Chairman’s Statement
2010 was another successful year  
for ENRC. We continued to execute  
our growth and diversification strategy, 
including significant acquisitions in  
Africa and Brazil. Our operations in 
Kazakhstan continued to perform  
strongly throughout the year.

Our people
Our operations in Kazakhstan continued to 
perform strongly throughout the year with 
record levels of production and capacity 
utilisation which, along with improved markets 
and management’s cost control measures, 
resulted in an increase in earnings per share 
of 110%.
The strength and focus of our management 
team has been critical for the implementation 
of our strategic plans. Kazakhstan has 
provided a stable platform on which to build 
the Group’s wider ambitions, supported by 
the country’s proximity to our main markets 
of Russia and China, its wealth of mineral 
resources and by the efforts of our 
employees. Our disciplined approach to 
acquisitions enabled us to make progress 
towards becoming a more diversified mining 
group. We believe that by extending our 
portfolio of commodities and products  
we are strengthening our business model.
The Group made significant progress  
in its diversification strategy during 2010,  
with material additions to the Group’s  
scope in both central Africa and Brazil. 
These transactions hold considerable value 
potential, and balance the opportunities  
they offer with the demands that are placed 
on internal resources and the complexity  
of realising integration synergies. We place 
considerable emphasis on thorough financial 
and legal due diligence and risk assessment 
in order to ensure the optimal return for 
shareholders over the life of the projects.
We continued to invest in training and 
development and this helps ensure that 
our workforce is better able to meet the 
challenge of integrating and developing 
our suite of assets. The commitment  
of our employees, in Kazakhstan and 
elsewhere, was instrumental in enabling 
us to take advantage of improving global 
economic conditions to deliver good results. 
On behalf of the Board, I offer thanks to  
all our employees.
The continued extension of health and 
safety initiatives throughout the Group 
remained a key focus. Although we have 
seen a reduction in the number of fatalities, 
seven people lost their lives at work during 
2010. Every fatality is investigated so that 
lessons are learned for the future. Our view 
remains that all fatalities can be avoided 
and are unacceptable.
Two new appointments were made  
to the Board in 2010. In January we 
announced the appointment of Professor  
Dr Dieter Ameling as an independent 
non-executive Director and in August,  
Mr Jim Cochrane, already the Group’s  
Head of Sales and Marketing, joined  
the Board and was promoted to  
Chief Commercial Officer.
In February 2011, Mr Felix Vulis, our 
Chief Executive Officer, decided to step 
down for personal reasons. The Board fully 
understands his decision and is grateful for 
his commitment to serve until a new Chief 
Executive Officer is appointed in order to 
ensure a smooth management transition.
We are pleased to recommend to 
shareholders a final dividend of US 18.0 
cents per ordinary share to be paid on 
15 June 2011 to all shareholders on the 
register on 1 April 2011 making the full year 
dividend US 30.5 cents. Our dividend policy 
remains unchanged. Payment of the final 
dividend is subject to shareholder approval 
at the Annual General Meeting which will be 
held on Wednesday, 8 June 2011. 
We believe that the global economic outlook 
is still improving and expect that 2011 will 
offer further opportunities for the Group to 
build on the success of 2010.
We continue to invest in the training and 
development of our workforce to ensure 
that we successfully meet the challenges  
of integrating recently acquired assets. 6__Unlocking Resources

A Business with Tremendous 
Assets and an Established  
Track Record
ENRC has interests in Kazakhstan, China,  
Russia, Brazil and Africa (the Democratic  
Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Mozambique  
and South Africa). The Group’s strategy is  
to build on its long-established Kazakhstani 
operations to become a diversified natural 
resources group with world class assets.
48 Years of chrome
 ore reserves ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__9
 
 
 
This track record and asset portfolio was of 
fundamental importance to the successful  
listing of ENRC’s shares on the London Stock 
Exchange in 2007 and the Kazakhstan Stock 
Exchange in 2008, and its entry into the  
FTSE 100 Index.
During the last two years management has  
taken advantage of opportunities arising from  
the economic downturn in order to boost and 
diversify the Group’s asset portfolio. Management 
has built on the strength of the Group’s low cost  
and integrated operations and its strong balance 
sheet to acquire a number of important assets in 
Africa and Brazil.
Today, ENRC is proud to be one of the world’s 
largest producers of ferrochrome, a significant 
exporter of iron ore, one of the world’s largest 
producers of traded alumina and one of the largest 
electricity providers in Kazakhstan. It is an important 
global resources group, currently selling the majority 
of its products worldwide.
Since its inception, the Group has established a track  
record for enhancing existing assets and for organic and 
acquisitive growth.
Over the years ENRC has put together a portfolio of world 
class assets focused on the core products of ferroalloys,  
iron ore, alumina and aluminium, coal and energy. 10__Unlocking Resources
Dynamic and Growing 
Business with the Capacity  
for Continued Growth
A key strength of the Group is its large scale, 
scaleable and long-life assets in its principal 
commodities. 
This has been an important factor in the 
dynamic growth of the Group’s Kazakhstani 
businesses and is reinforced by the integral 
energy and logistics capacity of the Group  
in the region. Together these help maintain 
the advantageous low cost position of the 
Group in its key commodities.
72% Growth in Group  
 revenue in 2010 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 11
The Group continues to build 
its asset resource capacity 
with the potential to be large 
scale and scaleable.
In Kazakhstan, the mine reserves life of the Group’s 
main commodities – chrome and iron ore, bauxite 
and coal – range between 32 and 48 years. With  
the addition of resources the mine life is potentially 
extended by between one and three times. This  
has enabled the Group to plan a capital expenditure 
programme that will grow the processing capacity  
of the domestic ferroalloys business by some  
30% and the domestic iron ore business extraction 
capacity by approximately 25%. The growth 
potential in the region is further underpinned by  
the Group’s strategic location, with its proximity  
to the longer-term, high-growth prospects of China 
and the potential of Russia, built on demographics, 
urbanisation, rising consumer demand and 
infrastructure needs. The Group’s commodities  
suite is well supported by the growth prospects  
of emerging markets and their commodity  
intensive requirements.
The Group has also looked to increase its growth 
options by acquisition, broadening its commodity 
base and reinforcing its market position in its 
established commodities. The Group has sought 
assets that are or have the prospect of being  
large scale and scaleable, as well as the potential  
to be towards the lower end of the cost curve.  
To this end the Group has been willing to consider 
acquisition at a relatively early stage in the 
development of projects.
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo,  
acquisitions in 2010 have scaled up and broadened 
the established production base of the businesses.  
The options for the further development of the 
business from the joint venture with Camrose,  
with its various licence holdings, offer potential 
material synergies from the complementary and 
contiguous nature of the ore bodies relating to 
energy, logistics, processing and mine planning.  
We see opportunity for real scale in the business, 
even before considering the potential offered by 
other projects acquired as part of Central African 
Mining and Exploration Company (‘CAMEC’) Plc  
in 2009.
In Brazil, where the Group has been building  
the potential for iron ore capacity since its entry  
in 2008, the opportunity exists to enter the seaborne 
market and to supply a new group of customers  
in China, the Atlantic and the Middle East. The 
development builds on the Group’s established 
technical knowledge base and marketing contacts.  
The capacity to grow the iron ore business,  
in combination with the growth in Kazakhstan,  
could make the Group one of the top iron ore 
producers in the world in the years ahead.
The Group’s commodities portfolio is well supported by the 
growth prospects of emerging markets and their commodity- 
intensive requirements. 12__Unlocking Resources
Specialist in  
Emerging Markets
The Group’s successful development of its 
Kazakhstani operations has provided it with 
considerable emerging markets experience.
This has been important in ENRC’s acquisitions 
activity, particularly in the Democratic Republic  
of the Congo, where we have sought to build  
on the skills and experience of operating in  
emerging market environments.

The Group believes that it is important to work  
in partnership with its host governments and to 
accommodate the wider development objectives  
of the countries in which it operates. 
The Group’s existing senior management team 
incorporates extensive experience of operating  
in Eurasia, in Africa and in the developing world  
more generally. In addition, in emerging markets,  
on-the-ground experienced management is often 
the important ingredient that ensures that the 
business model can be integrated and then can 
continue to operate successfully. The Group can 
provide additional financial, technical and marketing 
expertise, as well as international opportunities  
for its employees.
The entities of ENRC in Kazakhstan have long  
had the Kazakhstani Government as a partner  
and shareholder. Today, the Government continues 
to be an 11.6% shareholder in the Group, with two 
seats on the Board. In the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (‘DRC’) the Government, or other State 
entities, is typically a 25%-30% participant in our  
key licences. 
In emerging markets the role of central government  
in the provision of social welfare is at an early stage 
of development. In addition, the Group often 
operates in isolated areas where it is the major 
employer and where it can be difficult to attract  
and retain employees. As a consequence, taking  
on responsibilities for housing, healthcare, education 
and facilities, as well as supporting local, regional 
and central government social infrastructure 
initiatives becomes key to our success.
The expenditure on community social investment  
in Kazakhstan and Russia in 2010 amounted to 
US$58 million (2009: US$37million). This increase 
was largely a result of increased funding towards  
cultural development through Komek. The 
community investment spend in Africa was  
of the order of US$5 million in 2010. 
In the DRC the Group has undertaken a number of 
projects and in 2011 will continue the roll-out of its 
welfare programme.
The Group’s senior management team possesses an 
extensive experience of operating in Eurasia, Africa and  
the developing world. 14__Unlocking Resources
Commitment to Corporate 
Social Responsibility and  
Sustainable Development
A commitment to high standards of corporate 
responsibility, particularly health and safety,  
is one of the core principles of ENRC’s strategy.
The Group aims to grow its business while 
maintaining its commitment to respecting  
the environment, providing safe and healthy 
workplaces and making a positive contribution  
to the societies in which it operates. 
The Group believes that investment in this area 
brings long-term benefits, helping it to improve 
efficiency and reduce operational costs, better 
manage risk practices, and attract and retain  
the best employees.
18 New standards for  
 safety risk management  
 approved in 2010 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 15
In 2010 our values and an awareness of ENRC’s 
responsibilities were further embedded into  
every area of the business, starting with the 
safety of employees. The Group continued the 
implementation of the entity-wide ‘Project Ray’, 
launched in April 2009, which is aimed at improving 
the workplace safety culture, aspiring to a zero 
injury rate – a priority objective for the Group. The 
Group’s housing programme also continued, with 
the intention of providing Kazakhstani employees 
with housing and preferential mortgage rates and 
enhancing the quality of their lives.
ENRC works extensively with the communities 
involved with the Group, undertaking significant 
charitable projects via the ENRC Komek Corporate 
Foundation. The Foundation provides cultural, 
educational and other social support in Kazakhstan 
and beyond. Working with regional governments,  
the Foundation has invested in both their economic 
and social development, including the construction  
of infrastructure facilities, environmental initiatives 
and the creation and preservation of jobs for  
local communities.
Environmental awareness is also central to the  
Group and ENRC is committed to the efficient use  
of resources and to reducing any negative impacts  
of operations on water, air and land. The priority 
areas of environmental investment in 2010 included 
the improvement of energy efficiency and reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation 
and disposal, as well as a reduction in the use of 
hazardous chemicals. 
ENRC was the first company in Kazakhstan  
to introduce an environmental management  
system which met the international standard  
ISO 14001. All ENRC operations in Kazakhstan met 
this standard by the end of June 2010. In 2010 the 
construction of new gas cleaning facilities continued 
at Kazchrome, Eurasian Energy Corporation and 
SSGPO. These are the leading facilities of their  
kind in Kazakhstan, and have helped the Group  
in its objectives to reduce pollutant emissions.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
In 2010 the Group delivered a strong 
operating and financial performance, with 
production volumes at record levels. This 
performance was built on the robust core 
businesses of the Group in Kazakhstan,  
as well as the continued strength of the 
Chinese economy, the growth evident in 
emerging markets generally and greater 
stability in the developed economies. 
The Group continued to make  
significant strategic progress during  
the year. In Kazakhstan, we focused  
on plans to enhance our existing asset  
base and increase investment in capacity.  
In May, Phase 2 of the aluminium smelter 
commenced operations on time and  
on budget. The progress that we have  
made in recent and ongoing capex  
projects – for example, the Aktobe  
ferroalloys expansion, Phase 2 of the 
aluminium smelter and the increasing  
power generation capacity – gives us 
confidence in the Group’s prospects.
We remain positive on the Group’s  
prospects for 201 1, although the control  
of costs growth and the development of  
our assets in Africa will be important issues  
for management, as will be the continued 
near-term risk of commodity market volatility.
We made further progress with our strategy  
by establishing the foundations for growing 
businesses in Africa and Brazil, with major 
benefits to be realised in the years ahead.
 
In addition, we continued to grow through 
acquisitions, notably expanding our 
presence in copper, cobalt and iron ore. 
Acquisitions during the year have enhanced 
our assets in Africa – primarily in the DRC. 
We are undertaking an extensive exploration 
programme to scale up the level of resources 
and to prove the reserves base. Whilst we 
remain in the initial stages of the development 
of the DRC assets, the exploration 
programme has given us greater confidence 
in the scale of our ambitions. 2010 has  
also seen us complete the initial phase  
of integration of CAMEC into the Group. 
We made an investment in Northam  
Platinum to give us strategic optionality in  
a commodity which we believe has very 
good prospects. With this acquisition, along 
with our copper and cobalt assets, and with  
the potential coal and platinum projects,  
we expect Africa to be a more important 
geography in the future of the Group.
2010 also saw the Group enhance its 
presence in iron ore with acquisitions in 
Brazil. The Group’s Brazilian assets are  
all projects around the development of the 
Brazilian Government’s East-West rail link  
to open up the Bahia region to economic 
development. These projects will provide  
the Group with entry to the world’s one billion 
tonne seaborne iron ore trade and will enable 
us to offer products to new customers in the 
Asia-Pacific, Americas, Europe and Middle 
East regions. With the additional capacity 
offered by Brazil, along with the expansion  
in Kazakhstan, we have positioned the 
Group to emerge later in the decade as a 
leading global iron ore player and, as a result, 
this will shift the balance of our business.

In February of this year I made the decision 
to step down from the Group for personal 
reasons. I am pleased to have been

2010 production performance
In 2010 the Group achieved a record 
production performance, reflecting effective 
full available capacity of the Group’s principal 
Kazakhstani businesses throughout 2010. 
Management’s success was built on 
leveraging of low cost production, the 
Group’s location and the retained workforce, 
in addition to a rebuild of sales volumes, 
notably for ferroalloys, in traditional markets 
as well as into China.
Ferroalloys: ore extraction amounted   •
to a record 4.82 mt, whilst total gross 
ferrochrome production was 1.44 mt,  
of which 1.31 mt was high-carbon 
ferrochrome; total gross ferroalloys 
production rose to 1.86 mt. Throughout 
2010 the Division’s Kazakhstani 
operations were running at effectively  
full available capacity and exceeded  
the record volumes of 2007 . Production 
recovered at Serov and Tuoli to effective 
full available capacity at the end of 2010.
Iron Ore: ore extraction amounted to  •
some 43.61 mt, ahead of the prior high  
of 40.22 mt in 2007. Saleable product 
amounted to 8.94 mt of concentrate  
and 8.02 mt of pellet. 
Alumina and Aluminium: bauxite  •
extraction reached a record 5.31 mt, 
exceeding the previous high in 2008. 
Alumina volumes rose to 1.64 mt as  
part of the expansion in alumina capacity. 
Aluminium production was at its full 
available capacity run rate (250 ktpa)

2010 financial performance
The Group’s strong financial performance in 
2010 was underpinned by a rapid response 
to the market’s recovering appetite for 
commodities, its strategic location and its 
low cost position. These factors were partially 
offset by increased costs in relation to the 
build out of the Other Non-ferrous Division. 
For the Group, margins rose as like-for-like 
revenue growth of 62% outstripped the 
increase in like-for-like total costs of 27%. 
Total revenue rose 72% to US$6,605 million, 
due to both higher prices and significantly 
higher sales volumes, including new sales  
of aluminium and copper and cobalt. Total 
costs growth reflected both higher volumes 
and rising unit costs, which was a feature  
for the industry as well as the Group in 2010, 
and the inclusion of the Other Non-ferrous 
Division. Underlying EBITDA rose 118%  
to US$3,194 million, with the Underlying 
EBITDA margin increasing to 48%. Earnings 
per share was ahead 110% to US 170 cents, 
including a one-off gain of US$298 million 
arising in relation to the accounting for the 
Brazilian acquisition (Bahia Minerals BV 
(‘BMBV’)) in September 2010 and acquisition 
related costs of US$73 million. The Group’s 
effective tax rate for the year was 26.2%, 
which included the impact of these two items. 
The Group saw a substantial increase in 
operating cash flow during the year, rising to 
US$2,303 million (2009: US$1,209 million). At 
the year end the Group maintained a strong 
balance sheet position, with net debt of 
US$37 million, having secured additional 
funding from international banks, export 
credit agencies, the Chinese Development 
Bank and the Kazakhstan Sovereign Wealth 
Fund ‘Samruk-Kazyna’. 
h ealth & safety
Health and safety remains a key priority for 
the Group. In 2010 we undertook a number 
of major initiatives to raise engagement  
and compliance with health and safety 
standards. This was in response to the 
challenging environment of 2009 and  
our desire to improve performance across 
the Group. We continued with the 
implementation of our safety management 
system, with improved reporting and  
with a rollout of our new Safety Culture 
Improvement Project across our businesses 
in Kazakhstan and Russia. The project  
will enable us to build an integrated 
organisational structure, provide managerial 
leadership and establish effective safety 
procedures and performance standards.  
We introduced new communication tools 
and an improved incentive system for line 
managers, raising the priority of health and 
safety, and undertook behavioural audits 
across all of the Divisions. A special site visit 
was conducted to the African operations and 
we developed a safety management system 
integration plan. Corporate safety standards 
and reporting procedures are being applied 
to all operations in Africa. 
For the Group, the number of fatalities  
in 2010 was seven (2009: 12), with three  
out of eight of the principal operations  
in Kazakhstan and Russia avoiding any 
fatalities in both 2010 and 2009. All deaths 
are regrettable to us and we express our 
condolences to the families involved. The 
number of work-related injuries (excluding 
Africa) for 2010 was 45 (2009: 64). The  
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’) 
(excluding Africa) was 0.41 (2009: 0.63) per 
one million hours worked. Africa had zero 
fatalities, 52 injury cases and an LTIFR of 
2.88. In 2011 the Group will integrate the 
reporting of health and safety statistics of 
Africa into those of the Group as a whole. 
The Group remains focused on improving  
its delivery of health and safety based on  
the adoption, in 2008, of an aspiration to 
zero injuries.

acquisitions
In 2010 the Group accelerated its growth 
strategy in its targeted commodities. The 
underlying aim is to build a portfolio of tier one 
assets, which are large scale and scaleable, 
having extended mine lives, and with the 
potential to be towards the lower end of the 
cost curve. Our recent activity has focused 
on Africa, which has an outstanding mineral 
resource base, where we have established 
an operational platform for copper and 
cobalt, and on Brazil, where we are looking  
to build a presence in the seaborne iron ore 
market and aspire to emerge as a major 
player. The Group’s acquisitions strategy  
is unchanged and remains interested in  
its major core products, ferrochrome and 
iron ore, but will also consider looking at 
opportunities to enhance our recently 
acquired copper, cobalt and platinum assets, 
as well as the potential of thermal coal. 
In April–May 2010 the Group completed the 
US$300 million acquisition of Enya Holdings 
BV (‘Enya’) which holds a 90% interest in 
Chambishi, a Zambian copper and cobalt 
producer. In April the Group purchased  
a 12.2% interest in Northam Platinum, a 
major platinum producer in South Africa  
and subsequent purchases increased the 
holding to 14.35%; the total consideration 
paid was US$345 million. In June the Group 
completed the US$75 million purchase of the 
outstanding 50% of the issued share capital 
of SMKK. SMKK has exploration permit 
assets contiguous to the Group’s existing 
operations in the DRC. The acquisition of the 
outstanding 50% of SMKK allows the Group 
to reinforce its resource and production 
capacity in the DRC. In August the Group 
purchased 50.5% of Camrose Resources 
Limited and its subsidiaries (‘Camrose’)  
for US$175 million. The primary assets of  
the Camrose joint venture are high-quality 
copper and cobalt exploitation licences 
located in the DRC. 
In September the Group completed the 
purchase of the outstanding 50% of the  
BML Project, an iron ore resource in Brazil, 
for a net cash consideration of US$670 
million. In October the Group announced  
the purchase of MIBA and subscribed for 
51% of MPB for up to US$304 million. MIBA 
and MPB own iron ore licences in Brazil 
proximate to the East-West rail link and the 
BML Project.
In January 2011 the Group announced the 
extension of a call option originally granted  
in February 2009 in conjunction with the 
acquisition of a 25% interest in Shubarkol, 
one of Kazakhstan’s largest thermal coal 
producers. The call option gives ENRC  
the right to acquire the outstanding 75%  
of the ordinary shares of Shubarkol for  
a consideration of some US$600 million.  
The call option extension, which has  
been granted for nil consideration,  
extends the expiry date of the call option  
to 31 January 2012.
Capital expenditure
For 2010 capital expenditure amounted to 
US$1,187 million (2009: US$1,147 million), 
approximately US$300 million below our 
initial expectations, due to the timing of 
certain investments and management’s 
decision to revise the planned development 
and defer expenditure on a number of 
projects in Africa. Management prioritised  
a review of the assets of the Other 
Non-ferrous Division to provide a better  
basis for determining the optimal capital 
expenditure for the development of the 
businesses.
Project highlights in 2010 included:
Ferroalloys – construction of four furnaces  •
with 440 ktpa gross capacity at Aktobe  
is still in progress. Design engineering  
has been completed and preparatory 
works for the construction commenced  
in 2010 and are planned to be finished  
in 2011. Advance payments for primary 
equipment such as furnaces, transformers, 
rectifiers and automatics have been 
made; these will be built within 13 months 
and are expected to be delivered in 2012.
 Iron Ore – the completion in June of a  •
metal casting plant and ongoing feasibility 
studies for the expansion of iron ore 
extraction and the development of new 
high quality concentrate, high quality 
pellet and Hot Briquetted Iron capacity.
Progress in Africa
Copper and cobalt 
As 2010 progressed we completed the 
acquisitions of: processing capability – 
Chambishi Metals in Zambia; additional 
resource – SMKK in the DRC; and a mine 
management capability – Congo Cobalt 
Corporation in the DRC. We also 
established the Camrose joint venture  
in the DRC, giving us access to additional 
copper and cobalt resource. The collection 
of these businesses and resources 
establishes a compelling copper and 
cobalt business.
The acquisition of CAMEC in 2009 also 
marked the potential expansion into  
the export coal business, through our 
Mozambique project, and a potential 
platinum opportunity.
We achieved more than just acquisitions 
during 2010, especially in terms of 
exploration and the definition of indicated

Alumina and Aluminium – the completion  •
of the 125 ktpa Phase 2 of the aluminium 
smelter in early May, the ongoing 
expansion of alumina production to  
1.7 mtpa in 2011 and the initiation of 
construction of a 136 ktpa anode plant.
Energy – the commissioning of the new  •
overburden conveyor in June; and 
Other Non-ferrous – the commissioning   •
of Phase 1 of the cobalt SX/EW plant, 
which started production in Q4 2010.
At the start of 2011 management 
re-evaluated planned capital expenditure. 
The Group has added the purchase of 
wagons and trucks in the Logistics Division, 
reassessed investments in the Other 
Non-ferrous Division which were increased 
to US$810 million and made additional 
changes to the Energy Division spend.  
We have also included the projected spend 
on the BML Project and MIBA, both in Brazil. 
As a result, ‘Execution’ and ‘Planning and 
Design’ (both formerly ‘In Progress’) and 
‘Pre-feasibility’ (formerly ‘Under Review’) 
capital expenditure totals US$11.1 billion.
In 2011 capital expenditure is expected to 
amount to about US$2.5 billion (excluding 
BML), as we accelerate a number of the 
Group’s key growth initiatives, in particular 
spend on the Aktobe smelter and in the Iron 
Ore, Other Non-ferrous and Logistics 
Divisions. 2011 includes US$0.6 billion for 
sustaining capital expenditure.
Industry overview
The stainless steel industry saw a significant 
recovery in 2010, with production for the year 
estimated at about 31.3 mt, up 21% from 
25.9 mt in 2009. China remained both the 
largest and fastest growing producer of 
stainless steel with an estimated 11.4 mt  
in 2010, accounting for some 36% of total 
production. The speed of the recovery in 
global stainless steel volumes, coupled  
with low stockpiles at the beginning of  
2010, tightened the ferrochrome market 
considerably and, as a result, the European 
benchmark price rose US 35 cents per 
pound (to US$1.36) in Q2 2010. The 
subsequent increase in ferroalloys 
production and a global slowdown in 
stainless steel output, created an oversupply 
going into H2 2010, which resulted in the 
benchmark falling US 6 cents in Q3 and, into 
Q1 2011, a further US 5 cents (to US$1.25). 
This has broadly followed the pattern of  
the spot price of ferrochrome in China, 
increasingly an industry bellwether. For  
the industry, capacity utilisation in 2010 
amounted to 84.5%. Looking forward to 
2011 pricing will depend to a large extent  
on Chinese demand. However, it will also  
be constrained by the still material spare 
capacity of the ferrochrome industry and  
the ability of China to increase production  
to meet domestic demand. Longer-term, 
higher costs, particularly in South Africa, 
should support prices at higher levels while 
supply constraints, also in South Africa, 
could provide further upside.
Risk
Throughout 2010 the Executive management 
and the Board had a regular dialogue with 
shareholders. These discussions included 
corporate governance and the business 
acquisition processes, as well as the 
perceived level of risk ascribed to ENRC.  
The Group is cognisant of shareholders’ 
views. We are aware that some of the 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates 
pose particular and often heightened 
reputational issues that need to be managed 
appropriately. The Group continues to be 
open for dialogue with shareholders, and 
other stakeholders, to represent its position 
and resolve any issues. 
On 3 December 2010, Congo Mineral 
Developments Limited, a subsidiary of  
First Quantum Minerals Limited, served a 
claim for an estimated US$2 billion on four 
subsidiaries (together the ‘Highwind Group’) 
of Camrose Resources Limited, a joint 
venture company in which the Group holds 
50.5% of the share capital, in relation to the 
Kolwezi tailings project. The Highwind Group 
has applied to strike out the claim.
In 2010, the Group continued to enhance  
its approach to risk management and 
established a Group-wide Compliance 
function. The Group is continuing with  
the recruitment of additional high calibre 
individuals. The further development of 
policies, processes and procedures, in 
particular to support the acquisition and 
integration process, is under way. 
US$ 2.5 billion planned
 capital expenditure
 for 201 1
Capital expenditure will require a strong management 
focus and in 201 1 we expect to deliver progress  
on the Aktobe ferroalloys programme, our iron ore 
investments and in copper and cobalt in Africa. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__21
For iron ore, the improvement in the Russian 
steel industry in 2010 enabled us to sell 
higher volumes to our principal customer, 
Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (‘MMK’). 
However, this was limited by the iron ore 
surplus that continued in Russia. Sales to 
MMK amounted to approximately 10.6 mt. 
Sales to China, which doubled in 2009 
versus 2008, made up some of the shortfall 
in volumes to MMK, and remained broadly 
steady in 2010 at 5.6 mt. A Platts-based 
pricing formula has been agreed with MMK 
and will be valid until the end of 2012. There 
were some additional sales to Arcelor Mittal 
in Kazakhstan. The greatest opportunity for 
us to develop sales in the future is the 
ongoing industrialisation of markets in North 
West China, along with the access that will 
be offered by the Kazakhstani Government’s 
new China Gateway rail link due to be fully 
operational in 2012. The market for higher 
value added products is another opportunity 
for the Group, hence the project to build  
Hot Briquetted Iron capacity. Overall we 
expect China’s continued increase in steel 
production and its strong demand for iron 
ore to keep the market tight and support 
strong pricing in the medium term.
Outlook
The longer-term outlook for the Group’s  
main commodities and its main markets  
of China, other Asia-Pacific countries and 
Russia, remains very positive as these 
commodity-intensive economies continue  
to grow. GDP growth in China appears well 
supported at the level of 7%–9% per annum, 
while the prospect for robust growth remains 
for emerging markets more generally. 
Furthermore, supply constraints, underpinned 
by a range of different factors, continue to 
affect our main commodities and support 
prices in the short term. Positive signs are 
also emerging in the United States and some 
European economies. Nonetheless, there are 
some risks for the immediate future as China 
seeks to control and redirect its growth,  
with ongoing uncertainties in certain 
European economies and as governments 
around the world seek to rein back on the 
stimulus packages introduced in response  
to the recent financial crisis and lessen 
inflationary pressures. Together these 
increase the likelihood of near-term volatility 
in both the price and growth trajectories  
of our commodities. Nonethelesss, we 
remain confident that robust demand will 
continue for our products.
In 2011 the Group will continue to seek to 
maximise its production potential. However, 
notwithstanding some limited upside in 
ferroalloys, iron ore and alumina and 
aluminium, as well as the continued building 
of copper and cobalt production, the 
capacity growth of the Group will be limited 
until its large capital expenditure projects 
start coming on line in 2013.
2011 will require the Group to maintain  
an intense focus on costs. Cost inflation  
is affecting the whole industry, but we will 
continue to focus on efficiency improvement 
initiatives. Costs growth is across materials, 
transportation, fuel and other inputs, as well 
as logistics costs, and all are expected to 
show significant growth in 2011; Kazakhstani 
labour costs will rise in line with inflation. We 
also expect some limited appreciation of 
the Kazakhstani tenge (‘KZT’) against the 
US dollar during the course of 2011 and 
are working with an average exchange 
rate forecast in the range of KZT142 to 
KZT144. The further development of  
our African assets will also be a factor 
impacting costs in 2011.
The Group’s strategy remains focused  
on growing long-life, scaleable and low 
production-cost assets to deliver value  
for our shareholders. Following last  
year’s acquisitions to develop the Group’s 
commodities and geographic asset base, 
management will be focused in 2011  
on proving the new assets, firming-up 
development plans and implementing  
the capital expenditure programme. 
Capital expenditure will require a strong 
management focus and in 2011 we will 
expect to deliver progress on the Aktobe 
ferroalloys programme, our iron ore 
investments, and in copper and cobalt  
in Africa. We are ready to initiate progress 
in Brazil as soon as the port licence is 
approved. We will not forgo the potential  
of further acquisitions as an important 
route for further growth, particularly those 
filling-out our portfolio and in line with  
our strategy.
With our strong balance sheet,  
the scaleable asset base, the low cost 
potential of our asset suite and presence  
in strategic locations, we are well 
positioned to enhance shareholder  
value over the longer term.
The Group’s strong performance in 2010 was  
built on the solid foundations of the businesses  
in Kazakhstan which delivered record production in  
the year. China’s economic growth and our strategic 
location remained key, while we also saw recovery  
in our traditional markets. Maintaining and exploiting 
our advantaged cost position was also critical. 22__Unlocking Resources
The Group produced strong financial  
results in 2010 with all of the Divisions 
showing growth in Revenue and Underlying 
EBITDA. Increased Revenue was driven  
by both higher production and prices in  
all of our principal businesses.
 
 
Chief Financial Officer’s Review
2010 has been a year of strategic progress 
for the Group, continuing to integrate 
acquisitions, while maintaining our organic 
growth programme. The Group has 
numerous and significant growth projects 
ahead of it, which will require further 
substantial investment. The combination  
of strong operational cash generation,  
our robust balance sheet and our ability to 
attract a broad range of funding providers 
gives us confidence that we are able to 
source the funding necessary to meet  
our growth objectives. The Group’s cash 
balance at 31 December 2010 of US$1,595 
million (2009: US$830 million) and a recently 
signed unsecured senior US$500 million 
corporate revolving credit facility gives us 
further confidence in our liquidity position. 
The Group produced strong financial results 
in 2010 with all of the Divisions showing 
growth in Revenue and Underlying EBITDA. 
Increased Revenue was driven by both 
higher production and prices in all of our 
principal businesses. Despite increased 
costs the Group’s Underlying EBITDA 
improved 118.5% to US$3,194 million  
(2009: US$1,462 million), with an improved 
margin of 48.4% (2009: 38.2%). 
There have been two impacts on the results 
of the Group that arise from changes in  
IFRS requirements. Acquisition-related  
costs of US$73 million have been expensed 
and, as detailed below, a gain has been 
recognised related to the acquisition of 
control of Bahia Minerals BV (‘BMBV’) 
of US$298 million. These amounts are 
excluded from Underlying EBITDA. As a 
result of the strong financial performance 
and these items, the Group’s basic and 
diluted earnings per share increased to  
US 170 cents per share (2009: US 81 cents 
per share).
Dr Zaure Zaurbekova, Chief Financial Officer ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__23
Distribution costs
The increase in distribution costs was 
primarily due to a US$81 million rise in 
transportation costs, as a result of higher 
sales volumes and an increase in 
Kazakhstani railway tariffs of approximately 
14%. Agency and commission fees and 
other distribution costs increased US$14 
million and US$24 million respectively.  
The Other Non-ferrous Division added 
US$13 million to the total increase in 
distribution costs.
General and administrative expenses
The most significant change in general and 
administrative expenses was US$73 million 
in respect of acquisition-related costs  
which, under the revised IFRS 3 ‘Business 
combinations’, can no longer be capitalised. 
There was no requirement to restate the  
prior year in this respect.
In addition, staff costs increased US$45 
million, of which US$20 million related to  
the Other Non-ferrous Division. The Other 
Non-ferrous Division added further costs  
of US$29 million to the increased total  
of general and administrative expenses.
Other operating (expenses)/income
In 2009 the Group recorded a one-off foreign 
exchange gain of US$210 million, resulting 
from the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge 
against the US dollar. There were no similar 
exchange-related items arising in 2010.
Revenue
In 2010 the Group achieved a record level of 
high-carbon ferrochrome and iron ore sales 
volumes. In addition, iron ore prices reached 
record levels during the year. Revenue 
increased 72.4%, or US$2,774 million, to 
US$6,605 million (2009: US$3,831 million), 
which reflected the continued recovery of 
commodity prices and market demand.  
Of this increase in revenue, US$1,812 million,  
or 65.3%, was due to higher prices, US$591 
million (21.3%) due to higher sales volumes, 
and US$371 million (13.4%) due to the 
inclusion of the Other Non-ferrous Division. 
The Ferroalloys Division accounted for 45.2% 
of Group revenue, the Iron Ore Division 
28.4% and the Alumina and Aluminium 
Division 13.7%.
Gross margin
The gross margin improved significantly 
during the year to 56.9% (2009: 49.2%). This 
was due to significant increases in the selling 
price achieved for our products, partially 
offset by increased raw material costs  
and taxes, such as Mineral Extraction Tax 
(‘MET’). Total MET for the year was US$278 
million (2009: US$166 million). The Group 
mitigated some of these cost increases by 
improvements in labour productivity rates 
and improved efficiency in certain raw 
materials and electricity consumption rates. 
The Group’s focus will remain on cost  
control as the pressures on our production 
unit costs are likely to be sustained.
Gain related to the acquisition of BmBV
Included within the income statement for the 
year is a non-recurring gain resulting from 
the acquisition of BMBV of US$298 million. 
This gain arose as a result of the requirement 
under IFRS to fair value the Group’s existing 
interest in the business at the date of 
acquisition and to report any gain or loss  
in the income statement. 
n et finance (costs)/income
The finance income and costs for 2009 
included a one-off foreign exchange gain  
of US$104 million and a loss of US$75 million 
respectively, resulting from the devaluation of 
the Kazakhstani tenge against the US dollar. 
There were no similar exchange-related 
items arising in 2010.
share of profits of joint ventures  
and associates
The net share of profits of joint ventures  
and associates amounted to US$13 million 
(2009: US$31 million). This includes a  
US$11 million profit contribution from  
the Group’s 25% interest in Shubarkol,  
US$4 million from the BMBV joint venture  
(for the period before it became a subsidiary, 
with effect from 21 September 2010) and a 
US$2 million loss from Camrose.

Chief Financial Officer’s Review continued
t axation
In November 2010, the Republic of 
Kazakhstan extended indefinitely the 
applicable 20% rate of Corporate Income 
Tax (‘CIT’) and the current applicable rates  
of MET. 
The Group’s income tax expense for the year 
ended 31 December 2010 was US$780 
million (2009: US$377 million), an Effective 
Tax Rate (‘ETR’) of 26.2% (2009: 26.2%). 
The ETR included; the impact of the US$298 
million fair value gain on acquisition of BMBV 
reducing the rate by 2 percentage points; 
US$73 million of non tax-deductible 
acquisition costs which increased the rate  
by 0.5 percentage points; and the revaluation 
of deferred tax balances due to changes in 
the applicable CIT rate in Kazakhstan  
which resulted in a deferred tax charge  
of US$48 million, increasing the ETR by  
1.6 percentage points.
The Group’s ETR remains sensitive to  
market conditions and high commodity 
prices. The Group’s income tax expense  
of US$780 million included a US$148 million 
Excess Profits Tax charge, accounting for  
an increase in the ETR for the year of  
5 percentage points.
During the year the Group suffered US$26 
million of withholding taxes, mainly relating  
to the repatriation of dividends from 
Kazakhstan, which added 0.9 percentage 
points to the ETR.
exchange rates 
In 2010 the average Kazakhstani tenge to  
US dollar exchange rate was 147 .36 (2009: 
1 4 7 .50).
Balance sheet 
The Group’s net book value of property, 
plant and equipment at 31 December 2010 
was US$8,186 million (2009: US$5,480 
million), an increase of 49.4%. Goodwill at  
31 December 2010 totalled US$1,368 million 
(2009: US$579 million), an increase of 
136.3%.
The Group made a number of acquisitions 
during the year. The result of these 
acquisitions has been significant increases  
in property, plant and equipment including 
mineral rights from the acquisition of BMBV 
and of MIBA and MPB and the Chambishi 
smelter (which was acquired through the 
acquisition of Enya Holdings BV). 
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of 
Chambishi primarily because of the strong 
strategic location of the assets within the 
copper and cobalt belt of Zambia. 
Chambishi is well placed to take advantage 
of the potential growth in the copper and 
cobalt mining activity within the region.  
The acquisition complements the Group’s 
strategy of expansion in the copper and 
cobalt business. Goodwill arose from the 
other acquisitions primarily as a result of  
the recognition of deferred tax under IFRS.
In addition, the Group also completed  
the measurement period following the 
acquisition of the CAMEC group of 
businesses in 2009. The result of the 
finalisation of this work is the reallocation  
of certain assets and liabilities and a 
restatement, as required under IFRS,  
of the comparative balance sheet position. 
These results are further detailed in note 6  
to the financial statements. There was no 
material impact on the income statement  
for 2009 or 2010 on the completion of  
this exercise.
A detailed analysis of additions in the year 
arising from the Group’s capital expenditure 
projects is set out in the Capital Expenditure 
section of this report on pages 45 to 47 .
The Group also acquired a 14.35% interest  
in Northam Platinum Limited, which is held 
within other financial assets.
Deferred tax liabilities increased to US$1,176 
million (2009: US$455 million) as a result of 
the acquisitions detailed above and the 
requirement under IFRS to recognise a 
deferred tax liability in respect of fair value 
adjustments.
A summary of the Group’s borrowings is  
set out in note 27 to the financial statements 
with further commentary in the Funding and 
Liquidity section of this review.
The Group’s return on capital employed  
was 28.3% (2009: 13.8%). The calculation  
of return on capital employed is set out  
in note 37 to the financial statements.

Cash flow
The table below provides a summarised 
cash flow statement for the years ended  
31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
n et cash generated from operating 
activities
The Group generated cash of US$2,303 
million (2009: US$1,209 million) from 
operating activities, an increase of  
US$1,094 million. 
Increased commodity prices and a recovery 
in demand were the main drivers of the rise 
in gross profit and increased cash inflows in 
2010 versus 2009. Working capital increases 
totalled US$305 million.
n et cash used for investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities reflected 
the Group’s ongoing growth strategy. 
Purchase of property, plant and equipment 
totalled US$1,245 million. Payments made  
in respect of the acquisitions of subsidiaries 
and joint ventures totalled US$764 million. 
Further detail regarding these acquisitions 
can be found in note 6 and note 19 to the 
financial statements.
n et cash flow generated from/
(used for) financing activities
The Group generated cash resources of 
US$826 million from its financing activities 
during the year ended 31 December 2010. 
This was primarily; a US$400 million loan 
borrowed from the Development Bank  
of Kazakhstan under a 15 year facility 
agreement; a Structured Trade Finance  
facility for US$500 million based on the iron 
ore offtake contract with MMK; US$500 
million borrowed from JSC Sovereign  
Wealth Fund ‘Samruk-Kazyna’ under a  
10 year facility agreement, net of repayment 
of borrowings of US$360 million and cash 
outflows for dividends of US$238 million.
Funding and liquidity
During the year the Group continued to 
diversify its sources of funding and signed  
a US$3 billion Euro Medium Term Note 
programme which is a key element of our 
funding strategy to ensure that the Group 
has flexibility to meet the commitments of  
its capital expenditure programmes. This 
programme will be used to take advantage 
of opportunistic funding in the capital 
markets. As at 31 December, there were  
no issues under the programme.
The Group continued to raise debt in its 
traditional markets and expanded the range 
of lenders to include the JSC Sovereign 
Wealth Fund ‘Samruk-Kazyna’ and a 
number of commercial banks.
On 18 March 2011, the Group signed an 
unsecured senior US$500 million Revolving 
Credit Facility which will significantly enhance 
the Group’s financial headroom and provide 
liquidity to the Group’s business operations. 
Part of the Group’s strategy is to forge strong 
relationships with key banking partners  
to support the growth of the business.
The average maturity date on outstanding 
debt facilities is currently greater than  
five years. Net gearing at year end was  
0.4% (2009: (5.5)%). The calculation of 
gearing can be found in note 37 to the 
financial statements.

Key Performance Indicators
Financial Sustainability
This is a measure of the underlying profitability of the Group. In 2010 
Underlying EBITDA rose primarily as a result of increased production 
volumes and prices achieved. These increases were partially offset by  
higher costs of production.
EPS tells us how much profit is a attributable to each shareholder which may 
then be available for distribution. The sharp rise in EPS in 2010 was due to 
the recovery of the business from the economic crisis and the strong profits 
generated by the Group and also a one-off gain related to an acquisition.
ROCE measures how efficiently the Group’s capital is being used. The 
improvement in 2010 arises primarily as a result of the Group’s improved 
profits for the year. The reduction over previous years reflects the increased 
capital employed in the business due to acquisitions of early stage assets.
This is a measure of the investment made through sponsorships and 
donations, including via the Komek Foundation, to assist community 
development. It includes investments in healthcare, sports, education  
and cultural facilities. The increase in 2010 reflects a major investment  
in a significant cultural development in Astana.
Any fatalities that result from our operations are unacceptable. We aim for 
zero fatalities and investigate each case in detail to learn the lessons to help 
prevent recurrence. There were no fatalities in Africa.
This measure records the amount of employee working time lost,  
per 1,000,000 hours worked, as a result of accidents occurring in our 
operations. The further reduction in lost time reflects progress resulting from 
our continuing investment in reducing safety risks and developing a stronger 
safety culture.

The data for Africa for these measures have not been included in the KPI  
as alignment of reporting definitions is still underway. Further information, 
including the Africa data, is set out in our Sustainability Review on page 48.

Product costs
Costs per tonne increased during 2010 primarily due to 
increases in raw materials costs and taxes, such as Mineral 
Extraction Tax (‘MET’). Excluding MET, which is based  
on selling prices which have increased, our costs were  
at similar levels to 2008 (excluding royalties). The Group 
achieved this by improvements in labour productivity rates  
and improved efficiency in certain raw materials and electricity 
consumption rates.

The Ferroalloys Division produces and sells 
ferrochrome, as well as other ferroalloys, for 
use as alloying products in the production of 
steel, whilst manganese and chrome ore are 
sold to third-party producers of ferroalloys as 
well as to the chemical industry. ENRC is the 
largest ferrochrome producer in the world by 
chrome content and the lowest cost producer 
of high-carbon ferrochrome. The Ferroalloys 
Division is vertically integrated, having its  
own chrome ore and manganese ore mines 
feeding its ferroalloy production in Kazakhstan, 
Russia and China. In addition to its own ore, 
the Division also benefits from competitively 
priced electricity supplied by the Energy 
Division, as well as having a gas-fired power 
station at its Aktobe plant in Kazakhstan.
The Iron Ore Division consists of the 
Sokolov-Sarbai Mining Production 
Association (‘SSGPO’) in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, as well as Bahia Minerals BV 
(‘BMBV’), Mineração Minas Bahia SA (‘MIBA’) 
and a 51% interest in Mineração Peixe Bravo 
SA (‘MPB’) in Brazil. SSGPO produces and 
sells iron ore concentrate and pellet primarily 
to steel producers. On the basis of 2010 data 
SSGPO is believed to be a material exporter 
of iron ore and in the lowest quartile of the 
cost curve. The Iron Ore Division’s operations 
in Kazakhstan include iron ore mines, crushing, 
beneficiation and pelletising plants and a 
thermal power station. BMBV is focused  
on the development of an iron ore deposit  
in the Caetité region in the State of Bahia, 
while MIBA and MPB are early stage 
exploration projects, both located in the  
State of Minas Gerais.
The Alumina and Aluminium Division 
produces and sells the Group’s own 
aluminium and also sells alumina to other 
aluminium producers. ENRC believes, based 
on 2010 data, that the Alumina and Aluminium 
Division is the world’s ninth largest supplier  
of traded alumina by volume and is at the 
lower end of the global industry cost curve  
for alumina and aluminium. The Alumina  
and Aluminium Division’s vertically integrated 
operations include: bauxite mines; a limestone 
mine; an alumina refinery; an aluminium 
smelter; and a power station. The smelter 
allows the Alumina and Aluminium Division  
to process its own alumina into aluminium 
and Phase 2 of the smelter, with a total annual 
capacity of 250 kt, came online in May 2010.

The Other Non-ferrous Division operates 
principally in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (‘DRC’), where it mines copper  
and cobalt and processes the ore through 
Boss Mining Sprl, with the State-owned  
La Générale des Carrières et des Mines 
(Gécamines) as a minority (30%) partner. 
ENRC also owns 50.5% of Camrose 
Resources Limited, whose primary assets, 
held through its subsidiaries, include interests 
in five copper and cobalt exploitation licences 
situated in the DRC. The Chambishi smelter, 
acquired in April 2010 and located in Zambia, 
processes material mined in the DRC. The 
Other Non-ferrous Division’s copper and 
cobalt operations include open cast mines, 
crushing, beneficiation, concentrator plants  
and an electro-winning facility in the DRC,  
and the Chambishi copper and cobalt  
smelter in Zambia. In addition, the Other 
Non-ferrous Division includes a number  
of development prospects: Mozambique  
– coal; Zimbabwe – platinum; Mali – bauxite; 
and South Africa – fluorspar.
The Energy Division is one of the largest 
electricity providers in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, accounting for approximately 
16.6% of the country’s recorded electricity 
production in 2010 (2009: 17 .2%). Taking into 
account all of the energy generation facilities 
of ENRC, including SSGPO, the alumina 
refinery (Aluminium of Kazakhstan) and the 
Aktobe ferroalloys smelter (Kazchrome), the 
Group’s share of Kazakhstan’s energy supply 
was 22.6% in 2010 (2009: 23.5%). The Energy 
Division provides a cost-effective energy 
supply to the Group’s principal Kazakhstani 
operating Divisions, with internal consumption 
of 73.9% (2009: 60.8%) of energy produced, 
as well as providing a surplus for sales to  
third parties in Kazakhstan.
The Logistics Division provides transportation 
and logistics services to the Group’s principal 
operating divisions and to third parties.  
The Division’s operations include freight 
forwarding, wagon repair services and  
railway construction and repair services.  
The availability of these services within  
the Group mitigates many of the risks 
associated with the supply of raw materials 
and delivery of products to customers.  
In addition, the Division operates a railway 
transfer and reloading terminal on the 
Kazakhstan/China border, facilitating the 
Group’s access to the Chinese market.

Operating Review
Ferroalloys Division
The Ferroalloys Division 
primarily produces and 
sells ferrochrome, as well 
as other ferroalloys, for 
use as alloying products 
in the production of steel, 
whilst manganese and 
chrome ore are sold to 
third-party producers of 
ferroalloys as well as the 
chemical industry. 
Competitive position 
The Ferroalloys Division continued to maintain 
its competitive position over its peers during 
2010, underpinned by its low cost tier one 
assets. In addition, its strategic location 
adjacent to China contributed to vertically 
integrated operations and supporting 
infrastructure. The Group’s low cost power 
generation business remained a significant 
advantage over South African chrome 
producers, who again were faced with 
further increases in power costs in 2010  
of circa 25%. 
Kazchrome continued to benefit from the 
high quality of its ore deposit which allows  
it to produce ferrochrome with 69% chrome 
content and low trace residuals versus that 
of South African producers which produce 
charge chrome with approximately 50% 
chrome content with higher levels of silicon 
and iron. Charge chrome is limited mainly  
to stainless steel production as opposed to 
high-carbon ferrochrome which is used in 
the production of numerous speciality steels 
as well as foundry and welding applications. 
Kazchrome’s higher chrome content and 
lower residual product are highly valued by 
speciality steel producers in meeting critical 
specifications in their steel. The Division  
took advantage of speciality ferritic and 
duplex stainless steel production in 2010 
being at their highest levels, whilst further 
diversifying away from the traditional 
stainless steel grades which are the  
domain of charge chrome. 
ENRC was also able to take advantage of 
the recovery in the engineering, alloy steel 
and speciality sectors as global demand  
for these steels continued to improve on  
the back of better demand in the automotive 
and energy sectors. The Division responded 
to the increased demand for its products 
from the speciality steel sectors with almost  
100% capacity utilisation of its ferrochrome 
furnaces (high-carbon, medium-carbon  
and low-carbon ferrochrome), supporting 
record annual sales which were backed  
by a continued growth in long term  
supply contracts.
Production
In 2010 the Ferroalloys Division produced: 
3,574 kt of saleable chrome ore (2009:  
3,398 kt); 996 kt of saleable manganese  
ore concentrate (2009: 904 kt); and 1,855 kt 
of ferroalloys (2009: 1,446 kt), including  
1,306 kt (2009: 1,073 kt) of its primary 
product, high-carbon ferrochrome. In 2010 
272 kt (2009: 226 kt) of ferroalloys were 
consumed internally. For the year ended  
31 December 2010, the Ferroalloys Division 
had revenue of US$2,996 million (2009: 
US$1,874 million), which represented  
45.4% (2009: 48.9%) of the Group’s 
consolidated revenue.

Supply and demand 
2010 was a record year for stainless steel 
production with 31.5 million tonnes being 
produced up from 25.9 million tonnes in 2009. 
The first half of the year was particularly 
strong while the second half was impacted 
by the slowdown that resulted from 
overstocking in the first half. A shortage of 
scrap in the first half was a particular boost 
for the consumption of primary chrome units. 
Supply shortages in the first half of the year 
were replaced by an oversupply in the 
second half as higher prices in the first half  
of the year provoked a restart of offline 
capacity, particularly in South Africa. The 
result of this was a build up of stock towards 
the end of Q3 which acted as an overhang  
in the market through the year end.
Sales and pricing
After a late 2009 slowdown, due to 
de-stocking, 2010 saw a strong start as 
stock holders replenished inventory and 
global economic optimism improved.  
In Q1 2010, stainless steel production rose  
to its highest ever quarterly level of almost  
8 million tonnes. This was driven by increased 
production from emerging economies, 
notably China and India, whilst developed 
economies continued to struggle to get back 
to pre-crisis levels. With increased demand 
for engineering and alloy steels, in addition  
to stainless steel, and with scrap availability 
in Q1 2010 remaining limited due to  
adverse weather conditions, the supply of 
ferrochrome tightened. The price outlook 
during this period was also supported by  
the South African rand strengthening against 
the US dollar and the almost 25% increase  
in electricity costs imposed by Eskom,  
South Africa’s power provider, impacting  
the country’s industrial production cost base. 
This resulted in a 35 US cent increase in  
the benchmark price for Q2 2010 to US$1.36 
per pound of chrome, taking chrome prices 
back above levels last seen in Q1 2008.  
The market responded to these strong 
fundamentals with additional production, 
creating oversupply going into the 
traditionally quieter period of Q3 2010  
as steel producers reduced their own 
production after a record-breaking H1.  
As a result the benchmark declined to 
US$1.30 in Q3 2010. The re-emergence  
of global economic uncertainties, reflecting 
European sovereign debt concerns and 
Chinese monetary policy tightening, raised 
questions over the sustainability of the 
growth in these economies. This caused the 
price of ferrochrome to remain stable for the 
remainder of the year accompanying weaker 
global steel production.
Demand for medium- and low-carbon 
ferrochrome improved progressively during 
H1 2010 as the outlook in the engineering, 
alloy and speciality steel sectors improved, 
with prices increasing by between  
10 US cents and 15 US cents per pound 
against the start of the period. As with  
the stainless steel sector, the weaker 
fundamentals in H2 2010 impacted these 
other sectors as steel production declined

and the market was impacted by excess 
capacity. Chrome ore demand similarly 
increased, particularly in China, with  
prices rising strongly on the back of good 
demand from alloy converters and chemical 
producers. Demand for both these products 
remained strong but weakened marginally  
in line with the H2 2010 slowdown as weaker 
sentiment in China caused a decline in 
ferrochrome prices.
Prices for manganese alloys, which are 
primarily used in the production of carbon 
steel for the construction and automotive 
sectors, also improved, with silico-manganese 
attaining levels in excess of US$1,500 per 
tonne during Q2 2010. This improvement 
also led to a progressive upward trend for 
manganese ore, in terms of both demand 
and price, as converters bought increased 
volumes to cover alloy demand from  
the steel sector. Prices, as with the 
aforementioned products, declined in H2  
on the back of the weaker market sentiment.
Results for the year
The Ferroalloys Division remained the largest 
contributor to the Group’s Underlying 
EBITDA. The Division contributed US$1,403 
million, or 43.9%, of the Group’s Underlying 
EBITDA in 2010 (2009: US$707 million; 
48.3%); the increase was US$696 million,  
or 40.2% of the growth in the Group’s

Investing for growth and efficiency
In 2010 the Ferroalloys Division 
commenced work on the Aktobe 
smelter project, which will add  
four direct current (‘DC’) furnaces  
with 440 ktpa of high-carbon 
ferrochrome capacity by 2013 at a 
total cost of some US$750 million. 
The new capacity offered by Aktobe is 
believed by the Group to be the single 
largest ferrochrome capital expenditure 
project in the world. The expansion 
represents about one year’s expected 
increase in global demand for ferrochrome 
to come from stainless and alloy steel 
producers based on longer-term growth 
projections.
The strategy here is to build on the 
Group’s existing high quality chromite ore 
deposits, its integrated low cost energy 
capacity, as well as the opportunity for 
growth in key markets like China and  
the Far East. Ferrochrome is the Group’s 
most international business in terms of the 
breadth of its customer base, underpinned 
by the attractive margins available.
The decision to invest in DC furnace 
technology for the next stage of the 
ferroalloys expansion will enable the Group  
to achieve significant cost savings even 
against the existing low cost AC technology. 
The new capacity will, the Group believes, 
be the lowest cost capacity in the world. 
Notably, there is the ability to use chrome 
ore fines and the facility to substitute coke 
fines, or cheaper anthracite fines, in place 
of lumpy coke as the reductant.
During 2010 the Group undertook further 
engineering feasibility studies to reassess 
the technology and costs of the project 
ahead of proceeding. Investment has 
since begun at Aktobe.
In 2010 the Division’s performance benefited 
significantly from a strong recovery in both 
prices and volumes. All of the Division’s 
products increased sales volumes and 
prices year-on-year and ferroalloys sales 
were at their highest level in the Group’s 
history. Total ferroalloys and chrome ore 
sales volumes increased 17 .1% and 8.6% 
respectively. High-carbon ferrochrome 
volumes increased 14.8% versus 2009,  
while other ferrochrome products 
experienced more substantial growth rates 
against comparable 2009 levels, of up  
to 50%. The Ferroalloys Division revenue 
increased US$1,122 million, or 59.9%, of 
which US$751 million (66.9%) was due to 
higher commodity prices and US$362 million 
(32.3%) reflected higher sales volumes. 
High-carbon ferrochrome sales contributed 
US$710 million (US$550 million due to  
higher prices and US$160 million due to 
higher sales volumes), or 63.3%, of the 
increase in the Division’s revenue. The  
shift of sales towards Western European  
and Japanese markets, which were  
more favourable in terms of prices,  
and proportionally away from China,  
also positively impacted revenue.
A US$208 million increase in cost of sales 
resulted from increased sales volumes and 
US$106 million from an increase in cash 
costs per unit. Depreciation and amortisation 
increased cost of sales by US$20 million.  
In total, Mineral Extraction Tax (‘MET’) of 
US$172 million (2009: US$113 million) led  
to a US$59 million increase in cost of sales. 
Unit cost of sales for ferroalloys was 26.7% 
above that of 2009 due to higher MET, which 
followed from an increase in the chrome ore 
price due to prices of certain input materials 
and electricity.
A US$86 million increase in distribution  
costs was mainly attributable to higher  
sales volumes and increased railway tariffs, 
resulting in an increase in transportation 
costs. In addition, more products were 
shipped to the Group’s traditional and more 
distant markets of North America, Japan  
and Western Europe, instead of China.
General and administrative expenses 
increased US$13 million, largely due to 
higher staff costs. 
Net other operating expense amounted  
to US$8 million, principally due to foreign 
exchange losses. For 2009 Net other 
operating income reflected the one-off  
effect of the Kazakhstani tenge devaluation 
against the US dollar.

Ferroalloys Division ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__35
Competitive position
The Iron Ore Division has some significant 
strategic advantages over its major 
competitors. Firstly, the location of the 
Group’s large-scale iron ore reserves in 
northern Kazakhstan provides access  
to the customer base of steel production 
plants in Russia, China and Kazakhstan,  
with relatively low transportation costs. In 
particular, the Group’s facilities are located 
within 340 kilometres of its largest customer, 
MMK. This proximity provides significant 
logistical and cost advantages. Secondly,  
the Division operates large-scale iron ore 
mines and processing plants with relatively 
low production costs. This cost advantage  
is largely driven by the relatively low cost of 
electricity, due to the Group’s own power 
generation capacity.
Production
In 2010, the Iron Ore Division mined a record 
43,614 kt of iron ore (2009: 36,604 kt). This 
was processed into 17 ,702 kt of primary iron 
ore concentrate (2009: 15,197 kt), of which 
8,583 kt (2009: 8,857 kt) was sold with the 
balance used to produce pellet, of which 
8,031 kt (2009: 6,203 kt) was sold. For the 
year ended 31 December 2010, the Iron Ore 
Division had revenue of US$1,876 million 
(2009: US$1,093 million), which represented  
28.4% (2009: 28.5%) of the Group’s 
consolidated revenue.
Supply and demand
As a result of the remarkably swift recovery 
from the financial crisis, global crude steel 
production increased 15.9% in 2010 to 
almost 1.4 billion tonnes. The increase was  
driven by a recovery in traditional markets  
and by China’s continued growth. The 
strength of demand meant that seaborne 
trade broke the 1 billion tonnes mark for  
the first time, with China accounting for  
60% of this volume. However Chinese 
imports of iron ore actually decreased slightly 
in 2010 against 2009. Supply issues were 
driven by India’s reduction in exports which 
were 10% less in 2010 than 2009. Exports 
from Australia and Brazil did not increase 
sufficiently to make up the deficit.
Sales and pricing
There were two major developments in  
the iron ore market in 2010. There was  
a dramatic recovery in prices, whilst the 
traditional benchmark system of pricing  
was replaced by a more spot oriented 
methodology based on Platts published iron 
ore prices. During H2 2010, while the Platts 
system was under development, sales to 
MMK in Russia, the Group’s principal iron 
ore customer, were made on the basis of  
a quarterly negotiated price. 
An agreement has now been reached with 
MMK to use a formula based on the Platts 
published price to govern the long-term 
contract. This formula will be valid from  
Q2 2011 until the end of 2012.

consists of the 
Sokolov-Sarbai Mining

Sales to China, the Group’s other major 
customer base, were also made on a 
quarterly negotiated basis. In 2010 sales 
volumes to China were slightly lower  
than that for 2009, approximately 5.6 mt 
(2009: 6.3 mt). 
In the medium term, we expect high prices 
to be maintained as demand for iron ore 
continues to grow and new production 
struggles to keep pace with demand.
Results for the year
The Iron Ore Division had an Underlying 
EBITDA margin of 60.4% in 2010, an 
improvement from 44.4% in 2009. The 
Division contributed US$1,133 million, or 
35.5%, to the Group’s Underlying EBITDA 
(2009: US$485 million; 33.2%).
In 2010 the Iron Ore Division experienced 
record levels of sales volumes and prices.  
In 2010, volumes were 9.5% higher than 
2009 and 15.3% higher than 2008, with 
prices 58.6% and 9.9% higher respectively. 
In addition, higher priced iron ore pellet 
represented 48.3% of the sales mix, a 
marked improvement from the previous  
year (2009: 41.2%).
During the year revenue rose US$783  
million, or 71.6%. US$659 million of this  
was attributable to increased sales prices  
and US$124 million due to higher volumes. 
Higher priced pellet contributed US$518 
million of the Division’s revenue growth 
(US$371 million due to higher prices and 
US$147 million due to higher sales volumes). 
The rise in concentrate prices increased the 
Division’s revenue by US$289 million, offset 
by a US$16 million decrease due to lower  
sales volumes. 
A US$47 million increase in cost of sales 
resulted from increased sales volumes and 
US$48 million from the increase in cash 
costs per unit. Depreciation and amortisation 
increased cost of sales by US$10 million.  
In total, MET of US$93 million (2009: US$43 
million) led to a US$50 million increase in 
cost of sales. The unit cost of sales for iron 
ore was 20.0% higher than in 2009, due  
to higher MET, which resulted from higher 
prices and increased mined volumes as  
well as enhanced prices of input materials, 
gas and electricity and higher wage rates. 
A US$6 million increase in distribution costs 
resulted from higher sales volumes and 
railway tariffs. This increase was partially 
offset by almost twice as much product 
being shipped to Russia, which has lower 
tariffs in comparison with rail transportation 
to China.
General and administrative expenses rose 
US$21 million, including a US$11 million 
increase in staff costs. 
Net other operating expense was US$12 
million. For 2009 net other operating income 
reflected the one-off effect of the Kazakhstani 
tenge devaluation against the US dollar.
Emerging as a global player in iron ore
In 2010 the Group reviewed its capital 
expenditure plans for its iron ore business  
in Kazakhstan and its presence in Brazil.  
The Group envisages that by the second  
half of the decade it will emerge as one  
of the world’s leading iron ore producers  
and that the business will represent  
a significantly greater proportion of the 
results of the Group.

Alumina and Aluminium Division
Supply and demand
Global alumina production is estimated to 
have been approximately 82 million tonnes  
in 2010 (2009: 74 million tonnes). Global 
aluminium production in 2010 was an 
estimated 42 million tonnes (2009: 38 million 
tonnes) of which 17 million tonnes, or 40%, 
was from China. 2010 showed a remarkable 
rebound in demand for most traditional 
applications of aluminium compared to  
2009 particularly in the transportation and 
packaging sectors globally and the building 
& construction sectors in China. Globally, 
aluminium saw a 12% increase in demand  
in 2010 compared to 2009. Aluminium 
stocks at London Metal Exchange (‘LME’) 
warehouses stood at 4.3 million tonnes  
at the end of 2010, roughly unchanged  
from the beginning of the year; this 
represents around five weeks’ worth  
of global consumption.
Global consumption of aluminium was  
40.5 million tonnes in 2010 and production 
was 42.3 million tonnes, for a net production 
surplus of 1.8 million tonnes. However the 
continued contango meant that financing 
was still possible and excess production  
and the current level of industry stocks  
had limited impact on the supply and 
demand balance.
Competitive position
The Division’s focus on cost control, with  
the implementation of several cost-reduction 
programmes in 2009, enabled ENRC to 
retain its competitive cost position. The 
Group’s bauxite reserves guarantee an 
on-going low cost supply of raw materials for 
alumina production. Alumina and aluminium 
production benefit from the ability to buy  
low cost energy from internal Group sources 
and they have some electricity producing 
capacity themselves. As a result, ENRC’s 
alumina and aluminium are both at the  
lower end of the industry cost curves.
Production
In 2010, the Alumina and Aluminium Division 
mined 5,310 kt of bauxite (2009: 5,130 kt) 
and produced 1,640 kt of alumina (2009: 
1,608 kt) and 227 kt (2009: 127 kt) of 
aluminium. For the 12 months ended  
31 December 2010, the Alumina and 
Aluminium Division had revenue of US$926

Sales and pricing
London Metal Exchange aluminium prices 
were volatile during the year with a peak  
of US$2,461 per tonne recorded on  
31 December 2010 and a low of US$1,829 
per tonne in early June. Consumption of 
primary aluminium in 2010 was driven by  
a strong rebound in orders for semi-finished 
aluminium products in its key markets, mainly 
transportation, building and construction.  
In 2010 aluminium premiums, an indicator  
of the metal’s physical availability, rose 
significantly across the world. This was 
driven primarily by high levels of aluminium 
inventory being tied up in financing deals and 
thus unavailable for immediate consumption.
In 2010 the Group shipped 1,176 kt (2009: 
1,352 kt) of alumina to United Company 
RUSAL (‘RUSAL ’) under a long-term supply 
contract to supply a minimum of 1.2 mtpa. 
The contract expires at the end of 2016.  
The pricing under this contract is linked as  
a percentage of the LME price of primary 
aluminium. In 2010 RUSAL, the Division’s 
largest single customer, accounted for 42.3% 
(2009: 55.6%) of the Division’s sales revenue. 
The balance of the alumina production is 
consumed by the Group in its own aluminium 
smelter, Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter 
(‘KAS’). On 1 May 2010, KAS started up  
its Phase 2 production line, increasing total 
aluminium production capacity to 250 ktpa.
The Group shipped 222 kt (2009: 125 kt)  
of primary aluminium in 2010, of which 50 kt 
(2009: 31 kt) was delivered to customers 
located in Russia. Sales of the remainder of 
the aluminium were by way of a distribution 
agreement with Glencore International, 
which represented 39.8% (2009: 26.8%) of 
the Division’s revenue in 2010. The LME spot 
price serves as the basis for the pricing of  
all of our aluminium contracts. The Division’s 
average sales price for aluminium in 2010 
was US$2,178 per tonne (2009: US$1,605 
per tonne).
Results for the year
The Alumina and Aluminium Division 
delivered excellent results in 2010. The 
Division had third-party revenue of US$906 
million, 60.9% higher than 2009. The Division 
contributed US$267 million, or 8.4%, to the 
Group’s Underlying EBITDA (2009: US$78 
million; 5.3%).
Third-party revenue increased by US$343 
million, due to the significant increase in  
the LME aluminium price, as well as higher 
sales volumes. Higher prices increased 
revenue by US$227 million whilst additional 
aluminium sales volumes contributed 
US$156 million. The latter led to a decline  
in alumina third-party sales volumes, 
reducing revenue by US$40 million. 
Increased aluminium production resulted 
from the smelter operating at full capacity 
commencing in Q2 2010; aluminium sales 
volumes were 77 .6% higher than in 2009.
Higher sales increased the cost of sales  
by US$113 million. Higher unit cash costs 
increased cost of sales by US$26 million, 
whilst depreciation and amortisation rose 
US$25 million. Unit cost of sales for alumina 
was up 19.8%, to US$236 per tonne and  
for aluminium 24.3% to US$1,660 per tonne, 
mainly due to higher prices of certain input 
materials, such as anodes and mazut, as 
well as increased depreciation.
Distribution costs grew by US$16 million,  
or 44.4%, to US$52 million (2009: US$36 
million), mainly reflecting higher sales 
volumes and, consequently, increased 
transportation costs. 
General and administrative expenses 
increased by US$8 million, or 21.6%,  
to US$45 million (2009: US$37 million),  
due to higher wage rates.

The highlight for the Alumina and Aluminium 
Division in 2010 was the completion of Phase 
2 of the aluminium smelter in May with a full 
operating capacity of 250 ktpa, up from the 
Phase 1 capacity of 125 ktpa. Accompanying 
this, the Group is proceeding with an 
expansion in alumina capacity to 1.7 mtpa,  
to be achieved in 2011. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__39
Other Non-ferrous Division
Exploration
During 2010, an extensive drilling programme 
was undertaken, totalling 103,000 metres 
with assaying, to confirm and increase the 
confidence levels of the previously delineated 
inferred resources of Boss Mining (‘Boss’) 
and SMKK. The results of this programme 
are being compiled and will be completed  
in Q1 2011. Drilling on Camrose’s Comide 
Property at Mashitu and Safwe North 
deposits commenced in November 2010, 
with the intent of increasing the confidence 
levels in the two deposits in preparation for 
an accelerated mining and processing plan. 
Two drills are currently operating on this 
property. This concession is being explored 
to provide additional oxide copper material 
for the Luita processing facility.
Competitive position
The Other Non-ferrous Division has a 
number of strategic advantages as it 
integrates newly acquired businesses  
within the DRC and Zambia. 
The DRC contains a significant proportion  
of the world’s copper resources outside  
of Chile, which have some of the highest 
copper grades available. Extensive drilling 
programmes are under way to increase the 
confidence levels of previously delineated 
inferred resources. The additional capital 
expenditure on several projects will enable 
the capacity of copper production to grow 
very substantially ahead of the current 
production capacity of about 20 ktpa.  
The combination of increased scale and  
high copper grades will allow the Division 
over time to have a cost position in the 
lowest quartile of the cost curve. 
The DRC contains the world’s largest cobalt 
reserves, almost half of the world’s supply, 
with some of the highest grades available.
A significant advantage is that the cobalt 
production is independent of copper 
production and manufacture. The cobalt 
grades and ‘impurity loadings’ in the ore 
enable high quality cathode to be produced 
using a cost-effective heap leach to SX/EW 
process. Over time this will facilitate a 
bottom-quartile cost position and greater 
protection against price volatility.

Mining
A more formal mine planning system was 
implemented aimed at optimising the metal 
extraction and introducing good mining 
practices over the life of the mine. Mining  
of the Disele South pit was terminated  
during the year as it reached the end of its 
economic life. This was replaced with ore 
mined from SMKK’s Kabolela North deposit, 
which commenced in September. A total  
of 2.5 mt of ore was mined during the year 
from Mukondo, Disele and Kabolela North,  
with an average stripping ratio of 13.6:1 
(waste to ore).
Production
The review of operational efficiencies and 
increased focus on heap leach practices 
resulted in an increase in production to 
effective full capacity in the DRC. Record 
production of 20,267 t copper was achieved, 
compared to the 2,771 t from date of 
acquisition to 31 December 2009, with 
overall recovery at 58.8%. This represented  
a 105.1% increase in production volumes 
over the 2009 calendar year (being 9,879 t 
for the equivalent 12-month period, including 
the period prior to acquisition by ENRC). 
Production of cobalt contained grew 
throughout the first three quarters,  
peaking in Q4 2010. A total of 9,647 t  
cobalt contained was produced during  
the year. Boss produced 8,273 t of cobalt 
concentrate, compared to 6,697 t in the 
2009 calendar year (1,169 t of which were 
included in ENRC’s results).
The leaching, purification and electro-winning 
process at Chambishi was restarted and 
ramped up to achieve record monthly 
production of 437 t cobalt metal in Q4 2010. 
Total production at Chambishi amounted to 
3,265 t of cobalt metal.
Supply and demand
As the best non-precious metal conductor of 
electricity, copper demand is driven primarily 
by electrical applications. The transportation, 
communication and construction sectors also 
represent major customers. During 2010 global 
demand (19 million tonnes) was estimated  
to be at its highest level and further demand 
growth is predicted over, at least, the next 
three years. China was the main source  
of this demand, but ex-China consumption  
was also up over 10% during the year as  
the global economy continued to recover.
A key driver of the copper price is supply 
being unable to respond to increasing 
demand. Among other factors, such as the 
supply disruptions seen in 2010 (including 
the devastating earthquake in Chile), supply  
is limited by ageing mines, failing ore grades, 
water supply issues and a lack of new 
replacement projects. Global supply in 2010 
amounted to 18.8 million tonnes with the 
market balance moving into deficit as supply 
growth failed to keep pace with demand 
growth. The main source of mine production 
is South America, specifically Chile. The 
main source of copper smelter production  
is Asia, especially China and Japan. In 2010, 
China accounted for the largest share of 
copper semi-fabricated production capacity 
(30%) and the largest number of semis plants. 
During 2010 the first Exchange Traded Fund 
able to buy and hold physical copper gained 
regulatory approval and was launched. 
Although initial holdings are proportionally 
small, similar funds may launch in 2011.  
This represents a new type of ‘retail’ investor 
demand during a time of high physical 
demand and trailing supply response.
The demand for cobalt increased 
significantly during the year particularly  
as a result of the improvement in the alloy 
sector and the continued expansion of the 
battery industry.
Sales and pricing
The copper price was extremely volatile 
during 2010 as the market grappled with  
a number of economic concerns. During 
2010 LME cash-sellers price ranged from 
US$6,091 to US$9,740 per tonne, setting  
a new record high at the year end.
Contracts are negotiated annually or on a 
quarterly basis, fixing a premium or discount 
alongside the period in which a reference 
exchange price (such as the LME) is used. 
LME warehouses hold the largest available 
source of copper stock. During 2010 this 
stock trended downwards, reducing by over 
one third until the last two months of the year 
when it increased slightly as record prices 
increased physical deliveries.

In the past prices and volumes for cobalt 
concentrate were negotiated on an annual 
basis, however, more recently it became 
advantageous to negotiate terms over 
shorter periods or on a spot basis. 
Agreements are predominantly based on  
a formula linked to Metal Bulletin’s cobalt 
metal quotations and in most cases the  
seller is also paid for copper content.
The cobalt metal price stood at US$19.75 
per pound at the start of January 2010, with 
the price rising through January. It reached 
its highest level of the year, US$21.75 per 
pound, in late January. This was largely 
supported by speculative buying from China 
in advance of the introduction of cobalt metal 
on the LME pricing platform. After reaching 
its peak in January, the cobalt metal price 
declined through to the end of March to 
US$17 .25 per pound. The cobalt price 
experienced a subsequent period of  
volatility over the next five months, eventually 
settling at a price of US$16.25 per pound in 
mid-August. There was a rally in the cobalt 
market in Q3 2010 and the price rose to 
US$19.25 per pound in late September. 
There was a subsequent correction in the 
price as it fell back to US$16.25 per pound 
by the year end. The average Metal Bulletin 
2010 cobalt price was US$17 .93 per pound.
Mozambique coal
An exploration programme on the Group’s 
coal licences on the North Shore of Cahora 
Bassa commenced during the year. A new 
camp was established with the associated 
building of facilities required to service  
such a remote site. Progress was made in 
mapping and surveying the licences. Drilling 
commenced but was affected by delays in 
commissioning the contractors as well as 
inclement weather. As a direct result of this 
drilling activity, our in-house inferred resource 
estimate (non-JORC compliant) was 
increased by 1.35 billion tonnes.
A feasibility study has been commissioned 
on Licence 871. This licence has a JORC 
compliant resource of 1.03 billion tonnes. 
The feasibility study is targeted to be 
completed during 2011.
Results for the year
The Other Non-ferrous Division contributed 
US$60 million, or 1.9%, to the Group’s 
Underlying EBITDA. In 2010, the primary 
revenue and Underlying EBITDA generating 
businesses of the Division were the  
copper and cobalt operations in the  
DRC and Zambia. 
Higher cobalt and copper sales volumes 
contributed respectively US$245 million  
and US$114 million to the Division’s revenue. 
The results were impacted by the favourable 
pricing of both cobalt and copper. 
Cost of sales was adversely impacted by  
US$25 million of amortisation of acquired 
mineral rights. Unit costs of cobalt and 
copper have and are expected to continue  
to improve through the increase in 
production achieving economies of scale, 
cost synergies achieved by integrating the 
acquired businesses, as well as improving 
operational efficiencies. 
The Division’s exploration costs, which are 
part of general and administrative expenses, 
totalled US$16 million for 2010. The 
exploration programme focused on the 
Division’s coal, platinum and fluorite deposits 
as well as greenfield cobalt and copper 
areas of interest.
The Other Non-ferrous Division existed with 
effect from November 2009 following the 
completion of the acquisition of CAMEC  
and was included for only two months of 
2009. Results for 2009 have been restated 
to reflect the transfer of the SABOT business  
to the Logistics Division as detailed in note 4 
to the financial statements, which was 
effected in H2 2010.
Expanding the commodity footprint
In 2010 the Group’s expansion  
in copper and cobalt continued,  
with the development of the existing 
asset base, as well as adding scale 
and capability through further 
acquisitions.
During the year the Division undertook  
an extensive exploration programme to 
enhance the scale of resources, with the 
ultimate objective of proving up substantial 
economic reserves.
In 2010 the Division deployed up to  
13 drill rigs in the DRC and drilled 103,000 
metres. As of January 2011, with only 11%  
of the exploration data analysed, 1,292 kt 
of historic resource has been converted 
into 1,180 kt of JORC compliant resource. 
A full update to the resource base, 
including all of the exploration data from 
2010, is expected in Q2 2011. The average 
grade of contained copper is some 2.4%. 
In addition, the JORC compliant contained 
cobalt resource is 155 kt, with an average 
grade of contained cobalt of some 0.32%.
In 2010 the Division made the decision to 
prioritise exploration aimed at delineating 
the reserves for mining purposes, 
deferring some capital expenditure,  
in order to scale up the business and  
to develop more options for investment 
and expansion. More explorative drilling  
is under way in 2011.
In addition, in 2010, by way of acquisitions, 
the Division extended its portfolio. The 
Group added resource capacity, with  
the purchase of the outstanding 50% of 
Société Minière de Kabolela et de Kipese 
(‘SMKK’), in June 2010, where copper 
oxide mining commenced at Kabolela  
in Q3 to supply the existing processing 
facility at Luita. The purchase of Chambishi, 
a Zambian-based processing facility, 
enabled the Division to accelerate the 
growth in its processing of sulphide ores.
The acquisition of Camrose, announced  
in August 2010, gave access to additional 
mining licences, although all at a very early 
stage of development, that will enable the 
copper and cobalt business to be further 
scaled up. In addition the acquisition  
offers material synergies, arising from  
the complementary and contiguous  
nature of the ore bodies relating to energy, 
logistics, processing and mine planning.
In combination all of these assets firmly 
underpin the Group’s aim to have in  
place a substantial copper and cobalt 
producing business in the next five years, 
with cash costs in the lower quartile of  
the cost curve. 42__Unlocking Resources

Energy Division
Production
In 2010 the Energy Division produced 13,711 
GWh (2009: 13,478 GWh), of which 73.9% 
(2009: 60.8%) was used internally within the 
Group. The share of internal consumption 
increased, due to the start up of Phase 2  
of the aluminium smelter and significantly 
increased demand from the Ferroalloys  
and Iron Ore Divisions. Coal production was 
broadly flat at 20,102 kt (2009: 20,059 kt).  
In addition to sales of surplus electricity,  
the Energy Division also sold 6,964 kt of  
coal to third parties (2009: 7 ,280 kt), which 
represented 34.6% of total coal mined  
(2009: 36.3%), reflecting reduced demand 
due to lower economic activity. 
Sales and pricing: coal
Strong demand from the industrial and 
power sectors impacted coal output in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, which increased 
12% in 2010. The Energy Division’s total 
sales of coal to third parties nevertheless  
fell 4.3% in 2010, due to growth in the 
Group’s internal consumption. In the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, ENRC sold 3.0 
million tonnes of coal to third parties (2009: 
3.0 million tonnes) at an average sales price 
of KZT934 (US$6.34) per tonne (2009: 
KZT850 (US$5.76) per tonne), an increase  
of 9.9% in local currency terms. Russian 
utilities increased their coal imports from 
Kazakhstan, which was prompted by a rise 
in electricity generation in Russia in response 
to the improving economy and a rise in 
industrial demand. However, the Energy 
Division sold 3.9 million tonnes of coal to 
Russia (2009: 4.3 million tonnes), reflecting 
its own increased consumption. 
Sales and pricing: electricity
Improvements in economic conditions and 
industrial demand saw electricity demand 
recover in 2010. Total electricity consumption 
in Kazakhstan grew 7 .4% to 83.8 billion kWh; 
electricity generation increased 4.9% to  
82.3 billion kWh. Energy Division sales of 
electricity to third parties fell 40.5% in 2010 
due to increased internal consumption by  
the Group. The average sales price to third 
parties in local currency increased 58.5%  
to KZT4.67 (US 3.17 cents) per kWh  
(2009: KZT2.95 (US 2.00 cents) per kWh). 
The Government of Kazakhstan has imposed 
caps on annual price increases for domestic 
sales until 2015.

Results for the year
The results of the Energy Division were 
significantly impacted by higher sales prices, 
especially for electricity, which were in line 
with the State regulated annual price cap 
increases in the Republic of Kazakhstan.  
The Division contributed US$308 million,  
or 9.6%, to the Group’s Underlying EBITDA 
(2009: US$213 million; 14.6%).
The Energy Division’s third-party revenue 
increased US$4 million, or 2.0%, to US$200 
million (2009: US$196 million). Higher prices 
increased total revenue by US$46 million, 
whilst lower electricity sales volumes 
reduced revenue by US$42 million. The 
Division’s sales to other Group entities 
increased US$136 million, or 66.0%,  
to US$342 million (2009: US$206 million), 
resulting from the ramp up in production  
in other Divisions, including the launch  
of Phase 2 of the aluminium smelter.
Cost of sales increased US$39 million,  
or 25.7%, to US$191 million (2009: US$152 
million) mainly due to a rise in materials costs 
and an increase resulting from higher taxes, 
as well as higher ecological payments, health 
and safety expenses and training costs.
Distribution costs increased US$6 million,  
or 11.5%, to US$58 million (2009: US$52 
million), due to increased transportation costs.
General and administrative expenses 
increased US$12 million, or 60.0%, to US$32 
million (2009: US$20 million), principally due 
to additional sponsorship during the year.

Logistics Division
Operations
In 2010 the Logistics Division transported 
61,104 kt (2009: 58,181 kt) of products by 
railway, an increase of 5.0% on volumes  
in 2009. The share of third-party freight 
forwarding was 10.6%, broadly in line  
with 10.2% for 2009. In 2010 the tonnage of 
the Group’s products transported by railway 
grew 4.6% compared to 2009, reflecting 
improved activity.
External railroad repair service volumes 
increased to 359 kilometres (2009: 198 
kilometres), due to recovery in demand from 
the national railway company of Kazakhstan.
Sales
For the year ended 31 December 2010,  
the Logistics Division transported 61,104 kt 
of goods (2009: 58,181 kt), of which 89.4% 
(2009: 89.8%) was intra-Group. Increased 
transportation volumes for the year  
reflected a recovery in production in the  
key commodities: iron ore, chrome ore,  
and ferroalloys. 
Results for the year
The results for 2009 have been restated to 
reflect the transfer of the SABOT business  
to Logistics as detailed in note 4 to the 
financial statements.
The results of the Logistics Division  
reflected higher sales volumes. The Division 
contributed US$75 million, or 2.3%, to  
the Group’s Underlying EBITDA (2009: 
US$40 million, 2.7%). The inclusion of  
the African-based transportation business, 
SABOT, which supports copper and cobalt 
sales, added US$6 million to the Division’s 
Underlying EBITDA.
The Division’s third-party revenue increased 
US$151 million, or 225.4%, to US$218 million 
(2009: US$67 million). This was primarily  
due to US$66 million of revenue from 
participation as a contractor in the 
Kazakhstani Government’s China Gateway 
project; US$40 million of additional revenue 
from increased repairs of railway track and 
US$71 million of revenue from the inclusion  
of SABOT. 
Sales to other Group Divisions increased 
US$30 million, or 28.8%, to US$134 million 
(2009: US$104 million). 
Cost of sales increased US$140 million, or 
116.7%, to US$260 million (2009: US$120 
million) driven by the same factors which  
led to the increase in third-party revenue.
The Logistics Division 
provides transportation 
and logistics services  
to the Group’s principal 
operating Divisions and  
to third parties.

Capital Expenditure
In 2010, the Group’s 
capital expenditure 
amounted to US$1, 187 
million (2009: US$1, 147 
million), excluding 
changes in capitalised 
asset retirement  
cost estimates and  
borrowing costs.
Overview
For the full year 2010, total capital 
expenditure was lower than the planned 
US$1.5 billion. This reduction reflected a 
revision of the expansion strategy in the 
Other Non-ferrous Division and project 
updates in the Ferroalloys, Iron Ore and 
Alumina and Aluminium Divisions. 
Capital expenditure is designated as either 
‘expansionary’ or ‘sustaining’. 
‘Expansionary’ capital expenditure  
refers to investments made to drive  
future growth through increasing production 
capacities, and may include the construction 
or purchase of property, plant and 
equipment or the upgrade or expansion  
of existing facilities. 
‘Sustaining’ capital expenditure refers  
to investments designed to keep existing 
operations running at their current levels  
and may include major cyclical capital repairs 
or the replacement of existing property,  
plant and equipment. 
The Group anticipates that securing the 
necessary financing is a requirement for 
delivering its capital expenditure programme.
The Group reclassified its projects under  
four categories, with its ‘In Progress’ projects 
split between ‘Execution’ and ‘Planning  
and Design’.
1.  Execution: Board full approval, ordering of 
equipment and construction in progress;
2.  Planning and design: Board initial approval 
for feasibility studies;
3.  Pre-feasibility: projects at the stage of 
pre-feasibility study that have not been 
Board approved; or
4.  Deferred: identified projects that have 
been put on hold.
The Group’s capital expenditure programme 
totals US$11.1 billion, comprised of 
expansionary projects which are in 
‘Execution’, ‘Planning and Design’ and 
‘Pre-feasibility’ stages and allocated by 
Divisions, shown below, and on page 47 .
The major contributors to the increase in  
the Group’s capital expenditure programme, 
as compared to 2010, are greenfield projects 
in Africa and Brazil.
For the full year 201 1, total capital expenditure 
is expected to be approximately US$2.5 
billion, including expansionary capital 
expenditure of around US$1.9 billion and 
sustaining capital expenditure of around 
US$0.6 billion.

Capital Expenditure continued
Ferroalloys Division
The investment programme of the 
Ferroalloys Division includes the construction 
of four new direct current (‘DC’) furnaces at 
the Aktobe plant with 440 ktpa of capacity. 
The feasibility study for the project has been 
completed and the plant is currently under 
construction. The Environmental Impact 
Assessment Programme was developed 
and received favourable review from the 
Ministry of Environment Protection of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. Supply agreements 
for capital equipment and machinery,  
as well as engineering, procurement and 
construction contracts have been signed. 
The total project cost is approximately 
US$750 million, with completion planned  
for 2013. 
Iron Ore Division
After favourable feasibility studies and the 
overall improved conditions in the steel 
industry, the Iron Ore Division is working  
on the following projects: 
Expansion of the ore base including   •
the enlargement and reconstruction of 
deposits at Kachar and Rudny sites as 
well as the development of a new deposit 
at Sorsk. The commissioning date has 
been postponed to 2015 to reflect recent 
updates of the mining expansion strategy. 
The estimated expenditure for the mine 
expansion is US$720 million. 
The construction of a high quality  •
concentrate plant with total capacity of  
7 mtpa by 2014 at an estimated total cost 
US$440 million. High quality concentrate 
will be used as raw material for production 
of high quality pellet and for direct sales  
to customers. In 2010, preparation works 
took place and project documentation 
has been submitted to the Government 
authority. We are awaiting permission  
for the first stage of construction works. 
The construction of a 3 mtpa high quality  •
pelletiser plant and a Hot Briquetted Iron 
(‘HBI’) plant with a capacity of 1.8 mtpa  
by 2014. The total project cost is 
estimated to be US$920 million.
These projects will allow the Division to 
expand its product base, offering three  
new products: high quality concentrate;  
high quality pellet; and HBI, increasing total 
saleable output to approximately 23 mtpa  
by 2015.
In addition, at the end of 2010 the Iron Ore 
Division was expanded by inclusion of Bahia 
Mineração’s Ltda (‘BML ’) which operates the 
Pedra de Ferro Project (‘the BML Project’), at 
a current estimated total capital expenditure 
programme of about US$2.1 billion. 
In 2010 the project was at the planning 
stage, awaiting the environmental licences 
required to commence construction. BML 
has already obtained the installation licence 
for the mine from Instituto do Meio Ambiente, 
giving the Group permission to start the 
construction of the iron ore mine and 
beneficiation plant at Caetité, with potential 
annual capacity of 19.5 mt of iron ore.  
BML is awaiting the issue of the preliminary 
licence regarding the port terminal by 
Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos 
Recursos Naturais Renováveis, which if 
granted, will approve the location and design 
of the project. Operations are expected to  
start in 2013. 
Alumina and Aluminium Division
The main projects for the Division are:
The construction of a 136 ktpa anode  •
plant, which is in execution and due for 
completion in 2012, at a total estimated 
cost of US$240 million. The plant’s planned 
capacity was reduced from 150 ktpa and 
the completion date was delayed from 
2011 due to updates in the engineering 
data. This plant will allow the Group to  
be independent of third-party suppliers 
and will provide sufficient anodes for the 
increased Phase 2 aluminium production 
capacity.
Expansion of alumina production to   •
1.7 mtpa to support the expanded 
aluminium production capacity of  
the Group. This investment will allow  
the Division to maintain existing sales  
to customers and provide sufficient  
alumina for internal consumption.
Other Non-ferrous Division
The US$810 million capital expenditure 
programme of the Division has been revised 
and updated from previous estimates and 
consists principally of a number of expansion 
projects that are planned over the next  
five years to significantly increase capacity. 
The following projects were approved:
Expansion of copper (oxide) production.  •
Phases 1 and 2 of the expansion project 
to increase leaching and electro-winning 
capacity of the Luita plant to 50 ktpa of 
copper has commenced. The total current 
project cost is estimated at US$280 
million. The project cost increased some 
US$130 million against the previously 
estimated cost reflecting a tank leach 
upgrade and inclusion of an acid plant 
construction at Luita. A further phase  
to increase capacity up to 70 ktpa is 
currently at the planning and design stage.
 Oxide cobalt SX/EW plant. Construction   •
of the cobalt solvent extraction and 
electro-winning (SX/EW) plant was 
completed and Phase 1 has been 
commissioned. Phase 2 is scheduled  
to be commissioned during Q2 2011.  
The cobalt SX/EW plant has a planned 
capacity of 3 ktpa of cobalt metal and  
4.4 ktpa of copper grade A cathode 
equivalent derived as a by-product.  
The total estimated cost of the project 
decreased US$7 million to US$30 million 
mainly due to a change of the initial 
expansion strategy.
Expansion of copper (sulphide)  •
production. A 90 ktpa contained copper 
sulphide/oxide concentrate plant (60 ktpa 
sulphide and 30 ktpa oxide) was 
estimated at a cost of US$370 million, 
which is higher than the previous estimate 
due to construction of a new concentrator 
at Kakanda, which will start in Q2 2011. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__47
Chambishi copper SX/EW plant. •
Construction of a new SX/EW plant  
at Chambishi commenced at a total 
projected cost of US$80 million, a slight 
decrease from the previously announced 
US$85 million. It is scheduled to be 
completed in 2012 increasing capacity  
to 55 ktpa and raising the metal grade  
to grade A equivalent; and
Estimated exploration cost of US$50  •
million, related to the exploration 
programme at Boss Mining. The decrease 
from the previous reported US$115 million 
was due to the reclassification of total 
exploration cost between expense  
and capital. Expenditure in respect of 
greenfield sites is expensed until the 
completion of a feasibility study, after 
which time expenditure is capitalised. 
Brownfield exploration costs are 
capitalised. Further detail regarding  
the Group’s accounting policy can  
be found at note 1 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Energy Division
The main projects for the Division are:
•	 	 Con s tructi on 	 o f 	 a 	 ne w 	 po w er 	 un it 	 2 	 a t	
Aksu, with an investment of approximately 
US$250 million. An increase in the project 
cost of US$20 million reflects updates  
in detailed engineering data. The main 
construction works took place during the 
year with planned completion in H1 201 1.
Reconstruction of power unit 6 at Aksu,  •
upgrading its capacity to 325 MW,  
at an estimated cost of US$265 million  
is planned to be completed at the 
beginning of 2013. An increase in the 
project cost of some US$35 million, 
reflects updates in the engineering data.  
It is designed to achieve savings on  
fuel consumption, whilst environmental 
emissions will be reduced by the 
implementation of up-to-date filters. 
Construction of two 600 MW power units  •
and a 5 mtpa coal mine expansion are at 
pre-feasibility stage.
Logistics Division
450 open-top wagons were ordered  
in 2010, of which 150 wagons were received 
and the rest are expected to be delivered  
in H1 2011. Additionally 285 containers and 
three platforms were ordered and received  
in 2010. 
In 2011, to fulfil the requirements of the 
railway fleet, the Division is planning to 
purchase an additional 2,600 open-top 
wagons, 1,000 railway containers and  
600 platform wagons.

Sustainability Review
During 2010, we 
continued to make 
progress in delivering  
our goal to operate  
and develop as a 
responsible and 
sustainable business.
During 2010 we developed the governance of our 
environmental and social obligations and reviewed 
our goals.
We maintained our investment in safety 
improvement, our social programmes  
and environmental emissions reduction 
plans. We have taken steps to complete 
specific assessments to see how we need  
to develop further, in particular in relation  
to energy efficiency and occupational health 
management.
External events in 2010 as well as our internal 
development have caused us to look at  
how we govern our environmental and  
social obligations and consider our goals. In 
particular our focus has been influenced by:
integration of international assets into   •
the Group, bringing new demands on  
us to extend our response in different 
jurisdictions and cultures;
major industrial accidents in the mining  •
and metals industries, highlighting the 
constant risks that the industry faces;
the strengthening and maturing of   •
our internal governance processes;
accelerated progress of the Kazakhstani  •
Government to introduce legislation in  
new areas of environmental and social 
performance; and
completion of our pilot work on safety   •
in Kazchrome and our emissions 
improvement programme, giving us  
scope to reflect on the next phase  
of our improvement work. 
Our overall approach has remained 
consistent with prior years and is focused 
around a number of core themes that we 
use to achieve progress towards our goal  
to be a sustainable business:
 setting Group standards that provide   •
the foundation for how we work across 
the Group. 18 new safety standards have 
been approved by the Health, Safety, 
Environment and Sustainability (‘HSES’) 
Committee for global adoption;
changing behaviours to support  •
implementation. The results of our  
safety behaviours programme have been 
assessed by a third party and reported  
to the Executive Committee;
investing in our existing assets to help   •
us to achieve best available technologies  
with respect to environmental 
performance. We have completed  
our five year investment programme;
taking steps ahead of the introduction   •
of legislation in Kazakhstan to assist timely 
compliance, for example energy and 
carbon footprinting; and
 developing relationships to work in  •
partnership with governments and  
wider stakeholders. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__49
on both occasions. The HSES Working 
Group was convened in October 2010 to 
review progress, share learning and discuss 
Group priorities. Africa is not yet represented 
on the Working Group, but an integration 
visit was completed in November 2010.
The HSES Committee approved some 
revisions to the HSES governance structure 
in 2010 recognising the international nature 
of the Group and the ambition for HSES 
management and reporting. As part of this:
A Group HSES team has been created   •
to provide guidance and oversight over 
the full Group operations including Africa 
and Brazil in addition to the Kazakhstani 
and Russian operations. The Group HSES 
Head reports to the CEO.
A divisional HSES lead role has been  •
defined and will be put in place in 2011. 
This will be supported through the existing 
entity level HSES role, including Africa  
and Brazil. 
We will continue to integrate sustainable 
development considerations into wider 
corporate governance processes including 
our risk and compliance processes.
Internal reporting processes continue to be 
developed. Throughout 2010 the Board has 
received reports on safety performance. As 
part of this, all individual fatality cases have 
been reported and explained, including the 
steps to be taken to prevent recurrence.
We believe working with stakeholders  
is part of our governance process.  
It provides us with insights into external 
expectations and concerns and enables  
us to draw on the knowledge and skills of 
others and work in partnership. We work 
closely with governments, in particular at  
a regional level in Kazakhstan, and are  
in the process of establishing a number  
of partnership programmes in Brazil with 
different stakeholder groups.
As a Group we have continued our 
participation in major international 
programmes on sustainable development 
including the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development and its regional 
partner, the Kazakhstan Business 
Association for Sustainable Development. 
Our experience of working with governments 
and sharing industry practice was reflected, 
in 2010, in our support for the first Astana 
Mining and Metals Congress (June), and  
the UN ESCAP Environment Ministers 
Conference and Business Forum ‘Green and 
Competitive’. We continue to have close 
alliances with the Government in Kazakhstan 
giving us early insight and influence in the 
development of legislation. This is particularly 
relevant in the context of current discussions 
on the subjects of climate change and 
biodiversity. 
This review includes references to our 
international operations in Russia and  
Africa and our exploration activity in  
Brazil. It addresses priority areas of  
activity in 2010 namely:
HSES governance; •
safety management; •
social policy, including employee benefits  •
and community social contributions; and 
environmental stewardship. •
During 2011 we intend to review our priorities 
and areas of focus taking into account  
what we have learnt so far, what we need to 
achieve and how best to realise our goals. 
As part of this we plan to extend our risk  
and compliance processes to provide a  
more structured assessment and reporting  
on areas of risk relating to health, safety, 
environment and social performance.
We continue to work on developing our  
key performance indicators and reporting 
processes to improve the consistency and 
quality of our data.
HSES governance
Work has continued to develop and 
implement governance over our HSES 
performance. The HSES Committee has met

Safety management
Safety continues to be a priority for the 
Group. Our aim is to achieve zero injuries. 
We have made progress in 2010 and our 
accident rate is lower than in 2009. However, 
we are still at an early stage in embedding 
the right safety behaviours across the Group 
and continue to make the necessary 
investment in our assets to mitigate safety 
hazards.
Safety performance
Our accident rate in Kazakhstan has 
reduced since 2009. However, we still have a 
high number of severe injuries in Kazakhstan, 
2010: 23 (2009: 27), with one leading to a 
permanent disability. The number of fatalities 
in Kazakhstan was lower than in 2009, but 
seven fatal accidents (2009: 12) in the year  
is unacceptable. We have investigated each 
of the severe and fatal cases, working  
to learn lessons and implement changes  
to operations across the Group.
Our primary areas of incident include 
working at height, equipment isolation, 
transportation and moving equipment.  
We are sharing lessons learned across  
our network of safety representatives and 
on-site safety committees and determining 
Group-wide steps that can be taken to 
mitigate these risks, including consideration 
of these risks as part of our equipment 
procurement processes.
Our safety performance in Africa is the 
subject of management review. Alignment  
of the reporting definitions and processes 
across the Group, including Russia and 
Africa, is a key goal for 2011.
The Corporate Safety Programme initiated in 
2008 in partnership with DuPont completed 
its first phase in 2010. This first phase 
comprised a pilot safety project at 
Kazchrome; this has helped the Group to 
progress towards a stronger focus on safety 
behaviours. The necessary management 
mechanisms, including instructions and 
guidelines, and internal operational reporting 
continue to be developed. We continue  
to work to establish a corporate safety 
management programme across all of the 
Group’s operational sites. 
By the end of 2010, the operational sites  
in Kazakhstan and Russia were certified  
to OHSAS 18001, the international 
occupational, health and safety management 
standard. We will seek to achieve this 
standard at our operations across Africa.
As a Group  
we continued  
to participate in  
major international 
programmes  
on sustainable  
development.

Employees 
Our operations depend upon our ability  
to attract, retain and motivate employees 
who bring the necessary management and 
operational skills and are capable of working 
in challenging environments. We employ 
more than 74,000 people, of whom 70,000 
are in Kazakhstan and Russia.
Union membership and collective 
agreements
We recognise the right of all our employees 
to enter into a collective agreement and join 
a union. The majority of our employees in  
the Republic of Kazakhstan and Russia are 
members of trade unions. Unions are not  
in place in Africa but labour laws prevail. 
New industrial agreements have been signed 
or are in the process of being signed with  
the trade unions in Kazakhstan. These are 
agreed for a three-year period. In addition  
to the social rights and benefits guaranteed 
by the Kazakhstani Labour Code, these 
industrial agreements require the provision  
of medical benefits, loans at favourable 
mortgage rates, training of employees  
and their children and preferential packages 
to recreational centres and children’s 
summer camps.
Social benefits packages for 
employees
In Kazakhstan and Russia we invest beyond 
our legislative obligations on employment 
benefits as we believe this is essential to 
retaining our workforce and assisting their 
wellbeing. These additional social benefits, 
referred to in Kazakhstan and Russia as 
‘social packages’, include for example: 
memberships to sports facilities, discount 
tourist packages, voluntary medical insurance, 
and bonuses for landmark birthdays. These 
benefits also include investment in health, 
sport and other recreational facilities. We 
also continued our voluntary low interest rate 
(1%) housing programme for our employees 
in Kazakhstan. Currently the housing 
programme is being implemented in  
14 cities in four major industrial regions of 
Kazakhstan. About 2,000 employees have 
received new housing since 2006. 
Employee training and development
In 2010 we continued investment in the 
training and development of our employees, 
and the formation of a succession pool  
for management in our businesses.
An estimated 55% of the workforce in 
Kazakhstan and Russia was involved  
in training programmes during the year 
(2009: 40%). Our efforts were recognised 
when the ENRC programme on employee 
development was named as the best human 
resource project in Kazakhstan for the  
last five years, at an international human 
resources conference organised by the 
Samruk-Kazyna Fund.
In 2010 a new employee performance 
measurement system was developed  
for top and mid-tier management.
Milestones achieved in 2010 include: 
HSES Committee approval of 18 safety  •
standards for safety risk management;
 the establishment of eight site safety  •
committees led by site heads and  
five safety subcommittees led by line 
managers; 
  the training of about 3,500 line managers  •
in incident investigation and about 5,000  
line managers in safety behaviour audits; 
continued development of near miss  •
incident reporting; and
  further implementation of our accident  •
investigation procedure. 
Social policy 
The Group has a strong reputation in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan for being a socially 
oriented and responsible business. We work 
closely with the Government of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan to implement governmental 
agreements, programmes and initiatives 
related to implementing the Law of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan ‘On Social 
Partnership’. We are committed to achieving 
the same strength of reputation and 
relationships in Africa, Russia and Brazil. 
The Group’s social policy focuses on  
two key areas, employees and community 
social investment.
Waste management in ferroalloys production
Goals
•	 	 Pr ocessing	industrial	waste	into	 
useable products
•	 Resour ce	saving
•	 	 Reducing	adverse	envir onmental	
impacts of waste disposal
Scope
Kazchrome, Kazakhstan;  
Serov Ferroalloys Plant, Russia
Approach
Kazchrome’s Aksu and Aktobe Ferroalloys 
Plants, and Serov Ferroalloys Plant 
are processing newly generated and 
accumulated slags, producing metal 
concentrate which is used as an input  
for the core ferroalloys production 
process. In addition, the plants are 
producing crushed stone, which can  
be used in construction. 
Results
A small but increasing proportion of the 
current ferroalloys output is produced 
from industrial waste, which formerly  
was sent to slag dumps. Kazchrome 
saved 45 hectares of natural landscape, 
which would have been required for  
the construction of a new slag dump. 52__Unlocking Resources
Sustainability Review continued
Human rights
We have established internal policies 
addressing human rights as well as  
a corporate code of conduct. We are 
committed to upholding the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
do not tolerate any form of discrimination  
or unfair treatment. No cases of child labour, 
harassment, forced labour, discrimination  
or other actions that contradict the principles 
of equality and human rights have been 
identified during 2010. No human rights 
concerns have been raised by the unions  
in Kazakhstan during 2010.
Health protection
Investment in healthcare and medical 
facilities has been a major part of our 
employment packages over a number of 
years. In Kazakhstan 23 healthcare centres, 
located in the territory of ENRC operational 
divisions, provide medical services to 
employees. In the DRC, ENRC is the only 
provider of funds for the costs of hospital 
and medical services to employees and 
communities in the Kakanda area, where 
Boss Mining operates.
In 2010 we established a new Occupational 
Health Department which will focus on  
health protection issues across the Group.  
An initial assessment has been completed  
of healthcare provisions across Kazakhstan; 
this has identified variations in the manner in 
which healthcare provision is organised and 
the level of use of the facilities. Further 
assessments will be made during 2011.
HIV/AIDS in Africa and Central Asia is a  
major public health issue and a significant 
risk to our workforce located in these areas. 
Across all geographies in which we operate 
we are supporting detection and treatment 
programmes working in conjunction with 
local governments.
Community social investment
As we frequently operate in remote areas 
and are often the only commercial enterprise 
in the region, we are committed to investing 
in sustainable local and regional development. 
The majority of our communities are also  
our employees and contractors and the 
investment helps secure their wellbeing. We 
are also a major employer within Kazakhstan 
and seek to contribute more generally to the 
country’s social and economic development. 
Komek Foundation
The Komek Foundation, established in 2008, 
is governed through a Board of Trustees.  
Its long-term focus is on the implementation 
of programmes aimed at supporting ENRC’s 
own workforce, including sponsorship and 
charitable donations as well as provision  
of finance for investment in development of 
cultural and health facilities. The investment 
to date has been directed within Kazakhstan.
Our investment in the community through  
the Komek Foundation is included within  
our consolidated community social 
investment spend.
Community social investment spend
Each year the Group signs agreements  
with regional Governors in the Republic  
of Kazakhstan for the provision of financial 
support for regional development. 
Investments are typically directed towards 
infrastructure development, health and 
education programmes and cultural and 
sports facilities. In Africa, the social 
investment programme in 2010 continued 
and included road maintenance for a local 
village, purchase of fertilisers for farmers, 
contributions to hospital costs and support 
for schools. 
The expenditure on community social 
investment in Kazakhstan and Russia  
in 2010 amounted to US$58 million (2009: 
US$37 million). This increase was largely  
a result of increased funding towards  
cultural development through Komek.  
The community investment spend in Africa  
was of the order of US$5 million in 2010.
Environmental stewardship
Investment to reduce emissions has been  
a priority for a number of years. By 2011 
most of the planned improvements to  
reduce emissions at our current operations 
in Kazakhstan will have been completed.  
In 2010 the Group made further investments 
on upgrades and modernisation of old 
technologies to enable progress towards 
best practice standards. Across Kazakhstan 
and Russia emissions in 2010 were within 
applicable statutory limits.
Energy consumption is a major impact  
on the Group’s operations. In 2010 ENRC’s 
Kazakhstani and Russian operations 
consumed 250,000 terajoules (2009: 
275,000 TJ) of energy, of which 75% was 
sourced from coal. An energy efficiency 
study was completed by management and  
a greenhouse gas inventory and footprint 
were prepared for all operations in 
Kazakhstan. In 2010 total greenhouse  
gas emissions in Kazakhstan and Russia  
were 31 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent 
(2009: 29 milllion tonnes). The increase  
was due primarily to an increased level  
of production. During 2011 we will review  
the findings of this work and determine 
measures that can support energy efficiency 
and carbon reduction, while recognising the 
nature of our business and the geographies 
in which we operate. 
Other environmental impacts which we are 
working to reduce and manage to an 
improved performance standard include:
 Water efficiency. Work is under way   •
to consider alternative methods for dust 
suppression and investment to develop 
new sources of supply;
Biodiversity. Tree planting schemes will  •
continue in 2011 in Kazakhstan as well  
as a partnership with the United Nations 
Development Programme and 
Kazakhstan National Parks;
Waste and hazardous materials   •
reduction. Research continues into  
waste processing and chemicals  
handling options. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__53
Risk Management
Risk and the Board of Directors
The Board is ultimately responsible for maintaining a sound risk management and internal control system. Our system of risk management 
and internal control is designed to identify, manage and mitigate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The system provides 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
There are ongoing processes in place for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting on the significant risks faced by the 
Group. These processes are in place for the year under review up to, and including, the date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
In the Annual Report and Accounts for the preceding year, we reported on 13 principal risks. These risks were reviewed during the course  
of the current year by the Executive Committee, who determined that our risk environment had changed as a result of, inter alia;
an upturn in commodity pricing and the markets in which our key customers operate; •
the Group’s rapid response to the world market recovery in demand for commodities; •
the diversification of our portfolio of commodities and products and the expansion by means of acquisitions in both Africa and Brazil; •
the continued enhancement of our reporting and compliance framework; •
the implementation of key risk management action plans; and •
recruitment of a Group Head of Risk. •
Accordingly, the principal risks to the execution of the Group’s business strategy are shown in the rest of this section. We have explained  
the nature of each risk, identifying the possible impact and the associated strategic priorities. In addition, we have described the mitigating 
activity to address those risks, as well as our plans for further enhancements.

and have fluctuated significantly in response to changes in  
supply and demand, market uncertainty, the performance  
of global and regional economies and cyclicality in industries  
that purchase these products.
Risk
A substantial decline or volatility in commodity prices, could 
materially affect the Group’s business and financial results  
as well as the cash flow projections. 
Possible impact
Lower profitability, lower long-term growth.

industry overview and outlook on pages 20–21.
Risk Mitigation
Health, safety, environment and sustainability
Context
By their very nature, mining operations can be hazardous. 
However, ENRC management is committed to achieving zero 
incidents.
There is also the potential for a longer-term future sustainability 
risk, that environmental legislation may be introduced that will 
impose additional overheads on the business.
Risk
Health and safety incidents impacting on staff welfare, lost working 
time and breaches in health, safety and environmental regulation.
Environmental legislation drives additional taxes on the Group’s 
activities, as well as the costs required to ensure compliance  
with new standards.
Possible impact
Corporate reputation, impact on prospects for long-term growth, 
financial profitability, loss of life, environmental damage.
Associated strategic priorities

Share capital
As at 31 December 2010 the Company’s 
authorised share capital was US$400,000,000 
divided into 2,000,000,000 ordinary shares 
of US$0.20 each. The issued share capital  
of the Company at 31 December 2010  
was 1,287 ,750,000 ordinary shares of 
US$0.20 each. The ordinary shares are  
listed on the London Stock Exchange and 
the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange.
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s shares, in addition to those 
conferred on their holders by law, are set out 
in the Articles of Association, a copy of which 
can be obtained from the General Counsel 
and Company Secretary at the Company’s 
Registered Office. The holders of ordinary 
shares are entitled to receive all shareholder 
documents, to attend and speak at general 
meetings of the Company, to appoint 
proxies, to exercise all voting rights and to 
participate in distributions of income  
or capital.
At the 2010 AGM shareholders gave the 
Directors authority to allot shares up to an 
aggregate nominal value of US$25,755,000, 
representing 10% of the issued share capital 
of the Company as at 12 April 2010. This 
authority will expire on the earlier of the 2011 
AGM or 8 September 2011. No shares were 
allotted during the year.
Also at the 2010 AGM shareholders 
authorised the Company to make market 
purchases of up to 128,775,000 ordinary 
shares, representing 10% of the issued share  
capital of the Company as at 12 April 2010. 
This authority will expire on the earlier of the  
2011 AGM or 8 September 2011. No market 
purchases of shares were made during  
the year. 
At the forthcoming AGM the Board will again 
seek shareholders’ approval to renew the 
annual authorities for the Company to allot 
shares and to make purchases of its own 
shares through the market.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders 
restricting the voting rights or the right  
to transfer shares in the Company.
Amendments to the Articles of 
Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may 
only be amended by a special resolution  
at a general meeting of the shareholders.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Articles of 
Association of the Company the Board is 
permitted to consider and, if it sees fit, to 
authorise situations where a Director has  
an interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company. 
The Board has a formal system in place for 
Directors to declare any conflicts or potential 
conflicts and for these to then be considered 
for authorisation. The Nomination Committee 
takes responsibility for ensuring that a 
schedule of conflicts is maintained and  
that the Board reviews this schedule on an 
annual basis and updates authorisations 
where necessary.
Major interests in shares
The table opposite shows those 
shareholders who have been notified to  
the Company as holding major interests  
in shares amounting to more than 3% of  
the issued share capital of the Company,  
as at the date of this report.
Relationship agreements
On 7 December 2007 the Founder 
Shareholders, Mr Chodiev, Mr Ibragimov  
and Mr Machkevitch, entered into separate 
relationship agreements with the Company 
to regulate the ongoing relationship between 
each Founder Shareholder and the Company. 
The principal purpose of the relationship 
agreements is to ensure that transactions 
and relationships between the Group and 
the Founder Shareholders are at arm’s length 
and on a normal commercial basis. Under 
the terms of the relationship agreements, 
each Founder Shareholder has a right to 
appoint a director to the Board as detailed  
in the Corporate Governance report on  
page 66. As at the date of this report,  
only Mr Ibragimov has exercised this right.
Employees
Information about employees is disclosed in 
the Sustainability review on pages 48 to 52.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of 
trading with suppliers in advance and to 
make payment in accordance with these 
terms. The Group does not follow any 
specific published code or standard on 
payment practice. Suppliers in Kazakhstan 
and Africa often require prepayment and the 
average number of creditor days outstanding 
for the Group as at 31 December 2010 was 
40 (2009: 42). The average creditor days 
outstanding as at 31 December 2010 for the 
Company was nil (2009: nil).
Post-balance sheet events
On 31 January 2011, the Group announced 
that it had obtained an extension to a call 
option over 75% of the issued share capital 
of Shubarkol Komir JSC (‘Shubarkol’). The 
call option was originally granted in February 
2009 when the Group acquired an interest in 
25% of Shubarkol and had an expiry date of  
31 January 2011. The extension, which was 
for nil consideration, was granted for a period 
of 12 months up to 31 January 2012. All 
other significant terms of the call option 
remain the same.
In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, all Directors are subject to 
election at the first Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) after their appointment and to 
re-election at intervals of no more than three 
years. This is compliant with the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance. At the  
2011 AGM Mr Jim Cochrane, having been 
appointed since the previous AGM,  
will offer himself for election. Mr Marat 
Beketayev, Mr Mehmet Dalman,  
Sir Richard Sykes and Mr Eduard Utepov  
will retire by rotation. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code was introduced in  
May 2010 and requires that all directors of 
FTSE 350 companies stand for re-election 
annually. The Company is committed to 
maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance and accordingly Prof Dr 
Ameling, Mr Ammann, Sir Paul Judge,  
Mr Olisa, Dr Sittard, Mr Thomson, Mr 
Yedilbayev, Mr Vulis and Dr Zaurbekova  
will stand for re-election at the 2011 AGM.
Directors are appointed and may be 
removed in accordance with the Articles  
of Association of the Company and the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Board believes that each Director 
seeking re-election is an effective member  
of the Board and demonstrates commitment 
to his respective role. Further details and 
biographical information of the Directors  
can be found in the Notice of Meeting 
accompanying this document. 
The Board has put in place a procedure 
whereby all Directors have access,  
through the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, to independent professional 
advice at the expense of the Company. The 
Company also maintains an appropriate level 
of Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. 
A qualifying third party indemnity provision 
has been in place since 2008 for the benefit 
of current Directors and Officers of the 
Company and those of its subsidiaries  
to enable the Company to fund the costs 
incurred by Directors in defending certain 
claims against them in relation to their duties 
as Directors and Officers. The indemnity 
operates only to the extent that the  
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
does not afford protection.

be issued in a variety of forms and for a 
range of maturity periods. Proceeds from 
any issues under the programme may be  
used for the Group’s capital expenditure 
programme, potential future acquisitions and 
for general corporate purposes. There were 
no issues outstanding under the programme 
as at 31 December 2010.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control, 
the holder of any note under the EMTN 
programme will have the right to require the 
issuer to purchase such note at a purchase 
price in cash equal to 101% of the nominal 
amount together with (if appropriate) interest 
accrued to the date of purchase.
For these purposes, ‘change of control’ 
means the occurrence of any of the 
following:
a)  the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, 
conveyance or other disposition (other 
than by way of merger, amalgamation  
or statutory plan of arrangement or 
consolidation) of all or substantially all of 
the assets of ENRC PLC to any person  
or group (other than to ENRC PLC, one of 
its subsidiaries or one or more Permitted 
Holders); or
b)  the consummation of any transaction 
which results in any person other than  
a Permitted Holder or a group (other  
than a group that includes one or  
more Permitted Holders) becoming the 
beneficial owner directly or indirectly, of 
more than 50% of the combined voting 
power of the issuer’s voting stock.
A ‘Permitted Holder’ is any of 
a)  Mr Chodiev, Mr Machkevitch and Mr 
Ibragimov and any related person or trust; 
or
b)  the State Property and Privatisation 
Committee of the Ministry of Finance  
of the Republic of Kazakhstan (and any 
successor entity thereto).
Structured Trade Finance Facility
On 5 October 2010 the Group entered  
into a US$500 million Structured Trade 
Finance facility (the ‘Facility’) with a group  
of international lenders. The Facility has an 
applicable interest rate of one month LIBOR 
plus 3.37% and is repayable over three 
years. As at 31 December 2010 US$500 
million of the Facility was drawn down.
If at any time a change of control occurs  
and if the majority lenders so require,  
any lender may decline to fund a drawdown 
and may cancel its commitment under the 
Facility and require that its portion of any 
outstanding loan, together with accrued 
interest, be due and payable in full by  
giving not less than 10 days’ notice.
For these purposes, ‘change of control’  
means any person or group of persons 
acting in concert who gains direct or indirect 
control of the Company and ‘control’ means 
the power (whether by way of ownership of 
shares, proxy, contract, agency or otherwise) 
to cast more than one half of the maximum 
number of votes that might be cast at  
a general meeting of the Company as 
applicable or appoint or remove all, or the 
majority of, the Directors or give directions 
with respect to the operating and financial 
policies of the Company.
Auditors and disclosure of information

The Group’s external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have 
indicated their willingness to continue  
in office and a resolution seeking to 
re-appoint them will be proposed at the

of control of the Company.
Article 13 of the Kazakhstan 
Subsurface Law
The Republic of Kazakhstan may be entitled

equity interests being offered for sale on no 
less favourable terms than those offered by 
other purchasers.

Corporate Governance Report
The Board considers that, during the 2010 
financial year, it complied with the Code  
in all respects with the exception of the 
decision not to use an external agency when 
appointing Professor Dr Dieter Ameling. The 
circumstances surrounding his appointment 
are detailed below.
The Board’s role is to lead the Company  
by ensuring good management from  
the top downwards and there is a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for the Board 
which includes:
setting the long-term objectives and  •
commercial strategy of the Company;
agreeing policies and processes to guide  •
the affairs of the Company; 
responsibility for the overall management  •
of the Group; 
agreeing any changes to the Company’s  •
structure and capital; 
responsibility for financial reporting and  •
controls; and
approving major capital projects. •
This schedule is published on the Company’s 
website.
During the year, the Board discussed a 
variety of issues including mergers and 
acquisitions opportunities and the integration 
of the newly acquired African assets into  
the rest of the business. A two-day off-site 
meeting was held, which allowed the Board 
to focus on strategy and the long term 
objectives of the Group. Health and safety 
was a significant area of interest during  
the year. In particular the Board requested 
and received detailed analyses of the events 
surrounding the fatalities that occurred  
within its businesses and discussed  
steps taken to improve health and safety 
performance.
The ownership of the Company is such  
that the Board has major shareholder groups 
with which to deal. During the year the Board 
has discussed its approach to investor 
relations which reflected the importance of 
maintaining a balance between the interests 
of the major shareholders, the Government 
of Kazakhstan and other shareholders. The 
Board has had extensive engagement with 
both the Government of Kazakhstan and  
the Founder Shareholders, covering such 
issues as Board and governance procedures. 
This engagement has at times been robust 
in nature; however, the Board has maintained 
its independence in keeping with its 
responsibility to represent the interests  
of all shareholders.
The composition of the Board has also been 
considered, as detailed below. In particular 
the Nomination Committee has begun a 
search for a new Chief Executive Officer with 
assistance from an external search agency. 
Furthermore, the Board is currently reviewing 
its composition, recognising the importance 
of balancing the skills and experience of the 
Directors as well as ensuring an appropriate 
balance of independent and other directors. 
It is mindful of the need to ensure that it does 
not become so large as to be unwieldy.
The Board discussed its approach to 
corporate governance at several meetings 
during the year. In November, the Board 
reviewed a schedule detailing its compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘new Code’). The Company will report 
on its compliance with the new Code in  
the 2011 Annual Report and Accounts.
Board composition
At the start of 2010 the Board comprised  
12 Directors. Professor Dr Ameling was 
appointed as a non-executive Director on  
26 January 2010. The Board had identified  
a need to strengthen the balance between 
executive and non-executive Directors and  
to increase its understanding of the steel 
markets; a need that would be addressed  
by appointing a non-executive Director  
with good manufacturing or metallurgical 
experience. Professor Dr Ameling was 
already known to the Board as a highly 
respected expert in his field. Through his 
work for the World Steel Association he is 
the chairman of two international projects: 
‘Steel 2010 in China’ and ‘Steel 2020 in 
India’, giving him a wide knowledge of the 
Company’s worldwide customer base.  
His knowledge of the steel industry was 
recognised as a major strength to the 
Company and, as such, neither an external 
search consultancy nor open advertising 
was used for this appointment. 
The Board also recognised the importance 
of increasing its commercial awareness  
and responded to this by appointing  
Mr Jim Cochrane to the Board as an 
Executive Director on 13 August 2010.  
Mr Cochrane is a mining engineer with  
20 years’ experience in the industry. He 
joined the Group in 2001 and in addition  
to heading the Sales and Marketing function 
he has responsibility for the Logistics function 
of the Group.
As at 31 December 2010 the Board 
comprised 14 Directors. In addition to  
the Chairman, who is not considered 
independent, there were 10 non-executive 
Directors. Seven of these are considered  
by the Board to be independent. Directors’ 
biographies are shown on pages 58 and 59.
The ENRC Board takes 
its responsibility under  
the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance, 
as published in June 
2008 (the ‘Code’), very 
seriously, recognising that 
the Board sets the values 
and standards that are 
used to guide the affairs 
of the Company. 66__Unlocking Resources
Corporate Governance Report continued
outside Board meetings to ensure that he 
understands their views.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible  
for the operational management of the 
Group and the execution of the Group’s 
strategy. He is responsible for optimising  
the use of the Group’s resources, managing 
the Group’s risk profile and appointing senior 
management.
Mr Felix Vulis was Chief Executive Officer 
throughout 2010. For personal reasons he 
tendered his resignation to the Company  
on 4 February 2011 but has agreed to 
remain in his post until a successor is found. 
The Nomination Committee is currently 
undertaking the process to identify a  
new Chief Executive Officer using an external 
search consultancy.
Sir Richard Sykes is the Senior Independent 
Director and non-executive Deputy 
Chairman. In his role as Senior Independent 
Director, Sir Richard is responsible for 
addressing any shareholder concerns that 
cannot or should not be channelled through 
the Chairman or the Executive Directors.  
He is also responsible for ensuring that  
the Chairman’s performance evaluation  
is carried out.
Board processes 
Ten Board meetings and 11 Board 
sub-Committee meetings were held during 
the year. Eight of the Board meetings were 
regular scheduled meetings, and two were 
called to deal with specific issues relating  
to acquisitions. One Board meeting was 
arranged to discuss strategy, to which the 
General Directors were invited. One meeting 
was attended by the non-executive Directors 
only to discuss the performance of 
management. Where a Director was unable 
to attend a meeting, he was still supplied 
with the papers before the meeting and  
was able to discuss the business with the 
Chairman or Chief Executive Officer.
Four scheduled Board sub-Committee 
meetings were held during the year.  
The seven ad hoc meetings were held to 
discuss and implement various acquisitions. 
The schedule below shows the Directors’ 
attendance at scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings.
Activities during the year
The growth of the Group through 
acquisitions created governance challenges 
during 2010. The CAMEC acquisition in late 
2009 was a major step into a new territory 
and much consideration was given to 
ensuring that appropriate information was 
being brought to the Board. Significant focus 
was given to achieving the integration of 
financial reporting, and the consistency of 
health and safety reporting has also been  
a key issue.
The Group made significant progress in its 
diversification strategy in 2010, with material 
additions to the Group’s scope in both 
central Africa and Brazil. The pace of 
acquisitions in 2010 meant that some  
Board and Committee meetings were held  
at short notice. Nevertheless on each 
Under a relationship agreement with the 
Company, each of the Founder Shareholders 
of the Company has a right to appoint  
one Director to the Board, subject to them 
using reasonable endeavours to ensure  
that there is a majority of independent 
non-executive Directors on the Board, 
provided his shareholder group controls  
at least 10% or more of the voting rights 
exercisable at general meetings of the 
Company. Mr Ibragimov has exercised  
this right and appointed Mr Abdraman 
Yedilbayev as his representative.  
Mr Yedilbayev is therefore not considered 
independent by the Board. Mr Eduard 
Utepov and Mr Marat Beketayev are also not 
considered by the Board to be independent 
as both are representatives of The State 
Property and Privatisation Committee  
of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic  
of Kazakhstan. The non-independent, 
non-executive Directors contribute equally  
to discussions at Board meetings and each 
is a member of the HSES Committee.  
Mr Beketayev additionally serves on the 
Mergers and Acquisitions Committee and 
the Nomination Committee.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer are separate and their 
responsibilities are clearly defined in writing. 
The Chairman, Dr Johannes Sittard, is 
responsible for leading the Board and 
ensuring that it functions effectively. This 
includes setting the agenda for Board 
meetings, ensuring that the Board receives 
accurate, timely and clear information, and 
facilitating communication with shareholders.  
He liaises with his fellow Directors frequently

to good corporate governance. Board and 
Committee papers are generally distributed 
at least a week before the scheduled 
meetings to enable Directors to read and 
understand the issues to be discussed. Work 
to improve both the process and the content 
of Board and Committee papers continues.
The Board frequently receives presentations 
and updates from senior managers below 
Board level; not only does this give the 
Directors the opportunity to question 
employees about the running of the 
business, it also gives senior managers  
the chance to meet the Directors and gain  
a better understanding of their concerns. In 
2010, these presentations included regular 
updates from the Head of Investor Relations, 
operational reports from the CEOs of the 
Group’s businesses in Africa and 
Kazakhstan, and briefings from the Group 
Head of Risk and the Group Treasurer.  
In addition, all the General Directors were 
invited to attend the Board strategy meeting 
held in September.
Whilst no Board meeting was held at an 
operational site during 2010, the Directors 
are encouraged to make individual visits to 
the Group’s operations, particularly to the 
new sites in Africa. Sir Richard Sykes visited 
the Group’s operations in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo in October 2010.  
It is planned that a Board meeting will be 
held in Kazakhstan in 2011.
All the Directors have access to the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary for support 
and advice. He is responsible for advising 
the Board on all corporate governance 
issues and for ensuring that all applicable 
legislation and Board procedures are 
followed. He is also responsible for ensuring 
good information flows between the Board 
and its Committees and between senior 
management and the non-executive 
Directors. In conjunction with the Chairman, 
he is responsible for ensuring that the Board 
and Committee members receive 
appropriate training and development. 
During 2010 this included providing Board 
inductions for Professor Dr Dieter Ameling 
and Mr Jim Cochrane, detailed presentations 
to all the Directors on the UK Bribery Act 
2010, and providing various updates on 
corporate governance and risk. The 
appointment and removal of the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary is a matter 
reserved for the Board.
Committees 
The Board has established five principal 
Board Committees: Audit Committee, 
Remuneration Committee, Nomination 
Committee, Mergers and Acquisitions 
Committee and the Health, Safety, 
Environment and Sustainability Committee 
(‘HSES Committee’). The General Counsel 
and Company Secretary is secretary to each 
of these Committees. The terms of reference 
of each of these Committees are available  
on the Company’s website.
During the year, the Nomination Committee 
recommended that the HSES Committee’s 
membership should be extended to include 
Professor Dr Dieter Ameling, Mr Marat 
Beketayev and two managers of the Group, 
occasion paperwork was distributed in 
advance and, where Directors were unable 
to attend a meeting in person, conference 
facilities were made available to provide  
an alternative means of participation.  
The Board members recognised the risk  
of acquisitions to the Group’s reputation.  
The Board discussed all acquisitions 
thoroughly, recognising that these 
transactions held considerable value 
potential. The Board sought to balance  
the opportunities that they offered with the 
demands that each would place on internal 
resources and the complexity of realising the 
synergies of integration. The Board members 
placed considerable emphasis on thorough 
financial and legal due diligence and risk 
assessment in order to ensure optimal return 
for shareholders over the life of the projects.
In particular, the Group undertook extensive 
due diligence before the acquisition of 
Camrose in August 2010, and the Board  
had robust debate to ensure that the risks 
associated with that transaction were 
understood fully and mitigated properly.
All Directors contribute to Board discussion, 
although where a Director has a situational 
conflict he is not entitled to vote on the  
issue in question. All situational conflicts  
are reviewed annually by the Nomination 
Committee which then makes a 
recommendation to the Board on whether 
such situational conflicts should continue  
to be approved.
The Company recognises that supplying  
the Board with good information is essential

commencement of service, he also invites 
the Head of Group Risk and the Group 
Global Head of Compliance to attend  
and update the Committee at each of  
its meetings. The external auditors are  
also invited to each meeting of the Audit 
Committee and they meet separately  
with the Committee members, without 
management being present, at least once  
a year.
The Audit Committee held five scheduled 
meetings and two ad hoc meetings by 
telephone conference call in 2010. During  
the year the following items were reviewed:
accounting policies, estimates and  •
judgements including methodology and 
results of the Group’s annual impairment 
review;
confirmation of the ability of the Group   •
to continue as a going concern;
 the Preliminary and Interim Results  •
announcements, financial statements  
and Annual Report and Accounts;
all internal audit reports and investigations; •
the integration of CAMEC and other  •
acquisitions;
internal controls and risk management; •
compliance, including training on the   •
UK Bribery Act 2010; and
all external audit reports. •
The Committee also received regular 
updates on the progress of Project Arrow  
– an ongoing programme to improve the 
efficiency of reporting systems.
External audit
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been  
the Company’s auditors since before it was 
listed on the London Stock Exchange in 
December 2007 . The Audit Committee 
reviews the overall performance of the 
auditors annually and is responsible for 
making formal recommendations each  
year to the Board on the continuation  
of the external auditors in office. 
The Audit Committee is responsible to the 
Board for ensuring that the external auditors 
remain independent of the Company in  
all material respects and that they have 
adequate resources available to them to 
enable the delivery of an objective audit  
to the shareholders.
The Audit Committee remains satisfied  
with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s 
effectiveness and independence and to  
date has not considered it necessary to 
require the firm to tender for its audit work. 
However, the external auditors are required 
to rotate the audit partner responsible for the 
Group audits every five years. The current 
lead partner has been in place for four years. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the level 
and nature of any non-audit work to be 
performed during the year and considers 
whether it is appropriate for this work to  
be carried out by the external auditors.  
The Audit Committee maintains a policy 
regarding acceptable non-audit work, which 
incorporates authority levels for approving 
such work. The auditors are precluded  
from engaging in non-audit services that 
would compromise their independence  
and objectivity or violate any laws or 
regulations affecting their appointment as 
auditors. Note 34 to the financial statements 
shows the value of the non-audit work carried 
out by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during 
the year.
Internal audit
The Head of Internal Audit is invited to attend 
each Audit Committee meeting where he 
provides assurance, independent of the 
assurance provided by the Chief Financial 
Officer, that internal control activities, which 
have been subject to audit by his team, are 
operating effectively. 
The Group has an Internal Audit Charter 
which states that the Internal Audit Director  
is accountable to the Audit Committee and  
is to provide ENRC Group management  
with the following:
an independent, objective, positive  •
assurance on effectiveness of internal 
controls; and
a value-adding consulting service  •
designed to improve the effectiveness  
and efficiency of the Group’s operations 
and to safeguard both the assets and  
the integrity of the Group. 
During 2010, the Internal Audit function 
carried out a programme of planned reviews. 
In addition, ad hoc reviews included the 
following: 
investigations into procurement and  •
capital expenditure;
investigation into treasury controls; and •
a review of related party contracts. •
Mr Patrice L ’Huillier and Mr Victor Hanna, 
thus ensuring operational input from 
Kazakhstan and Africa. The composition  
of the Board Committees is now as  
shown overleaf.
Audit Committee
Mr Gerhard Ammann chairs the Audit 
Committee. Mr Ammann has had over  
30 years’ experience as an auditor including 
being chairman of Deloitte in Switzerland 
until 2007 . The Board therefore considers 
that he has had recent relevant financial 
experience. The remaining Audit Committee 
members are Sir Paul Judge, Mr Kenneth 
Olisa, and Mr Roderick Thomson, all of 
whom are regarded by the Board as 
independent non-executive Directors and 
each of whom has extensive business 
experience. The Company complies with  
the Code recommendations regarding 
membership of the Audit Committee.
Under its terms of reference, which are 
available on the Company’s website, the 
Committee is required to meet at least  
four times a year and, among other issues, 
considers:
the integrity of the Company’s financial  •
reporting;
the internal controls and risk management  •
systems;
the effectiveness of the internal audit  •
function; and
the relationship with the external auditors. •
The Audit Committee meetings are aligned 
with the corporate reporting cycle to enable 
the Committee to discharge its duties 
effectively. In particular the Committee 
schedules its meetings to enable it to  
review and comment on key financial 
announcements before making 
recommendations to the Board for  
their release.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
reports verbally to the Board on the actions 
of the Committee and updates the Board on 
any issues which require further investigation, 
action or improvement.
Whilst only members of the Committee are 
entitled to attend meetings, the Chairman 
invites the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the General Counsel and 
Company Secretary and the Chairman of  
the Board to attend. In addition, he invites 
the Head of Internal Audit and, since their  ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__69
The Nomination Committee also reviewed 
the composition of the Board and 
recommended the appointments  
of Professor Dr Dieter Ameling as a 
non-executive Director and Mr Jim Cochrane 
as an Executive Director. Professor  
Dr Ameling joined the Board on 26 January 
2010 and Mr Cochrane joined the Board  
on 13 August 2010. 
The Committee reviewed all existing 
conflicting situations and recommended  
that the Board reconfirmed its approval  
of these. It also reviewed all new conflicting 
situations and recommended their approval 
to the Board.
Remuneration Committee
Sir Richard Sykes chairs the Remuneration 
Committee. The other members are Mr 
Mehmet Dalman, Sir Paul Judge and Mr 
Kenneth Olisa, all of whom are independent 
non-executive Directors. The Company 
complies with the Code recommendations 
regarding membership of the Remuneration 
Committee. Whilst only the members of the 
Committee are entitled to attend its meeting, 
the Chief Executive Officer is also invited  
by the Committee Chairman to attend its 
meetings, but he does not attend on matters 
relating to his own remuneration.
Under its terms of reference, which are 
available on the Company’s website,  
the Committee is required to meet at least 
twice a year and, among other issues, it:
determines and recommends to   •
the Board the broad policy for the 
remuneration of Executive Directors  
and members of the senior management 
team;
determines the policy and scope for  •
pension rights for each Executive Director;
approves the design of any  •
performance-related pay schemes 
operated by the Group and determines 
the relevant performance targets as well 
as approving annual payments made 
under such schemes;
reviews the design of any share incentive  •
plans for approval by the Board and 
shareholders and determines the 
performance targets and the appropriate 
level of annual awards to be made; and
ensures that any compensation payments  •
made in respect of termination of contracts 
are fair to the individual but do not reward 
failure and that the duty to mitigate loss to 
the Company is recognised.
The remuneration of the Chairman and 
non-executive Directors is a matter reserved 
for the Board. The non-executive Directors 
do not review their own remuneration.
During 2010 the Remuneration Committee 
met six times. The Committee met:
to approve the bonus payments awarded  •
in respect of performance in 2009;
to determine and approve the  •
performance targets for bonus 
arrangements for Executive Committee 
members in respect of 2010;
to approve the awards made under the  •
Long Term Incentive Plan in April 2010; 
and
to determine the remuneration of   •
Mr Jim Cochrane on his appointment  
as an Executive Director.
The Committee also reviewed the 
remuneration packages of both the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer during 2010. It gave considerable 
attention to the alignment of senior 
management bonuses with health and safety 
objectives. The Committee agreed that, for 
each member of the Executive Committee, 
15% of their potential bonus would be based 
on the health and safety performance of  
the Group. The Committee also agreed  
that the safety performance of each  
General Director’s mine, plant, or division 
would determine 25% of that General 
Director’s bonus.
The Committee commissioned Kepler 
Associates to carry out a comprehensive 
review of senior executive remuneration  
and will consider Kepler’s review in 2011.
Further details are included in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which is set out  
on pages 73 to 78. A resolution to approve 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report will  
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 
Health, Safety, Environment  
and Sustainability Committee  
(the ‘HSES Committee’)
Mr Felix Vulis chairs the HSES Committee. 
The other members are Professor Dr Dieter 
Ameling, Mr Marat Beketayev, Mr Victor 
Hanna, Mr Patrice L ’Huillier, Dr Johannes 
Sittard, Mr Eduard Utepov and Mr Abdraman 
Yedilbayev. Mr Hanna and Mr L ’Huillier were 
appointed to the Committee during 2010  
to increase operational input. Mr Beketayev 
was also appointed to the Committee  
during 2010.
Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee reviews the 
arrangements by which employees can  
raise any concerns they may have about 
workplace fraud or mismanagement with 
local management on a confidential basis. 
All whistleblowing incidents are taken very 
seriously by the Committee. Any complaint  
is investigated in the first instance and  
a decision taken about further steps. 
Feedback is provided to the person making 
the complaint. Written records are kept of all 
whistleblowing incidents and a regular status 
report is presented at each Board meeting.
During 2010, the Committee held two 
telephone conference calls specifically  
to address whistleblowing allegations.
In 2011, the whistleblowing procedure is 
being upgraded with the introduction of  
an external whistleblowing helpline, available 
in four languages.
Nomination Committee 
Dr Johannes Sittard chairs the Nomination 
Committee. The other Committee members 
are Mr Gerhard Ammann, Mr Marat 
Beketayev, Sir Richard Sykes and Mr 
Roderick Thomson. The Company complies 
with the Code recommendations regarding 
membership of the Nomination Committee.
Under its terms of reference, which are 
available on the Company’s website, the 
Committee is required to meet at least twice 
a year and, among other issues, considers:
the size, structure and composition   •
of the Board, taking into account the  
skills, knowledge and experience of the 
Directors and to recommend to the  
Board any new candidates; 
whether non-executive Directors have  •
sufficient time to devote to the proper 
performance of their duties; 
 making recommendations in relation to  •
the retirement and re-election of Directors 
at the Company’s AGM; and 
succession planning. •
The Committee has assumed responsibility 
for monitoring Directors’ conflicts of interest 
or potential conflicts of interest in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and for making 
recommendations to the Board about 
whether such conflicts should be approved. 
The Committee met twice in 2010. It reviewed 
the composition of the Board Committees 
and recommended to the Board that the  
size of the HSES Committee be increased  
to ensure greater operational input. 70__Unlocking Resources
Corporate Governance Report continued
The M&A Committee met six times during 
2010 and its recommendations to the Board 
included the acquisition of a 90% stake in 
Chambishi Metals PLC, the acquisition of 
shares in Northam Platinum, the acquisition 
of a 50.5% stake in Camrose, the acquisition 
of the outstanding 50% interest in Bahia 
Minerals BV and the acquisition of 100%  
of Mineração Minas Bahia SA.
Board evaluation 
In 2009 an internal Board evaluation process 
was carried out, and the Board subsequently 
concluded that for 2010 an externally 
facilitated review was appropriate. Towards 
the end of 2010 the Company invited  
ICSA Board Evaluation to carry out an 
independent Board evaluation. This process 
was started early in 2011 and the results  
of the interviews with Directors will be 
discussed by the Board during spring.  
The key area for focus in 2011 will be the 
composition of the Board to ensure that it 
continues to be effective, with the level of 
skills and experience that is appropriate for 
the Group at this stage of its development 
and with shareholder representation that  
is balanced. The Board will undertake the 
recruitment of a new CEO and will also 
consider senior level succession planning.
In December 2010, the non-executive 
Directors met without management present 
and the Senior Independent Director led  
the evaluation of the performance of the 
Chairman.
The Company supports the 
recommendation in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that all Directors should 
be subject to annual reappointment. In 2011 
Mr Marat Beketayev, Mr Mehmet Dalman,  
Sir Richard Sykes and Mr Eduard Utepov  
will retire by rotation and stand for 
re-election. Mr Jim Cochrane, having been 
appointed since the 2010 AGM, will also 
stand for election. In addition, as the 
Company has decided that all Directors 
should stand for election at each AGM  
from 2011 onwards, Prof Dr Ameling,  
Mr Ammann, Sir Paul Judge, Mr Olisa,  
Dr Sittard, Mr Thomson, Mr Vulis,  
Mr Yedilbayev and Dr Zaurbekova will  
stand for re-election at the forthcoming 
AGM. The Nomination Committee will  
make recommendations to the Board on the 
continuation in office of each Director every 
year, taking into consideration the Director’s 
effectiveness and commitment to the role.
Training and development
The Chairman is responsible for arranging 
the training and development of the 
Directors. During 2010, inductions were 
given to Professor Dr Ameling and  
Mr Cochrane, and Board training was 
provided on the UK Bribery Act 2010, the 
role of Investor Relations, risk management 
and on the process for modelling cash flow  
and capital expenditure at Group level. In 
addition, the Audit Committee members 
received separate training sessions on the 
UK Bribery Act 2010 and on assessing risk  
in practice.
Risk management and internal control
Risk management
The Board is ultimately responsible for 
maintaining a sound risk management and 
internal control system to ensure compliance 
with the requirements of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance and the 
Turnbull Guidance on internal control and  
risk management. 
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance  
a review of the effectiveness of the risk 
management system is undertaken annually 
by the Board. 
Executive Committee (the ‘ExCom’)
The ExCom has specific responsibility as the 
risk management committee for the Group’s 
system of risk management. It reviews the 
Group’s significant risks and subsequently 
reports to the Audit Committee on material 
changes and the associated mitigating 
actions. 
Enterprise-wide risk management
The ExCom considers the careful and 
appropriate management of risk as an 
important management role. Managing 
business risk to deliver opportunities is a key 
element of all the Group’s business activities. 
The significant business risks are understood 
and documented. The business context 
determines in each situation the level of 
acceptable risk and controls.
The main features of the Group’s system  
of risk management include:
Group statements on strategic direction; •
clear business objectives and business  •
principles;
an established risk policy; •
annual review of key business risks; •
Under its terms of reference, which are 
available on the Company’s website, the 
Committee is required to meet at least twice 
a year and, among other things, it considers:
health, safety, environment and  •
community risks;
the Group’s compliance with applicable  •
legal and regulatory requirements 
associated with health, safety, 
environment and community matters;

Internal control
The Turnbull Guidance sets out best practice 
on internal control for UK listed companies  
to assist them in assessing the application  
of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance principles and compliance  
with the underlying provisions with regard  
to internal control.
The Group’s systems of internal control  
are designed and operated to support the 
identification, evaluation and management  
of risks affecting the Group, including in 
relation to the financial reporting process  
and the preparation of consolidated 
accounts, and the business environment  
in which the Group operates. The systems  
of internal control are subject to continuous 
review as circumstances change and new 
risks emerge. 
Features of the systems of internal control 
include:
the risk management system described   •
in the preceding section;
documented policies and procedures  •
within the Group’s businesses;
clearly defined lines of accountability;  •
an annual review of key internal controls;  •
and
minimising operating risk by using  •
appropriate infrastructure, controls, 
systems and people throughout the 
businesses.
The key policies employed in managing 
operating risk involve the segregation of 
duties, transaction authorisation, monitoring, 
financial, managerial and comprehensive 
reporting and analysis against approved 
standards and budgets.
Group Treasury operations manage 
exposure to counterparty risk, liquidity  
risk and currency transaction risks and 
Group Treasury coordinates the activities  
of Group companies in this area. The 
treasury policies, risk limits and monitoring 
procedures are reviewed regularly by the 
Audit Committee on behalf of the Board.
Group Tax manages risks associated with 
tax compliance, tax reporting, transfer 
pricing and tax planning. The Group Tax 
function monitors tax risk and implements 
strategies and procedures to control it.
Assurance on compliance with systems of 
internal control and on their effectiveness  
is obtained through:
regular management reviews; •
annual testing of key internal controls;  •
internal audit reviews; and •
testing of certain aspects of the internal  •
financial control systems by the external 
auditors during the course of their 
statutory examinations with regular 
reports to the Audit Committee by the 
external auditors.
The Audit Committee considers the results 
of the reviews to confirm that controls are 
functioning. Any material breakdowns and 
remedial actions are reported to the Board  
of Directors. 
Risk management and internal control 
systems in relation to financial 
reporting
The main features of the Group’s systems  
of risk management and internal control in 
relation to financial reporting, other than the 
general principles referred to above, are:
control environment – communication   •
of key principles and policies, delegation 
of authority and reports on compliance;
risk management – identification of key  •
financial risks and appropriate responses;
control activities – management utilises   •
a range of preventative and detective 
controls to minimise errors; and
monitoring – ongoing monitoring of   •
the above.
The systems of risk management and 
internal control are designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. In 
reviewing these, the Board has taken into 
account the results of all the work carried  
out by internal and external auditors.
Annual review of internal control
The Group continues to improve its process 
for reviewing the systems of internal control. 
For this year’s annual review of internal 
control, the Group significantly increased  
the scope and robustness of the review  
and testing process.
a continuing process for identification   •
and evaluation of principal risks to the 
achievement of business objectives;
management processes to mitigate  •
significant risks to an acceptable level;
ongoing monitoring of significant risks and  •
internal and external environmental factors 
that may change the Group’s risk profile; 
and
a review by the Group of both the type  •
and amount of external insurance that  
the Group buys, bearing in mind the 
availability of such cover, its cost and  
the likelihood and magnitude of the  
risks involved.
In addition to the annual review of principal 
risks, there is a process of regular reporting 
to the Board through the Audit Committee 
on the status of the risk management 
process. 
Risk management system evolution
The Group continues to develop its risk 
management and internal control systems 
and this includes:
•	 the 	 ap p oi n tmen t 	 o f 	 a 	 Gr o up 	 Hea d 	 o f 	 Ri sk ;
a clear strategy to further enhance the  •
Group’s approach to risk management, 
internal control and insurance;
 the review and development of a Group  •
risk framework;
 improved scope and robustness of the  •
annual review of internal control process;
further evolution of residual risk plans,  •
including insurance strategy and business 
continuity planning;
continued development of in-country   •
risk and internal control capabilities; and
further refinements to the ExCom Group  •
risk review process.
An enhanced ‘top-down’ risk management 
approach has been implemented in 2010 
focusing on the key risks to the execution  
of the Group business strategy. This will 
complement the current ‘bottom-up’ 
aggregation methodology. To further 
enhance the Group’s approach to risk 
management at a business unit level,  
the principles of the international standard  
for risk management ISO 31000 will be 
adopted where appropriate. 72__Unlocking Resources
Corporate Governance Report continued
The compliance function reports directly  
to the General Counsel and indirectly to  
the Audit Committee, and works closely  
with the legal, finance, risk, human resources 
and internal audit departments.
Interaction with shareholders
During 2010 the Group met with a large 
number of shareholders and prospective 
investors, mainly based in the United 
Kingdom, continental Europe and the  
United States of America, as part of a regular 
schedule of meetings and deal-related 
roadshows. The Group has an active and 
extensive investor relations programme 
although its free float is currently only around 
18%. Management also met with the 
Founder Shareholders and Kazakhmys PLC. 
The Government of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, with two Board seats, is 
frequently and closely involved with the 
Group’s deliberations and the executive 
management. 
As part of its investor relations programme, 
the Group aims to provide a high level  
of transparency and communication to 
investors and analysts on a timely basis, 
through announcements, meetings and 
seminars. The Group seeks to develop a 
regular dialogue with investors and analysts 
and to respond to their challenges and 
understand their sentiments and concerns. 
The Group has a comprehensive Investor 
Relations section on its website, which  
has up-to-date information available to all 
shareholders and investors. Shareholders 
have the opportunity to attend and raise 
questions at the Company’s Annual  
General Meeting. 
The Group aspires to have an investor 
relations programme that is ranked highly 
amongst its peers for its accessibility, 
responsiveness and disclosure. The Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer  
and Chief Commercial Officer between them 
aim to meet all major shareholders at least 
twice a year and, along with other senior 
management, to meet with a wide range  
of shareholders and prospective investors 
during the year. In 2010 these discussions 
focused on the results and businesses of  
the Group and also sought to understand 
any concerns held by investors. The  
Group meets with sell-side analysts to  
raise the Group’s profile and to build the 
research coverage.
Information on investor relations activity and 
analysts’ and brokers’ reports are regularly 
circulated to the Board. The Chairman and 
non-executive Directors are free to attend 
investor relations meetings or to request 
meetings with investors or analysts 
independent of the Group’s management. 
The Chairman, along with other 
non-executive Directors if appropriate, 
annually conducts a number of investor 
meetings focused on corporate governance. 
On an annual basis the Group undertakes 
meetings on sustainable development and 
corporate social responsibility with relevant 
executives and interested parties.
The fourth Annual General Meeting is due  
to be held on Wednesday, 8 June 2011  
and the Board welcomes the opportunity to 
answer questions put to it by shareholders  
of the Company.
Share capital
The Company’s share capital is described 
on page 63.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with those factors likely to affect future 
performance, are set out in the Business 
review.
In assessing the Group’s going concern 
status the Directors have taken into account 
the factors set out in the Business review, 
including the financial position of the Group 
and in particular its significant balances  
of cash, cash equivalents and liquid 
investments, the borrowing facilities in place 
and their terms, medium-term cash flow and 
liquidity projections, the current commodity  
prices and market expectations in the 
medium term, the Group’s expected 
operating cost profile and its capital 
expenditure and financing plans.
After making enquiries, the Directors have 
reasonable expectations that the Group  
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.
Review of effectiveness
The Board and the Audit Committee  
have reviewed the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control system, 
including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management, 
in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance  
to the date of approval of this Annual Report 
and Accounts. 
If significant internal control failings are 
identified, the Board confirms that necessary 
actions will be taken to address them and 
these will include:
reports to the Audit Committee and  •
Board; and if necessary
further investigations implemented by   •
the Audit Committee.
Remedial action plans will be monitored by 
the Audit Committee, with regular updates 
on progress to the Board of Directors.
In particular, the Internal Audit function has 
recently identified weaknesses regarding 
access to internal non-financial management 
data and regarding reporting lines and, 
under the guidance of the Audit Committee, 
these points are being addressed.
In 2011, the two key areas on which  
the Group will focus are mergers  
and acquisitions and developing the 
compliance function. 
Within mergers and acquisitions, the due 
diligence and integration manual has been 
developed and when approved will be rolled 
out. This is a complex and dynamic area for 
the business and it will be a clear priority for 
the year ahead.
Following an external report on risk and 
compliance, a global compliance function 
was created in 2010. The Group Global 
Head of Compliance was recruited and  
has now reviewed most of the operations, 
systems and controls in the context of 
compliance obligations. Progress has been 
made to devise and implement adequate 
procedures, as contemplated by the UK 
Bribery Act 2010. The priorities for 2011 are 
evidencing the ‘tone from the top’ by actions; 
implementing and monitoring of adequate 
procedures; and ensuring the different 
regions and businesses are staffed with 
appropriately skilled people. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__73
Remuneration Report
Membership of the Remuneration 
Committee
The members of the Committee were 
appointed on 6 December 2007 , and are  
as follows:
Sir Richard Sykes (Chairman)  •
Mr Mehmet Dalman •
Sir Paul Judge •
Mr Kenneth Olisa  •
Each member of the Committee is an 
independent, non-executive Director.  
The General Counsel and Company 
Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Chief Executive Officer  
and the Group Head of Human Resources, 
Business Performance & Transformation  
also attend Committee meetings by 
invitation, but neither is present when  
the Committee discusses issues relating  
to their own remuneration.
Advisers to the Remuneration 
Committee
Kepler Associates were retained by the 
Remuneration Committee as advisers. 
Kepler Associates do not have any other 
relationship with the Group. The Committee 
also received advice from the Group Head  
of Human Resources, Business Performance 
& Transformation (Mr Andrew Balgarnie) and 
the Group Counsel and Company Secretary 
(Mr Randal Barker) during the year.
Role of the Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is a formal 
committee of the Board. Its remit is set out  
in terms of reference formally adopted by  
the Board in 2007 and which were reviewed 
and amended in December 2010. The terms  
of reference are designed to enable the 
Committee to comply with the requirements 
relating to remuneration policy set out in the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
and, with effect from 1 January 2011,  
the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. A copy of the terms  
of reference can be found on the  
Company’s website.
The principal responsibilities of the 
Remuneration Committee are:
to determine and recommend to the  •
Board the framework for the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman, 
the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary and other senior executives  
of the Group;
 to monitor the appropriateness   •
and relevance of the Group’s 
remuneration policy;
 to approve the design and performance  •
targets of any performance-related pay 
schemes operated by the Group and  
to approve the total annual payments 
made under such schemes; and
to review the design of share-based  •
incentives and determine the level and 
extent to which awards are made during 
the year.
The Committee met six times during the year 
and, at the beginning of the year, reviewed 
the salaries of the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer, determining that 
they should remain unchanged from 2009. 
At subsequent meetings, the Committee 
gave considerable attention to the alignment 
of senior managers’ bonuses with health and  
safety objectives.
On his appointment to the Board, the 
Committee reviewed the remuneration 
package of the Chief Commercial Officer. 
Towards the end of 2010, the Committee 
began a detailed review of executive 
remuneration with the purpose of ensuring 
that remuneration continues to align with the 
Group’s remuneration policy, the business 
strategy, and best practice. As a result of this 
review, the Committee is proposing several 
changes to remuneration for 2011, namely 
the introduction of a deferred share bonus 
plan and changing the Total Shareholder 
Return performance condition attached  
to future Long Term Incentive Plan awards. 
These changes are described in more detail 
in the relevant sections later in this report. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is to 
provide a level of remuneration which 
attracts, retains and motivates Directors  
and senior executives of sufficient calibre  
to achieve the Group’s strategic goals and 
enhance shareholder value, whilst ensuring 
that remuneration is consistent with best 
practice and provides an appropriate 
alignment with personal and business 
performance. There is a competitive market 
for successful executives with experience  
in the mining industry and the provision  
of appropriate rewards for superior 
performance is important for the continued 
growth of the business. Therefore in applying 
the remuneration policy the Committee 
assesses relevant benchmark data from 
sources such as other FTSE 100 companies 
of a similar size and complexity, international 
mining companies and the market generally. 
The Remuneration Committee aims to set 
basic salary in line with the market median; 
over the longer term, superior performance 
should result in a pay and benefits package 
in the upper quartile. In setting remuneration 
within this framework, the Remuneration 
As required by section 
420 of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Directors 
present the report on 
Directors’ remuneration 
for the year ended  
31 December 2010.  74__Unlocking Resources
Committee aims to give senior executives 
every encouragement to enhance the 
Group’s performance whilst ensuring that 
they are fairly and responsibly rewarded  
for their personal contributions.
Components of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration 
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually by  
the Remuneration Committee and take 
account of the relevant benchmark data  
(as described above). The Committee  
also takes into consideration pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Group when determining any base salary 
increases. The Company does not have a 
policy on the differential between Executive 
Directors’ earnings and average earnings 
across the Group; rather it seeks to reward 
all employees fairly according to the nature  
of their role, prevailing market conditions  
and individual performance. There were  
no increases to Executive Directors’ salaries 
during 2010.
Annual bonus
For the year ended 31 December 2010,  
the annual bonus arrangements continue  
to be based on measures relating to Group 
financial performance, health and safety 
performance and personal performance. 
75% of bonus potential is based on Group 
financial performance (of which 75% is 
based on underlying EBITDA and 25%  
on basic EPS). The remaining 25% of  
bonus potential relates to health and safety 
measures (15%) and personal performance 
measures (10%). Financial performance is 
measured relative to budget, with 50% of  
the maximum opportunity payable for 
performance in line with budget, and full 
payment only if performance equals or 
exceeds 120% of budget.
Specific targets have not been disclosed  
as they are considered to be commercially 
sensitive and therefore confidential, but the 
Remuneration Committee is mindful of the 
need to provide targets that are deemed  
to be appropriately challenging and which 
will only pay out in full for exceptional 
performance. Budgets are set taking 
account of both internal and external 
expectations, while health and safety and 
personal performance aspects are 
measured against pre-determined 
objectives. The performance measures are 
regarded as appropriate to align 
management and shareholder interest, and 
to reward delivery of the Group’s strategy 
whilst cultivating greater health and safety 
awareness within the organisation. 
The maximum bonus potential for 2010, 
payable for exceptional levels of performance, 
was set at 200% of base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer, 175% of base salary for  
the Chief Financial Officer and 150% of base 
salary for the Chief Commercial Officer. In 
2010, the financial targets were met in full. 
The Committee also determined that the 
health and safety objectives and personal 
objectives had been achieved, and therefore 
maximum bonuses were due to Executive 
Directors for 2010 performance. Details of 
the actual amounts paid are set out in the 
Directors’ remuneration table on page 78.
For the 2011 financial year, the Committee 
has reviewed the performance measures 
that will determine bonus payouts to ensure 
continued alignment with the Group’s 
strategy. Changes include adjudicating 
financial performance both on an actual 
basis (as currently) and on an adjusted basis 
– adjusting for differences between actual 
and budgeted commodity prices. This will 
make bonus outcomes less sensitive to 
volatility in commodity prices in both directions.
To reinforce annual performance, whilst also 
helping to support retention and strengthen 
alignment of Executive Directors’ interests 
with shareholders, the Committee is 
proposing to introduce a deferred share 
bonus plan (the ‘Deferred Share Plan’). For 
2011, bonus opportunities will be increased 
to 300% of salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 250% of salary for the Chief 
Financial Officer and Chief Commercial 
Officer, but one third (30% for the Chief 
Financial Officer) of any bonus earned will  
be deferred in Group shares, vesting subject 
to continued employment for three years. 
This change will leave the cash opportunities 
broadly unchanged, but increase the 
weighting in the package on variable, 
share-based remuneration. In order to 
provide the flexibility to use new issued 
shares the Committee is seeking 
shareholder approval at the AGM for  
the Deferred Share Plan.

Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
It is the Remuneration Committee’s policy  
to align ‘at risk’ remuneration with the 
long-term success of the Group. The LTIP 
allows the Committee to award participants 
a conditional right to receive shares in the 
Company for nil consideration. Annual 
awards may not exceed a number of shares 
with a value equal to two times base salary, 
based on the average market value of shares 
over the five days preceding the date of 
grant. An award will normally vest on the 
third anniversary of its grant to the extent  
that the applicable performance conditions 
have been satisfied. The LTIP rules allow for 
immediate pro-rated vesting of the awards, 
subject to performance conditions, on a 
change of control. 
During 2010, LTIP awards were made of 
200% of base salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 175% of base salary for the  
Chief Financial Officer based on the average 
market value of the shares over the five  
days preceding the date of grant. The Chief 
Commercial Officer’s award, which was 
made before he was appointed to the Board, 
was 100% of base salary. Future awards  
will be more in line with those granted to  
the other Executive Directors, reflecting  
his increased level of responsibility.
The Committee considers that the 
Company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) 
remains the most appropriate measure of 
long-term Company performance, providing 
alignment of interests between management 
and shareholders. This is a key performance 
indicator for the Company and is described 
in more detail on page 28. The extent  
to which awards may vest will be subject  
to TSR performance over a three year  
period relative to the TSR performance of  
a specified comparator group of companies. 
These share awards will vest in full only  
if the Company’s TSR performance is  
ranked at upper quartile or above within the 
comparator group and the vesting schedule 
shown opposite will apply.
Furthermore the awards will not vest  
unless the Committee is satisfied that the 
Company’s TSR over the performance 
period reflects the underlying financial 
performance of the Group.
The TSR comparator group for awards  
made in 2009 and 2010 is seen in the  
table opposite.
No LTIP awards vested in the year. The 
Remuneration Committee has determined 
that the 2008 LTIP awards, which were 
based on TSR performance to 31 December 
2010, will not vest and will therefore lapse in 
May 2011. Details of awards made in 2010, 
which will vest subject to performance 
conditions in 2013, are shown in the LTIP 
table on page 78.
For 2011 awards, the Committee has 
decided to amend the TSR performance 
condition. The TSR comparator group has 
been revised to focus more on diversified 
and emerging markets miners and other 
relevant comparators such as steel 
companies. The revised TSR comparator 
group for 2011 awards is shown below.
The Committee believes this group  
will provide a more relevant benchmark,  
and therefore be a better indicator of 
management performance. The vesting 
schedule will remain unchanged, such  
that full vesting only occurs at upper quartile  
or above, 25% vesting at median and no 
vesting below median. Performance against 
this comparator group will determine  
the vesting of 50% of any LTIP awards.  
The other 50% will be based on TSR 
performance relative to the MSCI World 
Metals & Mining Index (the ‘Index’). The 
Committee is introducing this second 
benchmark in order to improve the 
robustness of the LTIP , as well as reflect 
market practice for other large miners.  
This portion of the award will vest as  
shown in the table below.
Performance graph
The Company’s TSR performance is shown 
against a recognised share index. ENRC 
became a constituent of the FTSE 100  
Index on 26 March 2008 and this index  
is considered to be the most appropriate.  
The graph opposite charts the total 
cumulative shareholder return of ENRC 
compared with the FTSE 100 since  
12 December 2007 (being the first date  
of trading for ENRC shares).
The mid-market price of ENRC shares  
at 31 December 2010 was £10.48  
and between 31 December 2009 and  
31 December 2010, the lowest and  
highest share prices were £8.18 and  
£12.66 respectively.

Pensions and benefits
The Executive Directors are members of  
the ENRC Personal Pension Plan (the ‘Plan’),  
a defined contribution pension scheme.  
An employer contribution of 10% of base 
salary is made to the Plan on behalf of  
each Executive Director. For the year ended  
31 December 2010 amounts of £102,000  
and £66,000 were paid into the Plan in 
respect of the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chief Financial Officer respectively. 
£25,000 has been paid into the Plan in 
respect of the Chief Commercial Officer 
since his appointment to the Board on  
13 August 2010.
Benefits comprise life assurance, private 
healthcare, travel insurance and income 
protection insurance. Both Mr Felix Vulis  
and Dr Zaure Zaurbekova received accrued 
annual leave payments, as required under 
Kazakhstani employment law, and relocation 
allowances. The taxable value of these 
benefits is included in the remuneration  
table on page 78.
Balance of the components of 
Executive Directors’ remuneration 
Remuneration packages are structured to 
provide an appropriate balance between 
fixed and variable elements, such that 
performance-related elements represent  
the majority. The main components of the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration for 2011 
and the percentage of each element as part 
of the total package are set out in the table 
on page 77 .
Directors’ contracts
Executive Directors
Each Executive Director has a service 
agreement which can be terminated by 
either the Company or the Executive Director 
giving 12 months’ notice. Under the terms  
of the contracts, the Company reserves the 
right, in its absolute discretion, to terminate 
an Executive Director’s employment by 
making a payment in lieu of notice. In the 
event of a contract being terminated, the 
Remuneration Committee would determine 
the level of any compensation to be paid, 
normally by reference to fixed elements of 
remuneration and the notice period. Any 
annual bonus payment or vesting of shares 
under the LTIP would be at the discretion of 
the Committee. Payments would normally be 
pro-rated and subject to the satisfaction of 
the performance conditions under which the 
awards were granted, pro-rated to the date 
of cessation of employment.
The Board supports the recommendation  
in the UK Corporate Governance Code that  
all directors should be subject to annual 
re-appointment and accordingly each 
Executive Director will stand for appointment 
at the 2011 AGM.
Dates of the service agreements are  
shown below.
The Board recognises that experience 
gained outside the Group can be valuable  
in terms of director development. Subject  
to Board approval, Executive Directors are 
permitted to accept outside appointments 
on external boards or committees so long  
as these are not considered to interfere  
with the business of the Company. Any  
fees in respect of those appointments  
may be retained by the Executive Directors 
concerned. During 2010, Mr Jim Cochrane 
was paid 40,000 rupees in respect of an 
external directorship; this sum was paid 
directly to a charity of his choice.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors do not have service 
contracts with the Company, but each has  
a letter of appointment. Each non-executive 
Director is required to stand for election at 
the first Annual General Meeting following  
his appointment and, subject to the outcome 
of the AGM, the appointment is for an  
initial three year term. Over and above  
this arrangement, the appointment may  
be terminated by either party giving six 
months’ notice. The Board supports the 
recommendation in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that all directors should 
be subject to annual re-appointment and 
accordingly each non-executive Director  
will stand for re-election at the 2011 AGM.
Details of the non-executive Directors’ letters 
of appointment are summarised below.
Copies of all Executive Directors’ service 
agreements and the letters of appointment  
of the non-executive Directors are available 
for inspection during normal business hours 
at the Registered Office of the Company.

Non-executive Directors’ fees
The remuneration of the non-executive 
Directors (other than the Chairman) is a 
matter for the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors. Fees are designed to ensure  
that the Company attracts and retains high 
calibre individuals. They are reviewed on an 
annual basis and account is taken of the 
level of fees paid by other companies of a 
similar size and complexity. Non-executive 
Directors do not participate in any annual 
bonus plan, long term incentive plan or 
pension arrangements. The Company 
repays the reasonable expenses that 
non-executive Directors incur in carrying  
out their duties as Directors. 
The fees payable to the Chairman are 
determined by the Remuneration Committee 
and the level of fees remained unchanged  
in 2010. 
The base fee for non-executive Directors  
in 2010 was £100,000 per annum.
Additional fees of £20,000 per annum  
were payable to Mr Gerhard Ammann  
as Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
additional fees of £150,000 per annum were 
payable to Sir Richard Sykes in respect  
of his chairmanship of the Remuneration 
Committee, his role as Senior Independent 
Director and as Deputy Chairman.
The non-conflicted Directors met during the 
year to review the non-executive Directors’ 
fees. They agreed that there should be no 
increase in the base non-executive Directors’ 
fee during the year, nor in the additional  
fees payable to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee or to Sir Richard Sykes in his 
capacity as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, Senior Independent Director and 
Deputy Chairman. However, it determined 
that Mr Mehmet Dalman should receive  
an additional fee of £20,000 per annum  
as Chairman of the M&A Committee.
As members of the Kazakh Government, 
neither Mr Marat Beketayev nor Mr Eduard 
Utepov is permitted to receive his fees 
personally. The fee for Mr Beketayev was 
donated to the London School of Economics 
and Political Science. As part of a larger and 
already ongoing engagement with 
Kazakhstan to facilitate the training and 
development needs of its Government, the 
School kindly offered to support two study 
visits for small groups of government officials 
from Kazakhstan in 2010. Mr Utepov intends 
to donate his 2010 fee to a charitable 
organisation, the details of which are to  
be determined.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as 
adopted by the European Union, and the 
parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group and the Company 
for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and  •
then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting  •
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
state whether IFRS as adopted by   •
the European Union and applicable  
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in  
the Consolidated and parent company 
financial statements respectively; and
prepare the financial statements on   •
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the  
Group and the Company will continue  
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that  
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Consolidated 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 58 and 59 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
the Consolidated financial statements,  •
which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group;
the parent company financial statements,  •
which have been prepared in accordance 
with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company; and
the Directors’ report and Business review  •
include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 80__Unlocking Resources
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of 
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC
We have audited the Consolidated financial 
statements of Eurasian Natural Resources 
Corporation PLC for the year ended  
31 December 2010 which comprise  
the Consolidated Income Statement, 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
‘IFRS’ as adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement  
of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on  
page 79, the directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the Consolidated 
financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require  
us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the company’s 
members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to  
any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Consolidated financial 
statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the  •
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2010 
and of its profit and cash flows for the  
year then ended; 
 have been properly prepared in  •
accordance with IFRS as adopted by  
the European Union; and
 have been prepared in accordance with  •
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the Consolidated financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the 
Consolidated financial statements.
Matters on which we are required  
to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of  
the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 certain disclosures of directors’  •
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
 we have not received all the information  •
and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required  
to review:
 the directors’ statement, set out on   •
page 72, in relation to going concern; 
 the part of the Corporate Governance  •
Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of  
the June 2008 Combined Code specified 
for our review; and
 certain elements of the report to  •
shareholders by the Board on directors’ 
remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent 
company financial statements of Eurasian 
Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the 
year ended 31 December 2010 and on the 
information in the Remuneration Report  
that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Principal accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC (the ‘Company’) was incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales on  
8 December 2006. The address of the Company’s registered office and domicile is 16 St. James’s Street, London, SW1A 1ER, United Kingdom. 
The consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
and the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates.
The accounting policies used in preparing these consolidated financial statements (‘financial statements’) are described below and are based on 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’), the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom’s (‘UK’s’) 
Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’), the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and Article 4 of the European Union 
IAS Regulation. These standards are subject to interpretations issued from time to time by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (‘IFRIC’). These consolidated financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for the 
revaluation of certain financial instruments. 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also necessitates 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree  
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 2.
The financial statements have been drawn up on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2009 except where new policies have been applied. New accounting policies and pronouncements and the effects of 
these policies have been outlined in note 3. 
Where the Group has changed the presentational format of these consolidated financial statements to further improve the comparability of its 
results, comparative figures have been changed accordingly. The Group has also completed the measurement period in respect of the acquisition 
of Central African Mining & Exploration PLC (‘CAMEC’), now known as ENRC Africa Holdings Limited, which has resulted in the restatement of the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity as detailed in note 6.
b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are those entities, over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic 
benefits from its activities, generally accompanying, directly or indirectly, an interest of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company (acquisition date) and are de–consolidated from the 
date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between subsidiaries are eliminated. Accounting policies  
of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
c) Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. 
As described further in note 3, the Group has changed its accounting policy for transactions with non-controlling interests and the accounting  
for loss of control from 1 January 2010 when IAS 27 revised, ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’, became effective. 
Previously transactions with non-controlling interests were treated as transactions with parties external to the Group. Disposals therefore resulted  
in gains or losses in the income statement and purchases resulted in the recognition of goodwill.
d) Joint ventures 
Joint ventures are all entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for 
strategic financial and operating decisions. The Group has elected to use the equity method to account for interests in jointly controlled entities, 
which are disclosed as joint ventures in the financial statements and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in joint ventures 
includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The Group’s share of its joint ventures’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are 
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the 
joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred. 88__Unlocking Resources

e) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under  
the equity method, the Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses are recognised in the income statement, and its share  
of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income are recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition 
movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its 
interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at 
cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual 
investments. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in that associate the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment  
and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred.
f) Functional and presentational currency
All amounts in these financial statements are presented in millions of US$ unless otherwise stated.
The functional currency of the significant operating entities is either the Kazakhstani tenge (‘KZT’), or the Russian rouble (‘RUB’) or Brazilian real 
(‘BRL ’), whilst for the Sales and Marketing entities and significant African operations it is the US Dollar (‘US$’). The functional currency for major 
entities in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The following additional factors  
are considered in determining the functional currency of a foreign operation:
 Whether the activities of the foreign operation are carried out as an extension of the reporting entity, rather than being carried out with a •	
significant degree of autonomy.
 Whether transactions with the reporting entity are a high or a low proportion of the foreign operation’s activities. •	
 Whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation directly affect the cash flows of the reporting entity and are readily available for •	
remittance to it.
 Whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation are sufficient to service existing and normally expected debt obligations without •	
funds being made available by the reporting entity.
The functional currency for the Company is the US dollar (‘US$’).

g) Foreign currency translation
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated to the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date  
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation of monetary assets 
and liabilities are taken to the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
h) Translation from functional to presentational currency
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated into  
the presentational currency as follows:
  Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet. •	
 Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable •	
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated  
at the dates of the transactions).
 All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. •	
 Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and •	
translated at the closing rate at the date of acquisition. When a subsidiary is disposed of through sale, liquidation, repayment of share capital  
or abandonment of all, or part of, that entity, the exchange differences deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement.
i) Revenue recognition
A significant portion of production is sold under contracts of sale of goods. Revenue from sales of goods is only recognised on individual 
shipments when persuasive evidence exists that the following criteria are satisfied:
 The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer. If it is arranged that the goods are transported •	
to a specified location, revenue is recognised when the goods are passed to the customer at the destination point. The revenue from sales of 
many products is subject to adjustment based on an inspection of the product by the customer. In such cases, revenue is initially recognised  
on a provisional basis using the Group’s best estimate of the quantity/quality of the product. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate  
of quantity/quality of the product is recorded in revenue once they have been determined;
 Neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold has been •	
retained;
 The amount of revenue and respective costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably; and •	
It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group. •	
Revenues from sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered by reference to the stage of 
completion of the specific transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual services provided, as a proportion of the total services to be provided. 
Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When the fair value of goods or services received in a barter 
transaction involving dissimilar items cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or service given up. 
Revenues are shown net of VAT and discounts.
j) Finance income and cost
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains and income on investment and trading securities. Finance costs comprise 
interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions, interest expense from the unwinding of discount on provisions for asset 
retirement obligations and losses on the revaluation and disposal of investments designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Finance income and costs include foreign exchange gains and losses that relate mainly to loans receivable, borrowings and term deposits (more 
than 3 months).
Interest income and expenses are recognised on a time proportion basis, using the effective interest method. All interest and other costs incurred 
in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred as part of financial expenses unless incurred on borrowings to finance the construction of 
property, plant and equipment in which case they are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its 
intended use. 90__Unlocking Resources
1. Principal accounting policies continued
k) Income tax
The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In that case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity. Kazakhstan’s Excess Profits Tax, being a tax on income, forms part of the income tax expense.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year. It is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and rates enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities  
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred assets to be utilised. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference  
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, 
associates and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is disclosed in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
l) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the 
balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the balance 
sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
m) Finance leases and hire purchase commitments
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased items, are capitalised at the 
commencement of the lease term. Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The capital 
elements, net of finance charges, of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as current or long-term 
payables in the balance sheet, as appropriate. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the lease liability so 
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the income statement. Capitalised 
lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset.
n) Operating leases
Where the Group is a lessee in a lease which does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership from the lessor to the 
Group, the total lease payments, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the period of the lease. For operating leases of facilities used in the process of production activity, the rental expense is recognised in the cost of 
sales. For operating leases relating to the use of administrative facilities, the rental expense is recognised in general and administrative expenses  
in the income statement.
Where the Group is a lessor under an operating lease, the lease payments receivable are recognised as rental income on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
o) Exploration and evaluation 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure related to an area of interest are written off as incurred until the management conclude that it is probable 
that future costs will be recovered through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively through its sale, from 
which point they are carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet and are included as a component of property, plant and equipment at cost 
less impairment charges.
Capitalised costs include costs directly related to exploration and evaluation activities in the relevant area of interest. General and administrative 
expenses are allocated to an exploration or evaluation asset only to the extent that they can be related directly to operational activities in the 
relevant area of interest. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that 
impairment may exist.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__91
1. Principal accounting policies continued
The following facts and circumstances, among others indicate that exploration and evaluation assets must be tested for impairment:
 The period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the near future, and  •	
is not expected to be renewed;
 Substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned; •	
 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral •	
resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; or 
 Sufficient data exists to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and •	
evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, the exploration and evaluation assets subject to testing are grouped with existing cash-generating units 
of operating mines that are located in the same geographical region. Where the assets are not associated with a specific cash-generating unit,  
the recoverable amount is assessed for the specific exploration area.
Any impairment loss is recognised as an expense in accordance with the policy on impairment of non-financial assets.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised as assets at their fair value at the date  
of acquisition.
p) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Cost includes the original 
purchase prices of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is recorded 
over the useful life of the asset, or over the expected remaining life of the mine if shorter, as follows:
Buildings (including mining premises): 20 to 50 years on a straight-line basis; •	
Mining assets (including mineral rights): on a units of production basis; •	
Plant and equipment: 4 to 15 years on a straight-line basis; and •	
Motor vehicles: 5 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. •	
Land is not depreciated.
The residual value of an asset is nil if the Group expects to use the asset until the end of its physical life. 
Estimates of residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually, and any change in estimate is taken into account in the determination of 
future depreciation charges.
The individual significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment (components), whose useful lives are different from the useful life of the 
asset as a whole, are depreciated individually, applying depreciation rates reflecting their anticipated useful lives. The cost of replacing major parts 
or components of property, plant and equipment items is capitalised and the replaced part is retired. 
Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Specialised spare parts and servicing equipment with a significant initial value and a useful life of more than one year are recognised as items of 
property, plant and equipment. Other spare parts and servicing-related equipment are recognised as inventories and accounted for in the income 
statement on utilisation.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, in accordance with the 
impairment policy below. 92__Unlocking Resources
1. Principal accounting policies continued
i) Mining assets
Once a project has been established as commercially viable, capitalised expenditures are transferred from ‘exploration and evaluation’ to  
‘mining assets’. In addition, mining assets include mineral rights, expenditure incurred to establish or expand productive capacity, costs to  
conduct mining-construction and mining-capital works, as well as costs arising from mining preparation works during the development or  
mine reconstruction phase.
Development expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the Group is accumulated separately for each area of interest in which economically 
recoverable resources have been identified. Such expenditure comprises costs directly attributable to the construction of a mine and the related 
infrastructure, including the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
When further development expenditure is incurred in respect of a mining asset after the commencement of production, such expenditure is carried 
forward as part of mining assets when it is probable that additional future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. 
Otherwise such expenditure is recognised as a cost of production.
Once a project has been fully commissioned, depreciation is charged using the units of production method, based on proved and probable 
reserves, with separate calculations being made for each area of interest. The units of production basis results in a depreciation charge 
proportional to the depletion of proved and probable reserves. 
Mining assets are included within the category ‘Buildings and mining assets’ of property, plant and equipment.
ii) Assets under construction
Assets under construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. Self-constructed assets include the cost  
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category. Assets under construction are not depreciated. Depreciation 
commences on the earlier of the date when the assets are available for use.
iii) Stripping costs
Stripping costs comprise the removal of overburden and other waste products from a mine. Stripping costs incurred in the development of mines 
and open pits before production commences are capitalised as part of the cost of constructing the mines and open pits, and depreciated using 
the unit of production method over the lives of the mines or open pits.
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of operations are treated as a production cost that form part of the cost of inventory.
q) Impairment 
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and all other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if facts and circumstances 
indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of ‘value in use’ (being the net present 
value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit) and ‘fair value less costs to sell’ (the amount obtainable from the sale of  
an asset or cash generating unit (‘CGU’) in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal). Where 
there is no binding sale agreement or active market, fair value less costs to sell is based on the best information available to reflect the amount the 
Group could receive for the CGU in an arm’s length transaction. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that 
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
The estimates used for impairment reviews to determine ‘value in use’ are based on detailed mine plans and operating budgets, modified as 
appropriate to meet the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Future cash flows are based on:
 Estimates of the quantities of the reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction; •	
 Future production levels; •	
 Future commodity prices; and •	
 Future cash costs of production, capital expenditure related to construction in progress and development projects that are not yet completed, •	
close down, restoration and environmental clean up.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income 
statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted in the impairment. This reversal is recognised  
in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised in prior years. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
r) Business combinations and goodwill
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. 
The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to measure non-controlling interests at the value of their proportion of identifiable assets 
and liabilities or at full fair value. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the acquiree, represents goodwill. ‘Bargain purchase gain’ is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__93
1. Principal accounting policies continued
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity 
interests issued by the Group, with contingent consideration recognised at fair value as part of that consideration transferred. The obligation to pay 
contingent consideration is classified as a liability or equity on the basis of the terms and conditions of the contingent consideration. In a business 
combination achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and the resulting 
gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in conjunction with a business 
combination are expensed as incurred. 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to those cash-generating units or groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the business combination. These cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units represent the lowest level within the Group 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and these groups are not larger than the Group’s operating segments, which are 
its product groups.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in accordance with the impairment policy described in the note above. Goodwill is measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses.
s) Intangible assets 
Intangible assets, which are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value when the fair value can be measured reliably on initial 
recognition. Intangible assets are tested for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, in accordance with the 
impairment policy described above.
Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives not exceeding 20 years.
t) Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: loans and receivables, financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and held-to-maturity financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
i) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are unquoted non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and 
receivables comprise mainly ‘loans receivable’, ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet.
ii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
iii) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance 
sheet date.
iv) Held-to-maturity financial assets
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Group’s 
management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity 
financial assets, the whole category would be reclassified as available-for-sale.
Recognition and measurement
Purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised on the relevant settlement date, which is the date that an asset is delivered to or  
by the Group. The change in value between the trade date and settlement date is not recognised for assets carried at cost or amortised cost.  
The change in value between the trade date and settlement date is recognised in the income statement for financial assets as ‘at fair value  
through profit or loss’. 
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, loans and receivables are stated at amortised  
cost using the effective interest method. Where a loan is provided at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is re-measured at origination 
at its fair value, which is represented by future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans.  
The difference between the fair value of the loan at origination and its cost (fair value of the contribution to the borrower, net of transaction costs) 
represents an origination gain or loss. The origination gain or loss is recorded in the income statement within finance income/costs unless it qualifies 
for recognition as an asset, liability or a charge to equity in accordance with the substance of the arrangement. Subsequently, the carrying amount 
of the loans is adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss and the amortisation is recorded as finance income/costs using the effective 
interest method. 94__Unlocking Resources
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit  
or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Available-for-sale financial assets and 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale 
monetary items, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in  
equity is transferred to the income statement.
Interest on available-for-sale securities calculated using effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Dividends on 
available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.
Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
The Group derecognises financial assets when: (i) the assets are redeemed or the rights to cash flows from the assets have otherwise expired;  
(ii) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets; or (iii) the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership but has not retained control. Control is retained if the counterparty does not have the practical 
ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party without needing to impose additional restrictions on the sale.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. 
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one 
or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications  
that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, when  
it becomes probable that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, where observable data indicate that there is a measurable 
decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults, and prolonged decline 
in the value of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale.
i) Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments carried at amortised cost has  
been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated  
future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.  
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of loss is recognised in the income statement.  
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after  
the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting an allowance account.
ii) Assets classified as available-for-sale
The decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in other comprehensive income. When there is an objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to  
the income statement as a reclassification adjustment even though the financial asset has not been derecognised. The amount of the cumulative 
loss that is reclassified from equity to the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and 
amortisation) and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement. Impairment 
losses recognised in the income statement for an investment in an equity instrument classified as available for sale are not reversed through the 
income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be 
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss shall be reversed, 
with the amount of the reversal recognised in the income statement.
u) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group’s policy with regard to financial risk management is set out in note 33. When the Group enters into derivative contracts they are designed 
to reduce exposures related to assets, liabilities, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement  
when incurred on the date a derivative contract is entered into. Derivative financial instruments are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.  
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature 
of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
 Hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitment (fair value hedge); •	
 Hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability  •	
or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). •	
The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in  
fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__95
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Management policy in 2009 was to hedge a proportion of foreign exchange risk associated with highly probable forecast transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies, refer note 33 for details.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘other 
operating income/expense’. Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item  
affects profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to  
the income statement.
Movements on derivatives not designated as hedge derivatives are taken to ‘other operating income/expense’ in the income statement. 
Refer note 33 for disclosure of derivatives and financial risk management.
v) Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory is determined on a weighted average basis.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost for raw 
materials, consumable stores and other inventories is purchase price or extraction cost and for work in progress and finished goods is the  
cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation and overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding 
borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to 
completion and disposal.
w) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able  
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the carrying 
amount and the recoverable amount, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The 
movement in the provision from the previous reporting period is recognised in the income statement. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, 
probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that 
the trade receivable is impaired. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘general and administrative expenses’ 
in the income statement. 
x) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with maturities  
of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. Balances restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date are included in other non-current assets, while balances 
restricted for more than three months but less than 12 months after the balance sheet date are included in trade and other receivables. Restricted 
balances are excluded from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
y) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference 
between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings 
using the effective interest method.
Where a loan is obtained at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is re-measured at origination to its fair value, which is calculated as 
future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans. The difference between the fair value of  
the loan at origination and its cost (fair value of the contribution to the borrower, net of transaction costs) represents an origination gain or loss.  
The origination gain or loss is recorded in the income statement within finance income/costs unless it qualifies for recognition as an asset, liability  
or a charge to equity in accordance with the substance of the arrangement. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the borrowings is adjusted  
for amortisation of the origination gain or loss and the amortisation is recorded as finance income/cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after balance sheet date.
z) Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where there are  
a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations  
as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations  
may be small. 96__Unlocking Resources
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time 
is recognised as a part of finance costs.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
aa) Asset retirement obligations and other environmental provisions
An obligation to incur asset retirement costs occurs when environmental disturbance is caused by exploration, evaluation, development or ongoing 
production. Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular review. Estimates are based on management’s 
interpretation of compliance with current environmental legislation in the country of operation.
Asset retirement costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net present value, are provided 
when the obligation to incur such costs arises and are capitalised into the cost of the related asset. These costs are charged against profits 
through depreciation of the asset and unwinding of the discount on the provision. Depreciation is included in operating costs while the unwinding  
of the discount is included as a financing cost. Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning or site rehabilitation of 
plant and other site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset.
ab) Employee benefit obligations
Defined benefit plans
The Group provides long-term employee benefits to employees before, on and after retirement, in accordance with labour union agreements in 
Kazakhstan, Russia and Democratic Republic of Congo. The agreement provides for one-off retirement payments, financial aid for employees’ 
disability, significant anniversaries and funeral aid. The entitlement to some benefits are usually conditional on the employee remaining in service  
up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. Such benefits are valued consistent with an unfunded defined benefit plan  
in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits . 
The future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods is discounted to determine the present 
value. Since Kazakhstan, Russia and Democratic Republic of Congo do not have an extensive market of high quality corporate bonds, market 
yields on government bonds which have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s benefit obligations are used as a basis for discount 
rates. The calculation is performed annually internally or by a qualified, independent actuary depending on the complexity of computations.
The expected costs of the benefits associated with one-off retirement payments are accrued over the period of employment using the same 
accounting methodology as used for defined benefit post-employment plans. This means that the difference between the fair value of the plan 
assets (if any) and the present value of the defined liabilities obligations is recognised as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Actuarial gains 
and losses arising in the year are taken to the income statement. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes 
in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has 
actually occurred.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including current service cost, any past service cost and  
the effect of any curtailments or settlements.
Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Obligations for contributions 
to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset 
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Payroll expense and related contributions
Wages, salaries, and social insurance funds, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in 
which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group. On behalf of its employees, the Group pays those statutory pension 
and post-employment benefit amounts prescribed by the legal requirements of the countries in which it operates. These payments are expensed 
as incurred. 
Share-based bonus awards
The Group has an equity-settled, share based compensation plans, under which the Group receives services from qualifying employees as 
consideration for equity instruments. The employee services received in exchange for the grant of the equity-settled payments are measured at  
the fair value of the equity granted and are recognised as expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the awards subject to the Group’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, due to the employees 
leaving the Group prior to vesting. The amount recognised in the income statement as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of 
awards that vest. The fair values of equity-settled payments are measured at the dates of grant using a Monte-Carlo pricing model.
If the Group cancels or settles a grant of equity instruments during the vesting period, it treats this as an acceleration of vesting and recognises 
immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period. Any payment 
made to a counterparty on the cancellation or settlement of a grant of equity instruments, even if this occurs after the vesting date, is accounted  
for as a repurchase of an equity interest (i.e. as a deduction from equity), except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity 
instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess is recognised as an expense. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__97
1. Principal accounting policies continued
ac) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
ad) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from 
the proceeds.
ae) Financial guarantees
Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs 
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees are initially 
recognised at their fair value adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Financial guarantees are 
recognised when premiums are paid or in the case of premium-free guarantees when the borrower received the money from the financing entity. 
When the Group issues premium-free guarantees or guarantees at a premium different from the market premium, the fair value is determined  
using valuation techniques (e.g. market prices of similar instruments, interest rate differentials, etc.). Losses at initial recognition of financial 
guarantee liabilities are recognised in the income statement within ‘net other operating expenses’. Financial guarantee liabilities are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee with the respective income presented within ‘net other operating expenses’. At each balance sheet 
date, the guarantees are measured at the higher of: (i) the unamortised balance of the amount at initial recognition; and (ii) the best estimate of 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
af) Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for making strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Group Chief Executive Officer. 
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a) Taxation
Taxation represents an area of inherent risk due to complexities of tax laws, frequent changes in tax rules, interaction between different taxes  
and interaction between tax rules of different jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the position for income taxes across  
the different countries in which the Group operates.
Tax provisions are recognised by the Group in accordance with tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the taxing jurisdictions, and in 
accordance with requirements of the applicable accounting standards. 
Note 15 contains information on current tax charges, prior period adjustments, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities including, where 
appropriate, provisions against uncertain tax positions.
b) Ore reserve estimates
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period. This may impact the Group’s financial results. Such changes in reserves may impact 
depreciation charges, asset carrying values, and asset retirement obligation provisions.
The Group’s ore reserves are based on its best estimate of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the relevant mining 
properties. Estimates are developed after taking into account a range of factors including quantities, ore grades, production techniques and 
recovery rates, forecast commodity prices and production costs.
The Group’s estimates are normally supported by geological studies by independent mining engineering consultants and drilling samples  
to determine the quantity and grade of each ore body. Significant judgement is required to generate an estimate based on the geological  
data available.
Ore reserve estimates are mostly calculated based on the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and  
Ore Reserves of December 2004 (the JORC code) which requires the use of reasonable assumptions, including:
 Future production estimates – which include proved and probable reserves, resource estimates and committed expansions; •	
 Expected future commodity prices, based on current market price, forward prices and the Group’s assessment of the long-term average price; •	
and
 Future cash costs of production, capital expenditure and rehabilitation obligations. •	 98__Unlocking Resources
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued
c) Life of mines
Contracts for subsurface use expire between 2012 and 2041. Management expects that the subsurface use contracts will be extended at nominal 
cost until the end of the lives of the related mines, which range between 9 and 48 years. Any change to this assumption may impact the Group’s 
financial results by affecting depreciation charges, asset carrying values and asset retirement obligations, as these have been recorded on the 
assumption that the subsurface use contracts will be extended until the end of the mine life. 
If the contracts are not renewed at their current expiry dates, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment existing at the expiry date to  
be written off at the date of expiry is US$923 million as at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$612 million). 
d) Provision for asset retirement obligations 
Provision is made for asset retirement obligations when the related environmental disturbance takes place. Provisions are recognised at the net 
present value of future expected costs as outlined in notes 1 and 28.
The provision recognised represents management’s best estimate of the costs that will be incurred but significant judgement is required as many 
of these costs will not crystallise until the end of the life of the mine. Estimates are reviewed annually and are based on management’s interpretation 
of compliance with current environmental legislation in the country of operation. Significant changes in environmental legislation, restoration 
techniques and estimates of contamination will result in changes to provisions from period to period.
The long-term inflation rate currently applied in the calculation is 2.8%-5.8% as at 31 December 2010 (2009: 5.6%-6.2%) being the estimate of the 
rate of inflation over the mine lives. The discount rate currently applied in the calculation is 7 .9%-9.0% at 31 December 2010 (2009: 6.0%-8.9%) 
being the estimate of the risk-free pre-tax interest rates for long-term government securities. Rehabilitation expenditure is largely expected to take 
place at the end of the respective mine lives, which varies from 9 to 48 years.
e) Impairment 
As stated in note 2(f) below, the Group considers, at least annually, the recoverability of the values of goodwill recognised in its financial statements. 
The Group also at the reporting date considers the recoverability of all assets if there have been any indications of impairment.
The recoverability of the value of financial assets is addressed through the Group’s usual procedures (refer note 1), for example the assessment  
of counterparty default risk, both customer and financial counterparties, and is not part of this impairment review.
Long term non-financial assets require there to be a reasonable expectation of recoverability of the carrying value of those assets through 
profitability and cash flow. Accordingly, if an impairment indicator exists, the Group’s approach is to consider the ability of its groups of 
cash-generating units, which have no goodwill in their financial statements, to generate future economic benefits which exceed the value  
of the related tangible assets in the financial statements.
In measuring the value in use for each CGU the Group based cash flow projections on the entities’ most recent business plans. Cash flow 
projections in these business plans are extrapolated until the last year of the life-of-mine applicable for each CGU. Cash flows have been projected 
for a maximum of 37 years as of 31 December 2010. The long-term US inflation rate has been used as the assumed growth rate in the preparation 
of these cash flows.
The key assumptions which formed the basis of forecasting future cash flows in the models as of 31 December 2010 are:
 Commodity prices, which are based on internal forecasts by the management of the Group’s sales and marketing business. These internal •	
forecasts are compared to the forecasts of industry market researchers;
 Long-term costs are set in line with current operational performance, as adjusted for future inflation rates in countries of operation and, where •	
applicable, the expected movements in key input costs;
 The successful extraction, processing and sale of the reserves in accordance with the quantities described in the report on Ore Reserves and •	
Mineral Resources on pages 144 to 151 and companies’ long term mine plans;
 The long-term US inflation rate will average 2.8% per annum, in line with external forecasts; and •	
 In determining the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows the Group based its computation on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital •	
for the Group, which is adjusted for the country risk premium for each CGU accordingly. The rates used were in the range of 11.01%-13.03%.
The impairment reviews as at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 concluded that no impairment provisions are required for long-term 
non-financial assets.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__99
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued
f) Business combinations and goodwill
The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year. Judgements and estimates are made in respect of the measurement of the provisional 
and final fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred. Where necessary, the Group hired external valuation consultants 
to advise on the fair value and asset lives of acquired assets, otherwise these were estimated internally.
The portion of the purchase price not allocated to specific assets and liabilities as identified by management has been attributed to goodwill. 
The Group considers, at least annually, the recoverability of the values of goodwill recognised in its financial statements. 
For groups of CGUs that were allocated goodwill the Group’s most recent business plans were used to calculate discounted future cash flows 
(‘Value in Use’ per IAS 36) and thus assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the goodwill. Cash flows in these business plans were 
extrapolated until the last year of life-of-mine applicable to each CGU as this period properly reflects the long term nature of the Group’s assets. 
The key assumptions which form the basis of forecasting future cash flows are the same as listed in section 2(e) above.
The impairment reviews as at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 concluded that no impairment provisions are required for goodwill.
g) Contingent liabilities
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other 
outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities  
(see note 36). Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the 
possible range of the financial settlement. Because of the inherent uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from  
the originally estimated provision.
3. New accounting pronouncements
(i) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2010 and are relevant to the Group’s operations 
IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’, and consequential amendments to IAS 27 , ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’, IAS 28, 
‘Investments in associates’, and IAS 31, ‘Interests in joint ventures’, are effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition 
date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with some significant changes compared with  
IFRS 3, which are described in note 1(r).
IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’ requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be 
recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. When control is lost, 
any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Also, total comprehensive 
income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a 
deficit balance. There have been no transactions whereby an interest in an entity is retained after the loss of control of that entity, and where there 
have been transactions with non-controlling interests they do not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IAS 36 (amendment), ‘Impairment of assets’, effective 1 January 2010. The amendment clarifies that the largest CGU (or group of units) to which 
goodwill should be allocated for the purposes of impairment testing is an operating segment, as defined by paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, ‘Operating 
segments’ (that is, before the aggregation of segments with similar economic characteristics). The amendment does not have a material impact  
on the Group’s financial statements.
Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions – Amendments to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, effective 1 January 2010. In 
addition to incorporating IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, and IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, the amendments expand on 
the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation. The amendments do not 
have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 100__Unlocking Resources
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

3. New accounting pronouncements continued
IFRS 5 (amendment), ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’. The amendment clarifies that IFRS 5 specifies the 
disclosures required in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations. It also clarifies  
that the general requirement of IAS 1 still apply, in particular paragraph 15 (to achieve a fair presentation) and paragraph 125 (sources of estimation 
uncertainty) of IAS 1. As the change only results in additional disclosures, there is no impact on earning per share.
Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards (issued in April 2009). Amendments to IAS 38, International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 9 and IFRIC 1 which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009; amendments to IFRS 5, 
IFRS 8, IAS 1, IAS 7 , IAS 17 and IAS 36 which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010.
(ii) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2010 but not currently relevant to the Group
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2010 but they are not currently relevant to the Group’s operations:
IAS 1 (amendment), ‘Presentation of financial statements’, (effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010). 
Embedded Derivatives – Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 (effective for annual periods ending on or after 30 June 2009).

IFRIC 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers (effective prospectively to transfers of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009, 
earlier application permitted). 
IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (following an amendment in December 2008, effective for the first 
IFRS financial statements for a period beginning on or after 1 July 2009). 
Additional Exemptions for First-time Adopters – Amendments to IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of IFRS (effective for annual periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2010). 
Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement – Amendment to IFRIC 14 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011). 
Limited exemption from comparative IFRS 7 disclosures for first-time adopters – Amendment to IFRS 1 (effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2010). 
(iii) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted 
by the Group
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (issued in November 2009, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with earlier application 
permitted, not yet adopted by the EU). 
IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures (amended November 2009, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011).
Classification of Rights Issues – Amendment to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation (effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 February 2010). 
IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010). 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the listed above amendments and new standards on its financial statements.
4. Segment information
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Group Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) and used to make 
strategic decisions. The CEO considers the business from a products and services perspective and assesses the performance of the operating 
segments based on the measure of Underlying EBITDA (refer note 37).
The amounts provided to the CEO with respect to segment assets and segment liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the 
financial statements. These assets and liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment and their physical conditions.
Segment Underlying EBITDA, assets and liabilities includes items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis. Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories, and trade and other receivables

4. Segment information continued 
The Group is organised on the basis of six (2009: six) operating segments:
 Ferroalloys – comprises the extraction and sale of chrome ore as well as the production of ferroalloys from chromium and manganese ores; •	
 Iron Ore – comprises exploration, extraction, processing and manufacturing of iron ore products; •	
 Alumina and Aluminium – comprises extraction and processing of bauxite and limestone, and smelting of alumina and aluminium; •	
 Other Non-ferrous – comprises the exploration and extraction, processing and manufacturing of copper and cobalt products, and the •	
exploration of other minerals in Africa;
Energy – comprises coal mining and power generation; and •	
 Logistics – Kazakhstan’s main freight forwarder and railroad operator, providing international logistics for all Eurasian based ENRC operations; •	
also rail construction and repair services for the Kazakhstani state rail company. Includes also logistics and trucking operations throughout 
Southern Africa.
Internal charges between segments have been reflected in the performance of each operating segment. The Group has a number of activities  
that exist principally to support the metals operations including power generation, coal mining and transportation. Inter-segment transfers or 
transactions are entered into under a cost-plus pricing structure. The revenue generated from external parties reported to the CEO is measured  
in a manner consistent with that in the consolidated income statement. The identified operating and reportable segments of the Group are the 
same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2009. The following acquisitions 
have been added to the Group’s segments during 2010.

Enya Holdings BV (‘Enya’) and Chambishi Metals PLC (‘Chambishi’) Other Non-ferrous
Comit Resources FZE (‘Comit’) Other Non-ferrous

Congo Cobalt Corporation Sprl (‘CCC’) Other Non-ferrous
Bahia Minerals BV (‘BMBV’) and Bahia Mineração Ltda (‘BML ’) Iron Ore
Mineração Minas Bahia SA (‘MIBA’) Iron Ore
Mineração Peixe Bravo SA (‘MPB’) Iron Ore
During the year, management of the SABOT logistics business, which was acquired with CAMEC, was transferred from the Other Non-ferrous Division 
to the Logistics Division. As a result of this change, the segment classification of the SABOT logistics business has changed for the current year and  
the prior year has been restated in this respect. The impact of the SABOT restatement is a transfer of revenue of US$14million, Underlying EBITDA of 
US$1 million, Segment assets of US$7 4 million and Segment liabilities of US$5 million from the Other Non-ferrous segment to the Logistics segment.  
In addition, the 2009 Segment assets and liabilities of the Other Non-ferrous segment were restated as detailed in note 6 to reflect the completion of the 
CAMEC fair value measurement period.

6. Business combinations
Enya Holdings BV and Comit Resources FZE
On 6 April 2010, the Group acquired 100% of Enya Holdings BV (‘Enya’) which holds a 90% interest in Chambishi Metals PLC (‘Chambishi’),  
a Zambian copper and cobalt producer and also acquired a 100% of Comit Resources FZE (‘Comit’), a Dubai-based marketing and sales 
company that historically has handled Chambishi’s copper and cobalt sales. The gross cash consideration for the transaction amounted to 
US$300 million. The acquisition of Enya and Comit was effectively completed and control obtained by the Group in April 2010. 
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Enya and Comit as at the date of acquisition were provisionally estimated as follows:

Includes non-controlling interests of a subsidiary not wholly owned by Enya.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of Chambishi primarily because of the strong strategic location of the assets within the copper and cobalt  
belt of Zambia. Chambishi is well placed to take advantage of the potential growth in the copper and cobalt mining activity within the region.  
The acquisition complements the Group’s strategy of expansion in the copper and cobalt business. None of the recognised goodwill is expected  
to be deductible for income tax purposes. The provisional fair value adjustments include measurement period adjustments made since  
30 June 2010.
Acquisition costs of US$4 million have been expensed and included in general and administrative expenses in the income statement. Trade  
and other receivables balances at acquisition date included gross contractual amounts due of US$2 million, none of which was expected to be 
uncollectible at the acquisition date. The loans receivable balances at acquisition date comprised gross contractual amounts due of US$12 million, 
none of which was expected to be uncollectible at the acquisition date. The Group has chosen to recognise the non-controlling interests for this 
acquisition based on their proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.
The acquired businesses contributed revenue of US$132 million and loss after income tax of US$8 million from the date of acquisition to  
31 December 2010. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the impact to the Group’s revenue would have been an 
additional US$28 million, whilst the impact to profit after income tax would have been an additional loss of US$9 million.
Bahia Minerals BV (‘BMBV’)
On 21 September 2010 the Group completed the purchase of the outstanding 50% of the common shares of Bahia Minerals BV (‘BMBV’) 
(commonly referred to as the ‘BML Project’) from Ardila Investments NV (‘Ardila’), a subsidiary of Zamin BM NV, being the shares of BMBV which 
ENRC did not already own. BMBV is the sole shareholder of two Brazilian companies, Bahia Mineração Limitada (‘BML ’) and Eire Mineração 
Limitada (‘EML ’). BML and EML are the only assets within BMBV, in the Caetite region in the State of Bahia in Brazil.
The 50% interest in BMBV was acquired for a net cash consideration of US$670 million (before discounting), after assuming net debt of 
approximately US$65 million. A payment of US$168 million was made at completion, from existing cash resources. The remaining US$503 million 
(the ‘Deferred Consideration’) is payable in two instalments, of US$168 million and US$335 million respectively which are subject to the satisfaction 
of certain conditions. Following the completion of the acquisition the Group owns 100% of BMBV.
The Group also secured an option to purchase 100% of the outstanding shares of Block V Limited and Caera Minerals Limited, which together 
own Greystone Mineração do Brasil Limitada (‘Greystone’), from Zamin. The Group paid US$50 million for grant of this option as an advance 
against its exercise price. The advance was to be offset either against the exercise price (should the Group exercise the option), or otherwise 
against the Deferred Consideration for BMBV (should the Group not exercise the option). The Group elected not to exercise the option and as a 
consequence the payment was offset against the Deferred Consideration. Subsequently, the Group also made a payment of US$84 million against 
the Deferred Consideration upon achievement of certain logistical infrastructure approvals. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 107

Carrying value of initial 50% interest at acquisition date 367
Total consideration 1,347
The gain of US$298 million arising on recognition of the Group’s existing interest in BMBV at fair value is recognised in the income statement. 
The fair value adjustments are to recognise mineral rights acquired and deferred taxation arising thereon. The goodwill recognised on acquisition is 
the result of the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on the acquired mineral rights (within property, plant and equipment). None of the 
recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The deferred consideration has been discounted to its fair value on initial recognition of this liability.
Acquisition costs of US$1 million have been expensed and included in general and administrative expenses in the income statement.
The acquired businesses contributed revenue of US$nil and loss after income tax of US$19 million from the date of acquisition to 31 December 
2010. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the impact to the Group’s revenue would have been an additional US$nil, whilst 
the impact to profit after income tax would have been an additional profit of US$4 million.
Mineração Minas Bahia SA (‘MIBA’) and Mineração Peixe Bravo SA (‘MPB’)
In October 2010, the Group announced the purchase of 100% of the common shares of MIBA. The cash consideration is payable in instalments, 
and shares of MIBA are transferred to the Group against each instalment. During 2010 the Group paid US$100 million, and received 42.4% of 
MIBA. The remainder is payable in two instalments, of US$48 million in April 2011 and October 2011 and a final instalment of approximately  
US$47 million in April 2012 (together ‘Deferred consideration’). 
In addition, the Group subscribed for new common shares representing 51% of the enlarged share capital of Mineração Peixe Bravo SA (‘MPB’). 
The Group also holds a 3 year option, from 20 October 2010, to purchase the remaining 49% of MPB from its shareholders for US$50 million.
The combined acquisitions and related deals have a total cash consideration of up to US$304 million, which includes US$54 million payable  
to Steel do Brasil Participações SA (‘Steel do Brasil’). The total consideration comprises US$250 million payable to the shareholders of MIBA –  
a group of individuals primarily composed of the Couri family (together, the ‘Sellers’) – and to MPB. 
Both MIBA and MPB have been accounted for as subsidiaries. MPB has been treated as a subsidiary because, under IFRS, the Group is 
considered to have control through the right to acquire the remaining shares and the terms of the shareholders’ agreement. Although the Group 
currently holds less than 50% of MIBA it considers it has control on the basis of the shareholders agreement and its obligation to acquire the 
remaining shares in the business.
In addition, up to US$54 million is payable to Steel do Brasil. Steel do Brasil previously entered into agreements to acquire 100% of the outstanding 
common shares of MIBA and 50% of the outstanding common shares of MPB. Steel do Brasil had agreed to allow the Sellers to negotiate an 
independent agreement with the Group and, if successful, conclude the transaction with the Group. Any amounts payable to Steel do Brasil are

The fair value adjustments are to recognise mineral rights acquired and deferred taxation arising thereon. The goodwill recognised on acquisition is 
the result of the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on the acquired mineral rights (within property, plant and equipment). None of the 
recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The fair value adjustments and non-controlling interests (which are not 
currently material) are provisional at 31 December 2010.
Acquisition costs of US$62 million have been expensed and included in general and administrative expenses in the income statement.
The Group has chosen to recognise the non-controlling interests for this acquisition based on their proportionate share of the identifiable net assets 
of the acquiree.
The acquired businesses contributed revenue of US$nil and profit after income tax of US$nil from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2010.  
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the impact to the Group’s revenue would have been an additional US$nil, whilst the 
impact to profit after income tax would have been US$nil.
Société Minière de Kabolela et Kipese Sprl
A 50% interest in Société Minière de Kabolela et Kipese Sprl (‘SMKK’) was acquired on 9 November 2009 as part of the CAMEC acquisition. 
SMKK is the title holder of some exploration permit assets contiguous to the Group’s existing operations in the DRC. At 31 December 2009, the 
provisional carrying value of the Group’s investment in SMKK was US$75 million. This investment was accounted for as an associate using the 
‘equity method’. In 2009 the Group acquired an option, for a cash consideration of US$25 million, to purchase the outstanding 50% of the issued 
share capital of SMKK by acquiring the entire issued share capital of Emerald Star Enterprises Limited (‘ESEL ’), (an entity controlled by the Gertler 
family trust), the owner of the outstanding 50% of SMKK. The Group exercised this option and the acquisition of ESEL was effectively completed 
and control obtained by the Group in June 2010. The total cash consideration in respect of the outstanding SMKK shares, inclusive of the US$25 
million option, amounted to US$75 million. 
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of SMKK and ESEL as at the date of acquisition were provisionally estimated as follows:

The goodwill recognised on acquisition is the result of the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on the acquired mineral rights (within 
property, plant and equipment). None of the recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
There were no significant acquisition costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest. 
The acquired businesses contributed US$nil revenue and profit after income tax from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2010. If the 
acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the impact to the Group’s revenue and profit after income tax would have been US$nil.

Congo Cobalt Corporation Sprl
With effect from 1 July 2010 the Group acquired, Congo Cobalt Corporation Sprl (‘CCC’), a legal entity registered in the DRC that provides mining 
contracting services to Boss Mining Sprl (part of the CAMEC group of companies) and SMKK. Consideration of US$4.5 million (US$3 million net of 
cash acquired) was paid.
Central African Mining & Exploration Company PLC
On 18 September 2009, the Group made a £0.20 per share cash offer for all outstanding shares in Central African Mining & Exploration Company PLC 
(‘CAMEC’), at which time the Group held 28.73% of CAMEC and accounted for the investment as an associate using the ‘equity method’.  
On 9 November 2009, upon the offer becoming unconditional following the receipt of acceptances in respect of 88.28% of CAMEC’s share capital, 
the Group obtained control of CAMEC. As at 31 December 2009 the Group held 96.05% of CAMEC’s share capital for a total cash consideration 
of US$931 million.
CAMEC, which was previously listed on the United Kingdom’s Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’), was an Africa-focused emerging mining 
company with operations centred around copper and cobalt mining and exploration, trucking and logistics, coal, bauxite and fluorspar exploration 
as well as platinum prospects. 
The fair values of the identifiable asset and liabilities of CAMEC as at the date of acquisition were provisionally estimated and disclosed in the 2009 
Annual Report and Accounts of ENRC. The Group has now completed the measurement of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired with 
CAMEC. The table below sets out the movements from the provisional fair values detailed in the 2009 Annual Report and Accounts and the final 
fair values at acquisition date.
These adjustments have been recorded as a prior year restatement of the Balance Sheet of the Group at 31 December 2009. There is no 
consequential impact to the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2009.

The goodwill balance is primarily the result of the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on the acquired mineral rights (within property,  
plant and equipment). This deferred tax liability is recognised within the carrying values at the acquisition date with an additional amount included 
within the fair value adjustments. 
The adjustments made to restate the balance sheet relate primarily to the final measurement of mineral rights acquired and other adjustments 
relating to loan receivables, trade payables and current income tax payable which were required when the Group completed its review of the 
acquired balance sheet.
Acquisition costs of US$6 million were expensed in the 31 December 2010 income statement.
In addition, the Group completed a partial buyout of non-controlling interests in CAMEC for a cash consideration of US$9 million. As a result, the 
Group’s interest in CAMEC increased to 96.88% of CAMEC’s issued share capital. The Group recognised a decrease in non-controlling interests  
of US$9 million, and no impact on retained earnings. 110__Unlocking Resources

Fair value estimates
The provisional values of assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition are their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Accounting 
standards permit up to 12 months for provisional acquisition accounting to be finalised following the acquisition date if any subsequent information 
provides better evidence of the item’s fair value at the date of acquisition.
For all business combinations, the Group either undertook or is in the process of undertaking a detailed review to determine the fair value of assets 
and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition. Such reviews may include engaging third party advisers to determine the fair values of the 
cash-generating units of the entities acquired.

Factors affecting future tax charges
Future tax charges are affected by changes to the applicable laws and regulations in, as well as profit mix from, the jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. Given that the Group is subject to Excess Profits Tax in the Republic of Kazakhstan, future tax charges are also affected by product prices 
and profitability levels achieved on subsurface use contracts in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
In November 2010, the Republic of Kazakhstan extended the applicable 20% rate of Corporate Income Tax and the currently applicable rates  
of Mineral Extraction Tax indefinitely. The enacted changes resulted in remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 
2010, and an increase to the income tax charge of US$48 million. A reduction in the applicable rate of Corporate Income Tax in the UK from 28%  
to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011 was enacted on 20 July 2010. A further reduction to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011 has subsequently been 
announced and is expected to be enacted in due course, along with a proposal to reduce the rate to 25% from 1 April 2012.

(2009 as restated: US$273 million) relates to deferred tax liabilities in respect of mineral rights. 
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of US$91 million (2009: US$77 million). Of this 
amount, US$14 million (2009: US$11 million) relates to losses which expire within 10 years, and US$77 million (2009: US$66 million) relates to 
losses which have no expiry date.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Group’s investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint ventures where 
remittance is not contemplated or where no additional tax is expected to arise. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with 
such investments is US$6,167 million (2009: US$4,686 million).

18. Goodwill and intangible assets continued
Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy disclosed in note 1. As at 31 December 2010, and 31 December 2009 there is  
no impairment of goodwill (refer note 2 and below).
Sensitivity of recoverable amounts
Management believes that, currently, there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions that would lead goodwill to be 
impaired for the majority of its businesses. The exception is the CGU in the Other Non-ferrous division, as described below.
At the end of 2010, the analysis of recoverable amounts for the Boss Mining group resulted in headroom that necessitated a review of sensitivities 
to the main assumptions used. The impairment test for this CGU is particularly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, discount rate and 
operating costs.
As indicated in note 6, the goodwill balance in CAMEC (of which Boss mining is a subsidiary) is primarily the result of the requirement to recognise 
a deferred tax liability on the acquired mineral rights. For the purposes of testing this goodwill for impairment, any of the related deferred tax 
liabilities recognised on acquisition that remain at the balance sheet date are treated as part of the CGU.
Whilst the directors remain confident in the assumptions used in the recoverable amount computations, adverse changes in assumptions as 
described below could result in impairment charges.

 Including foreign exchange rate.
The excess of recoverable amount over the carrying value was US$165 million. One of the assumptions used in the calculation of the recoverable 
amount relates to the quantity of available reserves and resources. The Group is in an early stage of exploration and has not yet completed an 
overall evaluation of reserves and resources by an appropriate qualified person. The assumption therefore represents management’s expectations 
at the time of completing impairment testing, based on available historical information and some preliminary drilling. Once the Group completes  
the evaluation exercise, the quantity of reserves and resources of their properties could be significantly different.
The commodity prices used in the impairment review are management’s estimates over the first five years of the forecasted period, and they are 
not significantly different from the available analyst forecasts. The long-term price after year 2015 remains fixed at US$6,200 per tonne for copper 
and US$30,900 per tonne for cobalt till the end of the forecasted period which is year 2027 . Operating cost assumptions are based on management’s 
best estimate at the date of impairment testing of the costs to be incurred, which correlate with the production volumes stated in long-term mine 
plans. Operating costs in the above table are presented on a combined basis for copper and cobalt.

(a) Acquisitions 
Camrose Resources Limited (‘Camrose’)
In August 2010, the Group purchased 50.5% of the issued share capital of Camrose and formed the Camrose joint venture. The interest in 
Camrose was purchased from Cerida, Silvertide Global Limited and Zanette Limited, which are owned by the Gertler Family Trust. Camrose’s 
primary assets, held through its subsidiaries, are high quality copper and cobalt exploitation licences located in the DRC. The consideration for the 
acquisition was US$175 million. The Group paid US$50 million in cash and issued promissory notes totalling US$125 million which mature between 
9 months and 24 months (refer to note 27). As part of the acquisition, the Group provided Camrose with a US$400 million shareholder loan facility. 
The loan has been made available to Camrose for the purposes of satisfying existing payment obligations on the part of the Highwind Group  
(as defined below), repaying committed loans previously undertaken by Camrose, funding working capital, commencing feasibility studies,  
as well as mine planning and development. The Group also provided a guarantee to secure repayment of US$155 million by Cerida of outstanding 
debt. Camrose, through its subsidiaries, primarily holds interests in five copper and cobalt exploitation licences situated in the DRC by way of: 
 45,400,000 common shares of Africo Resources Limited (‘Africo’), representing approximately 64% of the issued share capital of Africo, which  •	
is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Africo owns a 75% interest in the exploitation licence for the Kalukundi property in the Kolwezi District  
of Katanga Province in the southeast of the DRC. The remaining 25% is owned by Gécamines; 
 A 56% indirect interest in La Congolaise de Mines et de Développement (Comide Sprl) (‘Comide’) of which Gécamines holds a 25% interest  •	
in Comide. Comide holds the exploitation licences for Kii, Mashitu and Pangalume, which are contiguous to Africo’s Kalukundi property; and
 The entire share capital of Highwind Properties Limited, Pareas Limited, Interim Holdings Limited and Blue Narcissus Limited (together, the •	
‘Highwind Group’). Under the terms of a joint venture agreement dated 7 January 2010, between the Highwind Group, the DRC government, 
Gécamines and Simco Sprl, an entity associated with Gécamines, the Highwind Group holds a 70% interest in Treatment of Kingamyambo 
Tailings Company (‘Metalkol’) which owns the tailings exploitation licence (PER 652) covering the Kolwezi Tailings Site (otherwise known as  
the Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings, otherwise known as Kolwezi Mine Tailings (‘KMT’)), a license site located in the Kolwezi District of Katanga 
Province in the southeast of the DRC. Development of the site is subject to feasibility studies being completed. Metalkol has not acquired any 
infrastructure or equipment at the Kolwezi Tailings Site.
The acquisition is complementary to the Group’s existing operations in the DRC. The Camrose assets held by Camrose and its subsidiaries  
are contiguous to the Group’s existing assets held in the DRC. These proximate homogenous ore bodies have the potential to share power 
allocation and logistics capacity, with the ability to reduce mining costs through the optimisation of mining methods and enhanced scale of 
processing facilities.
The Group has a 50.5% interest in Camrose and exercises day-to-day operational control. This is accounted for as a joint venture due to  
certain reserved matters in the shareholders’ agreement governing this relationship.
The Highwind Group are co-defendants in an action filed by Congo Mineral Developments Limited. Further detail can be found in note 36. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 117
19. Investments in joint ventures and associates continued
Shubarkol Komir Joint Stock Company (‘Shubarkol’)
On 16 February 2009 the Group acquired a 25% interest in Shubarkol, a major semi-coke and thermal coal producer incorporated in Kazakhstan, 
for a cash consideration of US$200 million.
Shubarkol is majority owned by Eurasian Finance-Industrial Company JSC (‘EFIC’), a company controlled by the Founder Shareholders.
In connection with the acquisition, the Group has entered into an off-take agreement with Shubarkol, secured a seat on Shubarkol’s Board and 
entered into a shareholders agreement with EFIC. In addition the Group has a right of first refusal (subject to the pre-emption right of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan to purchase the subsurface user rights), combined with a call option, over all or part of the remaining shares in Shubarkol held  
by EFIC. The call option is exercisable at the Group’s discretion at any time until 31 January 2011 which, if exercised will be subject to required 
regulatory approvals having been obtained and is expected to be subject to the approval of the Group’s shareholders. The price payable on  
any exercise of the call option is the aggregate value of the shares to be transferred, assuming Shubarkol has a total value of US$800 million  
on a fully diluted basis, less any net debt at the time of the transfer. At 31 December 2010, the fair value of this option was US$nil.
The call option is subject to the approvals noted above and the Republic of Kazakhstan has the pre-emptive right to purchase the subsurface  
user rights. As a result, it is not readily exercisable or convertible, therefore, the possession of the call option does not contribute to control over 
Shubarkol. Consequently, the Group has accounted for Shubarkol as an associate.
On 31 January 2011, the Group announced the extension of the call option for US$nil consideration by up to 12 months, to 31 January 2012.  
All other significant terms of the call option remained unchanged as detailed in note 39.
(b) Acquisitions of outstanding interests in associates
Société Minière de Kabolela et Kipese Sprl (‘SMKK’) and Earth Centre Investments (Pty) Limited were acquired on 9 November 2009 as part of  
the CAMEC acquisition. While the Group legally held a 50% interest in SMKK and Earth Centre Investments (Pty) Limited, both investments were 
deemed associates as the Group could only influence, rather than control, the decision-making processes of both entities. 
In June 2010, the Group acquired the remaining 50% of SMKK. Refer note 6 for further detail.
(c) Debt to equity swap
In January 2010, the Group converted a US$27 million loan to Bahia Minerals BV (‘BMBV’) into an equity investment in BMBV with no increase in 
the Group’s percentage interest.
In September 2010, the Group acquired the remaining 50% of BMBV. Refer note 6 for further detail.

28. Asset retirement obligations continued
The amount of the provision for asset retirement obligations is determined using the nominal prices effective at the reporting dates by applying  
the forecasted rate of inflation for the expected period of the life of the mines. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes  
in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and the level of discount and inflation rates.
Principal assumptions made in calculations of asset retirement obligations are presented below:

The decrease in the asset retirement obligations for the year ended 31 December 2010 was mainly due to the increase in the discount rate for 
Kazakhstani entities.

32. Share-based payments
The Group has established a Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) with a view to attracting, retaining and motivating the Executive Directors and 
selected senior management. 
The LTIP share awards are equity settled share based payment transactions which vest on the third anniversary of the grant date subject to 
achievement of performance targets. The LTIP performance target is based on the Group’s total shareholder return, ranked against a comparator 
group of other international mining companies over a three year period. Further information on the LTIP is disclosed in the Remuneration report on 
pages 73 to 78.
In circumstances where an employee ceases to be employed prior to the vesting date for reasons except dismissal, the Board has the discretion  
to allow the employee’s award to vest to the extent they deem the performance target would have been satisfied if prorated to the date of cessation 
of employment. 128__Unlocking Resources

 The Group’s estimated share price volatility is based on the historical average annualised volatility of the comparator group of mining companies and reflects the assumption 
that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the awards is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. The increase in volatility 
for Grant 2 and Grant 3 was due to the changes in market conditions over historical periods similar to the life of the awards. 
2 
The estimated dividend yields for Grant 2 and Grant 3 were based on the Group’s historical dividend payments. For Grant 1, the expected dividend yield was deemed to be 
average of comparator group of mining companies as the Group had not paid any dividends prior to grant date of Grant 1.
3 
The risk-free interest rate is a government bond rate over a period similar to the life of the awards. The increase in risk-free rate in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to market 
fluctuations.
The estimated fair value of each share granted under the LTIP is calculated by applying a Monte-Carlo simulation model. At 31 December 2010 the 
median benchmark comparator was not met. As a result Grant 1 of the LTIP will not vest.
Recognition of services received
An expense of US$8 million (2009: US$13 million) for share-based payments was recognised during the year ended 31 December 2010 within 
employee benefit expense in the income statement. During 2010 payments of US$nil (2009: US$3 million) were made to LTIP participants.

33. Financial risk management 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk), credit 
risk and liquidity risk. The Group may use derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange exposure.
Financial risk management is the responsibility of the treasury function which identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation 
with the Group’s operating units. The Treasury Policy outlines principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific 
areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, 
and investment of excess liquidity.
Credit risk 
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. The Group has credit insurance for the majority of its sales. Credit limits are set 
by the Group in accordance to limits provided by the Credit Insurance Company.
Credit insurance is no longer available in respect of the Group’s Russian customers. The development of the Group’s relationship with its two 
largest Russian customers, MMK and UC Rusal, is described in the Operating Review. The Group undertakes rigorous credit control procedures 
which are closely monitored by the Head of Sales and the Chief Financial Officer. These procedures are regularly reviewed in light of the limited 
availability of credit insurance. As a general rule, for those sales to non-major customers where credit insurance is not available, the Group operates 
a policy of ‘cash on delivery’ or ‘letters of credit’.
The Group has established relationships with a number of international and domestic banks in the areas in which the Group operates to diversify 
credit risk. Individual credit limits are assigned to each counterparty according to an analysis of financial strength or published credit rating. Limits 
and exposures to each counterparty are regularly monitored and reported at each Board meeting. During the year a mixture of bank deposits and 
liquidity funds were used within the Group’s investment portfolio to manage credit exposure.
Where possible, our policy is to invest cash and cash equivalents with highly rated banks and with AAA rated liquidity funds. The Group’s Treasury 
policy prescribes the maximum limits that are available for investment purposes with any individual counterparty. For operational and investment 
purposes in Kazakhstan, there are a limited number of counterparties with an independent credit rating.  ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 129

In 2010 the top 10 customers as a proportion of the outstanding balance of the Group’s trade and other receivables accounted for 42% (2009: 65%).
Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment review is necessary in respect of trade and other receivables not past due 
by up to 60 days.
Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s production costs are denominated in Kazakhstani tenge (KZT) and Russian roubles (RUB) while sales are denominated 
in US dollars (US$). The Group is therefore exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates will affect both its operating profit and cash flows. 
The Group’s foreign currency exposure arises from: 
Highly probable forecast transactions (sales/purchases) denominated in foreign currencies; and •	
Monetary items (mainly intercompany receivables, payables and borrowings) denominated in foreign currencies. •	
Foreign currency risks in 2009 were partially mitigated through forward foreign exchange contracts which were deemed to be effective hedges  
on highly probable forecast transactions that achieve an average exchange rate. All forward exchange contracts expired at 31 December 2009. 130__Unlocking Resources

Devaluation of Kazakhstani tenge 
The devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge in early February 2009 gave rise to significant one-off foreign exchange movements on the revaluation of 
US dollar denominated balances in the Kazakhstani operations, primarily inter-company receivables and loans, and term deposits. Consequently, 
the Group recognised net foreign exchange gains of US$210 million and US$104 million included in other operating income (note 11) and finance 
income (note 13), respectively, and a foreign exchange loss of US$75 million included in finance cost (note 14). ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 131
33. Financial risk management continued
Separately, in the Group’s balance sheet the devaluation impact on net assets was reflected in a significant one-off reduction of about  
US$1.3 billion in the currency translation reserve within equity.
Commodity price risk 
The Group generates most of its revenue from the sale of commodities, primarily ferrochrome, chrome ore, iron ore, alumina, aluminium, cobalt 
and copper. Historically, the prices of these products have been volatile and have fluctuated widely in response to changes in supply and demand, 
market uncertainty, the performance of the global or regional economies and cyclicality in industries that are end users of these products. 
Prices may also be affected by government actions, including the imposition of tariffs and import duties, speculative trades, the development  
of product substitutes or replacements, recycling practices, an increase in capacity or an oversupply of the Group’s products in its main markets. 
These external factors and the volatility of the commodity markets make it difficult to estimate future prices.
A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices would materially and adversely affect the Group’s business and the financial results and 
cash flows of operations. The Group does not hedge significantly its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of its products.
The table below sets out the sensitivity of the Group’s Underlying EBITDA to changes in commodity prices:
The 5% reduction in sales price, relative to the average for the year, would reduce Underlying EBITDA by:

Copper 7 n/a

Commodity price sensitivity for Copper and Cobalt was not presented for 2009 as they formed an insignificant portion of the Group’s revenue.
Interest rate risk
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates. These assets and liabilities are exposed to 
cash flow interest rate risk or fair value interest rate risk depending on whether they are subject to variable or fixed rates of interest. 
The objective of interest rate risk management is to manage and control interest rate risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable interest rate borrowings. 
The Group’s significant interest bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 20, 21, 24, 25, and 27 .
An increase/(decrease) of 1% in interest rates at the reporting date would have decreased/(increased) profit before tax for the year ended  
31 December 2010 by US$4 million (2009: US$7 million). The impact on equity is the same as the impact on income. This analysis assumes  
that all other variables, in particular foreign exchange rates, remain constant. 
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns  
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group intends to maintain a capital structure in line with industry’s norms and practices which will be achieved over a period of time, taking

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

33. Financial risk management continued
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled  
by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have 
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking 
damage to the Group’s reputation. 
The table below summarises the Group’s non-derivative financial assets and liabilities which will be settled on a gross basis into relevant maturity 
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the tables are the 
contractual undiscounted cash flows, translated at balance sheet date exchange rates.

Fair value of financial instruments
In determining fair value of financial instruments the Group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and verify assumptions that are mainly 
based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date, as well as obtaining fair value measurements from other parties. 
For the financial instruments measured on the balance sheet at fair value, the Group has adopted the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in the active market is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. These instruments 
are included in Level 1. As at 31 December 2010 and 2009, the Group’s available-for-sale financial assets (note 20) are included in Level 1 of  
the hierarchy. 
As at 31 December 2010 and 2009, the Group did not hold financial instruments that are included in Level 2 or 3 of the hierarchy. 
The fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost is based on expected cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates for  
new instruments with similar credit risk and maturity. 
The investments in unquoted options, disclosed in note 20, are carried at cost, because the fair value can not be reliably measured. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 133

36. Contingencies
Pending litigation
The Highwind Group, subsidiaries of ENRC’s Camrose joint venture, are co-defendants in an action filed on 13 September 2010 in the Eastern 
Caribbean Supreme Court of the British Virgin Islands by Congo Mineral Developments Limited (‘CMD’), a subsidiary of First Quantum Minerals 
Limited (‘FQM’), in relation to the Highwind Group’s interest in the tailings exploitation licence (PER 652) covering the Kolwezi Tailings Site. The  
claim was served on the Highwind Group on 3 December 2010. The total amount claimed by Congo Mineral Developments Limited is an estimated 
US$2 billion. The Highwind Group has applied for summary judgement and/or strike out of the claim. The process of the application for summary 
judgement and/or strike out, including any appeals, could take over 2 years to complete. We consider that the application for summary judgement 
and/or strike out has good prospects of success. However, should the Highwind Group ultimately be unsuccessful in obtaining summary 
judgement or having the claim struck out, the Highwind Group intends to defend its position vigorously.
Taxation
At the end of 2009, the Kazakhstan tax authorities issued a transfer pricing assessment of US$126 million on SSGPO in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2004. The Group’s management are confident that the company was fully compliant with the transfer pricing legislation prevailing  
at the time, have appealed against the assessment, and are defending the adopted filing position. No provision against additional tax is considered 
to be necessary. The Kazakhstan tax authorities are currently considering the Group’s appeal against the assessment. 134__Unlocking Resources

39. Events after the balance sheet date 
Shubarkol Call Option Extension
On 31 January 2011, the Group announced the extension of a call option (the ‘Call Option’) originally granted in conjunction with the acquisition  
of a 25% interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC (‘Shubarkol’) in February 2009 (the ‘Call Option Extension’). The Call Option gives the Group the right  
to acquire the outstanding 75% of the ordinary shares of Shubarkol for a consideration of some US$600 million. The Call Option Extension, which 
has been granted for nil consideration, extends the expiry date of the Call Option by up to 12 months, to 31 January 2012. All other significant terms 
of the Call Option are unchanged. Shubarkol, one of Kazakhstan’s largest thermal coal producers, is majority owned by Eurasian Industrial Company 
JSC (‘EIC’), a private company beneficially wholly owned by the Founder Shareholders of the Group.
Funding arrangements
On 7 February 2011, the Group entered into an Export Credit Facility agreement for the amount of €185 million. The facility is an 11-year draw-down 
facility and bears an interest rate of six-month EURIBOR plus a margin of 1.2%. Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs AG has provided credit insurance 
to support the facility. The facility will be used to finance some of the Group’s capital expenditure programme. 
On 18 March 2011, the Group signed an unsecured senior US$500 million revolving credit facility which will significantly enhance the Group’s 
headroom and provide significant liquidity to the Group’s business operations.
2010 Final Dividend 
For 2010 the Board has recommended a final dividend of US 18.0 cents per share, amounting to US$232 million, to be paid on 15 June 2011  
to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 1 April 2011. 138__Unlocking Resources
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of 
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the year ended 31 December 2010 
which comprise the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 79, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance  
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2010; •	
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and •	
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. •	
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and •	
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the parent company financial statements are prepared is consistent •	
with the parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from •	
branches not visited by us; or 
  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting •	
records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or •	
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. •

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
1. Principal accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
These financial statements represent the individual parent company.
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. The Directors have reviewed the Company’s existing accounting policies and 
consider that they are consistent with last year. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is US dollars. At 31 December 2010, the exchange rate was £1 = US$1.5477 (2009: £1 = 
US$1.6139) and the average rate for the year was £1 = US$1.5451 (2009: £1 = US$1.5664).
b) Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment. Investments are tested for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An impairment 
loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the higher of net realisable value and the discounted future 
earnings from the investment.
c) Financial assets and liabilities
Amounts owed by group companies, which are interest bearing, are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
Amounts owed to group companies and term borrowings, which are interest and non-interest bearing, are initially recorded at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred, and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance income and expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. 
d) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
e) Taxation including deferred tax
Current tax in respect of the taxable profit or loss for a period is provided using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised in respect of all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured using the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis. 
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the profit and loss account for the period except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or a loss 
recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, in which case tax attributable to that gain or loss is also recognised 
directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
f) Share-based payments
The Company has adopted a Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) designed to reward senior management employees of the Group for achieving the 
Group’s strategic objectives and provide an appropriate level of long term performance related pay. Each year, participants will receive conditional 
awards of shares in the Company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded. This is subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions, measured over a three-year performance period and continued service.
The share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Company’s financial statements and is measured at fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date of grant. The fair value was calculated by applying a Monte Carlo model.
In accordance with FRS 20, where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based 
compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record  
an expense for such compensation with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent. Consequently,  
in the financial statements of the parent, the Company is required to record an addition to the Company’s investment in subsidiaries, with a 
corresponding increase recognised in other reserves, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. Failure to vest  
as a result of market conditions is not reversed.

the consolidated financial statements. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 141
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Change in accounting policy
The Company has changed its accounting policy when the Amendment to FRS 20, ‘Share-based payment – Group cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions’ became effective. The amendment clarifies the scope of FRS 20 by incorporating the requirements of UITF 41 ‘Scope of  
FRS 20’ and UITF 44 ‘Group and treasury share transactions’, and sets out the accounting for Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions  
in an entity’s individual financial statements. Where an entity receives goods or services but has no obligation to settle the share-based payment 
transaction or the awards granted are in the entity’s own equity instruments it would treat the transaction as an equity-settled share-based payment.
The change in accounting policy has no direct impact on the accounting previously adopted by the Company.
g) Dividends
Dividends payable are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on 
the balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the balance 
sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue. 
2. Cash flow statement, related party and financial instruments disclosures 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from presenting financial instruments disclosures under the terms of FRS 29. The Company 
has not prepared a cash flow statement as a consolidated cash flow statement has been presented in the consolidated financial statements of  
the Company.
In accordance with exemptions under FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’, the Company has not disclosed transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries, 
as the Company’s financial statements are presented together with its consolidated financial statements.
3. Directors’ report, Directors’ emoluments and employee information
The Directors’ report and the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement have been set out on pages 62 to 64 and page 79.
The Company had 3 employees in 2010 (2009: 2 employees), who were also Directors of the Company. Emoluments of all the Directors are borne 
by ENRC Management (UK) Limited. Full details of the remuneration and share interests of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2010 are 
set out in the Directors’ remuneration report section of this Annual Report and Accounts.
4. Taxation including deferred tax
The Company has unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of US$4 million (2009: US$3 million).
A change in the UK main corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% was enacted on 20 July 2010 and will be effective from 1 April 2011 as further 
detailed at note 15 to the Consolidated financial statements. On the basis that the Company currently does not have any recognised deferred tax 
assets or liabilities, no remeasurement of these balances is necessary.
5. Investments

Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2010
SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd (‘SRK’) has reviewed and restated in line with the 2004 Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves (the ‘JORC Code’) as published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgy, the mineral resources and ore reserves for the various mining assets of ENRC. For the Kazakhstan assets this involved reviewing  
the GKZ ‘reserve’ statements as prepared in accordance with the local regulatory requirements of Kazakhstan, as at 31 December 2010.  
SRK has modified and translated ENRC’s GKZ ‘reserve’ statements and restated these as Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance 
with the terms and definitions given in the JORC Code, without recourse to fundamental recalculation.
Since preparing an independent Mineral Expert’s Report (‘MER’) on the mining, processing, smelting and power generating assets of ENRC in 
2007, SRK has prepared annual updates of the JORC Code compliant Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves with site visits being undertaken on  
a two to three year basis. Site visits to Kazchrome’s Donskoy GOK chrome operations and Zhairemsky GOK’s manganese and iron-manganese 
operations were undertaken in February 2009. Site visits to Eurasian Energy Corporation’s (‘EEC’) Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine and the SSGPO 
iron ore mines were undertaken in February 2010, and Aluminium of Kazakhstan’s (‘AoK’) KBRU and TBRU bauxite mines were most recently 
visited in February 2011. The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements as of 31 December 2009 form the basis for the current update.
In addition to the Kazakhstan assets, Mineral Resource and, where appropriate, Ore Reserve statements have been reviewed and restated for 
Bahia Mineração Limitada’s (‘BML ’) Pedra de Ferro iron ore project in Brazil and several of the Other Non-ferrous Division’s copper and cobalt 
assets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (‘DRC’), being Boss Mining’s Mukondo Mountain, Kakanda North and South, and SMKK’s 
Kabolela deposits. The dates of these statements relied on the data availability and are therefore not stated per 31 December 2010. For BML,  
in line with the Bankable Feasibility Study (‘BFS’) statement, the Mineral Resources are stated as of March 2009, and the Ore Reserves as of  
April 2010. For the Boss Mining and SMKK assets, the date of the statement is as of 31 January 2011. A site visit to the DRC assets was carried  
out in February 2011.
SRK has reviewed the Ore Reserve statements in conjunction with ENRC’s price forecasts, or where not considered appropriate in line with 
consensus market forecasts. The long term prices used to support the current Ore Reserve declarations are: 
Chromite at US$271/tonne and HCFeCr at US$1,581/tonne; •	
Manganese concentrate products around US$259/tonne and iron manganese concentrate products of US$81/tonne; •	
 SSGPO iron ore at US$59/tonne for 66% concentrates, US$68/tonne for 69% concentrates, US$74/tonne for 63.5% pellets, US$92/tonne  •	
for 67% pellets, and US$377/tonne for HBI briquettes;
BML Blast Furnace product at US$47/tonne, and US$58/tonne for Direct Reduction product; •	
Alumina at US$338/tonne; and •	
EEC at US$10/tonne for domestic coal sales and US$35/tonne for export coal sales. •	
SRK has relied on ENRC and its technical representatives to ensure all technical information provided to SRK is accurate. A detailed information 
request list was submitted by SRK and ENRC provided data during January and February 2011. 
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statements are based on the following assumptions, assessments, recommendations and material 
changes:
Ferroalloys Division
Kazchrome
Donskoy GOK (Chrome ore)
In 2010 the Group produced 4.6 mt of ore. Molodezhnaya Underground Mine produced 2.5 mt and has a mine life of 14 years, producing between 
2.2 and 2.5 mtpa for the next ten years. 10th Anniversary Underground Mine produced 1.7 mt and has a mine life of 38 years, with an average  
2.5 mtpa from Phase 1. The deeper Phase 2 commences production in 2020, with production building up to around 4.4 mtpa in 2029, continuing 
to 2048. A significant portion of the Ore Reserves is dependent on successful application of new mining methods for both near surface and 
deposits at depth. Whilst studies have been carried out for these, the methods have not been trialled and will be at a higher cost than the current 
method being utilised. Due to the integrated structure of the Donskoy mines with the Aksu and Aktobe smelters, this higher mining cost will  
not negatively impact on the current Ore Reserve statement. Yuzhny open pit mined 0.3 mt in 2010 and is due to produce 2.5 mt ore between 
2013 and 2018, at a high stripping ratio. The Mineral Resource has marginally decreased in line with depletion from the 2010 production.  
The Ore Reserves for Yuzhny and Molodezhnaya have not materially changed. However, the Ore Reserves for the 10th Anniversary Mine  
have slightly increased due to a re-evaluation of the modifying factors. The investment required to sustain the current operations and to  
provide for planned expansions and improvements at the 10th Anniversary Mine and the Aktobe smelter, have been adequately allowed for.
Kazmarganets (Manganese ore)
The Ore Reserves for Tur are based on a life of mine plan ending in 2020. The current mining contract for Tur expires on 7th October 2021.  
The Vostochny Kamys Ore Reserves are based on a life of mine plan ending in 2013. The current mining contract for Vostochny Kamys expires  
on 28th June 2018. No operational changes are planned. Kazmarganets product is consumed by the Aksu smelter, and the Ore Reserves have 
therefore been stated on the basis that they are part of the integrated Kazchrome operations.
Overall comment on Kazchrome
The production levels planned for the mines, process plants and smelters, and the respective operating costs, are considered to be realistic.  
The 10th Anniversary Mine and the Aktobe smelter have substantial expansion plans and these appear to have been adequately investigated, 
planned and costed. The Ore Reserves for Donskoy and Kazmarganets are supported by the overall profitability of Kazchrome. Whilst minor 
recommendations have been made to ENRC, SRK finds all other requirements to be in place, including the mining contracts. ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2010__ 145
Zhairemsky GOK (Manganese and Iron-Manganese ores)
The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at Zhairemsky GOK have been reduced by 2.5 mt and 1.6 mt respectively as a result of mining activities 
and stockpile depletion. The majority of production has been sourced from the Ushkatyn III open pit manganese operations, with additional 
manganese ore sourced from the Ushkatyn III underground mine. A minor amount of iron ore has been sourced from existing surface stockpiles. 
There have been no material changes to the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for Zhairemsky GOK outside of mining depletion activities in 
2010. The current mining contract for Ushkatyn III expires in June 2015 and for Zhomart in June 2013. The Reserves for the Zhairem deposit are 
based on a life of mine plan to the end of 2023. SRK has declared the Reserves on the understanding that Zhairemsky GOK can extend these 
mining contracts under similar terms for periods that match their life of mine plans.
Iron Ore Division 
SSGPO (Iron ore)
In 2010 SSGPO produced 43.6 mt of iron ore at 32.0% iron, from four open pits and one underground mine. The current mining contract expires  
in May 2015. SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the assumption that SSGPO will apply for, and be granted, at least one 25 year extension  
of this contract until 2040 under similar terms and conditions. The Ore Reserves are based on an overall life of mine plan for SSGPO until 2040. 
Two new deposits (Sorksy and Shagyrkulsky) have been added to the Mineral Resource base for 31 December 2010. Currently no Ore Reserves 
are stated for these deposits, but technical studies are currently being completed for the Sorksy deposit, which could potentially support full or 
partial conversion of the Indicated Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. The Mineral Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2040.
BML (Iron ore)
The Statement is in line with the Pedra de Ferro project Bankable Feasibility Study issued in April 2010 with an effective date of December 2009.  
The Mineral Resources for Block 3 have been derived from those mineral rights licence areas that are attributable to Bamin as at December 2009, 
namely 870.830/2004 and 870.283/2005. At the planned annual production rate for the BFS of 18 mt of product, the life of mine will be 15 years, 
assuming production commences in 2013 and extends to 2027 . In addition to the Mineral Resources for Block 3, BML also has Mineral Resources 
for Blocks 1 & 4 (also referred to as ‘Jurema’) dated as at 9 January 2009. 
Alumina and Aluminium Division – AoK (Bauxite)
In 2010 the two divisions of AoK produced 5.3 mt of bauxite: 4.9 mt from nine operating open pits in three areas of KBRU and 0.4 mt from three 
operating open pits at TBRU. All mining contracts expire on 21 January 2017 , with the exception of the mining contract for Vostochno-Ayatskoye, 
which expires on 26 July 2031. SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding that AoK can extend these contracts under similar terms 
for periods that match their life of mine plans. The Ore Reserves are based on an overall life of mine plan for AoK to the end of 2045. SRK notes 
that the economic viability of TBRU is dependent on the production from KBRU.
Energy Division – EEC (Coal)
Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine produced 20 mt of coal in 2010. The current mining contract expires on 18 March 2022. The Coal Reserves are 
based on a life of mine plan up to 2046 and on the understanding that EEC can extend the contract under similar terms for a period that matches 
the life of mine plan. The Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2045. 
Other Non-ferrous Division – Boss Mining & SMKK (Copper/Cobalt ores)
SRK reviewed four of ENRC’s copper-cobalt deposits located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which ENRC acquired through its 
majority shareholding in Central African Mining and Exploration Plc (CAMEC) acquired in 2009 and through the acquisition of Société Minière  
de Kabolela et Kipese Sprl (‘SMKK’) in 2009 and 2010. The deposits reviewed and visited by SRK in February 2011 are: Kakanda North, Kakanda 
South, Mukondo Mountain and Kabolela. The projects all had mineral resource estimates issued in accordance with the SAMREC reporting  
code and prepared by international mining consultants, Coffey Mining. No Ore Reserves are stated for these deposits and current production  
is undertaken according to an internal mine plan. All Mineral Resources are presented on a 100% attributable basis.

Forward-looking statements
This Annual Report includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, ‘forward-looking statements’. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of 
forward-looking terminology, including the terms ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘plans’, ‘projects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘may’, ‘will’, or ‘should’ or, in each case, their negative 
or other variations or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans, objectives, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include 
matters that are not historical facts or are statements regarding the Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the Group’s results  
of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, and the industries in which the Group operates. Forward-looking statements are based on current 
plans, estimates and projections, and therefore too much reliance should not be placed upon them. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are 
difficult to predict and generally beyond the Group’s control. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and 
circumstances. The Group cautions you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that if risks and uncertainties materialise, or if the 
assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, the Group’s actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry  
in which the Group operates may materially differ from those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. In addition, even if  
the Group’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking 
statements contained in this Annual Report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in future periods. A number of factors could cause 
results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, general economic and business 
conditions, industry trends, competition, commodity prices, changes in regulation, currency fluctuations, changes in business strategy, political and economic uncertainty. 
Subject to the requirements of the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules or any applicable law or regulation, the Group expressly 
disclaims any obligation or undertaking publicly to review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking 
statements contained herein to reflect any changes in the Group’s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such 
statement is based. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed as a profit forecast. The forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as at the

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 03
I am pleased to report another strong performance by the Group with
record profits and increased UK market share.  We have consolidated
our position as the leading UK ceramic tile and wood flooring 
specialist, backed by what is now a truly national brand. The new
Topps Distribution and Marketing Centre is fully integrated with the
capacity to support our UK store target of a minimum of 350 stores.
The period has seen a particularly weak UK consumer environment,
however I am pleased to report the resilience of our business model
has enabled us to continue to deliver record results and to outperform
the market.  
Since flotation in 1997 total shareholder return has grown by over
2,000% and we have consistently been a top performing company in
the FTSE Index. 
Financial Results
Group turnover has increase by 10.0% over the period to £173.3 
million, with profit before tax increasing by 16.1% to £39.2 million.
Gross margins have improved to 61.3% compared to 60.5% in 2004.
2004 was an exceptional year in respect of trading and if you look at
the trend over the last two years like-for-like sales have improved
24.9%
Set against extremely strong comparatives last year and the tough UK
trading, growth in like-for-like sales for the period was 3.4%, with 
overall sales growth of 10.0%. 
Our business continues to be highly cash generative and at the year
end we had net cash balances of £21.8 million.
Board Changes
As announced at the Annual General Meeting on 11 January 2005,
Stuart Williams, my co-founder of Topps, stepped down as 
Co-Chairman and Board Director on 31 March 2005. I am delighted
however that Stuart has taken on the newly created non Board 
advisory role of President and continues to offer his expertise and
guidance to the business.
Dividend
The Board continues to be committed to a progressive dividend policy
and is recommending a final dividend of 6.00 pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend of 3.50p per share the total 
dividend for the period will be 9.50 pence per share, an increase of
18.8%. The dividend will be paid on 31 January 2006 to all shareholders
on the register as at 13 January 2006.
People
Our staff are fundamental to the success of the business and I would
like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees for their 
inspiring contributions and continued commitment during the period.
We have created another 174 jobs as a direct result of our expansion
programme.
Outlook
Although the current UK trading environment continues to be volatile,
I remain confident that the strength of our business model and the
expertise of the strong management team will enable us to continue
to grow the business and ensure the delivery of sustainable growth for
shareholders.

Our success 
is built on four 
key cornerstones:
>
>
>
>
Customer
service TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 05
1. Customer service
We continually strive to provide and maintain high levels of 
customer service and regard it as fundamental to the ongoing 
success of Topps. The quality and performance of our staff at every 
level is key and we train all our staff at our own national and 
regional training centres and through our e-learning tile training 
college. Customer service remains our number one priority and it is 
our policy to be honest, helpful and knowledgeable but never 
pushy.
We complement the advice that our staff can give in store with a 
range of services offering practical support to customers which 
include Loan-a-Tile, free “How to” video or DVD, tile cutting service 
and our buy-back service which allows undamaged stock tiles to be 
returned within 28 days for a full refund.
2. Store locations
Topps stores are purposely located in highly visible destinations, on 
or close to busy roads and always with parking facilities. Our stores 
in the main are not located on high streets or large retail parks. Our 
controlled expansion programme is taking us across the UK and a 
full list of stores can be found at the end of this report or on our 
website at www.toppstiles.co.uk.
Our stores trade seven days a week on Monday to Saturday opening
from 8.00am to 6.00pm and on Sundays either 10.00am to 4.00pm 
or 11.00am to 5.00pm, with a number of larger stores opening until
8.00pm during the week.
3. Store layout
Our average store size is just over 6,300 square feet and can 
accommodate our in-house formats including Floor Store and Stone
Works, which usually have their own individually branded section of
the store.  
All our stores have a similar layout, are clearly branded and 
designed to be customer-friendly with product and pricing clearly 
displayed on colourful and informative point-of-sale displays. The 
stores are mini-warehouse style, which is ideal to display our 
extensive product ranges as well as ensuring they are easy to 
navigate with trolleys, prams and pushchairs. 
4. Stock availability
Topps Tiles and Tile Clearing House offer a huge choice of product, 
with the best the world has to offer in wall and floor tiles, natural 
stone, laminate and real wood flooring. Our extensive in-store 
product offering is supported by on-site stock facilities. The 
combination of choice of product with the availability of stock is 
unrivaled in the UK. Our new marketing and distribution centre 
ensures that all our stores receive at least two deliveries a week to 
ensure stock levels are maintained at every store.

We always aim to provide high levels of
customer service across both our brands

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 07
This year, in a turbulent UK trading environment, we have again
demonstrated the fundamental strength of our business through the
continued delivery of improved profits.
Store Development and Expansion                                                                     
Our national store opening programme continues apace with a net 24
new stores (20 Topps and 4 Tile Clearing House) opened in this 
financial year. We now have a total of 244 trading stores (207 Topps
and 37 Tile Clearing House) and are firmly on our way to achieving our
stated target of a minimum of 350 UK outlets. We continue to enjoy a
good pipeline of suitable sites for occupation or development.
In line with our policy of continued store development and 
refurbishment, 3 stores were closed or relocated, 15 re-fitted and a net
24 new stores opened in the period. We have a total of 64 stores 
offering our tile studio concept of extra choice of up-market tiles, 
available on a special order basis and 17 floorstores with an enhanced
stock range of laminate and real wood flooring. The average square
footage of our stores has increased gradually and is now  over 6,300
square feet.
Our Stoneworks concept has continued to be popular, as consumers’
appetite for natural product grows. We now have 19 stores open with
a full Stoneworks offering and we also offer a selected range of these
products in all our other stores.
Holland
We now have a total of 13 stores trading in Holland under our 50/50
joint venture including two new stores opened in the period. It is our
intention to open a minimum two stores in the next financial period.    
Marketing, advertising and sponsorship
As part of our strategy to be “the brand” of choice in the UK we 
have again continued our nationwide marketing and advertising 
programme. Our approach is two fold: using national television 
advertising both digital and terrestrial coupled with print and radio
advertising on a regional basis. This is not only an effective strategy in
respect of maximising our reach UK wide but is also a cost effective
approach, spreading costs across each store in concentrated areas such
as central London, for example, the Carlton Weather sponsorship.

More specifically, in 2004 the UK ceramic tile market grew 12% to 77.2
million square metres, an increase of 49% compared with 2000. At
manufacturers selling prices the market was worth close to £400 
million in 2004 (source MBD).  
The UK still has a very low consumption rate compared to its European
counterparts with only 1.1% of world consumption in 2004 compared
with, for example Spain at 5.9% (Source: Ceramic World Review).
Consumption continues to increase driven by issues such as health
and hygiene, an increase in second bathrooms, shower rooms, 
conservatories and utility rooms and an increase in the use of 
underfloor heating systems.  
UK Retail sales of ceramic tiles are expected to increase by 26% by
2010 (source: MBD) and we are confident therefore of the continued
growth in the ceramic tile market.
Current trading
In the first seven weeks of the new financial period we have recorded a
like-for-like sales decrease of 4.7%, however, the two year like-for-like
sales shows an increase of 14.1%. Overall sales have increased by 1.2%
over last year and 24.8% over two years. 
We have opened stores in Hayes, Lewes and Pentonville Road already
this new financial year with our target roll-out of 24 new stores for
2005/06.
There is no doubt that we, along with the rest of the UK retail sector,
are experiencing a very tough trading environment. However, given the
strength of these results we believe we have the right business model
and the best people to continue to gain market share and we are well
placed to maintain our goal of providing sustainable returns for 
shareholders.
Nicholas Ounstead
Chief Executive Officer
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT continued
Topps Tiles is one of Britain's biggest supporters of youth 
football. Topps stores currently sponsor 225 teams nationwide and our
yellow kit is arguably the most famous in the beautiful game.
Staff Development and Customer Service
Our vision is of high-performing, motivated and well-trained people
who can make a difference to our customers, shareholders, the 
business and themselves. We live by our values of friendly, helpful and
expert advice.  
The quality of leadership in the company is key to the successful 
delivery of our strategy for growth and our commitment to training,
development and career progression is demonstrated through our 
in-house training school, incentive schemes, bonus system, share save
schemes and other incentives including the ‘Home Computing
Initiative’ and the ‘Cycle to Work’ schemes. We have recently introduced
a comprehensive employee benefits scheme which includes a whole
range of internal and external company benefits from discounts on
holidays to an employee helpline service.
We understand the true value of all our employees and actively
encourage the recruitment of staff from all age groups. We have a 
policy of internal promotion, encouraging employees to advance their
careers both in the stores and the Head Office functions.
The market
Despite a widely reported slow down in spending, we believe that in
the mid-longer term DIY retail remains a relatively stable sector. There
are a number of factors underpinning the future of the retail DIY 
market. The UK population is growing steadily, particularly in the 35-
64 key age band for DIY; and household numbers are growing faster
than the population up from 22.4 million in 1991 to 24.5 million in
2003; and owner occupancy is also on the rise and with an ageing UK
housing stock that requires constant repair and maintenance. TOPPS TILES PLC

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
This does not represent a statutory Operating and Financial Review as
set out in the Companies Act 1985 (Schedule 72A) and in RS1.
Nature, Objectives and Strategies of the business
Topps Tiles Plc is Britain's biggest tile and wood flooring specialist
group with over 244 stores throughout the UK. We have an opening
programme of 24 stores per financial year and a long term target of a
minimum of 350 stores UK wide.  
Our founders, Stuart Williams and Barry Bester, whose vision and
enterprise built up the business from just a few shops, are still major
shareholders.
Topps first specialist tile centre opened in Manchester in 1963. It was a
pioneering concept offering customers quality tiles at bargain prices,
sold by friendly, helpful people. This policy has never changed.
We operate two brands in the market, Topps Tiles and Tile Clearing
House. Topps is Britain’s biggest tile and wood flooring specialist group
with the largest choice in the UK to suit all tastes and budgets.
Tile Clearing House is a true “cash and carry” tile store selling end of
lines, job lots and seconds, appealing to small builders, local 
contractors and bulk purchasers.
Today at Topps you will find the best the world can offer in wall and
floor tiles, natural stone, laminate and solid wood flooring. Underfloor
heating, tools, adhesives, grouts, accessories and cleaning products are
also on hand for the perfect finish to any job.
Most of the tiles commissioned for Topps go straight to our central
warehouse and distribution centre near Leicester. From here, all Topps
stores receive at least two bulk deliveries a week, so stock is constantly
flowing to keep pace with demand.
The business is built on four cornerstones that underpin our success:
customer service, store locations, store layout and stock availability.
Our aim is to increase shareholder value through the delivery of 
sustainable earnings growth.
Operating Environment
Historically, the Group’s business has proven to be resilient in the face
of economic downturn. The business has traded through a number of
recessions and whilst sales continued to grow we did experience some
pressure on margins. However, the business has changed over the
years and we are confident that our current business model places us
well to continue to deliver future shareholder value.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued
Operating Environment (continued)
Topps is the market leading brand in the UK, enjoying an estimated
20% market share by value. Estimated market shares are based on
external research by MBD.
In terms of competitive positioning Topps sits between the DIY chains
and the independent tile retailers. In the UK there is one other 
significant chain, Tiles R Us but they also sell bathrooms and kitchens.
Key Performance Indicators
The directors monitor a number of financial metrics and key 
performance indicators (KPIs) for the group and by store, including:
  Like for like Sales
  Sales value per transaction
  Gross Profit
The directors receive daily information on these and other metrics and
KPIs for the Group as a whole.
In addition, the directors receive information on non financial metrics
such as customer satisfaction questionnaires and Mystery Shopper
surveys.
Key Strengths and Resources
Customer satisfaction is Topps No.1 priority. We are committed to the
highest levels of customer service, it is our policy to be honest, helpful
and knowledgeable.
In addition, we provide a range of services offering practical support at
every stage of the job including Loan-a-Tile, free 'How to' video or DVD,
tile cutting and Topps buy-back service for unused tiles.
The quality and range of products offered is the widest in the market
with over 17,000 separate product lines. 
Risks and Uncertainties
Risks to the business include its relationship with key suppliers, the
potential threat of competitors, the risk that key information 
technology or EPOS systems could fail; the loss of key personnel; the
risk of a prolonged economic recession and development of substitute
products.
The directors routinely monitor all these risks and uncertainties and
appropriate actions are taken to mitigate the risks or their potential
outcomes.
Financial review
Profit and Loss Account
Turnover
During the period Group turnover increased by 10.0% to £173.3 
million from £157.6 million last year. Like-for-like sales increased by
3.4%, with new store openings contributing a further 8.7% increase,
with the difference of 2.1% being due to the 53 week comparison in
the prior period.
Gross margin
Overall gross margin was 61.3% compared to 60.5% last year. At the
interim point of this period gross margin was 61.9%. The second half
of the period  has shown a gross margin of 60.7% which reflects the
tougher trading conditions in this period.
Operating expenses
Overall costs have increased from £62.8 million to £69.3 million which
is an increase of 10.4%. New stores accounted for 6.9% with the
remaining 3.5% due to like for like increases. Costs as a percentage of
sales were 40.0% compared to 39.9% last year. 
Profit before tax
We have achieved an overall increase in profit before tax of 16.1% to
£39.2 million compared to a profit before tax of £33.8 million last year.
This period’s profit before tax includes £1.7 million of exceptional 
profit, compared to £542,000 last year, following the sale and
leaseback of four freehold properties. 
Profit before tax margin
Group profit before tax margin has increased to 22.6% from 21.4% last
year. This increase of 1.2 percentage points has been achieved 
primarily by an increase in gross margin of 0.8 percentage points less 
a slight increase in operating costs of 0.1 percentage points with the
remainder being reflected in the exceptional profit on disposal of fixed
assets and interest receivable.
Taxation
The effective rate of Corporation Tax was 23.1% (53 weeks ended 2
October 2004: 24.1%) and we have continued to fully provide for
deferred taxation in line with FRS19. The effective rates of tax for both
financial periods have been favourably affected by statutory 
deductions for share options exercised and intra-Group restructuring
benefits.
Charts
Financial information in the charts displayed on pages 2,6,8,10,12,14,

Basic earnings per share has grown to 13.34 pence compared to 11.30
pence last year, an increase of 18.1%. Diluted earnings per share were
13.24 pence compared to 11.12 pence last year, an increase of  19.1%.
Dividend and dividend policy
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 6.00 pence per share,
which will give a total dividend for the period of 9.50 pence compared
to 8.00 pence last year an increase of 18.8%. This maintains our 
dividend cover at 1.41 times.
Balance Sheet
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the period amounted to £8.8 million. This
includes the cost of acquiring two freehold sites for £3.6 million and
development stores site costs of £0.1 million.   
We have also opened 27 new stores and undertaken preparatory work
on a further two stores at a cost of £3.0 million and undertaken major
refurbishment of a further 15 stores at a cost of £0.7 million and other
re-fit costs of £0.8 million. We continue to update and expand our IT
systems within the business and this coupled with some motor vehicle
renewals accounted for £0.6 million.
At the period end the Group owned six freehold sites, two development
sites and both the Topps and Tile Clearing House distribution and 
marketing centres, which have a total net book value of £12.0 million.
Stock
Stock at the period end represents 137 days turnover compared to 143
days for the same period last year.
Capital structure
Cash reserves at the period end were £27.8 million and borrowings
were £6.0 million, the latter being to help fund the cost of the new
Topps distribution and marketing centre which was opened in April
2004. This gives the Group a net funds position of £21.8 million 
compared to £23.1 million as at 2 October 2004.
The highly cash generative nature of our business means that the
Group has always been able to fund its new store expansion 
programme from its own resources and to purchase freehold sites as
suitable opportunities arise.
The Group expects that the business will continue to be cash 
generative and may look to repay part or all of the £6.0 million 
borrowings in 2006.
Cash flow
Net cash inflow from operating activities was £35.8 million, £2 million
below last year. Higher trading profit for the Group was offset by 
higher cash outflows on working capital. This is due primarily to a
decrease in Creditors as the Group now pays its employee bonuses on
a quarterly basis rather than on an annual basis.
Share buy-backs
In the financial period the Group has bought back 1,722,115 Ordinary
Shares at a cost of £3.77 million. This primarily is to stop any dilution
occurring as employee share options are exercised and sold. However
the Group has also, on occasion, acquired shares when the Board 
considers there is an opportunity to do so in the market. All of the
shares acquired have now been cancelled.
Joint venture in Holland
The joint venture in Holland continues to develop with two new stores
opened in the period to bring the total to 13 stores. The Group owns
50% in the joint venture with the other 50% owned by the Dutch 
management team. The Group’s Profit and Loss Account shows
turnover of £2.3 million (2004 : £1.8 million) and operating profit
before tax of £56,000 (2004 : £39,000) from the venture which reflects
the Group’s 50% holding.
Change in accounting policies
During the financial period there have been no changes to the
accounting policies of a material nature compared to the 
previous financial period.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Group is working closely with its auditors to implement these
changes. The Group is required to adopt IFRS for the financial period
commencing 2 October 2005. However, the Group intends to make an
announcement in January 2006 to show the impact of the changes.
Post balance sheet events
The Board confirms that there have been no events after the Balance
sheet date requiring adjustment or disclosure in the financial state-
ments for the period ended 1 October 2005.

Introduction
Corporate Social Responsibility is not new to Topps Tiles. We know that
a reputation for acting responsibly helps build our business through
customer recommendation.  
This is why we pride ourselves on our commitment to product quality,
customer service excellence, good environmental management and to
making a positive contribution to the communities where we do 
business.  
In 2004, we set up a social and environmental responsibility working
group chaired by a Board director. The purpose of this group was to
review how we were doing and to look for opportunities for 
improvement. Much has been achieved. For example, we have set up a
new way of including corporate social responsibility as part of our risk
assessment.  
Our Website demonstrates progress we have made on Corporate Social
Responsibility an extension of the way we have done and will continue
to do our business. In it we describe our approach towards:
  Community relations   
  Environment
  Workplace
  Supply Chain
Our Approach 
Andrew Liggett, the Finance Director for Topps Tiles Plc is the Chairman
and the Board director responsible for the Social and Environmental
policy.
Topps has established a social and environmental responsibility 
working group to further our consideration of corporate responsibility
issues generally, but with a specific focus on environmental 
management. The members of the working group are the Group
Finance Director, the Head of Human Resources, the Buying Director
and the Internal Audit Manager. We are supported in these initial
stages of establishing our environmental management systems by the
use of a specialist environmental consultancy. 
Together, the members of the working group are accountable for 
developing and improving our environmental management practice.
Each member of the working group is responsible for implementing
those elements of the environmental policy relevant to their functions.
Topps Tiles believe that environmental responsibility should be an 
integral part of how we manage our business. This is why we have
established such a senior working group to oversee our progress in 
this area.
Community relations
Topps is one of the biggest supporters of youth football in the UK, 
providing new kits and equipment to junior teams local to our stores.
We have a policy of building local brand awareness of Topps Tiles and
Tile Clearing House through involvement with young people.
Probably our most well-known community project is our youth sports
sponsorship, providing new kits and equipment to juniors in each
town where we have an outlet. This has made Topps one of the biggest
supporters of youth football in Britain and we now have over 225
teams playing regularly in our colours.

CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) continued
We also take great pride in our fund raising achievements for our
adopted charity Asthma UK. This is our fifth year of support for the
charity which aims to conquer this respiratory disorder which affects
over one million children in the UK. Asthma UK was the natural choice
of charity for Topps to adopt, as our products help to reduce the levels
of house dust mites which are one of the triggers of asthma attacks.
Our staff contributed greatly to the fundraising by holding sponsored
events and in total with our Company donation of £10,000 we raised
over £75,000 for this worthy cause.
As well as sport there is also education, where via our product
catalogue schools can win valuable computer equipment. Since the
scheme started, over 20 schools have benefited nationwide.
Environment
Respect for the environment is an accepted part of modern day 
business management.
At Topps, we recognise that our day-to-day activities impact on the
environment and aim to minimise the harmful effects whenever we
can. This year, we began a company-wide programme to improve our
environmental performance, to review our policies, to put in place
management systems to monitor and measure our performance and
to set targets for improvement.
Much has been achieved but there is more to do. We have:
  assigned board responsibility for environmental management
  established our approach to environmental management
  updated our environmental policy
  identified our most important environmental impacts
  put in place systems to collect data to measure our performance 
and set targets for improvement.
Market place
The Group works closely with key suppliers to source and distribute
products that contribute positively to environmental performance.
The Group has developed an environmental policy on timber products
and has adopted the principles and criteria of the Forest Stewardship
Council as its benchmark.
Workplace
Topps’ businesses comply with current employment legislation and
work with employees and local management of each branch to create
a positive and equitable working environment.
There is a strong culture of internal promotion and regular dialogue on
job and career development.
Topps is committed to promoting equal opportunities for all, and we
believe that we have the right policies in place to meet this objective.
The Group also operates an employee suggestion scheme which is
overseen by the Chairman, Barry Bester, which allows all employees to
give suggestions which can help improve the business whether it be
operational, environmental or social.
An in-house magazine is produced six times a year and sent to all
employees as a further way of keeping everybody informed of the
developments within the business.
Health and safety
The Group has a well documented and clear policy that is 
implemented rigorously throughout the business. We operate a 
Health and Safety Committee which meets on a regular basis and it’s 
members are representative of all areas of the business and is chaired
by our Chief Executive.
Supply Chain
Topps Tiles purchases around £70m of goods each year. The majority of
our purchases are ceramic tiles and we also purchase stone, wood and
laminate and adhesives. We source our products from around the
World.    
Labour Standards and Environmental Responsibility are issues of 
growing importance. Topps Tiles has reviewed how it considers these
issues with regard to its supplier relationships and has adopted:
  A policy on Labour Standards and Human Rights
  A standard clause on environmental protection which will be 
introduced into all new contracts and existing contacts on renewal.
Our buyers also have a regular programme to visit our suppliers, to 
discuss these issues.  
Our full policy and established targets can be viewed on our website at
www.toppstiles.co.uk and can be found in the Investors section under
Corporate Responsibility. EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

Executive’s and Financial reviews on pages 3 to 15 of the report and financial statements.

An interim dividend of 3.50 pence per share, £7,983,000, was paid on 30 June 2005.                                   
The directors recommend a final dividend of 6.00 pence per share, £13,576,000, making a total of 9.5 pence per share, £21,559,000 (2004 – total
dividend 8.00p per share, £18,195,000). Subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 10 January 2006,

directors’ interests in the shares of the Company are set out on page 35.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s authorised and issued share capital are shown in note 19  to the financial statements.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each transaction, ensuring that suppliers are made
aware of the terms of payment and that both parties abide by those terms.
The effect of the Group’s negotiated payment policy is that trade creditors at the period end represented 44 days purchases (2004 - 49 days).  Charitable and political contributions
During the period the Group made charitable donations of £10,000 to the ‘Tsunami Appeal’ and £10,000 to Asthma UK. The Group made no 
political contributions.
Substantial shareholdings
In addition to the directors’ shareholdings noted on page 35, on 3 November 2005 the Company had been notified, in accordance with Sections
198 to 208 of the Companies Act 1985, of the following interests in 3% or more of its issued share capital.
Number % held
HSBC Global Custody Nominee (UK) Limited 39,977,000 17.7%

Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the
event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and that
appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as
far as possible, be identical with that of other employees.
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed on matters affecting them
as employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved through formal and informal meetings and the
Company magazine. Employee representatives are consulted regularly on a wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests.
Share option schemes
The directors recognise the importance of motivating employees and believe that one of the most effective incentives is increased employee
participation in the Company through share ownership.
This has been achieved through the introduction of a number of employee sharesave, share bonus, approved and unapproved share option
schemes, since the flotation in 1997.
The total of options held by employees, excluding directors, is 1,858,455. The directors will continue to incentivise employees through additional
employee share option schemes in the forthcoming financial period.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT continued
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of the financial period and of the profit of the Group for that period. In preparing
those Financial Statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group accounts.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
On behalf of the Board
A Liggett
Director and Company Secretary
29 November 2005 In June 1998 the Hampel Committee and the London Stock Exchange published the Combined Code on corporate governance. This combines the
Cadbury Code on corporate governance, the Greenbury Code on directors’ remuneration and new requirements arising from the findings of the
Hampel Committee.
Statement of compliance with the Code of Best Practice
The Company has complied throughout the period with the Provisions of the Code of Best Practice set out in section 1 of the Combined Code
except for the provisions of A6.1. In this regard to A6.1 the Board does not currently undertake formal appraisal of its own performance and 
that of its committees but is currently in the process of completing such an appraisal. The Board considers this non-compliance with the
Combined Code to be justified in view of the size of the Group and in this respect supports the recommendations of the City Group for smaller
companies. The Company complies with all other provisions of the code.
Code Provision D.3.1 requires the members of the audit committee to be named in the report and financial statements. Mr. W.A. McIntosh
(Chairman), Mr. V.H. Watson and Mr. J.M. Jack have served on the committee throughout the period.

Practice as reported above. Further explanation of how the Principles have been applied in connection with directors’ remuneration is set out in
the Remuneration Report.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Alan McIntosh and is authorised by the Board to liaise with the external auditors on the nature and scope of
the audits, review the Audit Report and it’s findings and to ensure the Company’s internal control systems are adequate via liaison with the
Internal Audit department.

Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Victor Watson CBE and is authorised by the Board to maintain an ongoing review with the purpose of
making recommendations for Board appointments.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional shareholders by making annual
presentations and communicating regularly throughout the year. The Company also posts financial information on its website
www.toppstiles.co.uk.
Maintenance of a sound system of internal control
The Board has applied Principle D.2 of the Combined Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks the Group faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which has been put in place from the start of the period to the date of
the approval of this report and which is in accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code published in
September 1999. The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with Provision D.2.1 of the Combined Code, the Board continuously reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. It is based
principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and
whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed a
specific assessment for the purposes of this annual report. This assessment considers all significant aspects of internal control arising during the
period covered by the report including the work of internal audit. The audit committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS continued REMUNERATION REPORT
TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 31
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory 
requirements for the disclosure of directors’ remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002. The report also meets the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good
Governance relating to directors’ remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company’s members on the “auditable part” of the Directors’ remuneration report and to
state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by
the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the committee are Mr. McIntosh, Mr. Watson and The RT. Hon. Mr. Jack who are all independent non-executive directors, with the
committee chaired by Mr. McIntosh.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or
day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays a part in any 
discussion about his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the
Group’s position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the executive
directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the
Committee. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management:
  basic annual salary (including directors’ fees) and benefits;
  long-term incentive plan;
  annual bonus payments;
  pension arrangements. REMUNERATION REPORT continued
TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 32
Basic salary
An executive director’s basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position
or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives 
up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies. Basic salaries were reviewed in September 2005 with increases taking effect from 
1 October 2005. Executive director’s contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual
General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car and private medical insurance.
Long-term incentive Plan (L–TIP)
The Topps Tiles Plc 2003 Executive L–TIP is a three year plan which is due to mature at the financial period ending 30 September 2006. The L–TIP
is a cash based plan with performance targets based on the Group profitability over the three year period. It is discretionary and will be operated
by the Board acting through the Remuneration Committee. The maximum total amount potentially payable to participants under the plan if 
performance criteria are met is £4,000,000. N.D. Ounstead and A. Liggett each have been granted a 25% interest in the L–TIP .
The payment of the individual awards under the scheme is dependent on the participant remaining in employment with the Group and the
Group achieving a cumulative total of at least £80,000,000 pre-tax profits (before any accrual for the L–TIP) over the three year period and the
diluted earnings per share as shown in the Group’s annual accounts must increase by an average of 15% per annum (compounded annually) over
the same period. In the event of a take-over, reconstruction or winding up of the Group, a proportion of awards will vest having regard to the
number of months of the performance period that have elapsed and any other relevant factors. 
Annual bonus payments
A discretionary annual cash bonus scheme represents the short term incentive element of the overall remuneration package for Mr. Liggett and
Mr. Ounstead. The committee establishes the objectives that must be met in the financial period if a cash bonus is to be paid. The maximum
bonus achievable in the period was £nil and for the period ending 30 September 2006 will be a total of £520,000 which is 100% of basic salaries.  
Pension arrangements
Mr. Bester, Mr. Ounstead and Mr. Liggett received contributions into their own personal pension schemes.
Directors’ contracts
Executive directors
It is the company’s policy that executive directors enter into a contract with a 12 month term providing for a maximum of six months notice.
Mr. Bester, Mr. Ounstead and Mr. Liggett have entered into new service contracts on 1 October 2005 in accordance with the above policy.
In the event of early termination, the directors’ contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of six months basic salary for the notice
period. Directors’ contracts (continued)
Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the

Alan McIntosh
Chairman of Remuneration Committee
29 November 2005 To the members of Topps Tiles Plc
We have audited the financial statements of Topps Tiles Plc for the 52 week period ended 1 October 2005 which comprise the consolidated profit
and loss account, the statement of total recognised gains and losses, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related
notes 1 to 23. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the part of the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.  Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are also responsible for the preparation of the
other information contained in the annual report, including the directors’ remuneration report. Our responsibility is to audit the financial 
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom
legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part
of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company's compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above period as described in the contents section,
including the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report, and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.

remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the 
Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described
as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited.

TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 41
1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the period and the preceding 
period:
a) Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable  United Kingdom 
accounting standards.
b) Basis of consolidation
The statutory Group profit and loss account and balance sheet consolidate the financial statements of Topps Tiles Plc and its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 1 October 2005. The financial statements of Topalpha Limited have been consolidated using merger accounting 
principles. In all other cases, subsidiary undertakings have been accounted for using acquisition accounting principles and incorporate the 
results of the Group’s joint venture undertaking. The Group accounts for its own share of assets, liabilities and cash flows associated with this 
joint venture.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed. No profit and loss 
account is presented for Topps Tiles Plc, as permitted by S230 of the Companies Act 1985. The Company’s profit after tax for the period, 
determined in accordance with the Act, was £38,738,000 (2 October 2004 - £36,035,000).
c) Financial period
The accounting period ends on the Saturday which falls closest to 30 September, resulting in financial periods of either 52 or 53 weeks.
d) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration 
given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its useful 
economic life, which is twenty years. Provision is made for any impairment.
Goodwill of £ 15,080,000 arising on acquisitions in the period ended 30 May 1998  was written off to reserves in accordance with the 
accounting standard then in force. As permitted by the current accounting standard the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not
been reinstated on the balance sheet. On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously 
written off to reserves is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
e) Turnover
Turnover comprises the net amount receivable in respect of retail sales less goods returned during the period from third parties and excludes
value added tax.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the 52 week period ended 1 October 2005
TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 42
1 Accounting policies (continued)
f) Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.  Costs are only those costs that are directly 
attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of tangible 
assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Freehold buildings - 2% per annum on cost on a straight-line basis
Short leasehold land and buildings - over the period of the lease, up to 25 years
Fixtures and fittings - over 10 years or at 25% per annum on reducing balance basis as appropriate
Motor vehicles - 25% per annum on reducing balance
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition. 
g) Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes materials and an attributable proportion of distribution 
overheads based on normal levels of activity. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal.
h) Taxation
UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group's taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised
in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured 
on a non-discounted basis.
i) Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract
rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss 
in the profit and loss account.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations 
are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss 
account. TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 43
1 Accounting policies (continued)
k) Leases
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned 
assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives. The capital 
elements of future obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the 
period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are 
dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.  
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, 
except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate is shorter than 
the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used.
l) Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
m) Pension costs
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions 
payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or 
prepayments in the balance sheet.
n) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.  The Group does not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or
liabilities or to a probable commitment. It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce 
the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Group’s operations. Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and 
recognised in the profit and loss account, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Group’s financial statements.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example, because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument
is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
o) Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.  
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets. 
The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditures for the asset are being incurred and activities that
are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to 
get the asset ready for use are complete. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the 52 week period ended 1 October 2005

17 Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group holds financial instruments to finance its operations, and to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from its operations.
Consequently the main risks arising from the Group’s operations are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain continuity of funding through the use of retained profits and medium to long-term borrowings. The 
maturity profiles of the Group’s borrowings are detailed in section (c) of this note.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s objective is to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations whilst trying to minimise the cost of capital of the Group.  
Currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures which arise from purchases by subsidiary undertakings in currencies other than the 
functional currency of the Group. The Group’s policy is to periodically use forward contracts to hedge those transactions to eliminate any 
significant currency exposure. The frequency and amount hedged is decided by the Board and depends upon the magnitude of the 
exposure and volatility of the currency involved.
a) Interest rate profile
The currency profile of the Group’s financial assets is as follows:
Group
1 October 2 October
2005 2004
£’000 £’000
Sterling 27,940 29,719
Euro 164 (33)
Dollar (275) (62)
27,829 29,624
Financial assets (liabilities) comprise short term cash deposits with major United Kingdom clearing banks (with associated right of off-set) 
and deposits placed on money markets at call. The financial assets (liabilities) earn floating rates of interest based upon bank base rates. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the 52 week period ended 1 October 2005
TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 54
17 Derivatives and other financial instruments (continued)
The interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities is as follows:
Floating rate
1 October 2005 2 October 2004
£’000 % £’000 %
Sterling – Borrowings
Loan 1 – 1.00 517 1.00
Loan 2 6,000 0.75 6,000 0.75
Total 6,000 6,517
The interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities indicates the excess over bank base rate.
Loan 2 has an offset facility whereby if the cash deposit is equivalent to the loan value the Company only pays 0.75% on loan value.
b) Currency exposures
The amounts shown in the table below show the effect of forward contracts entered into to manage foreign currency exposure as at
2 October 2004 and 1 October 2005.

(e)  the Company may make a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares under this authority before the expiry of this authority which 
would or might require to be executed wholly or partly after the expiry of such authority, and may make purchases of Ordinary Shares in 
pursuance of such a contract as if such authority had not expired. Notes
1 This notice has been sent to all Ordinary Shareholders who are entitled to attend or be represented at the meeting.
2 A member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting may appoint a proxy or proxies to attend on a poll vote and, on a poll, vote on his or her 
behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.  To be valid, a Form of Proxy and any power or authority under which it is signed, must be lodged with 
the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars (Proxies), PO Box 25, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4BR, no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of 
the Annual General Meeting.
3 A proxy is not entitled to speak at the meeting except to demand a poll, and may vote only when a poll is taken.
4 A Form of Proxy is enclosed and instructions for use are shown on the form. The fact that shareholders may have completed forms of proxy will not prevent
them from attending and voting in person should they afterwards decide to do so.
5 As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertified Securities Regulations 2001, only those shareholders who are registered on the Company’s share register at
8.00am on 9 January 2006 (or if the meeting is adjourned, shareholders entered on the Company’s register of members not later than 48 hours before the time 
fixed for the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend the Annual General Meeting and to vote in respect of the number of shares registered in their 
names at that time. Changes to entries on the share register after 8.00am on 9 January 2006 (or, if the meeting is adjourned after 48 hours before the time 
fixed for the adjourned meeting) shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and/or vote at the Annual General Meeting.
6 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting 
and any adjournment(s) thereof by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and 
those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take
the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST”Proxy Instruction”) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. 
The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID : RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the 
notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any 
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in
CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting 
service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting 
service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.  
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 
2001.          
7 The following documents are available for inspection by members at the registered office of the Company (except Bank Holidays) during the normal business 
hours and at the place of the meeting but not less than 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
(a) the register of Directors’ interests required to be kept under Section 325 of the Act; and
(b) copies of the Directors’ service contracts.

TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 64
THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING of the Company will be held at the Company’s premises at Thorpe Way, Grove Park, Enderby, Leicestershire LE19
1SU on 10 January 2006 at 10.30a.m.
Three of the resolutions are to be taken at this year’s Annual General Meeting as special business. By way of explanation of these and certain
other resolutions:
Ordinary Business
Resolution 2
Final dividend
A final dividend of 6.00 pence per Ordinary Share is recommended by the Directors for payment to shareholders on the register of members of
the Company at the close of business on 13 January 2006. Subject to approval by the Ordinary Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, the
dividend will be paid on 31 January 2006. An interim dividend of 3.50 pence per Ordinary Share was paid on 30 June 2005. This gives a total 
dividend level of 9.50 pence per Ordinary Share for the 52 week period to 1 October 2005.
Resolutions 3, 4, 5 and 6 
Re-election of directors
B. Bester, A. Liggett, M. Jack and V.H. Watson are the Directors retiring by rotation this year and they offer themselves for re-election. All members
of the Board of Directors submit themselves for re-election at least every three years with the exception of VH Watson who at the age of 77
retires and offers himself for re-election annually. Brief biographical details about the Directors standing for re-election appear on pages 20 and
21 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. Special notice of the Intention to propose the resolution to re-elect Victor Watson has been
duly given as required by sections 379 and 293(5) of the Companies Act 1985.
Special Business
Resolutions 9 and 10
Appointment of authority to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory rights of pre-emption
Resolution 9: The right of the Directors to allot further shares in the capital of the Company requires in most cases the prior authorisation of the
shareholders in general meeting under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”), Resolution 9 will be put to members as special
business to authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of £1,885,303 out of the Company’s unissued share capital 
representing approximately 33.3% of the Company’s current issued share capital (excluding shares held in treasury). The Company currently holds
Nil Ordinary Shares in treasury.
The Directors have no current intention of exercising the authority to allot further shares. The authority shall expire immediately following the
Annual General Meeting next following the resolution or, if earlier, 15 months following the resolution being passed. Special Business (continued)
Resolution 10: This proposed resolution seeks to obtain power under Section 95 of the Act to enable the Directors to allot, for cash, shares with
an aggregate nominal value of £282,795 equal to approximately 5% of the Company’s current issued share capital without being required first to
offer such securities to existing shareholders. The Company will thereby be given greater flexibility when considering future opportunities but
the interests of existing shareholders will be protected as, except in the case of a rights issue or the allotment of shares under the Company’s
share option schemes, the Directors have no present intention to allot any part of the unissued share capital of the Company or, without the
prior approval of the Company in general meeting, to make any issue which would effectively alter the control of the Company or the nature of
its business. This authority will expire immediately following the Annual General Meeting next following the resolution or, if earlier, 15 months
following the resolution being passed.
Resolution 11
Authority to purchase Ordinary Shares
At the Annual General Meeting, Ordinary Shareholders are being invited under Resolution 11 to grant authority to the Company to make market
purchases of its Ordinary Shares. It is proposed such authority shall expire on the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2007 or
twelve months from the date of this resolution, if earlier.
This authority will be limited to the purchase of not more than 14.9% of the Ordinary Shares currently in issue. This represents the maximum
amount of Ordinary Share capital in issue which is permitted before tender or partial offer to all shareholders is require to be made to perform
any share buy-back. The maximum price payable under this authority will be 105% of the average of the middle market quotations of an Ordinary
Share for the five business days before the relevant purchase and the minimum price will be 2.5p per Ordinary Share.
In considering whether or not to purchase Ordinary Shares under the market purchase authority, the Directors will take into account cash
resources, the effect on gearing and other investment opportunities before exercising the authority. In addition, the Company will only exercise
the authority to make such a purchase in the market when the Directors consider it is in the best interests of the shareholders generally to do so
and it should result in an increase in Earnings per Ordinary Share. The Directors’ current intention is that the authority sought by Resolution 11
shall be utilised in respect of employee share options as they are exercised. 
As at 29 November 2005, there were options to subscribe for 1,858,455 equity shares outstanding under various schemes representing 
approximately 0.82% of the current issued share capital of the Company. If the authority sought by Resolution 11 was exercised in full, the 
number of outstanding options would represent approximately 0.97% of the issued share capital following the repurchase of shares.

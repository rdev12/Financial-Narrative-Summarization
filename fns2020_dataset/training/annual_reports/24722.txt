HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Overview
The global economic recovery that started in 2009 continued in 
2010. Gross World Product rose by 5%, well above the long-run 
average of 3.3%. However, 70% of this growth was accounted for 
by emerging markets. In most developed economies, conditions 
remained sluggish and unemployment high. Investors were more 
than once unnerved by the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, fearing 
that it would result in new strains on the banking system. Reﬂecting 
these concerns, as well as signs of slower growth in China, equities 
fell sharply in May and then languished for a while. The turning point 
for markets came in September when the US Federal Reserve 
announced a second round of quantitative easing. This, together 
with good corporate news, revived investors’ appetite for risk, so 
equities ﬁnished with solid gains for the year. When the quantitative 
easing policy was implemented in November, commodity prices 
rose sharply, boosting inﬂation in developed and emerging 
economies and making some central banks respond with 
tighter policy.
The overall rise in equity markets was good for Henderson’s 
business. With the success of the New Star acquisition and higher 
transaction and performance fees, the Group’s underlying proﬁt 
rose by 37%. 
Dividends
The Board has adopted a progressive dividend policy and, in 
keeping with this, is recommending a ﬁnal dividend for 2010 
of 4.65 pence per share, bringing the total dividend for 2010 
to 6.5 pence per share, 7% higher than the 2009 total dividend. 
The proposed ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 27 May 201 1 
to shareholders who are on the register on 6 May 201 1. 
As previously announced, we intend the interim dividend 
to be 30% of the total dividend for the previous year.
The Board
There were no changes to the Board’s membership last year. In 
accordance with the new UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
by the FRC in June 2010, from now on Directors will offer 
themselves for reappointment every year.

Corporate activity
The main strategy for the Group is proﬁtable organic growth. 
That said, and as we have shown in the past, we keep an eye on 
acquisition opportunities that ﬁll gaps in our product range and/or 
improve our distribution. Any acquisition possibility will be judged 
against strict ﬁnancial criteria, and also by its cultural ﬁt. We have 
a distinctive culture which (as evidenced by our low staff turnover) 
works for our staff and, through them, for our clients. In 2010, we 
reviewed a number of opportunities including RidgeWorth, a US- 
based company, but we decided not to pursue it. In January 201 1, 
we announced the proposed acquisition of Gartmore. It should 
reinforce our position as a diversiﬁed asset manager with much to 
offer in traditional long-only and absolute return funds, and it will 
signiﬁcantly strengthen our presence among UK retail investors. 
Shareholders are being asked to vote on this acquisition in March; 
your Board unanimously recommends that you vote in favour.
Outlook
Although concerns about sovereign debt are likely to continue, 
the global economy looks set for reasonable growth. Even though 
the UK recovery will test the nerves, we are well placed to provide a 
good service for our clients and decent results for our shareholders.
Thank you
The Board would like to thank our staff for their skill and hard work 
last year. Thanks also to our shareholders for your support for 
Henderson; we do not take it for granted.

Review of 2010
The year was characterised by recovery in the global economy, 
although the effects of the global ﬁnancial crisis continued to 
be felt. Market conditions improved and equity markets were on 
average 20% higher in 2010 compared to 2009, but there were 
notable episodes of volatility and uncertainty. As can be seen in 
the chart below, there were a number of economic, political and 
environmental events each of which troubled markets for a period 
of time. 
Following the recapitalisation of banks in 2009, the realisation 
came in 2010 that risk and liabilities had simply changed hands 
from the private to the public sector. As a consequence, the 
governance of the Eurozone came into question as signiﬁcant 
current account deﬁcits had been run up by countries such as 
Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The Greek debt crisis was 
followed by the near-insolvency of the Irish banking system and 
bailout packages reached a staggering EUR200bn. It now seems 
that, in order for the Eurozone to prosper, the rules governing the 
Eurozone will need to be rewritten.
In Asia, China overtook Japan to become the second largest 
economy in the world. Halfway through the year, in order to reduce 
the risk of importing inﬂation, it decided to de-peg its currency 
from the US dollar. In the US, on the other hand, with a fall in the 
popularity of President Obama and a faltering economic recovery, 
the Federal Reserve embarked on a second wave of quantitative 
easing. In the UK, markets broadly welcomed the spending cuts 
agreed by the Coalition Government following the General Election 
in May. Gilt yields remain low by historical standards, but household 
disposable incomes are under severe pressure from tax increases 
and rising prices.

The market outlook for 2011
Looking at 201 1, world trade and industrial output continue 
to recover, despite continuing concerns over rising inﬂation, 
the sovereign debt crises and the instability of banking systems. 
Strong demand from fast-growing developing countries has led 
to increased sales and improved proﬁtability of manufacturing 
companies around the globe. Our central tenet is that this theme 
is set to continue with industrial stocks poised to deliver good 
returns to shareholders whereas consumer-facing stocks in 
Western markets are likely to disappoint. 
From a regional perspective, the turmoil in sovereign debt markets 
held back European equities in 2010 and we believe valuations of 
these equities have the potential to improve in 201 1 as investor 
interest returns. 
We expect Asian companies could grow earnings by a further 
15% in 201 1. In addition, the region has a young demographic 
proﬁle and relatively strong ﬁscal background, which contrast with 
those of the West. The monetary expansion in the US is feeding 
through to commodity prices and asset prices in Asia. The danger 
is that inﬂation accelerates, requiring a strong reaction by central 
banks, although early moves by Australian, Chinese and Indian 
authorities to tighten monetary policy have been encouraging. 
When it comes to continued economic support, US policymakers 
have been more accommodating than most. The Federal Reserve 
has persisted with stimulus measures aimed at fuelling growth 
long after other countries adopted more hard-line austerity 
measures. The signs are coming through, however, that the 
economy is beginning to respond and US companies have shown 
impressive proﬁt growth. However, investor sentiment is weighed 
down by the high unemployment rate and weak housing market. 
This dichotomy between strong corporate earnings growth and 
a slow US economy is likely to continue in 201 1.
In bond markets, the days of signiﬁcant capital appreciation 
for bond funds are gone and the year ahead will likely focus 
on capital preservation whilst generating a consistent level of 
income. Given uncertainty over how the sovereign debt crisis 
will play out, and its impact on the banking and corporate 
sectors, identifying clear sector themes and combining them with 
company fundamental analysis will be the key to exploiting these 
challenging conditions. The ability to adjust to the ever-changing 
environment will be critical. In an environment where a sustained 
period of rising yields could be detrimental to overall bond market 
returns (should interest rates rise), the ability to utilise a broad 
range of investment instruments could prove invaluable in helping 
to preserve capital.
In the UK and Europe we believe the weight of money chasing 
a limited supply of prime property assets is likely to overheat 
this sub-sector of the market whilst Asian growth markets, such 
as China and Singapore, will continue to look attractive. In the US, 
we expect property markets to continue making a steady recovery.
Regulatory changes
Of the many regulatory developments there have been, 
one of the most prominent for our business is the UK Retail 
Distribution Review, originally launched in 2006, which aims 
to promote a resilient, effective and attractive retail investment 
market. Whilst there are aspects of these rules still to be 
ﬁnalised, we are working to get our business prepared for 
its expected implementation in 2013. Another important 
development has been the Alternative Investment Fund 
Managers Directive. The purpose of this Directive has been to 
provide more transparency and additional regulatory oversight 
of the alternative funds industry and has been in development 
for several years. At this stage, we do not expect this Directive 
to have a signiﬁcant impact on our business. However, much of 
the practical ‘rule making’ that stems from this Directive has yet 
to be promulgated. We observe developments with interest and 
participate where we can to inﬂuence the outcome for fair 
markets for the beneﬁt of investors. 
The FSA has also been reviewing the remuneration practices 
of ﬁnancial services ﬁrms in the UK and published its revised 
Remuneration Code in December 2010.  Our remuneration 
structures are consistent with the revised Code.  
The outlook for the Group
Keeping our clients’ needs at the centre of everything we do will 
drive our success. Joined-up thinking across product development, 
fund management, sales and client service, should ensure that 
we provide clients with more valuable investment products. We 
continue our efforts in making this business more efﬁcient and 
more proﬁtable and ultimately, increasing the value of our franchise. 
In so doing, we will deliver good returns to our shareholders. 
By combining organic growth with being alert to opportunities to 
accelerate our strategic goals, the overriding focus remains our 
clients and ensuring that we have the capabilities required to help 
them achieve their investment objectives. 
We are optimistic about the outlook for markets. We are well 
positioned to grow our existing product range and develop new 
products to distribute through all the channels in all the 
geographies in which we operate.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

 Good investment performance continued
 Reviewed and enhanced fund range with  
a focus on ﬁnding solutions for clients
 Extended relationships with clients 
and consultants globally
Given the diversity of our business, in terms of client, geography 
and product, we were well placed to navigate through the 
uncertain and volatile market environment during 2010. 

Investment performance in our key funds and products 
continued to be good (as discussed on page 12) and our 
investment management and distribution teams had minimal 
turnover, underscoring the commitment of our key employees 
to the further success of our business. 
Relationships with clients and institutional consultants across 
the globe continued to strengthen and in 2010 we sourced new 
business from nearly a dozen different investment consultants 
globally. We expanded our distribution capabilities into new 
regions, such as the Nordics and South America, and improved 
our distribution capabilities in China and Japan by developing 
regional distribution agreements with local ﬁnancial institutions. 
The core markets for us remain in the UK and Continental Europe, 
supported by an increasing presence in both the US and Asia. 
In the UK, the successful integration of New Star and our improved 
brand awareness have contributed signiﬁcantly to the growth 
potential of our UK Retail business. We had positive net ﬂows into 
a broad range of funds including Strategic Bond, our multi-manager 
fund range, European Special Situations and Credit Alpha, a UCITS 
III enabled fund. The Strategic Bond Fund enjoyed great success 
in 2010, both in terms of fund performance and ﬂows, and is fast 
approaching £1bn in assets. We are also pleased with the success 
we have achieved in launching the European Special Situations 
Fund. Launched in the fourth quarter of 2009, it has since grown 
to over £0.3bn. 
It was a good year for inﬂows into our specialist funds in Continental 
Europe such as our Global Technology Fund and Global Property 
Equities Fund. Our pan-European funds also saw strong inﬂows, 
especially our pan-European Equity Fund which has consistently 
delivered top quartile performance over three and ﬁve years. 
Our European Smaller Companies Fund had excellent investment 
performance and good net inﬂows. We launched the Horizon 
European Corporate Bond Fund at the end of 2009 and 
performance has been very strong, as a result of which 
we are seeing increased interest in this area.
The biggest disappointment in our US Retail business has been 
the investment performance of the International Opportunities 
Fund, one of our ﬂagship funds. Although the ﬁve year performance 
of this fund remains top quartile, the one and three year numbers 
have been poor resulting in some redemptions from the fund. 
On the other hand, the Global Equity Income Fund, which now 
has a four year track record, had good inﬂows during the year and 
is approaching USD1bn. We also launched two new funds towards 
the end of the year, providing further diversiﬁcation to our US 
Wholesale product suite. Our US institutional business is going 
from strength to strength, achieving a near record year in gross 
sales and crossing the USD2bn mark in AUM sourced from this 
market at 31 December 2010.

PERFORMANCE 
IN KEY FUNDS

traditional and innovative products to 
meet our clients’ needs
Interest rates and bond yields at historically low 
levels were leading to increased investor interest in the 
income-generating capacity of equities. Henderson noticed that 
UK investors were becoming increasingly comfortable investing 
outside of the UK but that most non-UK equity vehicles were 
focused solely on capital growth. There appeared to be a gap in 
the market, therefore, for equity products offering income drawn 
from non-UK equities. Not only was there appetite from 
investors for this type of product but there were attractive 
diversiﬁcation beneﬁts from being able to invest on a global 
basis. A global equity income vehicle would enjoy greater choice 
in terms of high yielding sectors and should help to reduce the 
potential risk from an individual country underperforming.
In early 2010, therefore, we considered launching a global 
equity income fund. We had inherited a global equity fund from 
our acquisition of New Star. This fund had a weak long-term 
track record and we believed that we could offer a stronger 
performance proposition to investors by converting this fund 
to a global equity income vehicle. 
Investors in the fund approved the change in mandate in June 
2010, and we relaunched the fund as the Henderson Global 
Dividend Income Fund, complete with new managers who 
had a strong reputation in managing equity income products. 
Its new mandate to deliver an attractive income with the 
potential for capital gain recognises the need for income 
producing investments whilst also providing access to fast-
growing markets. The Henderson Global Dividend Fund is in 
step with an increasingly globalised world and adds to our suite 
of equity income products.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
BUSINESS OVERVIEW – CONTINUED
Most of the inﬂows into our hedge funds occurred in the ﬁrst 
quarter of 2010 and these were mainly in Japan, UK Equity 
Long Short and our Asian absolute return funds. Investor activity 
slowed thereafter but picked up again in the fourth quarter of 
2010. We have good investment performance, particularly in our 
Japan, Multi-Strategy and European absolute return funds, with 
77% of our funds above their high watermark, and we expect to 
see further inﬂows into these funds during 201 1. We are focused 
on reﬁlling the capacity in our hedge funds and also responding 
to the increasing institutional demand in the US for hedge fund 
products. The UCITS III Credit Alpha Fund has enjoyed great 
success since its launch in mid 2007, being one of only a small 
number of UCITS III credit long/short funds. To complement this, 
given the team’s proven track record in long/short credit, we also 
launched the Henderson Credit Long Short Fund, a Cayman 
domiciled hedge fund, in the ﬁrst quarter of 2010. 
Our Structured Products business continued to earn advisory 
and management fees and, as a result of improvements in prices 
and opportunities in the loans market, we were able to release 
subordinated management fees from our Collateralised Loan 
Obligations book of business. 
Looking at other parts of the business, in Investment Trusts a 
combination of fund transfers and fund realisations resulted in net 
outﬂows in 2010. The Henderson Private Equity Investment Trust plc 
changed its investment strategy (see page 1 1), which involves the 
orderly realisation of the portfolio over a period of two years, and 
Witan Investment Trust plc changed its asset allocation, despite 
solid performance, and replaced Henderson’s enhanced index 
portfolios with traditional active managers. That said, Investment 
Trusts remain a sizeable and important part of our business. 
As regards our cash business, DB Advisors were appointed as 
investment manager of the £3.3bn Henderson Liquid Assets Fund 
(HLAF) from October 2010. This followed a review of our liquidity 
business in light of potential changes to the way that the money 
market fund industry is regulated whilst ensuring the best outcome 
for investors. Since then, investors have approved the merger of 
HLAF into the Deutsche Managed Sterling Fund, a corresponding 
sub-fund of Deutsche Global Liquidity Series plc, and as a result 
our AUM will reduce by approximately £3.0bn with effect from 
February 201 1. 
Our focus remains on providing client solutions. As such, we 
continually review our fund range, whether that be launching 
new products or rationalising existing ones, to ensure that we 
offer relevant products to our clients. We want to capitalise on the 
good reputation we have built in areas such as multi-manager, credit, 
and absolute return. Building our brand is vital in all markets, as well 
as maintaining good relationships with consultants and distribution 
partners globally and locally. 

Global Property AUM grew by £1.7bn from £8.9bn to £10.6bn, 
mainly due to fund ﬂows, including £0.9bn relating to the 
purchase of 50% of Westﬁeld Stratford City on behalf of clients 
and the investment of £0.5bn of prior year client commitments. 
Total client commitments at 31 December 2010 were £1.4bn 
(2009: £1.4bn), as investments made have been replaced by 
new assets raised. AUM as at 31 December 2010 of £10.6bn 
excludes investments by Pearl in closed-ended property funds 
of £0.4bn and £0.8bn of UK Retail assets, in respect to the 
Henderson UK Property Unit Trust.
Whilst we made good progress in investing client commitments, 
we are selective in the properties we choose to invest in. Prime 
assets in some of our key European markets are fully priced or of 
poor quality whereas the US property market recovery appears to 
be lagging Europe by six to nine months. It is also evident that the 
spread between prime and secondary properties has increased 
considerably. Taking into account these factors, the requirements 
of each fund is carefully balanced against the availability of 
suitable properties in the market. During the year, the team took 
advantage of improving valuations in the market, sold some of 
their assets and in so doing unlocked proﬁts for clients and in 
the majority of cases these proceeds will be reinvested. 
We also reviewed our fund range and in the middle of the year we 
transferred the £0.2 billion Henderson International Property Fund 
acquired as part of New Star to Aviva Investors. After a review of 
the fund’s long-term strategy, we established that, for the fund to 
remain effective, it needed to increase in both size and regional 
diversiﬁcation. So it was decided that, in the best interests of 
investors in the fund, to combine the fund with another fund with 
similar investment objectives and holdings. 
One of the highlights of the year was being appointed as investment 
management adviser to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and 
Algemene Pensioen Groep N.V. (through a joint venture) on their 
purchase from Westﬁeld Group of a 50% stake (valued at £871m) 
in Westﬁeld Stratford City. Another was the launch of the Central 
London Ofﬁce Fund II (CLOF II) which had a ﬁrst close of £90m 
and made investments of £25m in the year. One of the cornerstone 
investors in CLOF II has allocated funds outside of the fund for 
further investment in central London ofﬁces and we began to 
invest some of this allocation during the year.  We also reopened 
the open-ended Henderson Indirect Property Fund (Europe). 
There has been a signiﬁcant improvement in investment 
performance (discussed on page 12) across the fund range. 
We take a long-term view on investment strategy, keeping sight 
of the fact that our average fund duration is eight to 10 years. 
Although short-term investment performance suffered in 2008 
and 2009, our strategy is now paying dividends for our clients 
and this has provided a signiﬁcant boost to our brand strength 
in property. We took advantage of the downturn in the property 
cycle and were therefore well placed to lock in gains as property 
markets in some parts of Europe recovered rapidly in early 2010.  
While the easy wins have gone from prime markets our investment 
team is using its asset management and development skills to 
reposition secondary assets into the prime market.

As regards our outlook for global property, in the UK, we believe 
that sentiment may wane in 201 1 but that a more stable pace of 
recovery offers a welcome change from recent market volatility 
and should, in the medium term, help cement a more sustainable 
and robust market. For Europe, low interest rates and bond yields 
will underpin continued strong real estate interest in 201 1 and 
overheating in parts of the European property market seems 
unavoidable. In Asia, we predict that global commercial property 
investment will track macroeconomic indicators in 201 1 and that, 
as such, Asia’s ability to weather the global ﬁnancial storm, in 
addition to its attractive growth prospects and low interest rate 
environment, will underpin continued investor interest.

Total AUM grew by £0.1bn to £0.7bn in 2010 (excluding £0.1bn 
of Pearl AUM) , as a result of increases in the value of the funds. 
In the infrastructure business, a number of initiatives were 
successfully concluded in 2010 giving rise to a positive impact 
on valuation. In particular, during the fourth quarter of 2010 
John Laing (an investment held by two of our infrastructure funds) 
raised a £270m listed infrastructure fund, the second largest 
investment fund Initial Public Offering on the London market in 
2010. At the same time John Laing and its parent undertakings 
reﬁnanced and repaid its bank facilities. John Laing also met its 
targets for new business in 2010 and is expanding its global 
business in North America, Asia and Australia. These initiatives 
have underpinned a strong improvement in the performance of the 
infrastructure funds. 
Other parts of the Private Equity business continue to perform 
well. The ﬁrst Asia fund has delivered a net IRR of 16% per 
annum over a nine year period. The fund realised one of the 
three remaining investments during the year and partially realised 
the other two. These realisations gave rise to performance fees 
in the form of carried interest and the Group has recognised 
£4.8m in FY10 in relation to carried interest on this fund. The 
team’s second fund has made three investments to date across 
India and China and these are progressing well.
The Fund of Funds business has continued its good performance. 
The unlisted Global Fund of Funds, which was fully invested by 
the end of 2003, has now delivered a net IRR of 14% per annum. 
The listed Fund of Funds vehicle, Henderson Private Equity 
Investment Trust plc, performed well during 2010. In September, 
the Trust announced its intention to execute an orderly realisation 
of its portfolio.  As a result, the share price of the Trust increased 
70% during the year, making it the top performing private equity 
investment trust in 2010.

We undertook a company-wide rebranding project in the second 
quarter of 2010, the catalyst being the integration of the Henderson 
and New Star funds. In tandem with the decision to remove the New 
Star brand, we also invigorated our brand across the Group. A new 
Henderson Global Investors logo and brand identity was developed, 
building on the investment made into the UK retail brand. The 
rebranding exercise has been a success where in the UK retail 
market awareness levels remain signiﬁcantly above levels prior 
to the New Star acquisition.

returns to add value for clients
In 2010, the Henderson European Absolute Return 
Fund achieved a net return in excess of 40% and 
was awarded the EuroHedge award for Best European Equity 
Fund under USD500 million, reﬂecting strong external 
recognition for the fund’s risk-adjusted returns. 
Conviction-led stock picking and patience are just two of 
the ingredients that Stephen Peak, the fund manager, would 
use to explain the fund’s success. The fund generally takes a 
contrarian approach to investing, seeking to exploit valuation 
anomalies within equities. A good example is the gold miner 
Centamin Egypt. This investment was originally purchased in 
2001 on its London listing, when it was not widely followed 
by the investment community and the gold price was below 
USD300/oz. 
The fund manager visited the Sukari site in the Eastern 
Desert, around 500 miles south of Cairo to view the 
company’s operations ﬁrst hand – the type of direct analysis 
that can provide valuable insights into a company – and had 
the conviction to build up his position. 
As the company veriﬁed its reserves and moved closer 
to production, and with the gold price quadrupling, investor 
awareness increased. By the end of 2010, the share price had 
risen almost 30 times from the fund’s original purchase and the 
company had migrated to a full LSE listing and became a FTSE 
250 Index constituent. The fund took proﬁts into this rise and 
completely sold the position early in 201 1 as civil unrest in 
Egypt grew.

In Property, the one and three year performance track record 
is pending publication of the IPD Annual Benchmarks in March 
201 1. However, estimates derived from the monthly data show that 
the one year performance numbers should improve signiﬁcantly 
with circa 65% of funds achieving benchmarks or better in 2010. 
Encouragingly, investor conﬁdence in the long-term performance 
of the Group’s Property business has remained strong.
New Star Investment Management (NSIM) performance has 
improved signiﬁcantly during the period with 98% of assets 
outperforming over one year. However, the three year investment 
performance is disappointing with 55% of assets outperforming.
The number of buy rated products increased by 12 to 135 during 
the period. In addition, the Group won a number of investment 
performance awards including:
 FT Business Pension and Investment Provider Award – UK 
Fixed Income Manager of the Year;
 Investment Week Fund Manager of the Year – Multi Manager 
Group of the Year; and
 Lipper Best European region fund over ﬁve years: US.
Fixed Income and Equity funds continued to perform 
well with 62% and 77% respectively of assets achieving 
or beating their benchmarks over one year and 82% and 
63% respectively over three years.

The investment performance of the Group’s funds is good with

funds achieving or beating their benchmarks over one and three 
years respectively. UK Retail performance was good with 70%

performance was adversely impacted by legacy New Star funds 
and only 41% of assets outperformed over three years; however, 
excluding New Star funds, 65% of assets outperformed. 
Horizon performance improved signiﬁcantly in the year with 
83% and 88% of assets outperforming over one and three 
years respectively. This has driven record ﬂows into these funds. 
Performance of the US Retail fund range has been disappointing 
with 1 1% and 16% of assets outperforming over one and three 
years respectively. This is due to the Henderson International 
Opportunities Fund, representing approximately 65% of US Retail 
assets, underperforming. 
In the Institutional business, all fund classes continued to perform 
well over one and three years, with 100% of enhanced index funds 
outperforming over one year and 92% over three years. In our 
Institutional Fixed Income funds, 64% outperformed over one year 
and 97% over three years. Hedge fund performance suffered over 
the one year period, with 67% outperformance; however, three 
year performance remains good with 81% of funds outperforming. 
Of our funds 91% are above or within 5% of their high watermarks.

Transaction fees increased by 48% to £36.8m from £24.9m in FY09, 
primarily due to fees earned on UK Wholesale funds (including New 
Star) and transactions related to our Property business. Performance 
fees increased by 35% to £42.8m from £31.6m in FY09, primarily due 
to fees earned from institutional mandates. The main contributors to

Total fee margin increased from 53.5bps in FY09 to 61.7bps 
in FY10, largely due to higher transaction and performance fees 
and improving management fee margins following the New Star 
acquisition and higher margin net inﬂows. Average management 
fee and net margins in FY10 were 48.2bps (FY09: 42.8bps) and 
17.2bps (FY09: 13.9bps) respectively. Over the past 24 months, 
the Group’s strategy of growing higher margin assets, which now 
represent 59% of total AUM (FY09: 56%, FY08: 48%), has 
helped increase the management fee margin by 13% in FY10.
Total fee margin increased in FY10 due to higher 
transaction and performance fees together with a full 
year of revenue from New Star. Improving management 
fee margin illustrates the shift from lower to higher 
margin business. Net margins have improved as 
underlying proﬁts grew in better market conditions.

Finance income in FY10 decreased by £3.5m to £0.8m, 
primarily due to lower cash balances, lower interest rates and 
the impairment of a seed capital investment in a property fund. 

Operating costs increased by £48.5m to £253.5m in FY10. The 
main components are shown in the table below:

Employee compensation and beneﬁts increased £34.8m to £161.1m 
(FY09: £126.3m). Within this, ﬁxed staff costs increased by £6.3m, 
reﬂecting the impact of New Star for a full year and salary inﬂation, 
whilst variable staff costs increased by £28.5m, driven by improved 
Group proﬁtability. The average number of full-time employees 
remained stable in FY10 at 938 (FY09: 933). The compensation 
ratio also remained stable at 44.4% (FY09: 43.9%) as shown in the 
graph on the following page, mainly as a result of higher variable staff 
costs. The Group continues to manage its cost base in line with its 
income to protect the Group from any signiﬁcant market dislocation.
Investment administration costs increased by £0.7m to £23.3m, 
primarily due to the increased number of funds following the New 
Star acquisition. Information technology costs increased by £1.2m 
to £12.7m due to the write-off of capitalised software costs, the 
New Star acquisition and inﬂation. 
Other expenses increased by £1 1.8m to £37.0m, of which £3.0m 
represents costs incurred in relation to the potential acquisition 
of RidgeWorth on which the Group terminated discussions in 
June 2010. In addition, the Group has continued to invest in 
targeted strategic business development, in particular, relating to 
the UK Retail business, through marketing, events and promotions, 
with an impact of £6.2m. The Group has also seen an increase in 
irrecoverable VAT of £4.0m, partly offset by net foreign exchange 
gains in FY10 of £1.6m (FY09: £0.3m loss). 14

In November 2010, the FSCS indicated that it would raise an 
interim levy on investment managers in respect of claims received 
primarily from investors in Keydata Investment Services Limited 
(in administration). The Group has provided for this levy in full 
during 2010.

The goodwill allocated to the NSIM cash generating unit, 
(a specialised segregated company, formerly part of New Star), 
as a result of an earn out deal in respect of that company, has 
been impaired in full as a result of a 50% decline in AUM.

During the second half of 2010, the majority of a previously 
recognised product mis-selling provision, relating to legacy Towry 
Law International products, was deemed no longer required and 
was released. This resulted in a £5.8m credit in 2010.

During the second half of 2010, HMRC closed enquiries into 
certain prior year tax ﬁlings, resulting in the Group releasing tax 
provisions of £16.4m.

Notes
1.     Transfer of the Henderson International Property Fund, acquired as part of New Star, to Aviva Investors. 
2.  Net of commission expense. 
3. Property AUM at 31 December 2010 excludes £0.8bn of UK Retail funds and £0.4bn of Pearl Property managed funds. 
4. Private Equity AUM (based on 30 September 2010 valuations) excludes £0.1bn of Pearl Private Equity managed funds. 
5. The composition of lower margin and Pearl management fees by category is not shown due to client conﬁdentiality.

The tax charge on recurring proﬁt for the period was £16.1m, 
giving an effective tax rate of 18.5% (FY09: £13.3m, 21.2%). The 
effective tax rate on recurring proﬁt is less than the UK corporation 
tax statutory rate of 28%, primarily as a result of the net favourable 
effect of different statutory tax rates applying to proﬁts generated 
by non-UK subsidiaries. In addition, deferred tax balances have 
been adjusted for the 1% decrease in the UK corporation tax rate 
effective from 1 April 201 1.

Total AUM at 31 December 2010 were £61.6bn, 6% higher 
than at 31 December 2009 (£58.1bn). The Group generated 
higher margin net inﬂows of £2.0bn and net inﬂows of £0.4bn 
in Institutional. These net inﬂows were offset by lower margin 
outﬂows from Cash funds (£1.0bn), NSIM (£1.0bn) and Pearl 
(£1.8bn) and the transfer of the Henderson International Property 
Fund to Aviva Investors (£0.2bn). Outﬂows from Pearl will have 
no material impact on expected future revenues due to the fee 
compensation arrangements in place with this client.

The chart above shows AUM by asset class and includes cash 
holdings within products in Fixed Income AUM and fund of fund 
holdings in Equities AUM. Property asset class AUM excludes 
£0.4bn of cash holdings (2009: £0.3bn) and £0.6bn of fund of 
fund holdings (2009: £0.6bn) held in Property-related products. 
The increase in Equities AUM is due to net inﬂows into Horizon 
funds and the increase in equity market levels. Fixed Income 
AUM has fallen mainly due to outﬂows from Cash funds and 
Pearl. The increase in Property funds is mainly due to inﬂows 
during the year. 16

The Group has three types of pension schemes. A deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme and a deﬁned contribution scheme, together forming the 
Henderson Group Pension Scheme (Pension Scheme), and three 
smaller unapproved pension top-up schemes for previous executives.
There was a net surplus in the Pension Scheme of £1 12.5m at 
31 December 2010 (2009: £90.0m). The increase in the Pension 
Scheme surplus during 2010 is due to better than expected 
returns on the asset portfolio and a lower assumption for future 
price inﬂation, based on the Bank of England’s published price 
inﬂation curve, set at 3.6% per annum (2009: 3.7% per annum). 
These increases were partially offset by a lower discount rate used 
to value the Pension Scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, 
set by reference to AA-rated corporate bonds with approximately 
20 years’ duration, down to 5.4% per annum from 5.6% per annum 
in 2009.
The liability in respect of the Group’s unapproved pension schemes 
amounted to £6.2m at 31 December 2010 (2009: £6.1m).

The Group is subject to regulatory oversight and inspection by the 
FSA and other international regulatory bodies. Consequently, the 
Group’s internal controls, governance, procedures and capital are 
reviewed on a continuous basis. Both management and the Board 
of Directors ensure that the Group is compliant with its regulatory 
obligations at all times. The Group has a waiver from consolidated 
supervision in place, valid until April 2014. The regulatory capital 
surplus of the Group under the Parent Financial Holding Company 
test amounted to £304m at 31 December 2010 (2009: £323m).

The Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend for 2010 of 4.65 
pence per share, which will bring the total dividend for 2010 to 
6.5 pence per share, an increase of 0.4 pence per share from 
2009. The proposed ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 27 May 201 1 
to shareholders on the register on 6 May 201 1.
The Board has adopted a progressive dividend policy and will 
continue to apply a dividend formula where the interim dividend 
will be 30% of the total dividend of the previous year, assuming 
the Group has the resources to fund the dividend.

On 12 January 201 1, the Group announced that it had reached 
agreement with the board of Gartmore on the terms of a 
recommended acquisition by the Group of the entire issued 
share capital of Gartmore (Gartmore Acquisition). The acquisition 
will reinforce the Group’s position as a diversiﬁed fund manager 
with product strength in traditional long-only and absolute return 
offerings and will signiﬁcantly enhance the Group’s presence 
in UK retail asset management. Subject to regulatory and 
shareholder approvals, the acquisition is expected to complete 
on 4 April 201 1 with integration expected to be completed 
during 201 1. 17

RISK MANAGEMENT
EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF 
RISK IS CENTRAL TO ACHIEVING 
OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
Risk management
We have a framework in place which embeds the management 
of risk at all levels within the organisation. The framework also 
ensures that we meet our business objectives without exceeding 
our risk appetite; and is subject to continuous review to ensure it 
recognises both new and emerging risks in the business. The risk 
management framework is set out in more detail in the Corporate 
Governance Statement on page 29. The Group’s risk management 
and capital disclosures in accordance with chapter 1 1 of the 
FSA’s Prudential Sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies and 
Investment Firms (Pillar 3 disclosures) are available on our website 
at www.henderson.com.
Key risks and their mitigation
The key risks faced by the Group fall into a number of distinct 
categories and the means adopted to mitigate them are 
both varied and relevant to the nature of the risk concerned. 
These are set out below in alphabetical order of the key risks:
Key risks Description Mitigation
The Group’s long-term strategy involves its 
willingness to consider the acquisition of businesses. 
In addition to ﬁnancial risks, this introduces the risk of 
organisational stress through the potential demands 
made on staff and resources through the need to 
integrate acquired businesses.
We only consider acquisitions where they ﬁt with 
our strategic goals and meet our ﬁnancial criteria 
such that we can realise value for our shareholders. 
Thorough due diligence is performed before any 
acquisition is made and this includes assessing 
the ability of the Group to successfully integrate 
the acquired business.
Acquisition 
Business disruption risk is the risk of the occurrence 
of events which could have a material impact on the 
operations of the business.
Our business continuity plans are designed to 
ensure that, should an event occur which disrupts 
business activity, we are able to maintain our 
operations without irreparable damage being done 
to the business. These plans are regularly tested. 
The Group also has insurance arrangements should 
loss of revenue occur through business interruption. 
Business  
disruption 
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty to the 
Group defaulting on funds deposited with it or 
the non-receipt of a trade debt.
We have an established credit risk policy to 
ensure counterparties meet strict minimum rating 
requirements consistent with the Group’s risk 
appetite; and the Credit Risk Committee meets 
regularly to approve, review and set limits for all new 
and existing counterparties. In addition, the Group 
has many clients that have fees deducted directly 
from their assets or alternatively are billed regularly 
with strict payment terms.
Credit 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group 
will sustain losses through adverse movements 
in exchange rates. 
We mitigate this risk through the effect of natural 
hedges i.e. holding ﬁnancial assets and liabilities 
of equal value in the same currency; by limiting 
the net exposure to an individual currency; and by 
entering into hedging instruments such as foreign 
exchange contracts, which are primarily used to 
hedge available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. A Hedge 
Committee oversees the risk and reports to the 
Board monthly.
Foreign  
currency  18
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
FINANCIAL REVIEW AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS – CONTINUED
RISK MANAGEMENT – CONTINUED
Key risks Description Mitigation
Key personnel risk is the risk of losing either a 
member of the Senior Management Team (SMT) 
or one of the Group’s key investment or distribution 
professionals. This could have an adverse effect on 
both the growth of the business and/or the retention 
of existing business. 
We operate competitive remuneration structures 
designed to recognise and reward outperformance. 
We also have succession planning to ensure that 
there is cover for key roles should they become 
vacant. In addition, staff surveys identify any issues 
which could adversely impact staff retention and 
comprehensive training is offered ensuring skills 
and knowledge reside in more than one individual. 
Key personnel 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may  
be unable to meet its payment obligations  
as they fall due. 
We manage liquidity on a daily basis within the 
Finance function, which ensures that the Group has 
sufﬁcient cash and/or highly liquid assets available 
to meet its liabilities. The Group ensures that it has 
access to funds to cover all forecast commitments 
for at least the following 12 months. Henderson 
does not bear any liquidity risk associated with 
its clients’ funds and has no obligation to provide 
short-term liquidity to its clients. 
Liquidity
Market risk is the risk that market conditions lead 
to a decline in the value of Group available-for-sale 
ﬁnancial assets and/or a reduction in the value of 
clients’ AUM, which would result in a reduction in 
the level of the fees that are based on the value 
of clients’ AUM. 
We mitigate the market risk on the Group’s 
available-for-sale assets by investing in a diversiﬁed 
range of assets; and mitigate a fall in the value of 
clients’ AUM by having a broad range of clients 
by distribution channel, product, asset class and 
region. In addition, the Group actively seeks fee 
bases which are not solely related to market value 
of AUM. It also makes a signiﬁcant amount of its 
expense base variable and therefore capable of 
reduction, without having a signiﬁcant impact on 
the Group’s operating capability. 
Market 
Investment performance risk is the risk that funds 
fail to achieve performance hurdles or benchmarks. 
The effect of this might be that clients redeem 
investments, which in turn would result in a reduction 
in fees earned by the Group. Poor fund performance 
will also result in lower performance fees. 
Investment 
performance 
We mitigate this risk through a robust investment 
process which includes detailed research. We also 
have a clearly articulated investment philosophy and 
analyse our funds by comparing their performance 
against appropriate benchmarks.  19

Key risks Description Mitigation
Operational risk is the risk that the Group will 
sustain losses through inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people, systems and external events. 
We operate a system of controls which is designed 
to ensure operational risks are mitigated to the 
required level. The operation and effectiveness 
of the controls are regularly assessed and 
conﬁrmed through the work of the Group’s 
assurance functions: Risk Management, 
Compliance and Internal Audit. 
Operational
Outsourcing risk is the risk of failure in respect of 
the provision of services by third party administrators 
(TPAs). Any signiﬁcant interruption in services or 
deterioration in performance could damage the 
Group’s operations. Furthermore, if the contracts 
with any of the TPAs are terminated, the Group 
may not be able to ﬁnd alternative TPAs on a 
timely basis or on equivalent terms. 
We oversee the operation of our TPAs to ensure 
key performance standards are met. We hold regular 
meetings with our TPAs to discuss any service 
concerns or problems and work in partnership with 
TPAs to deliver solutions. The Group’s assurance 
functions also review controls operated by our 
major TPAs. The ﬁnancial strength of a TPA is given 
careful consideration when contracts are awarded 
and also if a material deterioration should occur in 
a TPA’s ﬁnancial strength. 
Outsourcing 
Regulatory risk is the risk that a change in laws 
and regulations will materially affect the Group’s 
business or markets in which it operates. The Group’s 
business is subject to many regulations in different 
jurisdictions and currently the pace of change is 
signiﬁcant and may affect the business either 
directly or indirectly by reducing investors’ appetite 
for its products, increasing capital requirements or 
in some other way.
We continuously monitor regulatory developments 
and where there is likely to be an impact, we have 
working groups in place to implement the changes. 
The Compliance team in particular monitor ongoing 
regulatory obligations and engage in dialogue with 
the main regulator.
Regulatory
Reputational risk is the risk that negative publicity 
regarding the Group will lead to a loss of revenue 
or litigation. The risk of damage to the Group’s 
reputation is more likely to result from one of the 
risks described above materialising rather than 
as a standalone risk. 
We believe that reputational risk is mitigated 
through the effective mitigation of the other key 
risks. In addition, we regularly update clients and 
the market and in doing so, mitigate the risk of 
reputational damage.

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
A SUSTAINABLE 
APPROACH TO BUSINESS
We are committed to interacting responsibly with employees, 
clients, suppliers, shareholders, communities and the wider 
environment. We have developed policies and activities to address 
key issues in four broad areas. Our commitment and efforts to 
ensure good practices have been recognised externally through 
our continued inclusion in the FTSE4Good UK Index. We aim  
to comply with the principles of the UK Stewardship Code.
The commentary below is intended to provide a summary, 
focusing on our performance for 2010 and plans for 2011. 
Details on our policies, systems and performance are on  
our website at www.henderson.com. 
Targets
 We are committed to maintaining high standards of business 
conduct in all operations; we have adopted a Code of Conduct 
covering employees, clients, suppliers and shareholders.
 We seek to operate high standards of corporate governance.
 Our business goal is to deliver sustainable, long-term investment 
performance to our clients. We believe we need to be 
responsible investors and also consider environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) issues that have the potential to add value to 
our investment decisions. Our adoption of the UN Principles for 
Responsible Investment creates a framework for implementing 
this. As well as managing Sustainable and Responsible 
Investment (SRI) funds where ESG issues are proactively 
considered, we have a responsible investment policy that outlines 
our commitment to integrate ESG in our non-SRI equity funds.  
We aim to take an active approach to corporate governance  
and voting in investee companies. Our property assets also  
have responsible property development and investment policies, 
and we have set speciﬁc targets on areas such as carbon, water 
and waste.

 The key ESG issues we analysed and engaged companies  
with during 2010 were corporate governance, climate change, 
business ethics and human capital management.
 We continued to participate in initiatives such as the Carbon 
Disclosure Project, the Forest Footprint Disclosure and the 
Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change. 
 We developed our framework for evaluating and reporting  
on our ESG company engagement activities. 
 Our property team commenced rolling out an extensive 
programme to measure carbon emissions, water consumption 
and waste sent to landﬁll, setting targets to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of assets under management. 
 We continued to explore ways to integrate ESG into asset classes 
beyond equities and property.

 We will continue to maintain high standards of customer care.
 We will continue to explore ways to integrate ESG factors across 
our asset classes as well as how we report more effectively on 
the UK Stewardship Code. More speciﬁcally, our property team 
will set new 201 1 targets for its activities, and continue to report 
publicly on its performance. 
Targets
 We aim to ensure that all our policies meet best practice and 
comply with relevant employment legislation and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, creating a working environment 
free from discrimination and harassment.
 To achieve top performance, we need our people to be top 
performers. As part of the feedback from our staff survey,  
we aim to signiﬁcantly enhance our learning programme.
 We aim to introduce creative solutions to attract talent and 
provide a stepping stone into the business.
 We are committed to building staff share ownership and 
creating a reward approach of both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
elements which recognises individuals’ performance.

 We have introduced a new development platform “The Pathway”, 
signiﬁcantly increasing our training coverage.
 We have developed our recruitment activities and website to 
encourage employees to consider opportunities within the Group, 
resulting in a high number of vacancies being ﬁlled internally.  
We also encourage employee referrals.
 To recruit fresh talent, we have launched a Trainee Programme, 
giving around 40 people, a year’s work experience across the 
business with the possibility of gaining a permanent role.
 Employee views have been sought through a conﬁdential all-staff 
survey. 81% of staff participated in the survey (industry 
benchmark: 70%).
 90% of employees contribute to our share schemes with 13.6% 
of the Company owned by employees if all existing share 
schemes vest, a 3% increase from 2005. Our share schemes 
have been recognised at the ifs ProShare and Employee Beneﬁt 
Awards for the last four years.
 We also launched an international share scheme targeting our 
non-UK employees. 
 Our award winning ﬁnancial education package provided a wide 
range of planning tools to employees. 

 Staff survey results will be used to identify areas with potential  
for improvement.
 “The Pathway” development programme will be fully launched and 
expanded to our ofﬁces outside the UK.
 We will target increasing share scheme participation, especially 
non-UK employees’ holdings of our shares.


We believe the Treating Customers Fairly (TCF)  
initiative promoted by the FSA is embedded within  
the culture and procedures of the Group. TCF, among  
other priorities, is intended to promote fair treatment  
of customers by regulated ﬁrms throughout the product  
life cycle, from design to post-sales support.  
We always aim to:
 treat our clients fairly;
 ensure that any information provided in respect  
of a product is clear, fair and not misleading; and
 align our interests with those of our clients.

Targets
 We follow responsible environmental practices for all Group 
operations and aim to minimise any adverse impact our activities 
have on the environment.
 We will continue to measure our emissions and carbon footprint 
for all energy consumption, business travel and waste generation 
and aim to retain our status as a Carbon Neutral Company by 
procuring credits through veriﬁed carbon offset schemes.

 We maintained our status as a Carbon Neutral Company by 
offsetting our net global emissions of 2,772 tonnes CO2e.
 At our London ofﬁce, we procured energy from renewable 
sources and offset our residual carbon footprint. We introduced 
an automated energy monitoring scheme aimed at focusing on 
benchmarking and reduction targets.
 We rolled out our new web-based carbon reporting tool to all 
worldwide ofﬁces. Relevant staff received formal training through 
the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management.
 All waste reduction, re-use and recycle schemes operated 
effectively. We won a gold award in the City of London Clean City 
Awards Scheme.

 We are committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all 
employees and compliance with all health and safety legislation 
relating to the workplace. 
 Appropriate monitoring of health and safety control procedures 
takes place and is maintained through a programme of internal 
and external safety checks and audits.

 We will maintain our status as a Carbon Neutral Company and will 
focus on our energy reduction programme for our London ofﬁce. 
We will maintain and develop our waste management, re-use and 
recycling programme.
Targets
 We focus our efforts on fostering positive relationships 
with the local London community, as this is where the majority  
of staff are located. Activities focus on employee involvement  
and charitable donations. We encourage staff involvement in 
charitable activities matching, pound for pound, money raised.
 We are committed to ensuring our suppliers and service 
providers operate responsible labour and environmental 
practices, and have practices in line with our corporate 
responsibility policy. We seek to implement a green procurement 
policy for purchase of ofﬁce supplies and equipment.

 Our preferred charity since 1987 has been Community Links,  
the inner city charity running community-based projects in  
East London, the location of our London ofﬁce. During 2010,  
we donated a total of £35,938 to community and charitable 
purposes, compared with £52,609 for the previous year.  
The amount of employee matching grants made in 2010 
was £19,546, a decrease from 2009 of £10,889. 

 We will continue to promote staff involvement in the local 
community and will encourage further participation in our  
Give As You Earn scheme, for example, donating an hour’s  
pay to a number of chosen charities.


The Pathway was launched in 2010 as a development 
platform for our employees, encouraging them to 
self-select the opportunities that will be most beneﬁcial to  
them. The Paths are structured around the core experiences  
an employee is likely to have during their career at  
Henderson Group.
The platform offers a range of new training formats. One of the 
most successful has been discussions by our senior leaders on 
topics they are passionate about and add value to the business. 
This enables employees to create connections with senior 
managers and gain value from their skills and talents. External 
speakers have led sessions to trigger new approaches and ideas, 
including leadership lessons from Yogi Breisner, coach of the 
UK’s Olympic medal winning equestrian team, and new ways of 
connecting teams with Adam Travis from Nokia. These have been 
widely attended and positively rated by staff looking for the edge 
in how they approach their work.
We have also launched bite sized sessions enabling staff to 
receive training as part of their working day. Sessions covered 
Effective Risk Management, Introduction to Fund Management, 
Managing Change/Coaching and Strategic Thinking. 
For our current and future leaders, we have designed two new 
leadership programmes, Stepping into Leadership and High 
Impact Leadership, focused on developing high performance 
leadership capabilities within our top management population. 
The programmes are facilitated at the Royal Military Academy 
Sandhurst – an institution that thrives on training for excellence. 
Participants experience leading methodologies used within the 
Military and reﬂect on the implications for leadership. 
Participants are given a team challenge to complete to enable 
them to see leadership as a behaviour. Partnering with the charity 
Fairbridge, participants raised money for disadvantaged youths 
enabling them to see the powerful impact of team action.

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group in 2010 was the provision of 
investment management services.
Future developments and business review
The Group’s results for the year are shown in the Consolidated 
Income Statement on page 46. The business review, which is 
incorporated into and forms part of this Directors’ Report, of 
the ﬁnancial year and future developments is covered in the 
Chairman’s Statement on page 3, the Chief Executive’s Review 
on pages 4 to 1 1 and the Financial Review and Key Performance 
Indicators (including Risk Management) on pages 12 to 19.
Corporate Governance Statement
The Corporate Governance Statement appears on pages 26 to 33 
and forms part of this Directors’ Report.
Branches
The Group continues to operate a number of overseas branches. 
Reporting
Shares in Henderson Group plc are listed on both the LSE and 
the ASX (in the form of CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs)) and 
therefore the Company is required to comply with both sets of 
disclosure requirements.
Events after the reporting date
The Board has not received, as at 22 February 201 1, being the 
date on which the Annual Report and Accounts were approved, 
any information concerning signiﬁcant conditions in existence 
at the reporting date which have not been reﬂected in the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements as presented. The Board has, 
however, given due regard to the events which occurred after the 
reporting date as described in note 34 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Share capital
Details of movements in the allotted share capital during the year 
are given in note 25 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Further information regarding the share capital structure of the 
Company is given in pages 31 to 33 in the Corporate Governance 
Statement which forms part of this Directors’ Report.
Substantial shareholdings
Details of substantial shareholdings notiﬁed to the Company 
in accordance with Rule 5 of the Financial Services Authority’s 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules) are set out on page 31 in the Corporate Governance 
Statement which forms part of this Directors’ Report.
Supplier payment policy
The Company has no trade creditors. It is the Group’s policy 
that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with the 
terms and conditions agreed between Group companies and 
their suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions 
have been complied with. In respect of the Group’s activities, 
the amounts due to trade creditors as at 31 December 2010 
represent approximately 30 days of average daily purchases 
throughout the year (2009: 30 days).
Directors
Details of the Board members who served during the year and 
at the date of this report are set out on pages 22 and 23.
Directors’ remuneration and interests
A report on Directors’ remuneration appears on pages 34 to 42, 
including details of Directors’ interests in shares and share options 
or any right to subscribe for shares in the Company.
Conﬂicts of interest
The Directors have put in place procedures to deal with conﬂicts 
of interest and these have operated effectively throughout 2010. 
A Register of Conﬂicts of Interest is maintained by the Company 
and reviewed by the Board on an annual basis. Any Director who 
is considering accepting a new external appointment must provide 
full details of the appointment to the Chairman and Company 
Secretary. In some cases, the interest or duty of someone who is 
connected with a Director may give rise to a potential conﬂict of 
interest and details of that must also be provided to the Chairman 
and Company Secretary. The Chairman will then decide whether 
the relevant appointment causes a conﬂict or potential conﬂict of 
interest and should therefore be considered by the Board. If it is 
considered and approved by the Board, such interest or potential 
interest is added to the Register of Conﬂicts of Interest.
Financial instruments
A statement on the risk management objectives, policies and 
related matters in respect of the use of ﬁnancial instruments, 
including policies for hedging and the exposure to price, interest 
rate, liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks, can be found in 
note 28 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Political donations
The Group made no political donations, incurred no European 
Union political expenditure and made no contributions to non-
European Union political parties during the year.
Charitable donations
Donations by the Group during the year towards community and 
charitable causes amounted to £35,938 (2009: £52,609), which 
comprised social and welfare £7,61 1 (2009: £22,635), education 
and non-UK £6,845 (2009: £3,920), and medical and other 
projects £21,482 (2009: £26,054).
Rounding
In accordance with the Australian Securities and Investments 
Commission Class Order 98/0100, amounts in this Directors’ 
Report and other sections of this Annual Report and Accounts 
have been rounded to the nearest £0.1m, unless stated otherwise.
Annual General Meeting
A separate document, the Notice of Annual General Meeting 201 1, 
covering the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company 
to be held on 4 May 201 1, will be sent or made available to all 
shareholders and will contain an explanation of the business 
before that meeting.
Indemniﬁcation and insurance of Directors and Ofﬁcers
The Company provides a Deed of Indemnity to Directors to 
the extent permitted by Jersey law, including (i) indemniﬁcation 
against any liabilities incurred in defending any proceedings in 
which judgment is given in that Director’s favour or the Director 
is acquitted, (ii) against liabilities incurred otherwise than to the 
Company, if the Director acted in good faith with a view to the best 
interests of the Company and (iii) against any liabilities incurred 
in successfully applying to the Court for relief where the Director 
acted honestly. 25

In addition, the Deed of Indemnity provides that Directors will 
have access to Board and Committee papers of the Company 
for the period of their ofﬁce and for seven years after ceasing 
to be a Director for the purpose of defending legal proceedings, 
and that the Company will maintain Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ liability 
insurance cover for the Directors to the extent permitted by law 
for the period of their ofﬁce.
During, or since the end of the ﬁnancial year, the Company has 
paid or agreed to pay premiums in respect of a contract insuring all 
of the Ofﬁcers (including all Directors) of the Group against certain 
liabilities. The insurance policy prohibits disclosure of the nature 
of the liability, the amount of the premium and the limit of liability.
Independent auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have indicated their willingness to continue 
in ofﬁce and a resolution that they be reappointed will be proposed 
at the 201 1 AGM.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure  
of information to auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving this Directors’ Report are listed on page 22 and 23.
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s 
auditors, each of these Directors conﬁrms that:
 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information needed by the Company’s auditors in connection 
with preparing their report of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
 the Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information needed by the Company’s auditors in 
connection with preparing their report and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Combined Code and ASX Principles 
The Directors support and are subject to the high standards 
of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in June 2008 (Combined Code) and the Corporate Governance 
Principles and Recommendations issued by the ASX Corporate 
Governance Council in August 2007 (ASX Principles). Compliance 
with the new UK Corporate Governance Code, published in June 
2010, and with the ASX Principles including 2010 amendments, 
which apply from the ﬁnancial year commencing on 1 January 
201 1, will be disclosed in the 201 1 Annual Report and Accounts. 
Copies of the Combined Code and the ASX Principles can be 
found on the websites of their respective organisations at www.frc.
org.uk and www.asx.com.au. Copies of the Company’s corporate 
governance policies can be found at www.henderson.com (the 
Group’s website). 
The Company complied with the Combined Code and the ASX 
Principles in 2010. This Statement, together with the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration, describes how the Company applied the 
‘main principles’ set out in section 1 of the Combined Code and 
complied with the ASX Principles. Further details are in the 
corporate governance section on the Group’s website. The ASX 
Principles also encourage companies that are not subject to the 
Australian Corporations Act 2001 to adopt practices and make 
disclosures to achieve the aims of the provisions contained in 
certain sections of that Act. The Company achieved the aims of 
those provisions, although not fully in respect of senior executives’ 
remuneration (refer to the generic disclosures on senior executive 
remuneration on page 42). 
The Board’s structure 
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, the 
Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and four other 
Non-Executive Directors. Tim How was appointed as the Senior 
Independent Director on 1 January 2010. Biographical details 
of the Directors are set out on pages 22 and 23.
Although the Chairman, Rupert Pennant-Rea, met the 
independence criteria on appointment, the Combined Code 
provides that the test of independence is not appropriate thereafter. 
The Board considers all the other Non-Executive Directors – 
Gerald Aherne, Duncan Ferguson, Tim How and Robert Jeens – 
to be independent, as they do not have any interest or business 
or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived 
to, interfere materially with their ability to act in the best interests 
of the Company. The Board has considered the criteria proposed 
by the Combined Code and the ASX Principles in assessing the 
independence of the Directors. Materiality, as referred to in the 
ASX Principles, has been assessed on a case-by-case basis by 
reference to each Director’s individual circumstances rather than 
general materiality thresholds. The independent Directors meet the 
quantitative materiality threshold for independence that no Director 
has a relationship with the Group which generates or accounts for 
more than 5% of the Group’s revenue or expenses. Accordingly, the 
Board has a majority of Directors who are independent.
There is a division of responsibility between the Chairman, who is 
responsible for the effective operation of the Board, and the Chief 
Executive who is responsible to the Board for the overall 
management and performance of the Group. The Chairman’s other 
signiﬁcant commitments, and any changes to them during 2010, 
are shown in the Board of Directors section on page 22.
Non-Executive Directors are initially appointed for a ﬁxed term, 
normally of three years, and any subsequent terms are considered 
by the Nomination Committee. The remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors is shown on pages 38 and 39. The terms and 
conditions of their appointment are on the Group’s website, as is 
the process for their appointment and reappointment.
At the Company’s AGM held on 1 1 May 2010, shareholders 
reappointed Gerald Aherne, Duncan Ferguson, Shirley Garrood 
and Robert Jeens as Directors. The Company’s next AGM is due 
to take place on 4 May 201 1 when all Directors will be seeking 
reappointment in accordance with the recommendations of the 
new UK Corporate Governance Code.
Evaluation of the Board’s performance 
The Board reviews, on an annual basis, whether the evaluation 
of Board performance should be conducted using an external 
facilitator. The Board decided that, for 2010, there was greater 
value conducting the process internally. However, the Board 
anticipates that an external evaluation will be undertaken in 201 1.
The Directors conducted a formal evaluation, between August 
and December 2010, of the performance of the Board, Board 
Committees and individual Directors (including the Chairman). 
The evaluation exercise of the Board and Board Committees 
involved Directors completing a questionnaire about Board 
composition, Board process, Group strategy and interaction with 
shareholders; a similar approach was followed for each Committee. 
The results of the evaluation were collated and presented to the 
Board, which included a small number of non-material enhancements 
to the Board process.
To evaluate individual Directors, the Chairman held a formal 
evaluation meeting with each Non-Executive Director and the 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, taking into account 
the views of the Directors who had all completed a questionnaire 
about the skills and experience of the members of the Board. 
The Chairman’s performance evaluation was led by Tim How, the 
Senior Independent Director. For this, the Directors completed a 
questionnaire which focused on the Chairman’s performance and 
the Chairman also conducted a self-evaluation which was shared 
with the Senior Independent Director. After taking account of the 
results of these questionnaires, the Senior Independent Director 
met with the Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) 
and evaluated the Chairman’s performance. He then met with 
the Chairman to discuss the outcome of the evaluation.
The performance of Andrew Formica, Chief Executive, was 
evaluated by the Chairman and the Remuneration Committee. 
The evaluation of the members of the SMT was undertaken 
by the Chief Executive and the Remuneration Committee. 
The performance evaluations were conducted in accordance 
with the process as disclosed on the Group’s website.
The outcome of the evaluations was that the Directors concluded 
that the Board and its Committees operate effectively and that 
each Director contributes to the overall success of the Group.
To ensure that the Directors continually update their skills and 
knowledge of the Company and Group, all Directors receive 
regular presentations on different aspects of the Group’s business 
and on ﬁnancial, legal and regulatory matters. For example, during 
2010, the Directors received presentations on various business 
matters, including the new FSA Remuneration Code 2010, 
domestic and regulatory developments, absolute return funds 
and the Group’s approach to information technology.
Operation of the Board
The Board of the Company met 14 times in 2010, of which eight 
were scheduled meetings. All of the Board meetings and Audit, 
Nomination, Remuneration and Risk Committee meetings of the 
Company took place in Dublin with the exception of one set of 
meetings which took place in Singapore. Attendance by each of the 
Directors at Board meetings during 2010 is set out in Table 1 below.
The Board is scheduled to meet seven times in 201 1. Additional 
meetings will be held as required, or at the request of a Director. 
During 2010, the Non-Executive Directors also met the Chairman  27

without the Executive Directors being present and this will 
continue in 201 1.
The Board is responsible for making all key strategic, management 
and commercial decisions. During 2010, the matters considered by 
the Board included: 
 discussion and approval of business strategy;
 annual budget and ﬁve year forecast;
 half year and full year ﬁnancial report and accounts;
 dividends;
 interim management statements;
 trading updates;
 monthly performance reports;
 review of a report provided by the FSA and the implementation 
of follow up actions;
 review of corporate governance arrangements;
 establishment of a Risk Committee;
 review and approval of the Risk Appetite Statement;
 review and approval of the Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP);
 regular reports on treating customers fairly;
 review of advisers;
 review of investment performance;
 review of delegated authorities; and
 all signiﬁcant capital projects, investments and disposals.
A schedule of matters reserved for approval by the Board is 
reviewed annually and is also on the Group’s website. The Chief 
Executive and the SMT are responsible for developing business 
strategy and, once approved by the Board, for ensuring that 
the strategy is implemented in accordance with the approved 
operating plan and compliant with internal controls. The Board 
has granted speciﬁc delegated authorities (with ﬁnancial limits 
approved by the Board) to the Chief Executive, the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer and other senior executives in respect of 
ﬁnancial, accounting, treasury, regulatory and other matters 
relating to the Group’s business.
To enable the Directors to perform their role effectively, they are 
given the means and information necessary for them to make 
informed decisions and to follow best corporate governance 
practice. At each of its meetings, the Board receives detailed 
reports on the various aspects of the business and of any major 
issues affecting it.
The Board has approved the Company’s corporate governance 
policies. These include an overview of the Company’s corporate 
governance procedures, a policy on trading in the shares of the 
Company by Directors and employees and a code of conduct. 
The Company has a Market Disclosure and Communication Policy 
designed to ensure compliance with the Company’s relevant 
disclosure obligations and has a Chief Disclosure Ofﬁcer who 
oversees this. During 2010, the Board adopted a diversity policy 
which is available on the Group’s website. Together, these corporate 
governance policies set a framework within which the Directors 
and other employees are expected to protect the interests of 
shareholders, clients, employees and suppliers. These policies 
were reviewed and updated in 2010 as were other corporate 
governance documents, all of which are on the Group’s website.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of both the 
Company Secretary and the General Counsel. The Company 
Secretary can be appointed or removed only with the approval 
of the Board. The Directors are entitled to seek independent 
professional advice, at the Company’s expense, where they judge 
it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors.
Board Committees 
The Board has delegated speciﬁc responsibilities to four standing 
Committees of the Board. The membership of the Board 
Committees and a summary of their main duties and terms of 
reference are set out below. Their full terms of reference are on 
the Group’s website.
Audit Committee
Robert Jeens is the Chairman of the Audit Committee, having 
succeeded former Director John Roques, the previous Audit 
Committee Chairman, on 1 January 2010. The other members are 
Gerald Aherne, Duncan Ferguson and Tim How. All members of 
the Committee are independent and have “recent and relevant 
ﬁnancial experience” and “ﬁnancial expertise” as recommended by 
the Combined Code and the ASX Principles respectively. Robert 
Jeens has competence in accounting and auditing as required 
by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The details of the 
qualiﬁcations of the Committee members are set out on pages 22 
and 23. The Audit Committee met six times in 2010, all of which 
were scheduled meetings. Attendance by each of the members 
during 2010 is set out in Table 2 below.
The Audit Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on such matters as the appointment of the external 
auditors and their terms of engagement and for reviewing the 
performance, independence and objectivity of the external auditors. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control framework and the 
Internal Audit function, which is subject to an external review every 
three to ﬁve years; such a review was undertaken in November 2010. 
The Audit Committee reviews the Annual Report and Accounts and 
other related ﬁnancial disclosures; however, ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts and other 
public reports and statements remains with the Board.

Nomination, Remuneration and Risk Committees referred to hereafter. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT – CONTINUED 28
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
The Audit Committee, up until the formation of the Risk Committee 
in June 2010, also had responsibility for the matters set out in the 
business of the Risk Committee (refer to below).
Audit Committee’s principal activities during 2010
During the year, the Audit Committee:
 received and reviewed reports from management and the 
external auditors relating to the Annual Report and Accounts of 
the Group and the Company as well as the interim report and 
accounts, interim management statements, related disclosures 
and the ﬁnancial reporting process;
 assessed the effectiveness and independence of both the 
external auditors and Internal Audit function;
 reviewed compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and 
accounting standards;
 assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls;
 received regular reports from the Finance, Internal Audit, Legal 
and Compliance functions;
 reviewed and approved the external auditors’ remuneration and 
engagement letter;
 reviewed and authorised details of the non-audit services 
provided by the external auditors during the year – refer to note  
4.2 to the ﬁnancial statements. The amount paid for non-audit 
services and the type of services provided were not considered 
by the Audit Committee to affect the external auditors’ 
objectivity or independence;
 reviewed arrangements for whistleblowing should an employee 
wish to raise concerns, in conﬁdence, about any possible 
improprieties; and
 reviewed the risk of the withdrawal of the external auditor from 
the market.
The internal and external auditors attended all Audit Committee 
meetings during the year and, on one occasion, met the Non-
Executive Directors without the Executive Directors being present.
As explained above, an annual review was undertaken regarding 
the effectiveness and independence of the external auditors. 
The Board is satisﬁed with the performance and independence 
of the external auditors. The audit engagement partner and senior 
audit team members are rotated every ﬁve years. No contractual 
obligations exist to restrict the choice of auditors of the Group 
and the Company. The Board has adopted a Charter of Statutory 
Auditor Independence, which requires both the Company and the 
external auditors to take measures to safeguard the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors. These measures include a 
prohibition regarding any non-audit services in respect of speciﬁc 
areas (e.g. secondments to management positions) or which could 
create a conﬂict or perceived conﬂict. It also includes information 
on the procedures for the selection, appointment and rotation of 
the external audit engagement partner. The Charter is on the 
Group’s website.
The external auditors will be asked to attend the Company’s AGM 
on 4 May 201 1 and will be available to answer questions from 
shareholders about the conduct of the audit and the preparation 
and content of the Independent Auditors’ Report as shown on 
page 44.
Nomination Committee
Rupert Pennant-Rea is the Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee. All the other Non-Executive Directors are members 
of the Committee. The Committee met four times in 2010. 
Attendance by each of the members is set out in Table 3 below.
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for considering the 
size, composition and balance of the Board, and the retirement 
and appointment of Directors and making recommendations to 
the Board on these matters. In identifying suitable candidates 
for appointment to the Board, the Nomination Committee is 
responsible for ensuring that Directors have the right mix of 
expertise and experience. The Committee also considered 
succession planning for key management and staff members. 
Remuneration Committee
Gerald Aherne is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
The other members are Duncan Ferguson, Tim How and Robert 
Jeens. The Committee met six times in 2010. Attendance by each 
of the members during 2010 is set out in Table 4 below.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the Group’s remuneration plans, 
policies and practices and for determining, within agreed terms of 
reference, speciﬁc remuneration packages for each of the Executive 
Directors and members of the SMT. These include pension rights, 
compensation payments (if any) and the implementation of executive 
incentive schemes. The Remuneration Committee operates on 
the principle that members of the SMT should be provided with 
incentives to encourage superior performance and should, in a fair 
and responsible manner, be rewarded for their individual contributions 
to the success of the Group.
The Report on Directors’ Remuneration (refer to pages 34 to 42) 
provides details on how the Remuneration Committee exercised 
its responsibilities during 2010. During 2010, the Remuneration 
Committee took advice on technical aspects of remuneration 
policy from independent external consultants appointed by the 
Remuneration Committee. These were Towers Watson, a specialist 
remuneration consulting ﬁrm, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) 
both of which provided advice on a variety of matters (particularly 
the FSA Code on Remuneration), and Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, 
which provided advice to the Group on pension matters. 
Remuneration survey data published by McLagan Partners was 
also presented to the Remuneration Committee. None of Towers 
Watson, Lane Clark & Peacock LLP or McLagan Partners have 
any connection with the Company other than to provide data 
and information on remuneration and on pension matters and 
developments. PwC provide other consultancy and specialist 
advice to the Group on an ad hoc basis but have no other 
connection with the Group.

Risk Committee
The Board formed a Risk Committee in June 2010 following its 
assessment of the November 2009 Walker Report. Previously, the 
Audit Committee was responsible for the matters set out below.
Duncan Ferguson is the Chairman of the Risk Committee. All the 
other Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman, are 
members of the Committee. The Committee met four times in 2010. 
Attendance by each of the members is set out in Table 5 below.
The Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
key risks through a mixture of qualitative guidance and quantiﬁable 
limits. The Risk Committee is forward looking and advises the 
Board on the Group’s risk proﬁle and risk appetite in setting its 
future strategy. It also advises the Board on the amount of surplus 
regulatory capital that should be held and oversees the 
effectiveness of the risk management framework and procedures, 
regulatory compliance and the principal risks and uncertainties 
relating to the Group. It also reviews the work and reports prepared 
by the Chief Risk Ofﬁcer (CRO) and oversees the effectiveness 
of the CRO’s role.
Since its formation, the Risk Committee:
 reviewed and accepted the Risk Committee’s terms of 
reference;
 assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
framework;
 received regular reports from the Finance and Risk 
Management functions (further information on the Risk 
Committee’s role in monitoring and assessing the Group’s 
management of risk is set out in the risk management and 
oversight of internal controls sections on page 30);
 reviewed and updated the Group’s risk appetite statement; and
 reviewed and recommended the approval of the ICAAP reports 
to the Board.
Risk management
The Board considers risk assessment and the existence of 
effective controls to be fundamental to achieving its corporate 
objectives within an acceptable risk and reward proﬁle. Throughout 
2010 and up to 22 February 201 1, being the date on which the 
Annual Report and Accounts were approved, there has been in 
place an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
signiﬁcant risks within the Group’s control which accords with the 
guidance set out in the “Turnbull Report – Internal Control: Revised 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code – October 2005”. 
No signiﬁcant failings or weaknesses were identiﬁed by this 
process. A summary of the Group’s risk policy is on the Group’s 
website and the key risks and their mitigation are outlined under 
Risk Management on pages 17 to 19.
The responsibility for managing risk lies with the SMT. There are 
also a number of management committees chaired by, and 
consisting of, senior managers that have responsibility for speciﬁc 
areas of risk. These provide a forum for managing and resolving 
signiﬁcant risk and regulatory issues. Day-to-day responsibility for 
management of risk is delegated to line management who work 
closely with the Risk Management Team to maintain an effective 
system of controls.

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
The Group’s framework utilises a ‘three lines of defence’ 
approach to managing risk: the ﬁrst line is represented by 
business management managing risk and having in place 
effective controls; the second line comprises an independent risk 
management team monitoring the operation of those controls and 
ensuring signiﬁcant risks are not overlooked and by Compliance 
monitoring regulatory risks; and the third line is provided by 
Internal Audit, which operates and reports independently of 
management to the Audit Committee and is responsible for 
assessing the effectiveness of controls and, where necessary, 
making recommendations for improvements and monitoring 
management action plans to implement such improvements.
Quarterly risk reports are provided to the Board by the Risk 
Committee which include material business risks such as credit, 
market and operational risks; and the CRO provides regular reports 
to the Risk Committee on these topics. The Risk Management 
Team maintains an incident management process and reports 
regularly to the SMT. 
The Board considers that this reporting framework gives it sufﬁcient 
information upon which to assess the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls.
Oversight of internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system 
of internal controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls is 
reviewed at least annually by the Board in order to safeguard the 
Group’s assets as well as clients’ and shareholders’ interests. For 
2010, this review covered all material controls including ﬁnancial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management 
systems. As part of its review, the Board received assurances 
from the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer that 
the statement provided on page 43 is founded on a sound system 
of risk management and internal controls and that the system is 
operating effectively in all material respects in relation to ﬁnancial 
reporting risks. In addition, the SMT reported positively to the 
Board on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls and the mitigation of any material business risks.
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to the Audit 
and Risk Committees (refer to pages 27 to 29 for roles and 
responsibilities of these committees). Terms of reference for these 
committees are available on the Group’s website. The responsibility 
for risk within the Group is now overseen by the Risk Committee 
(prior to its establishment in June 2010, this responsibility lay with 
the Audit Committee). 
The Group’s system of internal controls requires line managers 
to conﬁrm regularly that controls in their areas have operated 
effectively. These controls, and the risks which they are designed 
to mitigate, are maintained within the Group’s operational risk 
database, which in turn reﬂects the risk proﬁles of each part of 
the Group’s business. 
Internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting
The Group’s ﬁnancial reporting process has been designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the 
ﬁnancial reporting and preparation of ﬁnancial statements, 
including consolidated ﬁnancial statements, for external purposes, 
in accordance with IFRS. This process is under the supervision 
of the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and has 
appropriate internal controls to ensure its effectiveness. 
The internal controls include policies and procedures that:
 relate to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and disposals of 
the Group’s assets;
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial statements, and 
that the receipts and expenditures of the Group are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
Directors; and
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposal of 
Group assets that could have a material effect on the Group’s 
ﬁnancial statements.

Financial reporting and going concern
The Directors have acknowledged their responsibilities in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in relation to the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 (refer to 
page 43).
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 1 1. The ﬁnancial 
position of the Group, its cash ﬂows and liquidity position are 
described in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes. 
In particular, note 28 to the ﬁnancial statements summarises 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives, details of ﬁnancial 
instruments used and hedging activities and its exposures to 
market, liquidity, interest rate and credit risks.
The Group has sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources and diverse revenue 
streams. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group 
is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have made appropriate enquiries into the material 
uncertainties inherent in current and expected market conditions, 
the trading performance of the Group and the debt instrument 
issued by the Group in 2007, which matures in 2012. Furthermore, 
the Directors have considered the guidance published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in October 2009 entitled “Going 
Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK 
Companies 2009” and the key questions for boards contained 
within that guidance. After thorough examination, the Directors are 
satisﬁed that the Group has and will maintain sufﬁcient ﬁnancial 
resources to enable it to continue operating in the foreseeable 
future and, therefore, will continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Signiﬁcant agreements
HGI Group Limited (previously Henderson Group plc and now 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) has in issue 
£175,000,000 in senior, unrated ﬁxed rate notes (Notes) listed on 
the LSE, maturing on 2 May 2012. Condition 6.3 of the terms and 
conditions of the Notes gives each noteholder the option to require 
HGI Group Limited to redeem or (at HGI Group Limited’s option) 
to purchase that Note at its principal amount together with accrued 
interest in the event of a ‘Change of Control’. A ‘Change of Control’ 
will be deemed to have occurred, broadly, if there is a change in 
the person(s) who own(s) directly or indirectly more than 50% of 
the share capital of HGI Group Limited (or more than 50% of the 
voting rights attached to the share capital of HGI Group Limited). 
In the event that 80% or more in nominal amount of the Notes 
then outstanding has been redeemed or purchased in accordance 
with this condition, HGI Group Limited may redeem, at its option, 
the remaining Notes as a whole at their principal amount plus 
accrued interest.
The Group has entered into multicurrency term and GBP revolving 
loan facilities which may be utilised by the Group to meet the 
Group’s post-Gartmore Acquisition debt obligations and for 
general corporate and working capital purposes. The Facilities 
Agreement contains a standard clause that sets out repayment 
and cancellation provisions should a change of control occur.
Share capital and structure
The share capital of the Company, issued and unissued, consists 
entirely of ordinary shares of 12.5 pence each. Each share ranks 
equally and carries the same right to receive dividends and 
other distributions declared, made or paid by the Company. 
No restrictions exist on the transfer or holding of securities in the 
Company under its Articles of Association and there are no shares 
carrying special rights with regard to the control of the Company.
Substantial shareholdings
At 22 February 201 1, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 5 
of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Company had 
received notiﬁcation of direct and indirect holdings in the 
Company’s issued share capital from:
Percentage  
of total  
voting rights
Perpetual Limited 13.51%
JCP Investment Partners Limited 6.46%
Lansdowne Partners Limited Partnership 6.22%
BlackRock, Inc. 5.01%
Suncorp-Metway Limited 4.57%
Legal & General plc 3.97%
Investor relations
The Group welcomes the views of investors and their 
representative bodies. The Board receives regular feedback from 
management about investors’ and analysts’ views on the Group 
and also wider industry matters. In addition, a monthly investor 
relations report informs the Board of analysts’ views on the Group, 
provides a summary of the largest shareholders and reviews share 
price performance and key market and sector developments in 
the month.
The Group’s website provides online services to help shareholders 
manage their holding and engage with the Investor Relations Team 
and Share Registry. To assist shareholders in accessing up-to-date 
information on the Group, market brieﬁngs and other Company 
announcements and presentations are on the Group’s website. 
The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer meet with 
institutional shareholders and equity analysts regularly and the 
major shareholders are offered meetings with Non-Executive 
Directors. The Company’s Market Disclosure and Communication 
and Shareholder Communication Policies, which are designed to 
promote effective communication with shareholders, are available 
on the Group’s website.
The Group publishes its ﬁnancial results on both the LSE and 
the ASX. The 2009 Annual Report and Accounts was sent to 
all shareholders that had requested it and all other shareholders 
were notiﬁed, via post or email, that the 2009 Annual Report and 
Accounts was available on the Group’s website.
All shareholders were invited to the AGM held on 1 1 May 2010. 
Notice of the AGM was given to shareholders at least 21 clear 
days before the meeting. In line with the Combined Code, proxy 
forms for general meetings (including the AGM) made it clear that 
shareholders could vote for or against any resolution or withhold 
their vote. The AGM was held in Dublin and simultaneously 
broadcast to a venue in Sydney. All Directors attended the AGM. 
A summary of the questions asked at the AGM and the answers 
given, together with the results of resolutions put to the AGM, 
is on the Group website. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT – CONTINUED 32
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
Employee share schemes
The Group has a number of employee share schemes. The rights 
attached to the shares of several of the share schemes are not 
exercisable directly by the employees. The trustees of such share 
schemes have an obligation to act in the best interests of the 
beneﬁciaries of the share schemes and, although the trustees 
consider any recommendations made by the Company, where 
applicable, the discretion over the rights remain with the trustees. 
In cases of takeover or reconstruction, the employees do have a 
right to vote via the trustees. An exception to the above is that the 
trustee of the Henderson Group plc Buy As You Earn Share Plan, 
and its international equivalent, does not have discretion as to how 
to vote and is instructed by the employees who are beneﬁcially 
entitled to the underlying shares.
Restrictions on voting rights
All shareholders entitled to attend and vote at Company meetings 
are also entitled to appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote in their 
place. A member may appoint more than one proxy. Proxy forms 
must be received not less than 48 hours before the time appointed 
for holding a meeting, as set out in any notices concerning a 
general meeting or in any proxy form sent by or on behalf of 
the Company in relation to a meeting. In addition, the Companies 
(Uncertiﬁcated Securities) (Jersey) Order 1999 provides for a time 
to be speciﬁed in the notice of meeting for determining attendance 
and voting entitlements. This time may not be more than 48 hours 
before the meeting. Further details are set out in any notice of 
meeting issued by the Company from time to time.
Amendment to the Articles of Association  
of the Company
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, the Company may only 
amend its Articles of Association if its shareholders pass a special 
resolution to that effect. A special resolution is passed if two thirds 
or more of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, are in favour of 
the resolution.
New issues of share capital and disapplication  
of pre-emption rights
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, the Directors of the 
Company are, with certain exceptions, unable to allot any ordinary 
shares without express authorisation which cannot last more 
than ﬁve years. The Company follows best practice and asks 
shareholders to grant such authority on an annual basis. Under 
the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board may not allot 
ordinary shares for cash, other than pursuant to an employee 
share scheme, without ﬁrst making an offer to existing 
shareholders to allot such shares to them on the same or more 
favourable terms in proportion to their respective shareholdings, 
unless this requirement is waived by a resolution of the 
shareholders passed by a majority of at least three quarters of 
the holders of the shares who vote in person or by proxy in favour 
of the resolution.
The Directors have been authorised by shareholders to allot the 
Company’s unissued shares up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £34,000,000, or £68,000,000 when in connection with an 
offer of equity securities by way of a rights issue to shareholders 
in proportion to their existing holdings. The former amount 
represented less than one third of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital as at the year end. As at 22 February 201 1, the 
Company has authority to allot shares up to a nominal value of 
£34,000,000, or £68,000,000 when in connection with an offer 
of equity securities by way of a rights issue to shareholders in 
proportion to their existing holdings. Shareholders will be asked to 
renew this authority up to a limit of £34,000,000, or £68,000,000 
when in connection with an offer of equity securities by way of a 
rights issue to shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings, 
at the AGM on 4 May 201 1. The latter allotment ceiling of up 
to two thirds of the nominal value of the issued shares is in 
accordance with guidelines issued by the Association of British 
Insurers (ABI).
The Directors have authority to allot equity securities for cash or 
sell ordinary shares held in treasury (treasury shares) for cash on 
a non-pre-emptive basis: (a) pursuant to a rights issue; or (b) up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £5,000,000. This empowers the 
Company to make limited allotments of unissued equity shares of the 
Company or certain rights to acquire such shares (equity securities) 
and to sell treasury shares for cash other than in accordance with 
the pre-emption rights in the Articles of Association. This amount 
represents less than 5% of the Company’s issued share capital. 
Shareholders will be asked to renew this authority up to a limit 
of £5,000,000 at the AGM on 4 May 201 1.
Purchase of own share capital
Subject to authorisation by a special resolution passed by 
shareholders, the Company may purchase its own shares in 
accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Any shares 
which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares and 
if not so held, would be cancelled, thereby reducing the amount of 
issued share capital. The Directors have shareholder authority to 
buy back up to 80,000,000 ordinary shares during the period up 
to the forthcoming AGM. The maximum number of ordinary shares 
authorised to be purchased is 80,000,000 minus the number of 
shares purchased pursuant to any purchases of CDIs made under 
a Contingent Purchase Contract (CP Contract). The minimum price 
(exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share is 
12.5 pence (being the nominal value of an ordinary share). The 
maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each 
ordinary share is the higher of: (a) an amount equal to 105% of the 
average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as 
derived from the LSE Daily Ofﬁcial List for the ﬁve business days 
immediately preceding the day on which the share is contracted 
to be purchased; and (b) an amount equal to the higher of the price 
of the last independent trade of an ordinary share and the highest 
current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived from the 
LSE Trading System. No ordinary shares were bought back by the 
Company during 2010.
The Directors consider that it may be advantageous for the 
Company to buy back interests in its own CDIs in certain 
circumstances. However, because CDIs are interests in shares, 
rather than shares themselves, the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
provisions which provide for a buy-back of shares do not apply to 
CDIs. The Company, therefore, cannot buy CDIs pursuant to the 
above authority.
The Company achieves a similar result by entering into a CP 
Contract with Credit Suisse (Australia) Limited and certain of its 
afﬁliates (Credit Suisse) as identiﬁed in the CP Contract. Credit 
Suisse would buy the CDIs in Australia and then convert the CDIs 
into shares (Converted Shares). The Company would then have 
an obligation to buy any Converted Shares from Credit Suisse 
up to a maximum amount as explained below.
The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 provides that any purchase 
of shares must be approved by shareholders by special resolution. 
Shareholders are therefore asked to approve the CP Contract. No 
Converted Shares were bought back by the Company during 2010.
The maximum number of Converted Shares which could be 
bought back by the Company, together with the number of shares 
bought back by the Company under the authority to purchase 
its own shares set out above, is limited to 80,000,000, which 
represented under 10% of the Company’s issued share capital 
at 22 February 201 1. Shareholders will be asked to renew these 
authorities up to a limit of 80,000,000 ordinary shares at the AGM 
on 4 May 201 1. 33

REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Introduction
This Report on Directors’ Remuneration (Report) contains  
the following information:
 a description of the membership and role of the Group’s 
Remuneration Committee; 
 a summary of the remuneration policy of the Group including  
a statement of the Group’s policy on Directors’ remuneration; 
 details of the terms of the service agreements and the 
remuneration of each Director for the preceding ﬁnancial year; 
 details of the share options and awards under long-term 
incentive schemes, held by the Directors; and 
 details of each Director’s interest in ordinary shares  
of the Group.
Henderson Group plc is a Jersey incorporated company and 
has no statutory requirement to prepare a Report on Directors’ 
Remuneration. Nevertheless, on a voluntary basis, the requirements 
of the UK Companies Act have been taken into account in preparing 
this Report. The Report also meets the requirements of the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. It sets out how the principles of 
the Combined Code and the ASX Principles relating to Executive 
Directors’ remuneration are applied by the Group. In addition, it 
outlines our alignment with the FSA Code on Remuneration.
A resolution will be put to the AGM on 4 May 201 1 inviting 
shareholders to consider and approve this Report.
Membership and responsibilities  
of the Remuneration Committee
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews and approves, where 
appropriate, the Group’s remuneration and remuneration plans, 
policies and practices. Its duties are to:
 review and recommend to the Board the Group’s remuneration 
protocols and practices, which are performance-based and 
aligned with the Group’s vision, values and overall business 
objectives; 
 determine annually the remuneration of the Board Chairman, 
the Chief Executive and his direct reports, including the other 
Executive Director; 
 approve the terms and conditions of employment and  
other contractual matters relating to the Group’s SMT; 
 approve the policy and terms of the Group’s employee  
and executive share incentive plans; and 
 approve the Group’s Remuneration Policy Statement and  
the remuneration terms and arrangements for FSA code staff 
in accordance with the new FSA Code on Remuneration. 
The full terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are 
available on the Group’s website. 
No Director or member of the Group’s SMT is involved in any 
decision on their own remuneration.
Membership 
The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. During 2010, and as at 22 February 
201 1, the Remuneration Committee consisted of Gerald Aherne 
(Committee Chairman), Duncan Ferguson, Tim How and  
Robert Jeens.
The Board Chairman, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer may attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee 
at the Remuneration Committee’s invitation, save that they may 
not attend if their own remuneration is under consideration.
Meetings
The Remuneration Committee meets regularly and takes advice 
on a range of matters, including the scale and composition of 
the total remuneration package payable in comparable ﬁnancial 
institutions to people with similar qualiﬁcations, skills and 
experience. Additionally, a focus in 2010 was preparing for 
compliance with the FSA Code on Remuneration and other 
regulatory developments in remuneration policies and practices.
Internal support is provided to the Remuneration Committee 
by the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the General Counsel and the 
Managing Director, Human Resources. The Remuneration 
Committee also receives support from the Chief Risk Ofﬁcer 
and the Risk Committee on risk management issues relating 
to remuneration matters. The Managing Director, Human 
Resources is invited to attend meetings, except when his 
own remuneration is under consideration.
The Remuneration Committee Chairman and the Chief Executive 
make remuneration recommendations for the senior managers 
who report to the Chief Executive. The Board Chairman is also 
consulted about the remuneration of both Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee met six times in 2010.
Advisers
During 2010, the Remuneration Committee took external advice 
on technical aspects of remuneration policy from independent 
external consultants appointed by the Remuneration Committee. 
These were Towers Watson, a specialist remuneration consulting 
ﬁrm, and PwC, both of which provided advice on a variety of 
matters (particularly the FSA Code on Remuneration) and Lane 
Clark & Peacock LLP, which provided advice to the Group on 
pension matters.
Remuneration survey data published by McLagan Partners was 
also presented to the Remuneration Committee.
None of Towers Watson, Lane Clark & Peacock LLP or McLagan 
Partners have any connection with the Group other than to provide 
data and information on remuneration and on pension matters and 
developments. PwC provide other consultancy or specialist advice 
to the Group on an ad hoc basis but have no other connection with 
the Group.
Policy statement
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee considers that a successful remuneration 
policy should be sufﬁciently ﬂexible to take account of future changes 
in the Group’s business environment and remuneration practice and, 
therefore, the Group’s policy is also subject to change.
The Group has established a remuneration framework, which 
is designed to be market competitive and motivate employees 
to improve individual and business performance, retain key 
employees and align employee actions with the interests 
of shareholders. Our remuneration policies are also designed 
to address risk management and compliance issues. The 
Remuneration Committee has discretion and authority to 
make recommendations on matters of remuneration where 
they consider it appropriate to do so especially relating to 
FSA code staff. 
The Group’s remuneration framework is based on a total reward 
approach designed to deliver top quartile pay for top performance. 
There are three key components:
 basic salary – paid within appropriate market range; 
 annual bonus – paid under a short-term incentive plan where 
individuals have the opportunity to receive a bonus (of which 
a substantial portion is deferred over three years) based on 
business and individual performance against targets; and 
 long-term incentive – performance-based for senior executives 
and certain professionals such as senior fund managers and key 
distribution personnel. 35

The Group and Remuneration Committee also considered, in detail, guidelines from the FSA and the Walker Report on executive pay 
and remuneration practices. As a result, the Group has implemented several changes that strengthen the link between its remuneration 
policies and practice and the increased focus on corporate remuneration governance, these being;
 the production of a Group Remuneration Policy Statement that sets out the Group’s remuneration policies and practice;
 the introduction of risk assessment factors into our key reward processes through liasion with the Chief Risk Ofﬁcer, the Risk 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee when awards are made and vest; 
 new rules for the Group’s share plans to provide the Remuneration Committee with the power to vary or lapse individual unvested 
awards in cases of poor risk management or where results have been misstated or where there has been serious misconduct;
 the introduction of non-ﬁnancial objectives and risk measures into key remuneration and the annual employee appraisal processes; 
and
 implementation of processes that enable the Remuneration Committee to identify and regulary monitor all FSA code staff especially 
in respect of levels of reward, risk management, compulsory deferral and annual appraisals. 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance

Executive Directors’ remuneration: individual elements
Overall structure
Executive Directors’ remuneration comprises:
 basic salary; 
 annual bonus; 
 pension beneﬁts; 
 beneﬁts in kind; and 
 the opportunity to participate in certain Group-wide incentive schemes, such as the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the Restricted 
Share Plan (RSP), the Sharesave scheme (SAYE) and the Buy As You Earn Share Plan (BAYE).
The LTIP and the annual bonus are performance-related and these are key elements in the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages. 
The SAYE is available to all UK and US employees and is not performance-related. Awards to Executive Directors can be made under 
the RSP and may be subject to performance conditions.
For target levels of performance, at least 60% of total remuneration (excluding pension) should be performance-related. The expected 
value of awards made under the LTIP was calculated by the Group’s adviser, Towers Watson, using a proprietary methodology. Its 
methodology considers TSR rank at which payment begins, the payment level at this threshold, the maximum payment under the plan 
and the rank at which this maximum is achieved. The methodology also takes into account the correlation of the Company’s share price 
with those companies in its peer group, starting from the premise that the value of the shares awarded at the end of the performance 
period is correlated with the TSR ranking. The Remuneration Committee is satisﬁed that the overall structure is a well-considered set 
of arrangements for the Executive Directors’ remuneration. It is kept under review to take account of changing circumstances. Incentive 
payments are not taken into account for pension purposes. 36
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION – CONTINUED
Basic salary
Salaries are reviewed annually for each Executive Director. In 
2010, the salaries of the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer remained unchanged at £350,000 per annum and 
£300,000 per annum respectively. 
Annual bonus
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, each Executive 
Director may receive a cash bonus subject to achieving performance 
targets set by the Remuneration Committee. Payment of bonuses 
(if any) will be made to the Executive Directors annually, in February, 
on condition that performance targets were met in the preceding 
calendar year. The Remuneration Committee has the ﬂexibility 
to take into account other factors in determining any bonus. The 
bonus range is zero to a speciﬁed maximum. The maximum bonus 
entitlement is based on a percentage of annual basic salary. The 
maximum entitlements for 2010 performance are 600% of salary 
for the Chief Executive (2009: 600%) and 200% of salary for the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (2009: 200%).
For the Executive Directors, the corporate performance targets 
relate to Group performance measures as set out in the 
Performance linkage section above. The Group’s performance 
measure in 2010 was predominantly underlying pre-tax proﬁt. 
However, operating margins, net fund ﬂows, return on equity and 
investment performance were also factored in. Also considered 
were a number of non-ﬁnancial measures and a report from the 
Chief Risk Ofﬁcer on risk. The Remuneration Committee and the 
Board review the performance of each Executive Director on an 
annual basis against these targets and guidance from the FSA in 
its code of practice on remuneration. The Committee determined 
that annual bonuses for Executive Directors should continue to 
be subject to deferral in line with the FSA Code on Remuneration 
(this also applies to FSA code staff).
Long-term incentives
Under the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee may make awards 
to Executive Directors up to a maximum number of ordinary shares 
determined by the Remuneration Committee at the date of grant. 
Vesting of awards is conditional upon the achievement of a 
performance target measured over a three year period and the 
Executive Director’s continued employment during the performance 
period. The primary performance measure is the relative TSR and 
the Remuneration Committee must be satisﬁed that the Group’s 
TSR performance reasonably reﬂects its underlying ﬁnancial 
performance over the performance period. In addition, the 
Committee has the power to vary or lapse individual unvested 
awards in cases of poor risk management or where results have 
been misstated or where there has been serious misconduct.
The Group made awards under the LTIP to Andrew Formica and 
Shirley Garrood on 21 June 2010. The aggregate market value 
of the ordinary shares capable of being acquired under these 
awards at the date of award was equivalent to 464% and 217% 
of salary respectively.
The Remuneration Committee will consider awards under the LTIP 
to the Executive Directors in 201 1. The Committee also intends to 
change the LTIP from a three year plan to one where the full 
beneﬁt of the plan occurs between years three and ﬁve.
2010 LTIP award
The proportion of the 2010 LTIP awards that will vest will be 
determined by reference to the Group’s TSR over the three year 
period commencing 1 January 2010, compared to that achieved 
over the same period by the companies in the FTSE 350 General 
Financial Services Index. If the Group’s TSR performance is below 
the 50th percentile, none of the shares awarded will vest. If the 
Group’s TSR performance is at the 50th percentile, 25% of the 
shares awarded will vest and if it is at or above the 75th percentile, 
100% of the shares awarded will vest. Vesting between these 
latter two points will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
2009 LTIP award
The awards made in 2009 continue to be held, subject to the same 
TSR performance condition as the 2010 LTIP, over the three year 
period to 31 December 201 1. The awards will vest in May 2012.
Performance linkage
Each element of the Executive Directors’ reward package supports the achievement of key business measures and rewards 
outperformance as illustrated in the table below:
Element StructurePurpose Performance measure
Basic salary Fixed Reﬂects the competitive market rate for  
the role, the individual’s contribution and prior 
contractual arrangements
Experience and qualiﬁcations
Annual bonus Variable Rewards the delivery of operational goals,  
ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial targets
Return on equity, underlying pre-tax proﬁt, 
operating margins, net fund ﬂows and investment 
performance. Non-ﬁnancial measures  
(see note 1 below) are also considered
Long-term incentives Variable Supports superior business performance  
in relation to competitor companies and aligns 
Executive Directors’ with shareholders’ interests
Relative TSR
Note 1
In 2010, the Committee agreed to particularly consider any non-ﬁnancial measures:
 potential external and/or reputational issues arising from regulatory issues, including an adverse report from, or ﬁnancial penalty imposed by, the FSA, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, Monetary Authority of Singapore or other regulator, an adverse report from Ernst & Young relating to the Group’s 
Annual AAF or reputational risk, other than those included above; and 
 operational risk and internal controls: the cost of any error deals in the year, together with a failure to satisfactorily close actions relating to any incidents; 
the number of serious issues identiﬁed by Internal Audit, combined with a failure to close related actions within agreed timescales or non-adherence to internal 
procedures, i.e. Group-wide compulsory training (such as TCF and market abuse) or control sign-offs not completed on time. OUR BUSINESS

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
2008 LTIP award
The TSR performance condition for this award, which was also 
the Company’s TSR performance versus the FTSE 350 General 
Financial Services Index, was satisﬁed at the end of 2010 and 
resulted in 100% of the shares in the award being capable of 
exercise. The award will vest in February 201 1.
2007 LTIP award
2007 LTIP awards vested in March 2010 and based on the TSR 
performance condition over the prior three calendar years, resulted 
in 100% of the shares in the award being capable of exercise.
Shareholding requirement
The Remuneration Committee has also determined that, over time, 
each Executive Director should be required to maintain a target 
shareholding of ordinary shares in the Company, equivalent to 
100% of basic salary, in order to align the interests of Executive 
Directors more closely with those of shareholders. The Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer met this requirement 
throughout 2010.
All-employee Group share schemes
The SAYE, a savings-related share option scheme, is available 
to all UK employees. It operates within speciﬁc UK tax legislation 
(including a requirement to ﬁnance exercise of the option using 
the proceeds of a monthly savings contract) and exercise of the 
option is not subject to satisfaction of a performance target since 
this is an all-employee scheme. Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate in the SAYE on the same terms as other employees. 
There is a similar plan for US employees.
The BAYE, available to all UK employees, is a scheme that 
operates within speciﬁc UK tax legislation and was established 
following shareholder approval at the 2004 AGM. The BAYE 
represents a further opportunity for employees to increase their 
share ownership in the Company, which is an important tool in 
attracting and retaining staff in the asset management industry. 
The BAYE enables participants to acquire ordinary shares via 
deductions from gross salary, for which the Company provides 
two matching shares for every one purchased. The BAYE also 
allows for limited annual awards of free shares up to HM Revenue 
& Customs (HMRC) (UK tax authority) limits. Executive Directors 
are eligible to participate in the BAYE. There are similar plans for 
employees outside the UK (except for China and India).
The Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP), last offered in 
2008, provides an opportunity for employees to further increase 
their ownership in the Group. Employees are able to purchase 
Company shares up to a set limit through the Deferred Equity 
Plan (DEP) and, subject to continued employment over a speciﬁed 
period, the Company provides one further matching share for 
each share purchased. 
The Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) is a global plan that 
provides employees with an opportunity to buy shares after three 
years at an option price ﬁxed at the start of the scheme. Under 
the CSOP, an employee may receive one or several awards of 
stock options. Being a global plan means that the tax treatment 
for this plan can vary by country and tax jurisdiction but in the 
UK an employee’s CSOP is limited to £30,000 in aggregate. 
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the CSOP.
The Executive Shared Ownership Plan (ExSOP) was introduced 
in 2010 to encourage employee share ownership at middle 
management level. Under the ExSOP, selected employees were 
invited to acquire, jointly with an employee beneﬁt trust (Co-Owner) 
and upon the terms of a joint ownership agreement a restricted 
beneﬁcial interest in a given number of shares in the Company. 
When the jointly owned shares are sold, after at least three years, 
the participant receives the growth in the value of the shares and 
the Co-Owner retains the original value of the shares. Executive 
Directors are excluded from participating in the ExSOP.
All Group share awards can be funded by issuing shares except 
for an element of the BAYE and DEP which are made through 
on-market purchases.  All awards to Executive Directors are 
satisﬁed by on-market purchases.
The Group’s share plans rules currently restrict the level of shares 
that may be issued to satisfy share plan vestings to 10% of the 
issued share capital of the Group over a 10 year rolling period. 
Executive plans are restricted to 5%.  This is consistent with 
ABI guidelines.
Pensions
Retirement beneﬁts are designed to be both market competitive 
and cost effective. HGI Group Limited is the sponsoring employer 
of the Henderson Group Pension Scheme (Pension Scheme), 
which has both a deﬁned beneﬁt section (closed to new members) 
and a deﬁned contribution section. No members of the deﬁned 
beneﬁt section of the scheme receive unapproved pension beneﬁts 
in addition to their normal scheme beneﬁts. In the UK scheme, 
the Group replaced the statutory earnings cap which was abolished 
on 6 April 2006 by the Finance Act 2004 with an internal scheme 
earnings cap, which is broadly the same as the previous statutory 
ﬁgure adjusted for inﬂation. The annual scheme earnings cap of 
£122,760, remained unchanged on the previous year.
The Executive Directors participate in the non-contributory 
section of the Pension Scheme providing beneﬁts on a deﬁned 
contribution basis on the same age-related basis as other 
employees. The Chief Executive receives a Group contribution, 
currently 10.5% of basic salary, into the pension plan limited by 
the operation of the scheme earnings cap and the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer receives 1 1.5%, again limited by the operation of the 
scheme earnings cap. 
In 2007, the Group introduced a Self Invested Personal Pension 
(SIPP) that allows UK employees to make voluntary contributions 
into a wider range of funds and also the ability to transfer in 
Company shares from maturing share plans in a tax effective 
manner.  The Group rebates some of the national insurance 
savings to employees’ SIPP accounts. The Chief Executive and 
the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer made no contributions to the Group 
SIPP in 2010 that qualiﬁed for any rebate. 
The Group also has pension arrangements in place for its 
non-UK-based employees, which are in line with market practice.
Beneﬁts and beneﬁts in kind
The Executive Directors are contractually entitled to a lump-sum 
life assurance beneﬁt of four times basic salary, permanent health 
insurance and medical insurance.
The Executive Directors also beneﬁt from indemnity arrangements 
in respect of their services as Directors, and Directors’ and 
Ofﬁcers’ liability insurance, under separate Deeds of Indemnity. 
Further details can be found in the Directors’ Report section.  38
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION – CONTINUED
Contracts and termination provisions
The Group’s policy is to employ Executive Directors on annual 
rolling contracts although, in exceptional circumstances on 
recruitment, longer initial terms may be approved by the 
Remuneration Committee. To date, it has not exercised this 
power. The Remuneration Committee will, consistent with the best 
interests of the Group, seek to minimise termination payments.
The Executive Directors have service agreements terminable on not 
less than 12 months’ written notice by the Group or on not less than 
six months’ written notice by the relevant Executive Director.
The service agreements allow the Group to suspend the Executive 
Directors from their duties at any time after notice has been given 
by either party, provided they continue to receive full pay. Under 
certain circumstances (such as serious misconduct), the Group 
may terminate employment immediately with no liability to make 
any further payment (other than amounts accrued to the date 
of termination).
The Executive Directors’ employment agreements have no 
provisions for remuneration payable on early termination. In relation 
to their participation in long-term incentive-related pay, Executive 
Directors are subject to the same LTIP rules as other participants. 
Roger Yates, former Chief Executive, received 624,166 
shares in March 2010 in respect of a prorated award from the 
2007 LTIP and his adherence to contractual post-termination 
restrictions agreed at the time of his departure in 2008. Toby 
Hiscock, former Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, received 312,500 shares 
in respect of a prorated award from the 2007 LTIP and a cash 
award of £225,000 in March 2010, as part of his contractual 
post-termination arrangements and his adherence to restrictions 
post termination agreed at the time of his departure in 2009. 
Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Board Chairman is determined by the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the other Non-
Executive Directors and, for other Non-Executive Directors, is 
determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors, both 
on the basis of external independent advice. The Board Chairman 
and other Non-Executive Directors serve the Company under 
letters of appointment that are terminable by the Company on one 
month’s written notice without liability for remuneration; they do not 
have service agreements. It is the Company’s policy that the Board 
Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in any of the Group’s bonus, incentive or pension schemes, nor 
are they entitled to any retirement beneﬁts. Under their respective 
letters of appointment:
 the annual fee payable to each Non-Executive Director (other 
than the Board Chairman and the Audit, Remuneration and 
Risk Committee Chairmen) is £50,000, of which £5,000 is 
paid in the form of Company shares. The fee was increased 
from £45,000 with effect from 1 July 2010; 
 the annual additional fee payable to the Audit, Remuneration 
and Risk Committee Chairmen is £20,000, of which £5,000 
is paid in the form of Company shares; 
 Rupert Pennant-Rea is Non-Executive Chairman of the Group. 
His fees are £170,000 per annum, of which £20,000 is paid in 
the form of Company shares; 
 Gerald Aherne was entitled to additional fees of £20,000 per 
annum, of which £5,000 is paid in the form of Company shares 
as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee; 
 Duncan Ferguson was entitled to additional fees of £20,000 
per annum, of which £5,000 is paid in the form of Company 
shares as Chairman of the Risk Committee. He was appointed 
Chairman of the Risk Committee with effect from 29 June  
2010 and therefore received a prorated cash fee in 2010. The 
£2,500 payable in shares will be purchased on-market in 201 1;
 Tim How was entitled to additional fees of £5,000 per annum, 
as the Senior Independent Director; and 
 Robert Jeens was entitled to additional fees of £20,000 per 
annum, of which £5,000 is paid in the form of Company shares 
as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
The Chairman, together with the Executive Directors, has 
reviewed the basic fees paid to other Non-Executive Directors and 
determined that they would rise by £5,000 to £55,000 per annum 
with effect from 1 January 201 1. The increase would be in the 
form of cash. The additional fees for the Audit, Remuneration and 
Risk Committee Chairmen and the Senior Independent Director 
will remain unchanged. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the other 
Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Board Chairman) 
also reviewed the fees payable to the Board Chairman and 
determined that they would rise from £170,000 to £180,000 per 
annum, with effect from 1 January 2011. The increase would be 
in the form of cash.
The Chairman and other Non-Executive Director remuneration 
was determined after having reviewed market survey data and 
a report from the Managing Director, Human Resources on pay 
levels and employment conditions of employees across the Group. 
The following tables provide greater detail in respect of each of the 
Directors’ remuneration, pension entitlements and share interests 
which have been audited by the Group’s auditors. 39

1.   Under the SAYE, after 36 monthly contributions of up to £250, SAYE participants may exercise their options to acquire Company shares at a pre-deﬁned 
issue price set at a 20% discount to the closing mid-market value on a pre-deﬁned date. 
2.   The vested LTIP relates to the 2007 award. On exercise, for the 2007 plan, awards were satisﬁed by the transfer to participants of shares purchased  
on-market by the LTIP trustee.
4.   Maximum LTIP award – this number reﬂects the number of shares that would vest on the vesting date. However, the expected level of achievement of 
the TSR performance target at the time of award is 40.6% of the maximum award. 
5.   The CSOP award to Shirley Garrood was in respect of her previous role as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer. 42
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION – CONTINUED
Additional remuneration information
The ASX Principles encourage companies that are not subject to the Australian Corporations Act 2001 to make certain disclosures 
about the remuneration of the ﬁve highest paid non-Director executives in accordance with section 300A of that Act. Details of the 
remuneration of each individual and the value of the component parts of their remuneration have not been disclosed. The Group 
considers this information to be commercially sensitive. However, generic disclosures are given as follows.
The ﬁve highest paid non-Director executives during 2010 were:
Name (in alphabetical order) Position
Andrew Boorman Managing Director, Human Resources
James Darkins Managing Director, Property
Roger Greville Managing Director, Private Equity
David Jacob Managing Director, Listed Assets and Chief Investment Ofﬁcer
Arno Kitts Director of Global Distribution
The aggregate annual remuneration of the executives listed above was £6,107,000 made up of the following:
 basic salary; 
 discretionary annual bonus, which is dependent on stipulated Group, divisional and individual performance measures; 
 discretionary performance fee or transaction fee awards in 2010; 
 Group non-contributory (i.e. the employee does not contribute and the Group bears all the costs) pension plan in the deﬁned 
contribution and deﬁned beneﬁts sections of the plan; 
 other beneﬁts including private medical insurance, car allowance, season ticket loans and life assurance and free shares under  
the BAYE; and 
 vesting of discretionary share plan awards, refund of commission charges on mandatory deferral into hedge funds and cash payment 
of BAYE dividend awards that exceeded the HMRC annual dividend limit.
In June 2010, the Remuneration Committee made awards to non-Director executives under the LTIP as described on page 63. In 2010, 
the aggregate market value of the ordinary shares (averaged over the three month period immediately prior to the date of grant) capable 
of being acquired by any non-Director executives under these awards was a maximum of 300% of basic salary, depending on the role 
and responsibilities of the relevant executive. The vesting criteria set out on page 63 will apply to these awards. The executives were 
awarded a total of 1,825,000 shares under the LTIP in June 2010. Non-Director executives are entitled to participate in the SAYE and 
BAYE as described on page 63. In addition, the Remuneration Committee made an award of 10,000 jointly owned shares under the 
ExSOP in June 2010 to Andrew Boorman.
Non-Director executives (as with Executive Directors) also participate in the DEP under which participants receive part of their annual 
bonus, principally since 2004, in the form of Company shares or, an interest in an investment fund vesting at the end of a speciﬁed 
restricted period, subject to the executive continuing to be employed by the Group. The restricted period will normally be three years, 
but cannot be less than one year or more than ﬁve years. 
The structure of the remuneration packages for non-Director executives and FSA code staff is designed to support the achievement of 
the same key measures as for Executive Directors (as set out on page 37) and to ensure that executive pay complies with the Board’s 
remuneration policy (as described on pages 34 to 35).

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors are required to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with Jersey law which show a true and fair view in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. The Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS).
International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly 
for each ﬁnancial year the Group’s and Company’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. In preparing the Group 
and Company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are also required to:
 select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements of IFRS is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s and Company’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial 
performance; and
 state that the Group and Company have complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the ﬁnancial 
position of the Group and Company, for safeguarding the assets, and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors conﬁrm that to the best of their knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial 
position and proﬁt of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2010;
 the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group; and
 the accounting records have been properly maintained.

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
We have audited the Consolidated and Company ﬁnancial 
statements of Henderson Group plc for the year ended 
31 December 2010 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows (the Group), the Company Income 
Statement, the Company Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Company Statement of Financial Position, the Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the Company Statement 
of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 34 (the ﬁnancial 
statements).  The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 1 13A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 43, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group and Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion: 
 the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2010 and of the Group’s proﬁt and the Company’s loss for the 
year then ended; 
 the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
 the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
 the ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 The part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2008 
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review.

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – GROUP AND COMPANY
1.   Authorisation of ﬁnancial statements and 
statement of compliance with IFRS
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 22 February 201 1 and the respective statements 
of ﬁnancial position were signed on the Board’s behalf by Rupert 
Pennant-Rea. Henderson Group plc is a public limited company 
incorporated in Jersey and tax resident in the Republic of Ireland. 
The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the LSE and CDIs 
are traded on the ASX. 
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. 
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and by the 
Company are set out in note 2.
2.  Accounting policies
2.1  Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements have been  
prepared on a going concern basis and on the historical cost basis, 
except for certain ﬁnancial instruments that have been measured 
at fair value. 
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements are presented  
in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest  
one hundred thousand pounds (£0.1m), except when  
otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group comprise the 
ﬁnancial statements of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries 
as at 31 December each year. 
The ﬁnancial statements of all the Group’s signiﬁcant subsidiaries 
are prepared to the same year end date as that of the Company. 
The accounts of all material subsidiaries are prepared under either 
IFRS or UK GAAP. Where prepared under UK GAAP, balances 
reported by subsidiaries are adjusted to meet IFRS requirements 
for the purpose of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, 
as appropriate. Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the results for the period 
of the reporting year during which the Group had control. Non-
controlling interests represent the equity interests in subsidiaries 
not fully held by the Group.
Interests in property closed-ended funds, private equity 
infrastructure funds, Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) 
and unit trusts are accounted for as subsidiaries, associates, joint 
ventures or other ﬁnancial investments depending on the holdings 
of the Group and on the level of inﬂuence and control that the 
Group exercises. Strategic shareholder investments in associates, 
where the Group has the ability to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence as 
well as joint ventures where there is joint control, are accounted for 
using the equity method.
Income recognition
Fee income and commission receivable
Fee income includes management fees, transaction fees and 
performance fees (including earned carried interest). Management 
fees and transaction fees are recognised in the accounting period 
in which the associated investment management or transaction 
services are provided. Performance fees are recognised when 
the prescribed performance hurdles have been achieved and it 
is probable that the fee will crystallise as a result. The Group’s 
policy is to accrue 95% of the expected fee on satisfaction that 
the recognition criteria have established a performance fee is 
due, with the balance recognised on cash settlement. Initial fees 
and commission receivable are deferred and amortised over the 
anticipated period in which services will be provided, determined 
by reference to the average term of investors in each product on 
which commissions are earned. Other income is recognised in the 
accounting period in which services are rendered.
Carried interest
The Group is entitled to receive a share of proﬁts (carried interest) 
from certain private equity funds it manages, once the funds meet 
certain performance conditions. Where the funds’ investments 
constitute large volumes in relatively illiquid markets, the Group 
does not deem it appropriate to recognise unearned carried 
interest based on current fair values. However, where the value 
of the carried interest will be determined by the future disposal 
of investments which are quoted on a recognised exchange, then 
the Group will recognise carried interest to the extent deemed 
prudent. Carried interest for all other types of investments is only 
recognised when investments are disposed of and performance 
conditions are met.
Finance income
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective 
interest rate method. Dividend income from investments is 
recognised on the date that the right to receive payment has  
been established.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses on ﬁnancial assets
See policy set out under ﬁnancial instruments on page 55.
Operating leases
All leases are classiﬁed as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Beneﬁts received and 
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also 
spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Post-employment beneﬁts
The Group provides employees with retirement beneﬁts through 
both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution schemes. The 
assets of these schemes are held separately from the Group’s 
general assets in trustee administered funds. 
Deﬁned beneﬁt obligations and the cost of providing beneﬁts 
are determined annually by independent qualiﬁed actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method. The obligation is measured as 
the present value of the estimated future cash outﬂows using 
a discount rate based on AA rated corporate bond yields of 
appropriate duration. The resulting surplus or deﬁcit of deﬁned 
beneﬁt assets less liabilities is recognised in the statement of 
ﬁnancial position. The Group’s expense related to these schemes 
is accrued over the employees’ service lives, based upon the 
actuarial cost for the accounting period, having considered interest 
costs and the expected return on assets. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
in the accounting period in which they occur. Normal contributions 
to the deﬁned contribution scheme are charged to the income 
statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules 
of the scheme.
Other post-employment beneﬁts, such as medical care and life 
insurance, are also provided for certain employees. The costs 
of such beneﬁts are accrued over the employees’ service lives, 
based upon the actuarial cost for the accounting period using a 
methodology similar to that for deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. The valuation methodology, 
assumptions and schemes are disclosed in note 10.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair 
value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The awards are  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – GROUP AND COMPANY – CONTINUED 54
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
expensed, with a corresponding increase in reserves, on either 
a straight-line basis or a graded basis (depending on vesting 
conditions) over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The expected life 
of the awards used in the determination of fair value is adjusted 
for, based on management’s best estimate, the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions, market performance and 
behavioural considerations.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair 
value at the grant date. The fair value is expensed over the period 
until vesting, with recognition of a corresponding liability. The 
liability is remeasured at each reporting date up to and including 
the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement.
Income and sales taxes
The Group provides for current tax expense according to the tax 
laws of each jurisdiction in which it operates, using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial reporting 
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are not recognised 
if they arise from goodwill, however, they are recognised on 
separately identiﬁed intangible assets. If the deferred tax arises 
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, 
other than a business combination, that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither the accounting nor taxable proﬁt or 
loss, it is not accounted for. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts 
will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for taxable differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and 
joint ventures where the Group controls the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences and where the reversal of the 
temporary differences is not anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Income tax relating to items recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income is also recognised in that statement 
and not in the income statement. 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales 
tax, except where the sales tax is not recoverable, in which case 
the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of 
the asset or as part of expenses. Receivables and payables are 
stated with the amount of sales tax included. The net amount of 
sales tax recoverable from, or payable, to the taxation authority, 
is included separately in receivables or payables in the statement 
of ﬁnancial position.
Business combinations
Under the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, all 
business combinations are accounted for using the purchase 
method (acquisition accounting). The cost of a business 
combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of 
exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and 
equity instruments issued by the acquirer. The fair value of a 
business combination is calculated at the acquisition date by 
recognising the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their 
fair values at that date. The acquisition date is the date on which 
the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. The cost 
of a business combination in excess of fair value of net identiﬁable 
assets or liabilities acquired, including intangible assets identiﬁed, 
is recognised as goodwill. Any costs incurred in relation to a 
business combination after 1 July 2009 are expensed when the 
services are received.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised in the consolidated 
statement of ﬁnancial position. Goodwill on acquisitions prior to 
1 January 2004 is carried at its value on 1 January 2004 less 
any subsequent impairments. 
Goodwill arising on investments in associates and joint ventures is 
included within the carrying value of the equity accounted investments.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently 
if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
be impaired. For this purpose, management prepares a valuation 
for each cash generating unit based on value in use. This valuation 
is based on the approved forecasts for future years, extrapolated 
for expected future growth rates, and discounted at the Group’s 
risk adjusted discount rate. Where the value in use is less than 
the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised. Where goodwill 
forms part of an entity or sub-group and the entity or sub-group or 
part thereof is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the entity 
or sub-group disposed of is included in the carrying amount of 
the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately through the consolidated 
income statement and cannot subsequently be reversed.
Investment management contracts
Investment management contracts have been identiﬁed as a 
separately identiﬁable intangible asset arising on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. Intangible assets are recognised at the present value 
of the expected future cash ﬂows of the investment management 
contracts acquired. The intangible asset is amortised on a straight-
line basis over the expected life of the investment management 
contracts, currently estimated at approximately eight years. 
Computer software
The costs of purchasing and developing computer software, 
together with associated relevant expenditure, are capitalised 
where it is probable that future economic beneﬁts that are 
attributable to the assets will ﬂow to the Group and the cost of the 
assets can be measured reliably. Computer software is included 
in the statement of ﬁnancial position as an intangible asset and 
is recorded initially at cost and then amortised over its expected 
useful life of between three and ﬁve years on a straight-line basis. 
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is valued at cost and depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over its useful economic life of between two 
and 20 years.
An item of plant and equipment is removed upon disposal or 
when no future economic beneﬁts are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal 
of the asset, calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the item, is included in the 
income statement in the year the item is sold or retired.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments by the Company in subsidiary undertakings are held 
at cost less any impairment where circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Equity accounted investments
Equity accounted investments comprise investments in associates 
and joint ventures held by the Group. Investments are recognised

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
initially at cost. The investments are subsequently carried at 
cost adjusted for the Group’s share of proﬁts or losses and other 
changes in comprehensive income of the associate or joint 
venture, less any dividends or distributions received by the Group. 
The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of 
proﬁts or losses for the year. 
Deferred acquisition and commission costs
For investment management contracts, incremental acquisition 
costs are deferred to the extent that they are recoverable out of 
future income. This includes initial commission paid by the Group in 
respect of certain investment products. These costs are amortised 
over the period in which they are expected to be recovered out 
of margins from matching revenues from related contracts. At 
the end of each accounting period, deferred acquisition and 
commission costs are reviewed for recoverability against future 
margins from the related contracts in force at the reporting date.
Placement fees are deferred and amortised over the expected 
investment period of the fund. Where the actual investment period 
is signiﬁcantly shorter than expected, the amortisation rate is 
accelerated accordingly.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill and 
ﬁnancial assets)
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is 
any indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator 
of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the 
recoverable amount, being the higher of an asset’s fair value less 
cost to sell, and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their net present 
value using a risk adjusted discount rate that reﬂects a current 
market assessment of the time value of money and the risks 
speciﬁc to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the statement of 
ﬁnancial position, when the Group becomes party to the contractual 
provisions of an instrument, at fair value adjusted for transaction 
costs, except for ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss, where transaction costs are immediately recognised 
in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when 
the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the investments have expired or 
where they have been transferred and the Group has also transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities 
cease to be recognised when the obligation under the liability has 
been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Financial assets
Purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets are recognised at the 
trade date, being the date when the purchase or sale becomes 
contractually due for settlement. Delivery and settlement terms are 
usually determined by established practices in the market concerned.
Debt securities, equity securities and holdings in authorised 
collective investment schemes are designated as either fair value 
through proﬁt or loss, or available-for-sale, and are measured at 
subsequent reporting dates at fair value. The Group determines 
the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets on initial recognition. 
Financial assets classiﬁed as fair value through proﬁt or loss 
comprise the Group’s manager box positions in OEICs and unit 
trusts, which are recorded on a fair value basis. Where securities 
are designated as fair value through proﬁt or loss, gains and 
losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the 
income statement.
For available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair value which are not part of a designated 
hedge relationship are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. When an asset is disposed of, the 
cumulative changes in fair value, previously recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income, are taken to the income 
statement in the current accounting period.
Unrealised gains and losses on ﬁnancial assets represent the 
difference between the fair value of ﬁnancial assets at the 
reporting date and cost or, if these have been previously revalued, 
the fair value at the last reporting date. Realised gains and losses 
on ﬁnancial assets are calculated as the difference between the 
net sales proceeds and cost or amortised cost. 
Where a fall in the value of an investment is prolonged or 
signiﬁcant, this is considered an indication of impairment. In 
such an event, the investment is written down to fair value and the 
amounts previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income in respect of cumulative changes in fair value, are taken to 
the income statement as an impairment charge.
Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day payment 
terms, are initially recognised at fair value, normally equivalent 
to the invoice amount and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. When the time value of money is material, the fair value is 
discounted. Provision for speciﬁc doubtful debts is made when 
there is evidence that the Group will not be able to recover 
balances in full. Balances are written off when the receivable 
amount is deemed irrecoverable.
Cash amounts represent cash in hand and on-demand deposits. 
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with 
same day or next day maturity.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities including trade payables are stated at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost 
is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any 
discount or premium on settlement. A ﬁnancial liability ceases 
to be recognised when the obligation under the liability has been 
discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging
The Group may, from time to time, use derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments to hedge against price, interest rate, foreign currency 
and credit risk. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed 
as ﬁnancial assets when the fair value is positive or as ﬁnancial 
liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
At the inception of a hedge, the Group formally designates and 
documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to 
apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such hedges are expected 
to be effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value and 
are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have 
been effective throughout the reporting periods for which they 
were designated and are expected to remain effective over the 
remaining hedge period.
Currency hedges
Forward currency contracts are used to hedge the currency 
nominal value of certain Euro and US dollar denominated 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets and are classiﬁed as fair value 
hedges. The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is 
recognised in the income statement. The change in the fair value 
of the hedged item, attributable to the risk being hedged, is also 
recognised in the income statement, offsetting the fair value 
changes arising on the designated hedge instrument.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments traded in active markets 
(such as publicly traded securities and derivatives) is based on 
quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted market 
price used for ﬁnancial instruments is the current bid price. The fair  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – GROUP AND COMPANY – CONTINUED 56
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
value of ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active 
market is determined using valuation techniques commonly used 
by market participants, including the use of comparable recent 
arm’s length transactions, discounted cash ﬂow analysis and 
option pricing models.
Provisions
Provisions which are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, 
are recognised when: the Group has a present obligation, legal 
or constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that 
an outﬂow of resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be 
required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount of the obligation. In the event that the 
time value of money is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at a discount rate 
that reﬂects a current market assessment of the time value of 
money and, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability. 
When discounting, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a ﬁnance charge.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is GBP. Transactions 
in foreign currencies are recorded at the appropriate exchange 
rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency 
monetary balances at the reporting date are converted at 
the prevailing exchange rate. Foreign currency non-monetary 
balances carried at fair value or cost are translated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value or cost is determined. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are taken to the income 
statement, except for available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets where the 
unhedged changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operations whose functional currency is not GBP are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and 
expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the 
accounting period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are taken 
through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
to the translation reserve. In the period in which the operation 
is disposed of, these translation differences are then recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.
Equity shares
The Company’s ordinary equity shares of 12.5 pence each are 
classiﬁed as equity instruments. Equity shares issued by the 
Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received 
or the market price at the day of issue. Direct issue costs, net of 
tax, are deducted from equity through share premium. When share 
capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including 
directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Own shares held
Own shares held are equity shares of the Company acquired 
by or issued to employee beneﬁt trusts. Own shares held are 
recorded at cost and are deducted from equity. No gain or loss 
is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, issue, 
sale or cancellation of the Company’s own equity shares. 
Dividend recognition
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are 
paid and, in the case of ﬁnal dividends, when these are approved 
by the Company’s shareholders at the AGM. Dividend distributions 
are recognised in equity.
2.2   Signiﬁcant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
management has made signiﬁcant judgements involving 
estimations and assumptions which are summarised below:
Impairment of goodwill
As explained on page 54, goodwill is reviewed for impairment 
annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired.
The judgement exercised by management in arriving at this 
valuation includes the selection of market growth rates, fund 
ﬂow assumptions, expected margins and costs. Further details 
are given in note 13.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled share schemes at fair 
value at the date of grant and expenses them over the vesting period 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The liability for cash-settled share schemes represents the 
estimated transaction cost up to the settlement date, taking into 
account historical experience of good and bad leavers. 
Impairment of available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are reviewed for impairment 
on a semi-annual basis or more frequently as required. In 
speciﬁc cases, where a quoted market price or fair value is not 
available, signiﬁcant judgement is exercised by management in 
determining the extent of impairment, taking into account other 
available market data. Management also exercises judgement in 
determining whether a decrease in the value of an asset meets 
the prolonged or signiﬁcant tests.
Pension and other post-employment beneﬁts
The costs of and period end obligations under deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The 
actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount 
rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term 
nature of these schemes, such estimates are subject to signiﬁcant 
uncertainty. Further details are given in note 21.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against 
which the losses can be utilised. Signiﬁcant management judgement 
is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that 
can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future 
taxable proﬁts together with future tax planning strategies.
Provisions
By their nature, provisions often reﬂect signiﬁcant levels of 
judgement by management. The nature and amount of the 
provisions included in the statement of ﬁnancial position are 
detailed in note 22 and contingencies not provided for are 
disclosed in note 32.
Accrued income
Accrued income is based on latest available information and 
involves a degree of estimation. The most signiﬁcant estimation 
relates to the accrual of performance fees as described on 
page 53.

HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
Consolidation of seed investments
From time to time, the Group provides seed capital on the launch 
of its products, such as UCITSs, SICAVs, hedge funds and other 
investment vehicles. The seed capital investments vary in duration 
depending on the nature of the investment, with a typical range 
of less than one year for Listed Asset products and between 
three and seven years for Private Equity and Property funds, and 
represent less than 50% of the underlying fund’s equity. Given 
the limited size and nature of these investments, the Group does 
not consider itself to have signiﬁcant inﬂuence or control over the 
underlying funds to merit accounting for them using the equity 
method or consolidating them in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. 
2.3  Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in this Annual Report and 
Accounts are consistent with those of the previous ﬁnancial year, 
except in relation to the following revised and amended standards 
set by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised)
This standard, which the Group adopted in 2010, introduced 
a number of changes to accounting for business combinations 
which will impact the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. 
The amendments will also impact the reported results in the period 
that an acquisition occurs as well as future results. During 2010, 
the Group acquired no new businesses. 
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements (amendment)
This standard requires that a change in the ownership interest 
of a subsidiary (without loss of control) is accounted for as an 
equity transaction and such transactions will no longer give rise 
to goodwill or gains or losses. Furthermore, on the loss of control 
of a subsidiary, the retained interest will be remeasured to fair 
value and therefore impact the gain or loss on disposal.
IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows (effective 1 January 2010), which 
clairﬁes the treatment of expenditure recognised as a cash ﬂow 
from investing activities and IAS 38 Intangible Assets (effective 
1 July 2009) which discusses intangible assets as a result of 
a business combination have been amended due to the revision 
of IFRS 3. Additionally, IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (effective 
1 January 2010) considers the treatment of units of accounting 
for goodwill. None of these changes has a material impact on 
the Group’s net income or equity.
2.4  Future changes in accounting policies
During the course of the year, the IASB and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee issued a number 
of new accounting standards, amendments to existing standards 
and interpretations. The following new standard is not applicable to 
these ﬁnancial statements but is expected to have an impact when 
it becomes effective. The Group plans to apply this standard in the

2010
FSCS interim levy
In November 2010, the FSCS indicated that it would raise an interim levy on investment managers in respect of claims received primarily 
from investors in Keydata Investment Services Limited (in administration). The Group has provided for this levy in full during 2010. 
Goodwill impairment
The goodwill allocated to the NSIM cash generating unit, (a specialised segregated company formerly part of New Star), as a result of an 
earn out deal in respect of that company, has been impaired in full as a result of a 50% decline in AUM.
Towry Law International provision release
During the second half of 2010, the majority of a previously recognised product mis-selling provision, relating to legacy Towry Law 
International products, was deemed no longer required and was released. This resulted in a £5.8m credit in 2010.
Non-recurring tax
During the second half of 2010, HMRC closed enquiries into certain prior year tax ﬁlings, resulting in the Group releasing tax provisions 
of £16.4m.
2009
Impairment of available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets – property seed capital
In accordance with the impairment tests under IAS 39, three available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets invested in property funds were impaired 
during 2009. These were written down to their fair values at 31 December 2009, resulting in a charge of £7.3m. 
Infrastructure fund charge
During 2009, the Group recognised an exceptional charge of £20.7m in respect of management fees on one of its infrastructure funds.
Insurance recoveries
During 2009, the Group reached agreement with insurers regarding a number of insurance claims made by Towry Law International and 
Henderson Global Investors in 2003 and 2004 under an AMP Limited run-off insurance policy, resulting in a net receivable of £14.3m. 
New Star integration costs 
On 9 April 2009, the Group’s acquisition of New Star was completed. An expense of £33.8m was incurred in relation to the integration 
of New Star during the period. These integration costs included costs in respect of fund mergers, rebranding, ofﬁce relocation and 
reorganisation, transition of outsourced retail and investment operations and staff related expenses.  61

10.  Share-based payments
Group
10.1 Share-based compensation plans
The following share-based compensation plans were in operation during 2010:
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The RSP is a scheme that allows employees to receive shares in the Company for £nil consideration at a future point, usually after three 
years. The awards are made typically for staff recruitment and retention purposes. Generally, the larger awards have a performance 
hurdle. The Remuneration Committee must approve all awards and the vesting of awards over £50,000. On vesting, in order to obtain 
the shares, the employee must satisfy any tax and national insurance obligations. 
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
The ESOP enables all staff, but not the Executive Directors, to voluntarily defer part of their annual bonus into the ESOP up to a 
speciﬁed limit. The ESOP provides one free matching share for every share purchased. To receive the matching shares, employees must 
remain in the plan for three years. The ESOP was offered in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Forfeiture conditions apply in the case of approved 
and unapproved leavers. No plan was offered in 2009 or 2010. Matching shares for the 2008 plans will vest in June 201 1.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP is a scheme that allows selected employees to be granted shares or nil cost options. The options are granted on condition that 
the selected employees remain with the Group, normally for three years after the grant date, and the performance conditions for the 
plans are as follows:
 
Criteria
Amount vesting 
2007 plan
Henderson Group TSR less than the 50th percentile of the FTSE 250 companies nil%
Henderson Group TSR at the 50th percentile of the FTSE 250 companies 35%
Henderson Group TSR at or above the 75th percentile of the FTSE 250 companies 100%
 
Criteria
Amount vesting 
2008 to 2010 plans
Henderson Group TSR less than the 50th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies nil%
Henderson Group TSR at the 50th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies 25%
Henderson Group TSR at or above the 75th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies 100%
For a Henderson Group TSR between the 50th and 75th percentiles, the amount vesting will increase on a linear basis. In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee must be satisﬁed the TSR reﬂects the underlying performance of the Group.
For the 2010 LTIP, certain employees who are US citizens have been awarded performance shares as opposed to nil cost options 
but the vesting and forfeiture criteria remain the same.
The employees are not entitled to vote or receive dividends in respect of these awards until the vesting conditions are met, nor are they 
allowed to pledge, hedge or assign the expected awards in any way.
In accordance with the scheme terms, the 2007 LTIP met its vesting conditions on 31 December 2009 and the awards vested in 
March 2010. The TSR performance condition resulted in 100% of the shares of the award being capable of exercise. The 2008 LTIP 
met its vesting conditions on 31 December 2010 and the awards will vest in February 201 1. The TSR performance condition resulted 
in 100% of the shares of the award being capable of exercise.
Deferred Equity Plan (DEP)
Under the Group’s remuneration policy, there is a requirement for employees who receive short-term incentive awards over a preset 
threshold to defer an element of their award. The majority of deferrals are deferred into the Company’s shares, with some deferrals into 
Group managed funds when it is deemed appropriate. The deferred monies are paid to the DEP trustee, who purchases shares or funds 
and holds them in trust. In 2007, these shares attracted one free matching share for every four shares awarded by the trustee. Since 
2008, there has been no matching share element.
Hedge fund performance fee deferrals are deferred into the hedge fund that provided the performance fee award and are held in trust 
for two years on a fully restricted basis and have no matching element.
Forfeiture conditions apply in the case of approved and unapproved leavers. Deferrals into the Company’s shares are held in trust for 
a minimum of one year. However, for the 2007 scheme the shares must be held in trust for three years in order to receive the free 
matching shares.
Deferrals relating to 2009 and 2010 performance awards are deferred into the Company’s shares for up to three years and vest in three 
equal tranches, starting in 201 1 and 2012 respectively.
Buy As You Earn Share Plan (BAYE)
This is an HMRC approved plan. Eligible employees who wish to purchase shares in the Company invest a monthly amount up to a 
maximum of £125, which is deducted from their gross salary. Each participating employee receives, for no additional payment, two free 
matching shares for each share purchased (partnership shares). Matching shares will be forfeited if purchased shares are withdrawn 
from the trust within one year. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – GROUP AND COMPANY – CONTINUED 64
HENDERSON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2010
10.  Share-based payments continued
10.1 Share-based compensation plans continued
The Group introduced an international version of the BAYE during 2010. It operates on a similar basis to the UK version, except that 
each participating employee receives one free matching share for each share purchased.
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The CSOP is a global plan that provides employees with an opportunity to buy shares after a three year vesting period at an option price 
ﬁxed at the start of the scheme. The CSOP is an HMRC approved share option plan; this means that the maximum value of unvested 
options at any time is limited to £30,000 for UK employees. No such restrictions apply for overseas employees. The share options are 
held in trust. There are no Group performance conditions attached to the options. At vesting, the employee must choose whether or 
not to exercise the options within two years of the vesting date. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the CSOP. A 2010 
CSOP was introduced during the year.
Executive Shared Ownership Plan (ExSOP)
The ExSOP is an employee shared ownership plan and is aimed at encouraging employee share ownership at middle management level. 
Executive Directors are excluded from participating in the ExSOP. 
Under the terms of the ExSOP, certain employees may be invited to acquire jointly with an employee beneﬁt trust, the beneﬁcial interest 
in a number of shares under the terms of a joint ownership agreement (JOA). Under a JOA, the employee will beneﬁt from any growth 
in value of the jointly owned shares from the time of the award in excess of a hurdle amount ﬁxed by the Board in respect of each award. 
For the 2010 ExSOP, the market price at grant was £1.24 per share. The hurdle price including the 9% carry charge was set at £1.35 
per share. The shares have a vesting period of three years. The employees have a further two years to take their portion of the jointly 
owned shares.
Sharesave scheme (SAYE)
The SAYE is an HMRC approved plan. UK employees may participate in more than one scheme but only up to a maximum of £250 
per month across all schemes. Eligible employees who participate in the SAYE contribute a monthly amount from their net salary to a 
savings account. The SAYE vesting period is three years for UK employees.
A 2010 SAYE was introduced during the year. At the end of a three year period, the employees in the 2010 SAYE can choose to 
exercise their share options using the funds in their account, together with a bonus, equivalent to 0.3 (2008 SAYE: 2.4 and 2009 SAYE: 
0.6) times the monthly saving amount, to subscribe for shares at a preset price, this being £1.00 (2008 SAYE: £0.76 and 2009 SAYE: 
£0.58) per share, a 20% discount to the average share price on the ﬁrst ﬁve working days of March 2010 (2008 SAYE: 3 March 2008 
and 2009 SAYE: 4 March 2009). Employees have up to six months after the 36 month period to exercise their options and subscribe 
for shares. Forfeiture provisions apply in the case of approved and unapproved leavers. The 2007 SAYE vested in 2010.
In 2006, the Group launched the USA Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP). A 2010 ESPP was also introduced during the year. 
The ESPP works broadly on the same principles as the UK SAYE but has a 24 month savings period, a lower discount level at 15% 
and no bonus element. The preset option price was USD1.62 (2008 ESPP: USD1.61 and 2009 ESPP: USD0.88). Employees may 
participate in more than one plan but only up to a plan maximum of USD312.50 per month across all plans.

Dividends proposed on ordinary shares for approval  
by the shareholders at the AGM
Final dividend for 2H10 (2H09) 38.8 4.65 35.1 4.25
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend for 2H10 of 4.65 pence per share which, when added to the interim 1H10 dividend of 1.85 
pence per share, results in a total dividend for 2010 of 6.50 pence per share. 
The dividend proposed in respect of 2H10 of £38.8m is based on the total number of ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 2010. 
As referred to in note 34, an additional £1 1.3m of dividends may be payable as a result of the Gartmore Acquisition. 
The difference between the proposed dividends (2H09 ﬁnal: £35.1m, 1H10 interim: £15.3m), as reported in the 2009 Annual Report 
and Accounts and the Interim Results for the six months to 30 June 2010, and the dividends paid out during the year (2H09 ﬁnal: 
£34.1m, 1H10 interim: £14.9m), represents a decrease of £1.4m due to the dividends waived by employee beneﬁt trust trustees 
on shares held in trust on behalf of Group employees. The amount waived in respect of the ﬁnal dividend declared for 2010 will be 
established by the employee beneﬁt trust trustees on 6 May 201 1, being the dividend record date.
Pursuant to the Income Access Share arrangements, shareholders in the Company are able to elect to receive their dividends from 
a UK source. Shareholders will be deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the Income Access Share arrangements 
unless they have elected to receive them directly from the Company. All elections remain in force indeﬁnitely unless revoked. 
Shareholders who have opted out of the Income Access Share arrangements will receive dividends from an Irish source and will be 
taxed accordingly. 67

The Group considered itself to have two cash generating units to which goodwill was allocated, being NSIM, formerly part of the New 
Star group, as one and the rest of the Group as the other. As part of the NSIM earn out deal, NSIM was valued at £13.5m whilst the net 
assets acquired were £4.8m, resulting in an allocation of £8.7m of purchased goodwill. Management conducted a valuation of NSIM 
based on the budgets and forecasts approved by the Board. Based on this valuation, the goodwill allocated to NSIM is impaired in full 
and as a result a charge of £8.7m is recognised in the Group’s consolidated income statement as a non-recurring item. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill for the rest of the Group at 31 December 2010 has been determined from a value in use 
calculation, using the budgets and forecasts approved by the Board and a terminal value for the period thereafter. The key growth 
assumptions used in the budgets and forecasts include assumptions on market movements, business growth, margins, business 
investment and inﬂation. The terminal value has been calculated assuming a long-term growth rate of 2% per annum in perpetuity, 
based on the Group’s view of long-term nominal growth. A risk adjusted discount rate of 1 1.6% per annum has been applied.
The resultant value in use calculation has been compared with the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if any goodwill impairment 
arises. The calculation shows signiﬁcant headroom in the recoverable amount of goodwill. 
The value in use calculation has been ﬂexed for a 25% reduction in annual fund ﬂows, a 40% drop in markets in 201 1 with a recovery 
after two years and a corresponding decrease in costs. This calculation also shows headroom in the recoverable amount of goodwill. 
The ability of the Group to manage its cost base during periods of market weakness has not been factored into this scenario, but would 
further increase headroom in the recoverable amount of goodwill.
Recent market transactions and the Group’s current market capitalisation provide additional evidence that the recoverable amount of 
goodwill is in excess of the carrying amount. 69

The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge various ﬁnancial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency and therefore applies fair value hedge accounting. In 2008, an interest rate swap held on the debt was unwound and the 
cumulative fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the debt up to the date of unwinding, is being amortised and the charge is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement over the remaining term of the debt, which matures on 2 May 2012 (refer to note 20).
Debtor and creditor balances, included in the tables above, are mainly balances settling in a short time frame, and accordingly, the fair 
value of these assets and liabilities is considered to be materially equal to their carrying value after taking into account any likely impairment. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – GROUP AND COMPANY – CONTINUED 72

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of ﬁnancial assets by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs, which have a signiﬁcant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly 
or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a signiﬁcant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.

Debt instrument in issue 179.1 179.2 181.9 173.5
The debt instrument in issue represents £175m senior, unrated, ﬁxed rate notes listed on the LSE. The debt instrument is unsecured and 
repayable in full on 2 May 2012 and bears interest at a ﬁxed rate of 6.5% per annum payable every six months. The debt instrument was 
issued by HGI Group Limited (HGIGL), a subsidiary of the Company. 
The Group swapped the ﬁxed interest coupon into a ﬂoating rate on issue of the debt. The swap was unwound on 9 December 2008 
and the fair value adjustment to the debt carrying value, attributable to the hedged interest rate risk up to the date of unwinding the swap, 
£10.5m, is being amortised over the remaining term of the debt. As at 31 December 2010, £4.1m (2009: £7.2m) remains to be amortised.
On 30 January 2009, the Group entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks. The facility limit was £25m 
and was due to terminate on 31 March 2012. The Group has not drawn on the facility since entering into the agreement. As referred to 
in note 34, subsequent to 31 December 2010 the Group has cancelled this facility.

The Pension Scheme does not hold any investments in employer-related companies.
The expected return on assets assumption is the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the portfolios as shown above. 
The expected rate of return on assets is based on long-term expectations as at 31 December 2010. The expected rate of return on 
bonds and swaps, constituting the risk reducing portfolio, has been set by reference to current market yields on long-dated government 
bonds. The rates of return for the equities, property and cash asset classes, constituting the return seeking and cash portfolios, have 
been based on the Group’s expectations of investment returns over the longer term.

On 8 July 2010, the UK Government announced its intention that statutory minimum pension indexation for private sector UK pension 
schemes would, in future, be linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than RPI, and the consultation period ends on 2 March 201 1. 
As a result, the Group has continued to value the liabilities in the Pension Scheme using RPI rather than CPI. 77

21.2 Henderson Group unapproved pension schemes
The Group operates three unapproved pension schemes, the details of which are provided below:
The Pearl Executive Scheme. Members of this scheme are also members of the Pension Scheme. However, pensionable earnings under 
the Pension Scheme are limited to 1/60th for each year of service and the earnings cap. The Pearl Executive Scheme provides beneﬁts 
at 1/30th for each year of service with a maximum of two thirds of salary after 20 years’ service based on pensionable earnings above 
the earnings cap, on an unfunded basis.
The Henderson Top Up Scheme. Members of this scheme are also members of the Pension Scheme. However, pensionable earnings 
under the Pension Scheme are limited to the earnings cap, and the Henderson Top Up Scheme enables beneﬁts to be based on 
pensionable earnings without restriction of the earnings cap. These additional uncapped beneﬁts are provided on an unfunded basis. 
There is also an unfunded liability in respect of one member, to whom the Group has made a contractual promise to pay a ﬁxed pension 
from age 60.

During 2010, £17.7m was recognised in equity in relation to deferred tax. This represents the amount by which the expected tax 
deduction exceeds the cumulative remuneration expense for share-based payments. 
The change in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% resulted in a reduction of £0.9m in the net deferred tax liability. The 
Government has announced its intention to reduce the UK corporation tax rate by 1% per annum to 24% effective from 1 April 2014. 
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date during this period will reﬂect the change in UK corporation tax 
rate enacted or substantially enacted at that reporting date.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had unused tax losses in respect of which no deferred tax has been recognised as utilisation of 
the losses is dependent on future proﬁts. The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of trading losses carried forward is £29.9m 
(2009: £26.7m). The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of capital losses carried forward is £16.1m (2009: £16.1m). The trading 
and capital losses have no expiry date. 
Consistent with prior years, deferred tax is not recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with the Group’s 
investments in overseas subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures where the Group controls the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences and where the reversal of the temporary differences is not anticipated in the foreseeable future.

28.  Financial risk management
Financial risk management objectives and policies
Financial assets principally comprise investments in equity securities, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and cash 
and cash equivalents. Financial liabilities comprise borrowings for ﬁnancing purposes, certain provisions and trade and other payables. 
The main risks arising from ﬁnancial instruments are price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. 
Each of these risks is discussed in detail below. The Group monitors ﬁnancial risks on a consolidated basis and intra-Group balances 
are settled when it is deemed appropriate for both parties to the transaction. The Company is not exposed to material ﬁnancial risk and 
separate disclosures for the Company have not been included.
The Group has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk 
management practices appropriate for a listed company. The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board and 
overseen by the Risk Committee.
28.1 Price risk
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the proﬁtability of the Group.
The Group is exposed to price risk in respect of seed capital investments in Henderson funds (available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets). 
Seed capital investments vary in duration, depending on the nature of the investment, with a typical range of less than one year for 
Listed Asset products and between three and seven years for Private Equity and Property funds. The total market value of seed capital 
investments at 31 December 2010 was £46.6m (2009: £41.7m). 
Management monitors exposures to price risk on an ongoing basis. Signiﬁcant movements in investment values are monitored on a daily 
basis. Where appropriate, management will hedge price risk. At 31 December 2010, investments with a carrying value of £2.9m (2009: 
£nil) were hedged against price risk through the use of contracts for difference (CFDs).
A fall in the value of an investment which is prolonged or signiﬁcant is considered to be objective evidence of impairment under IAS 39. 
In such an event, an investment is written down to its fair value and cumulative amounts previously recognised in equity, in respect of 
market value and unhedged foreign exchange movements on the investment, are recognised in the consolidated income statement as 
an impairment charge.

28.2 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest rates, either through a mismatch of 
interest-bearing assets and liabilities, or through the effect such movements have on the value of interest-bearing assets. The Group is 
exposed to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are not currently 
exposed to interest rate risk. This exposure is monitored by management on a continuing basis.

Interest on ﬁnancial instruments classiﬁed as ﬂoating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on ﬁnancial instruments 
classiﬁed as ﬁxed rate is ﬁxed until the maturity of the instrument. 
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis on the consolidated income statement has been performed on the basis of a 50bps per annum fall 
in interest rates at the beginning of the year. The impact of such a decrease would reduce ﬁnance income by approximately £0.9m per 
annum in the consolidated income statement. 85

28.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
Group liquidity is managed on a daily basis by Group ﬁnance, to ensure that the Group always has sufﬁcient cash or highly liquid assets 
available to meet its liabilities. Group ﬁnance also controls and monitors the use of the Group’s non-operating capital resources. It is the 
Group’s policy to ensure that it has access to funds to cover all forecast commitments for at least the next 12 months. 
The maturity dates of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities and obligations are as follows:

28.4 Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk through its exposure to non-GBP income and expenses, assets and liabilities of its 
overseas subsidiaries as well as net assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than GBP. The currency exposure is managed 
by closely monitoring foreign currency positions. The Group also uses foreign currency contracts to reduce or eliminate the currency 
exposure on certain individual transactions. The Group also seeks to use natural hedges to reduce exposure. Where there is a mismatch 
on material currency ﬂows, which are reasonably certain, they are actively hedged. Where there is insufﬁcient certainty, the currency is 
translated back into GBP on receipt. In addition, the Group carries a small foreign exchange position as principal to facilitate the smooth 
conduct of its client business.
Foreign currency risk management is overseen by the Hedge Committee and hedge effectiveness is reported to the Board monthly.
A rolling programme of forward currency contracts has been implemented to hedge the currency exposures arising from certain 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, with a year end notional value of USD44.7m and €7.8m (2009: USD49.2m and €12.5m) (refer to 
note 28.6).
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are either denominated in GBP or hedged back to GBP using foreign currency forward contracts 
based on the Group’s hedging policy. However, there remain some available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets which are not fully hedged as they 
fall below the policy level for implementing hedging arrangements. In addition, there are unhedged foreign currency cash balances in 
overseas subsidiaries of the Group.
The table below illustrates the impact of adjusting year end exchange rates on all unhedged ﬁnancial assets and cash balances 
denominated in a currency other than GBP:

28.  Financial risk management continued
28.5 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty of the Group defaulting on funds deposited with it or the non-receipt of a trade debt. 
The Group has an established credit policy to ensure that it only transacts with counterparties that are able to meet satisfactory rating 
requirements. Counterparty limits are reviewed and set centrally by the Credit Risk Committee. Management is responsible for ensuring 
that it remains within these limits and the risk management function monitors and reports any exceptions to policy. The Group has not 
suffered any losses as a result of trade debtor defaults during the year.
The risk management function is also responsible for reporting credit exposures to the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis and for 
ensuring that any credit concerns are raised and actions taken to mitigate risks.

28.6 Hedging activities
At 31 December 2010, the Group held CFDs to hedge the price risk arising from certain available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. These have 
been assessed as effective fair value hedges. The net realised and unrealised loss arising on these and other instruments entered into 
throughout the year amounted to £0.4m (2009: £nil) and has been offset in the consolidated income statement by £0.5m (2009: £nil), 
being the net realised and unrealised gain on available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets in designated hedging relationships during the year. 
At 31 December 2010, the fair value and notional amount of the CFDs was £nil (2009: £nil).
At 31 December 2010, the Group held two forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk arising from available-for-sale 
ﬁnancial assets denominated in Euro and US dollars (refer to note 28.4).
These forward exchange contracts have been assessed as effective fair value hedges. The net realised and unrealised loss arising 
on these and other instruments entered into throughout the year amounted to £0.7m (2009: loss £0.4m) and has been offset in the 
consolidated income statement by £0.6m (2009: £0.4m), being the net realised and unrealised foreign exchange gain on available-for-
sale ﬁnancial assets in designated hedging relationships during the year.

of 30 months. The rental expense on this lease is being recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
On acquisition of New Star, the Group became party to two further material operating leases. These are in relation to 1 Knightsbridge

The Group did not acquire any subsidiaries during the current year.

New Star was £94.2m and included cash consideration of £68.8m and equity consideration of £21.2m, being 25,774,190 new ordinary 
shares in the Company at their market price on the LSE on the date of issue. The fair value of the net assets of New Star at the date of 
acquisition was £36.2m and the goodwill accounted for was £61.4m.

34.  Events after the reporting date

for each Gartmore share. In addition, the New Henderson Shares will rank for the ﬁnal 2010 dividend of 4.65 pence per share at a total 
cost of £1 1.3m.
The Group has entered into multicurrency term and GBP revolving loan facilities which may be utilised by the Group to meet post-
Gartmore Acquisition debt obligations and for general corporate and working capital purposes. As a result, the Group has cancelled

signiﬁ cant growth.
The Group achieved revenues 
of £11.28 million (2006: £9.67 million), up 
17 per cent. compared to last year including 
the acquisition of Immediacy Limited. 
The Group reported an EBITDA loss excluding 
non-cash exceptional items of £1.30 million 
(2006: proﬁ t £0.96 million) for the full year. 
During the year, the Group lost £1.06 million on 
providing the Pepperio roll-out. Excluding this 
investment and the investment in US expansion, 
the Group was break-even at EBITDA level.
As at 30th September 2007 the Group had
£1.78 million (2006: £1.08 million) in cash 
excluding a three year term loan due 
of £1.90 million (2006: £nil).
In July 2007, the Group concluded the 
acquisition of Immediacy Limited which added 
a new product to the Group’s product portfolio 
addressing the medium sized enterprise market. 
The business has enjoyed signiﬁ cant growth in 
this market sector and this continued to be the 
case post-acquisition, reporting results slightly 
ahead of expectations during the last quarter.
Morello had a mixed year. Having enjoyed 
a proﬁ table ﬁ rst half, reporting signiﬁ cant wins 
at the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁ ce and 
Ofﬁ ce of Fair Trading, the second half proved to 
be more challenging. The Group had anticipated 
that the launch of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce SharePoint 
Server (MOSS) 2007 would be a disruptive 
event in the Morello market and to counter this 
developed an innovative MOSS Connector to 
allow customers to leverage MOSS content in 
Morello. The Group experienced extended sales 
cycles whilst customers digested 
the merits of MOSS 2007 who eventually 
concluded that the Microsoft product did 
not meet the needs of Enterprise Content 
Management. In addition, sales opportunities 
in the Group’s ﬁ nancial vertical were also 
delayed by the turmoil in the Financial Markets 
toward the end of our ﬁ nancial year. As a 
consequence, Morello revenues grew by a 
modest 5 per cent. compared to last year. 
In line with stated policy, earnings for the 
foreseeable future will be reinvested to ﬁ nance 
the growth of the Group and acquisition 
strategy. Consequently the Directors do not 
recommend the payment of a dividend.
(2006: £Nil) 
 
The Board is now conﬁ dent that the Group’s 
prospects are much improved as a result of the 
cost savings made. We now have every reason 
to believe that further progress will be achieved 
based on an encouraging start to the new 
ﬁ nancial year.
In conclusion, I would like to express my 
appreciation to all the management, staff 
and shareholders for their continued 
support during the year.

Chairman’s statement
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30th September 2007
MD2243– AR07 AW02.indd   2 MD2243– AR07 AW02.indd   2 26/2/08   13:49:32 26/2/08   13:49:32 The year ended 30th September 2007 was 
characterised by two very different halves to 
the year. In the ﬁ rst half the Company delivered 
revenues of £6.06 million and an EBITDA of 
£0.47 million. This was based on continued 
strong sales successes around the major 
Morello product line, coupled with exceptionally 
strong demand for professional services and a 
growing pre-contracted maintenance annuity 
stream. During the ﬁ rst half, the business 
enjoyed a number of high proﬁ le, high value 
new business sales wins including the Foreign 
and Commonwealth Ofﬁ ce, the Ofﬁ ce of Fair 
Trading and VRT, a major Belgian broadcaster. 
The second half of the year was much more 
challenging for the core Morello business. The 
professional services and maintenance revenue 
streams remained very strong with continued 
high demand for services and continued 
growth in the pre-contracted revenues for 
maintenance. The company ended the year 
with an annualised pre-contracted run rate of 
£3.26 million (2006: £2.50 million) for the Morello 
maintenance stream. The situation in Morello 
licence sales was however much more difﬁ cult. 
There were two principal contributing market 
factors which had a much greater impact on the 
sales result than had been anticipated by the 
management. Firstly, the launch of MOSS 2007 
in April resulted in a much greater marketplace 
overhang than expected. As a direct result, 
sales cycles were heavily delayed while 
customers’ internal teams were distracted into 
evaluating MOSS as a potential solution to their 
web content management needs. In reality, 
MOSS was deemed not a suitable product by 
the vast majority of potential customers and no 
deals were lost to MOSS, however the delays 
and associated sales efﬁ ciency impacts within 
the business did have a signiﬁ cant negative 
impact on the expected top line revenue. 
The second key impact was less predictable. 
The effect of the “credit crunch” following on 
from the issues in the US with respect to the 
sub-prime market resulted in uncertainty in one 
of our key markets, ﬁ nancial services. The effect 
of this so close to the year end on a market that 
typically represents approximately 25 per cent. 
of our revenues was dramatic as prospects 
suspended, postponed or delayed a signiﬁ cant 
number of sales cycles.
PEPPERIO
The Pepperio product line had a disappointing 
year after a very promising start. The early 
encouraging signs persuaded management to 
continue to invest in channel establishment 
and a high growth strategy. Unfortunately the 
channel strategy proved successful from a 
channel partner recruitment perspective but, 
with a few notable exceptions, the channel 
proved not so successful from a sales execution 
standpoint. The resulting numbers of customers, 
whilst continuing to grow, was disappointing 
in the second half of the year and consequently, 
following the trading announcement in October 
2007, signiﬁ cant cost reduction initiatives were 
implemented. The core Pepperio proposition 
remains compelling to both customers and 
partners alike and holds the long term prospect 
for the group of a secure annuity style revenue 
from the Software as a Service (SaaS) model. 
Expectations have accordingly been reset 
within the business and the costs associated 
with the product line dramatically reduced.
The business enjoyed
a number of high 
proﬁ le, high value 
new business
sales wins.
The professional services and maintenance 
revenue streams remained very strong.

Chief Executive’s report
Immediacy slightly exceeded expectations 
and is now a major contributor, representing 
around 30 per cent of overall business. 
Immediacy now 
represents 30% of 
the overall business.
ACQUISITION
Also in the second half, and on a far
more positive note, the Company acquired 
Immediacy Limited, a UK based provider of Web 
Content Management Software to two sectors; 
mid-sized companies where the solution is 
deployed as the strategic web platform; and 
within larger organisations where the solution 
is acquired tactically to support departmental 
or project based initiatives. Immediacy sits 
well within the overall product line up of 
Mediasurface and has enjoyed previous years 
of growth and success. In the ﬁ rst quarter of 
ownership of Immediacy within the group, the 
business slightly exceeded expectations and is 
now a major contributor to the plc representing 
around 30 per cent of the overall business. 
The proﬁ le of the Immediacy revenue stream 
is the same as Morello (namely, licence sales, 
professional services and maintenance) but 
the fact that it is a lower price, higher volume 
model assists the group in reducing the risks 
associated with the very high value but less 
frequent licence transactions in Morello.

BUSINESS REVIEW
A review of the Group’s position as at 
30th September 2007 together with a review
of the development and performance of the Group 
during the ﬁ nancial year is contained in the Financial 
and Operating Highlights, Chairman’s Report and Chief 
Executive’s Report. The principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the company not covered in the Financial and 
Operating Highlights, Chairman’s Report and
Chief Executive’s Report include:
The ﬁ nancial performance and working capital • 
requirements may be affected by extended customer 
evaluation before committing to purchase the 
Group’s products; implementation problems with the 
introduction of new versions; growth rates in markets 
into which the products are sold; market acceptance 
and demand for the Group’s products;
Management of growth and the adequacy of • 
management, ﬁ nancial and operational systems;
The retention of key personnel and recruitment • 
of new staff is naturally important in order to fulﬁ l 
planned business growth;
 The market in which the Group operates is • 
characterised by rapidly evolving technology 
and standards. The Group’s success depends 
on maintaining a functional advantage over the 
competition. No assurance can be given that the 
competition may not acquire or develop equivalent 
technologies which may adversely affect sales level 
and pricing of the Group’s products.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
The Group continues to invest in Research & Development 
in both the UK and India in order to deliver software 
innovations identiﬁ ed in the product roadmap. India 
accounted for a greater proportion of activity during the 
year accounting for a reduction in overall R&D costs. The

Mediasurface plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and is accountable to the shareholders for 
good governance. The Board currently consists of an 
independent Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer and two Non-Executive Directors, and 
meets regularly, typically on a monthly basis. These 
individuals demonstrate a range of experience sufﬁ cient 
to bring considered judgement on all business issues and 
standards of conduct vital to the Group’s success.
COMBINED CODE
The Group is committed to applying the highest 
principles of corporate governance having regard to 
the current stage of the development of the Group and 
complying, as far as practicable, with the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance.
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board takes responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining reliable systems of control in all areas 
of operation. These systems of control, especially 
of ﬁ nancial control, can only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance that no material loss or 
misstatement has occurred.
The key features of the system of internal control 
are set out below:
the Group has established a clearly deﬁ ned and • 
focused management structure which is subject 
to regular review;
the Group prepares and monitors ﬁ nancial reporting • 
on a monthly basis against budget, forecast and 
other key performance indicators;
the Group conducts regular internal systems reviews • 
of subsidiary operations.
The Board considers that there have been no substantial 
weaknesses in internal ﬁ nancial controls that have resulted 
in any material losses, contingencies or uncertainties 
which need to be disclosed in the accounts. The Board has 
considered the need for an internal audit function within 
the Group and concluded there is no current need for such 
a function. The Board can conﬁ rm there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group, and that this process 
has been in place for the year under review and up to the 
date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
This process is regularly reviewed by the Board.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors 
to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year, 
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and Group as at the end of the ﬁ nancial 
year and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Company and Group
for that period. In preparing those ﬁ nancial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply • 
them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable • 
and prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have • 
been followed, subject to any material departure 
disclosed and explained in the accounts;
prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going • 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records, which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the Company 
and Group and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁ nancial 
statements comply with the Companies Act. They are also 
responsible for the system of internal control, safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for 
ensuring that the Directors’ Report and other information 
included in the Annual Report is prepared in accordance 
with UK company law. They are also responsible for 
ensuring that the Annual Report includes information 
required by the AIM rules.

The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website 
is the responsibility of the Directors. The work carried 
out by the auditors does not involve consideration of 
these matters and accordingly, the auditors accept no 
liability for any changes that may have occurred to the 
information contained in the accounts since they were 
initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and the dissemination of the accounts and other 
information included in annual accounts may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

a suitable quality to enable it to discharge its duties. 
Advice from independent advisors is available if required. 
The Board monitors exposure to key business risks and 
reviews strategic direction of the Group and the annual 
budgets as well as their progress against those budgets.

undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS 
AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report and the accounts in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set 
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts 
give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the accounts. The 
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that 
speciﬁ c information presented in the Chairman’s and 
Chief Executive’s Reports and the Financial and Operating 
Highlights that is cross referred from the Business Review 
section of the Directors’ Report. We also report to you if, in 
our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting 
records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if the information 
speciﬁ ed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and 
transactions with the company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
accounts. This other information comprises only the 
Financial and Operating Highlights, Chairman’s Statement, 
the Chief Executive’s Report, The Board of Directors, 
the Directors’ Report, and the Report on Corporate 
Governance. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the accounts. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the accounts. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgements made by 
the Directors in the preparation of the accounts, and 
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.We planned and performed our 
audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations 
which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
accounts are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the accounts.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.  
Basis of preparation
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards under 
the historic cost convention and on the going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁ nancial statements consolidate the ﬁ nancial statements of Mediasurface plc and its subsidiary 
undertakings drawn up to 30th September 2007 using the acquisition method.
In the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision 
for impairment.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses representing any excess of 
the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identiﬁ able assets and liabilities acquired is 
capitalised and written off on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life which is determined on a case 
by case basis. Goodwill relating to the acquisition during the year is amortised over ten years. Provision is 
made for any impairment.
Tangible ﬁ xed assets
Tangible ﬁ xed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is 
provided on all tangible ﬁ xed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of 
each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements Unexpired period of lease 
Ofﬁ ce equipment and computers 2 years
Furniture and ﬁ xtures 2 years
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or 
recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or 
a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences 
between the Group’s taxable proﬁ ts and its results as stated in the ﬁ nancial statements that arise from the 
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the ﬁ nancial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all 
evidence available, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁ ts from 
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Notes to the Accounts
YEAR ENDED 30th September 2007
MD2243– AR07 AW02.indd   17 MD2243– AR07 AW02.indd   17 26/2/08   13:49:37 26/2/08   13:49:37 Mediasurface plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2007
18
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Deferred tax is not recognised when ﬁ xed assets are re-valued unless by the balance sheet date there is 
a binding agreement to sell the re-valued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been 
recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements.  Neither is deferred tax recognised when ﬁ xed assets are sold and 
it is more likely than not that the tangible gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when 
the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to 
the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement 
to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing 
differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Revenue recognition and long-term contracts
Revenue from the sale of software relates mainly to perpetual licences, which provide the customer with 
the right to use the Group’s products.  Where additional services are not essential to the functionality of the 
software then revenue is recognised in full on delivery when the following conditions are met:
• persuasive evidence is available that a legally binding agreement exists; 
• the fee is ﬁ xed or determinable; and
• collection is probable. 
Maintenance revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement.
Revenue generated from consultancy and training contracts is recognised when the work is performed.
Pension costs and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts
The Company does not operate any deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes.  For deﬁ ned contribution schemes the amount 
charged to the proﬁ t and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts is the 
contributions payable in the year.  Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions 
actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Share options
The fair value of share options provided for in these accounts is £644,653 as at 30th September 2007. In 
determining the fair value of equity settled share based payments and the related charge to the income 
statement, the Group makes assumptions about future events and market conditions. In particular, judgement 
must be made as to the likely number of shares that will vest, and the fair value of each award granted. 
The fair value is determined using a valuation model which is dependent on further estimates, including 
the Group’s future dividend policy, employee turnover, the timing with which options will be exercised and 
the future volatility in the price of the Group’s shares. Such assumptions are based on publicly available 
information and reﬂ ect market expectations and advice taken from qualiﬁ ed personnel. Different assumptions 
about these factors to those made by the Group could materially affect the reported value of share 
based payments.
Share options are accounted for in accordance with FRS20 representing a change in Accounting Policy 
compared with the last ﬁ nancial year resulting in a prior year adjustment of £195,896 representing an increase 
in the provision.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange at the dates of the transactions or, 
if hedged, at the forward contract rates.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, 
at the forward contract rates.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their 
balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of 
the opening net assets and results of overseas operations are dealt with through reserves.  All other exchange 
differences are included in the proﬁ t and loss account.
 
Leases
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to 
those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible ﬁ xed assets and are depreciated over the shorter 
of the lease terms and their useful lives.  The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as 
liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the proﬁ t and loss account over the period of the leases 
to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.  Hire purchase 
transactions are dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments 
are not made on such a basis.  Beneﬁ ts received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are 
similarly spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on 
which the rent is ﬁ rst expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, 
in which case the shorter period is used.

• a temporary increase effective 3rd January 2008 in interest payable to 2.75% over base which will prevail

17.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group uses a limited number of ﬁ nancial instruments comprising cash and short-term deposits and 
various items such as trade debtors and creditors, which arise directly from operations. The main ﬁ nancial 
risks faced by the Group are those of interest rate, foreign currency movements and cash liquidity. The 
Board agrees policies for managing each of these risks as appropriate. The Group does not trade in ﬁ nancial 
instruments.
In respect of interest rate risk, the Group ﬁ nances its operations through a mix of cash ﬂ ow from current 
operations together with cash on deposit and bank and other borrowings. Any borrowings are generally at 
ﬂ oating rates of interest and no uses of interest rate swaps have been made. In respect of liquidity risk, the 
Group ensures it has adequate cover through the availability of cash resources.
Mediasurface Inc, Mediasurface BV, Class Act BV and Mediasurface Software Development Private Limited, 
whose revenues, expenditures and cashﬂ ow are denominated in local currency, provide a natural hedge 
against foreign currency risk. Gains and losses arising from this foreign currency exposure are shown in the 
statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The fair values of the Group’s sterling, euro and rupee ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities are not materially different 
from their book values. The Group considers the interest and foreign currency risk to be immaterial to the 
accounts with the exception of ﬁ nancial assets denominated in US dollars which have de-valued over the 
course of the ﬁ nancial year.
The Group has a Loan of £1,901,129 at as the balance sheet date repayable in equal monthly instalments by 
August 2010.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Chairman’s statement
in the price of barley and hops. At the
same time, rising oil prices have put up 
the cost of transport, glass and aluminium.
Despite higher input costs, we’ve been
able to maintain our group margin this year
at 17.4%, which is quite an achievement 
as the Chief Financial Officer explains in 
his review.
Given the medium-term growth momentum 
in our business we continue to make
substantial investments. In recent months
we’ve been upgrading our breweries,
building new facilities in countries such as
Colombia, Russia and China and investing
in sales and distribution in the form of new
bottles and fridges. As a result, our overall
investment has almost doubled from just
over US$1.2 billion to US$2.0 billion over
the past 12 months and will remain high 
in the current year.
Also essential to our future growth 
is our ability to address the social and
environmental issues that affect the health
and prosperity of the communities in which
we operate. As we describe more fully on
page 30, we’re guided in this respect by
10 social and environmental priorities. Two
years on from introducing these priorities,
we’re at the point where every SABMiller
business has either reached the minimum
level of compliance with all ten or has a
plan to do so. 
Operational highlights
In October 2007, we announced our
intention to combine Miller with the US 
and Puerto Rico operations of another
great US brewing company, Coors. 
The proposed joint venture will create 
a stronger, brand-led US brewer with 
the scale, resources and distribution
capabilities to operate more effectively 
in the increasingly competitive US
marketplace. We hope to complete
the transaction in mid-2008.
The other main highlight of the year 
was our acquisition of the Dutch company,
Royal Grolsch N.V. With its rich northern
European heritage, the Grolsch brand is
not only a powerful addition to SABMiller’s
portfolio but also we hope it will open 
new doors in premium markets around 
the world. 
In Latin America we continued our
programme of investment and raising 
the perception of the beer category. 
Market overview
There has been increasing uncertainty 
over the last 12 months about the 
health of the global economy and this 
has translated into substantial falls in
financial markets. Against this background,
SABMiller’s share price has outperformed
the FTSE100 by 9.4% and our position in
the ranking of the top 100 companies by
market capitalisation has improved one
place to stand at number 25, as calculated
on 31 March 2008.
We have benefited from our bias towards
developing markets where we have well
established and advantageous positions.
We are number one in China, through our
associate CR Snow, and in the Andean
region of Latin America, and the second
biggest brewer in India. We supply six 
out of every ten beers drunk in Africa, 
if you include our Castel Alliance. Growth 
in our key markets still outstrips the global
average and is predicted to remain strong
over the medium term. 
The question is how well the developing
world will survive the slowdown in the
global economy. In most of these markets,
the economic fundamentals are sounder
than those in developed markets.
Commentators generally believe that 
Asia will remain economically dynamic.
Africa’s ability to continue growing is less
predictable, but its strong momentum,
falling debt levels and improving balances
of trade suggest that the continent’s
economies will prove resilient. Despite 
high interest rates in the short term in
countries such as Colombia, we also 
see robust economic growth continuing 
in Latin America. 
One effect of the recent rapid growth 
in developing markets is that national
infrastructures have sometimes failed 
to keep pace – witness the recent power
shortages in South Africa. A period of
slower growth will allow infrastructure
investment to catch up, as is now
happening in South Africa where business
and government are working together 
to address the issues. 
Although rising demand for commodities
has helped to create strong demand 
for our beers in commodity-producing
countries, the same trend has added to 
our costs as a brewer with sharp increases
Dear Shareholder:
This strong out-turn to the year is
particularly pleasing given the scale of 
the challenge we faced at its outset, 
with exceptional prior-year comparatives,
rising input costs and an increasingly
competitive environment in many of our
markets. It is a clear testament to the
strength of our brands and the group’s
operational capability that we have been
able to deliver such a good performance.
In the event, total beverage volumes 
grew 6% to 288 million hectolitres 
and earnings before interest, tax and
amortisation (EBITA) increased by 15% 
to US$4.1 billion, translating into profit
before tax of US$3.3 billion. This reflects
the benefits of price increases, higher sales
of premium brands, gains in productivity
and the strength of a number of currencies.
Adjusted earnings per share benefited 
also from a lower tax rate, growing 19% 
to 143.1 US cents. 
In the light of this strong performance, the
board has recommended a final dividend 
of 42 US cents per share, bringing the total
for the year to 58 US cents per share – 
an increase of 16%. 
Net cash generated from our operations, 
at US$4.3 billion, was 6% above the prior
year. Our gearing increased, as expected,
to 49.7%, mainly as a result of higher
borrowings to fund acquisitions and
the substantial US$2.0 billion capital
investment programme discussed below.
Meyer Kahn, Chairman Chairman’s statement 5
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
During the year both André Parker,
Managing Director of SABMiller Africa 
and Asia, and Norman Adami, President
and CEO of SABMiller Americas, retired. 
As long serving executives they have 
both made significant and enduring
contributions to the business and will 
be greatly missed. The group has been
fortunate in having a number of long-
serving executives who have shown 
their dedication and commitment to 
the company over many decades. In this
regard I congratulate the Chief Executive,
Graham Mackay, on completing 30 years
service, 11 years leading the company,
and wish him continued success.
I am grateful to all my board colleagues for
their guidance and advice – not to mention
their invaluable contribution in upholding
the highest standards of corporate
governance. The recent board changes 
will enhance the balance of independence
on the board, while continuing the process 
of progressive renewal.
Finally, I would like to welcome to the
SABMiller family our new colleagues from
Grolsch and to thank all our executives,
managers and staff who have worked
extremely hard to produce the current 
set of results. I am also indebted to our
many business partners and to you, 
our shareholders, for your support.
Outlook
This has been another year of strong
growth for the group. In the current year,
volume growth in the first half will be
affected by high comparative growth 
rates, and pressure on input costs will
continue to increase although pricing 
and mix benefits are again expected to
compensate for these cost increases. 
The economic outlook across our global
footprint, which is biased towards growth
markets in developing countries, remains
positive, and we will continue to benefit
from the strength of our brands,
operational capability and investment 
for growth.
Meyer Kahn
Chairman
However, reported EBITA declined by 
7%, reflecting lower premium volumes 
and significant cost increases in brewing
materials and distribution, and a weakening
of the local currency. 
Board and executive
It is now nine years since the company
listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
We have been fortunate to retain the
services of several distinguished non-
executive directors for the whole of that
period, benefiting considerably from their
insight and experience. The board does
not consider it to be in the interests of the
company to require all four of the directors
who have served for nine years to retire 
at the same time, favouring continuity 
and stability through orderly succession.
Accordingly, we have announced, at 
his own request, the retirement of Robin
Renwick and the appointment of two 
new independent directors.
Robin Renwick has made a unique and
important contribution to your company’s
success, both pre- and post-listing. He 
has been a diligent and committed director,
chairing almost all the board committees 
at various times during his tenure. I thank
him most warmly for his efforts.
Our two new directors joined the board 
on 15 May. Rob Pieterse is Chairman of the
supervisory boards of Mercurius Groep B.V.
and Royal Grolsch N.V. and was formerly
Chairman of Wolters Kluwer N.V. Maria
Ramos is Group Chief Executive of South
Africa’s largest transport, infrastructure 
and logistics firm, Transnet Limited, having
previously been Director-General of the
South African National Treasury. 
While the full benefits are yet to be 
realised, progress has been in line with 
our expectations with lager volumes up 
5% against an exceptional prior-year
performance, and EBITA rising 17%.
Europe delivered another excellent result
with organic lager volume growth of 8%
and reported EBITA up by 30%. Volumes
were particularly strong in Poland, Romania 
and Russia while stronger pricing and
improved productivity more than offset
higher input costs.
In North America, Miller Brewing 
Company made good progress in
reshaping its portfolio to address higher-
margin, higher-growth segments of the
market while also achieving price gains 
and a segment-leading 1.1% growth in
sales for its flagship brand, Miller Lite.
Reported EBITA grew by 27%, mainly 
as a result of strong pricing, higher
volumes and productivity and a 
one-off reduction in canning costs. 
The strong growth in Africa and Asia
continued with lager volumes growing
organically by 15%. Our African operations
benefited from robust economic conditions
and a major investment programme is
under way to meet growing demand.
In China, the Snow brand enjoyed
exceptional growth of 63%, cementing 
its position among the top three beer
brands in the world. EBITA for the region
increased by 22% to US$568 million.
Finally, in South Africa, SAB Ltd posted 
a satisfactory result, maintaining sales
volumes despite losing a major premium
beer brand before the start of the year.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
The global beer market
Five dynamics are asserting strong influence over the
global beer market
■ The inherent challenges of slowing economies
Economic conditions vary greatly from market to market. 
The relative tailwinds of recent years have faded in some key
markets. Other markets are just now beginning to show the
strain of increased commodity costs. At the consumer level,
this has tempered, but not derailed, the well-established trend
of consumers trading up to higher-end products. At a structural
level, this has significantly tightened the access to capital,
providing meaningful advantage to players with strong
balance sheets.
■ The rise of a global middle class
According to a World Bank report published in late 
2006, approximately 800 million people around the world 
are expected to join the middle class by the year 2030.
These people are not only gaining the resources needed 
to purchase world-class consumer products, but they also
view those products, such as professionally produced and
marketed beer, as important benefits and indicators of their
improved lifestyle.
■ The accelerated evolution of emerging markets
Emerging economies that previously featured traditional 
beer markets are now quickly developing many commercial
characteristics once associated exclusively with developed
economies. In addition to the rise of the global middle class,
emerging markets are also being reshaped by ongoing
urbanisation.The United Nations predicts that more than 
650 million people will migrate to urban centres over the 
next decade. Urbanisation enables global brewers and other
fast moving consumer goods companies to reach additional
consumers more effectively and efficiently.
■ The intensification of consumer fragmentation
The growing consumer demand for variety has prompted
brewers and other alcoholic beverage players to expand 
their portfolios with new offerings. That, in turn, has
stimulated additional consumer interest in new choices,
creating a reinforcing loop that shows no signs of slowing.
That growing interest in choice has also made it far more
attractive than ever before for competitors to expand into 
new local markets, exerting growing pressure on established,
massive brands.
■ The intensification of retail consolidation
While consumer preference continues to fragment, the retail
environment continues to consolidate. Some of that is driven
by actual structural consolidation among retailers, as major
chains expand or combine. But most is driven simply by 
large retailers capturing a larger percentage of consumer
transactions, as increasingly wealthy consumers continue 
to gravitate to more advanced retail outlets.
Consequently, three critical implications exist for 
global brewers
■ Efficiency and execution will be more important 
than ever
While beer has always been an asset-intensive business 
in which scale advantages are critical, the strong surge in
commodity costs in recent years is forcing brewers to become
even more efficient. Marketplace execution will be challenged 
by the increased complexity inherently associated with managing
more diverse brand portfolios, as well as by the demand from
the large retailers for increasingly sophisticated service.
■ The key variable will be the development of strong
brands and marketing capability
Strong efficiency and execution will increasingly function as
simply ‘table stakes’ in the global beer industry. As developed
markets fragment and emerging markets evolve, the key
competitive differentiators will be the ability to create brands
with strong consumer pull, and the ability to manage diverse
local portfolios that fully address the new desires of consumers.
■ Discipline will be rewarded
While effective cost-management will be critical in achieving
short-term targets, long-term advantage will go to those
companies that also continue to invest with discipline. Such
discipline will be particularly important in building brands and
customer-service capability, both of which typically require
sustained, consistent investment over time to deliver
meaningful competitive advantage.

experience in the global beverage industry. He served as a 
non-executive director of the Miller Brewing Company from
2004-2008.
A view from an independent consultant
While the current economic conditions present real challenges that must be
managed, several underlying dynamics still favour global brewers. Within that
environment, the companies that can best balance great day-to-day execution
with disciplined investment in brands and capability will create important long-
term competitive advantages for themselves. Chief Executive’s review 7
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
After several brand launches and
renovations in the prior year, Latin America
delivered lager volume growth of 5%.
Strong revenue and cost management 
as well as favourable currency impacts,
drove solid profit growth with EBITA up
17%. We expect further growth as we
continue to make the beer category more
appealing through clearer segmentation 
of the market, improved brand portfolios
and more effective and efficient selling 
and distribution.
In North America, Miller Brewing 
Company has returned to growth after 
the previous years’ setbacks. EBITA was
up by 27%, driven by a 4% increase in
sales to retailers along with higher pricing,
brand mix improvements, cost savings and
a non-recurring gain. Miller’s worthmore
portfolio overall grew by nearly 50% with
the newly launched Miller Chill selling 
some 500,000 barrels during the year.
The underlying momentum of the business
will help considerably as we prepare for 
the proposed joint venture with Coors. 
We hope to close the transaction in 
mid-2008.
Robust economic conditions in Africa
contributed to a 6% growth in organic 
lager volumes from the group’s operations
on the continent (excluding Zimbabwe).
Beer sales in our key markets of Tanzania
and Mozambique continue to expand
rapidly, despite tough comparisons with
the previous year. Growth in Botswana 
has also been excellent, following the
renovation of the St Louis brand and 
the launch of returnable glass bottles. 
Our partners in Africa, Castel, have also
delivered a laudable performance in 
their markets. 
In Asia, the group’s associate in China, 
CR Snow, has extended its lead, acquiring
a further four breweries in the year and
growing volumes by 15% on an organic
basis to bring its market share to 18%.
Recent industry-wide price increases will
help to cover rising input costs in the short
term and, more importantly, bode well for
future profitability. In India, despite over
burdening regulation, we achieved organic
volume growth of 19%. Our import-led
business in Australia continues to grow
strongly, albeit from a small base. 
Owning the growth
This year has seen another strong
performance with results continuing the
trend of several very strong years. Adjusted
earnings per share grew by 19%, bringing
the compound annual growth rate over the
last six years to some 20% per annum. At
143.1 US cents, our adjusted earnings per
share have very nearly trebled since 2002.
Review of operations
While each of our markets has its own
unique drivers of profit growth, there are
common themes that have characterised
our success this year. Our focus on building
leading, local, mainstream and premium
brands and managing full brand portfolios
in each market has been successful in
driving up revenues and profits and
expanding our organic market share. 
What we’ve demonstrated is that stronger
brands can deliver better value to our
consumers and sustain firmer pricing. 
As a consequence, revenues have grown
strongly across the business and have
more than offset higher input costs. 
We have also improved our brand mix,
selling more higher-value brands in packs
that generate higher margins. Given the
trend towards premium beers, we 
continue to work hard to enhance our
offering in this segment. We’re also 
starting to see a meaningful contribution
from brand innovations.
Consumer demand remained strong 
during the year, particularly in our
developing markets. As a result, we’ve
continued to make significant investments
– some US$2.0 billion in total – in additional
production capacity, the provision of fridges
and the introduction of new bottles to
ensure we’re positioned to take advantage
of the growth in our markets. We’ve also
invested heavily in product and packaging
innovations.
Europe continued its very successful 
run with marketing and brand investments
producing gains in market share in our 
six largest markets and pushing organic
lager volumes up by 8%. Almost a third of
volumes came from local product and pack
innovations undertaken in the last three
years. The region has also seen robust
price growth with EBITA rising 30% as we
capitalise on the strength of our brands.
Chief Executive’s review
Success requires a broad, global spread of businesses, a full portfolio 
of brands, outstanding operational capability and talented people. 
As a result of consistently sticking to its strategic priorities, SABMiller

Our strategic priorities
Principal risks
The principal risks facing the group, which
have been considered by the board, are
detailed below. The group’s well developed
risk management process is detailed in 
the Corporate Governance section and 
our financial risks are discussed in note 22
to the consolidated financial statements.
The global brewing industry is expected to
continue to consolidate. Should the group 
not participate in attractive value-adding
transactions, this may inhibit its ability to
leverage additional scale benefits. While
participation in global consolidation provides
opportunities to access scale benefits, enter
growth markets and achieve benefits from the
group’s best operating practices, there is the
risk that expected benefits may not be captured
or may be inadequate, such that an appropriate
return on capital is not achieved over time. 
The group has continued to make significant
progress during the period with regard to
creating a balanced and attractive global spread
of businesses, as set out on pages 10 and 11.
The continued development of our marketing
and growth of our brand portfolios positions 
us well to benefit from changing consumer
preferences in both developed and developing
markets. However, markets continue to evolve
and competitor activity is increasing and
should the group fail to ensure the relevance
and attractiveness of its brands, and the
enhancement of brand marketing, there is 
the risk that significant growth opportunities
may not be realised. The group’s approach
and progress this year in terms of developing
strong, relevant brand portfolios in local
markets is set out on pages 12 and 13.
The group now operates on six continents 
and it is essential to develop and retain a
global management capability. Failure to
maintain this capability at a high level or
maintain our effective organisational leadership
process which can capture shared learnings
and leverage global synergies and expertise,
could jeopardise our growth potential. The
group’s approach to leveraging its global 
scale is detailed on pages 16 and 17.
In many countries, regulatory constraints 
and restrictions on alcohol products, including
sales and marketing activities, continue to 
be under the spotlight, and management
interacts with the relevant authorities wherever
appropriate. An increase in such impositions 
or in excise duties can have an adverse impact
on our business in those countries where 
such actions may take place. Details of the
group’s activities regarding responsible alcohol
consumption can be found in the sustainable
development review on pages 30 to 33. 
The supply of some brewing raw materials 
and packaging materials has been constrained
during the past two years, leading to supply
shortages and cost increases. Should the
group fail to ensure an adequate supply of
brewing and packaging raw materials at
competitive prices, there is the risk that
margins could fall. Mitigating factors for the 
risk of supply constraints and rising cost 
of raw materials are covered on page 14.
SABMiller has a clear strategic focus, at the centre of which are the four priorities set out below and discussed in more
detail on the following pages. Management use a range of indicators to monitor progress against these four priorities.
Some of the most important measures used are identified in the accompanying table and are expanded upon in the 
Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 18 to 23.

markets, because the growth is fastest at the top end, 
we’ve been focusing on our international premium brands,
such as Peroni Nastro Azzurro and regional brands such 
as Kozel in Europe.

Shorter term, with input costs remaining
high, it is critical to be able to secure the
raw materials we need at the lowest costs.
This key priority is discussed further on
page 14. 
Finally, we’re looking to grow by leveraging
our global scale. While allowing each
business a high degree of autonomy and
accountability, we’re setting up structures
and networks to foster collaboration, to
ensure standard ways of doing things
where this is helpful and to capture the
best ideas and practices and disperse
them quickly through the group. The
objective is to create a collaborative,
learning organisation in which the whole
becomes greater than the sum of the parts
and is better able to seize the opportunities
for growth.
We recognise that our people are critical 
to our success. We have a strong culture
of accountability and empowerment with
clearly defined performance goals and we
support our employees with world-class
training and development. Further details
are included on page 31.
Addressing risks
Like any organisation, we face a variety 
of risks. Recognising that risk is a fact of
business, presenting opportunity as well 
as threat, we aim to manage it in a way
that generates the best return for our
shareholders. The well developed risk-
management process described on pages
39 and 40 helps us to identify and monitor
the principal risks to the business and deal
with them appropriately. The principal risks 
we face are set out opposite while financial
risks are discussed on page 97. 
In summary
With the market positions we now occupy
and the strategies we’ve consistently
deployed, we believe that we’re well placed
to capture the growth opportunities in 
each market, to reinforce our competitive
advantages and to keep generating value
for our shareholders. 
Graham Mackay
Chief Executive
the global operators. However, we have
well established positions and a long 
track record of success in these types 
of markets. 
As time moves on, the opportunities 
to expand into new territories through
mergers and acquisitions are becoming
fewer. This means that while growth
through territorial expansion remains
important, our priority, increasingly, is 
to identify the most valuable segments 
of the markets we already serve and to
make sure we capture a higher value 
share of these than our competitors. 
We call this process ‘owning the growth’.
Owning the growth has to begin with 
a thorough analysis of consumer trends 
and marketplace dynamics. Before we 
can identify the opportunities, we need 
to understand the evolving tastes and
preferences of different groups of
consumers. Trends such as premiumisation,
fragmentation and the increasing importance
of female consumers will influence the way
we approach any given market. Then we
have to offer the right brands to the right
target audiences in order to capture the
growth where we think it exists. 
Here we benefit from a second of our
strengths – the ability to develop strong,
relevant brand portfolios for each local
market. Unlike some of our competitors,
we’ve never concentrated on just one
or two monolithic brands. Instead, we’ve
developed a spectrum of strong brands
from economy to premium, local to
international and traditional to experimental.
This is now turning out to be an advantage
as we now have a locker-full of brands with
which to address almost any segment of
any market where we see an opportunity.
The aim is to develop and deploy these
brands for maximum competitive
advantage in each local market. 
A third strength of our business is its
operational capability. Our strategy here is
to keep improving our day-to-day execution
by consistently and relentlessly raising the
performance of each local business. In our
manufacturing, our routes-to-market, our
sales processes and every other aspect of
our operations, we believe that long-term
success comes down in the end to superior
local execution, recognising that each of our
local markets has is own unique features. 
In South Africa, where SAB Ltd began 
the year with the loss of a major premium
brand to a competitor, overall volumes
remained level while mainstream volumes
grew satisfactorily by mid-single digits. 
The decline in premium volumes was
partially mitigated by the successful 
launch of Hansa Marzen Gold and 
growth in excess of 100% for Peroni
Nastro Azzurro. Soft drinks grew 4%
despite tough comparatives in the final
quarter. EBITA declined by 7%, reflecting a
weaker currency, rising costs in distribution
and brewing raw materials and investment
in our marketing and sales activities. 
Exploiting our strengths in 
a challenging marketplace
As the Chairman has indicated, 
economies in general and the brewing
sector in particular face tough new
challenges. Against the background of 
a global economic slowdown and rising
food price inflation, the current growth in
commodity prices means sharp increases
in the cost of our brewing and packaging
raw materials. At the same time, the
brewing industry continues to consolidate,
intensifying the competition within each
market. The retail environment is also
getting tougher as stores and supermarkets
claim more of the market from bars 
and restaurants where brewers’ margins
are higher. 
Meanwhile, as the global beer market
review on page 6 explains, consumers 
are seeking more choice and variety in 
their repertoire of drinks – a further trend 
to be factored into our strategy.
Succeeding in this challenging 
environment requires a broad, global
spread of businesses, a full portfolio of
brands, outstanding operational capability
and talented people. As a result of
sticking to the group’s strategic priorities,
discussed on pages 10 to 17, I believe
SABMiller is unique among the global
brewing companies in having all these
requisites in place. 
Our business portfolio, for example, 
gives us wide geographic coverage and
advantageous exposure to emerging
markets with above-average economic
growth. Other brewers have followed 
our lead into emerging markets and, as a
result, competition is increasing between
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 10 Strategic priority one

happening elsewhere. In a young market like India with its low 
per-capita consumption of beer, the key is to increase our 
volumes by switching consumers to beer from other, stronger,
alcoholic beverages. In India, last year’s acquisition of Foster’s 
is now contributing strongly to our growth. In China, part of the
strategy is to acquire new breweries (four purchased in the past
year) or to build from scratch where doing so adds value. 
In other markets it may be more advantageous to acquire a
company. That’s what we did with Belgia in Poland – a move 
that gave us another brewery and an economy brand that 
fills a gap in the local portfolio. Another acquisition was that 
of Bluetongue in Australia, providing a local premium brand 
to put alongside our imported brands. Australia, like the UK, 
is an example of owning the local growth by importing 
attractive and interesting brands into a mature market. 
Owning the growth is a complex process and one that requires
clever, innovative thinking to address the varied opportunities 
in any given market. The case studies in this section are a few
examples of how we’ve gone about it during the year. 
Our acquisitions in recent years have given us a wide
geographic spread with good exposure to emerging 
markets. We now span six continents with a portfolio of
businesses that captures opportunities around the world
without being over-reliant on any single region. According 
to some sources, we’ve recently become the world’s biggest
brewer by volume – not something we deliberately set out 
to achieve, rather a by-product of creating a widespread,
value-generating portfolio.
While geographic expansion remains part of the strategy, 
we’re looking increasingly to identify and exploit the opportunities
for growth within the existing business portfolio. This can involve 
a range of activities from entering into local joint ventures or
partnerships, to buying or building breweries, to acquiring 
local brands to help shape a full, local, brand portfolio. All are
potential means of ‘owning the growth’ in individual markets. 
The headline transactions of the year – the proposed MillerCoors
joint venture and the acquisition of Grolsch, both detailed
alongside – have contributed to this process. But much has been
Creating a balanced and attractive 
global spread of businesses
Bluetongue: another route into Australia
Pacific Beverages, our 50-50 joint venture with Coca-Cola Amatil, was formed in 
2006, initially to import SABMiller’s international premium beers into Australia, where the
premium sector has been growing by 15% per annum over the past five years. Already
handling Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft, Pilsner Urquell and Miller Chill, 
the business has been looking for a local premium brand to complement the portfolio. 
In 2007 it found the answer in Bluetongue, a characteristically Australian brand that
started life in 2003, was named New Product of the Year at the 2004 Australian Liquor
Awards and saw a 70% increase in sales during 2007. Its acquisition adds a successful,
fast-growing, local brand to Pacific Beverages’ existing portfolio (sales of which more 
than doubled in 2007) and will expand the joint venture’s share of Australia’s highly
profitable premium beer market.
A further advantage is that the acquisition of Bluetongue creates sufficient critical 
mass in terms of local sales for Pacific Beverages to invest in a new brewery near 
Sydney. Due to be completed in 2010, this will provide extra capacity both for 
Bluetongue and for our other premium brands. With its advanced environmental
technology, the new plant is planned to be one of the most water-efficient breweries 
in the world.  Srategic priority one 11
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
The acquisition of Royal Grolsch N.V. in February 2008 
adds a prestigious brand to the portfolio and strengthens 
our hand strategically.
With its 400 years of Dutch brewing tradition, Grolsch 
brings a long record of innovation and excellence and exciting
opportunities to share best practice. It also contributes a large,
state-of-the-art brewery that gives SABMiller the opportunity
both to expand production of Grolsch and to brew its own
international brands for sale in the Netherlands and for export 
to markets such as the UK.
Grolsch complements the existing premium brand portfolio 
and adds another powerful name in the fastest growing
segment of the global beer market. Grolsch, in turn, will 
benefit from SABMiller’s global distribution network.
Northern European brands have been among the most
successful global premium brands, accounting for nearly 
half the growth within the segment. Importantly for our
purposes, they’re highly regarded in developing markets and
have proved to be an excellent way of establishing the premium
sector in parts of the world where the top end of the market 
has yet to be occupied. We therefore see strong potential for
Grolsch, particularly in Africa where the premium segment is 
in its infancy. Further opportunities exist in the more developed
markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Grolsch will also help
us develop the premium sector in South Africa. 
Grolsch: a strong addition 
to the premium portfolio
MillerCoors: a leading US brewer 
for the 21st century
The agreement to combine Miller Brewing Company 
with Coors Brewing Company, the US subsidiary of 
Molson Coors, is a major advance for the business. 
The joint venture will have the scale, resources and 
distribution to compete more effectively as cost pressures 
mount, competition intensifies, consumers look for greater 
differentiation and retailers and distributors consolidate. 
The combined business, MillerCoors, will benefit from the largely
complementary brand portfolios and geographic coverage of the two 
companies and from synergies and productivity improvements worth an 
estimated US$500 million a year. The gains will be felt not just by the business, 
but by consumers, retailers, distributors and the industry at large.
With its wider portfolio of brands and improved ability to innovate, MillerCoors will be able to offer greater choice and
availability to US consumers. Streamlined processes and systems will provide the more sophisticated service that retailers
increasingly demand, helping them, in turn, to compete more effectively. Distributors, for their part, will benefit from a stronger
portfolio of brands along with lower costs and simpler logistics. All these together will make for greater efficiency and ensure
strong, healthy competition in the industry.
We hope to close the transaction in mid-2008.
MillerCoors will benefit from the largely complementary geographic strengths

Strategic priority two
Managing full portfolios of brands in this way is more complicated
than the single-brand approach. A premium beer with an unusual
heritage will need different marketing to a mainstream brand –
something more akin to viral marketing that gives consumers 
a sense of having discovered it for themselves. Brands targeted 
at the clubbing generation, of legal age drinkers, might be best
communicated through new media such as the internet, as 
we’re doing with Miller Genuine Draft in Russia. Among the 
skills we need, we’re learning the best ways to communicate 
with multiple target audiences. 
Around the group, businesses such as Miller in the USA and
Kompania Piwowarska in Poland have continued to evolve their
portfolios to match the opportunities in their respective markets.
Panama and Botswana are two examples of businesses that have
renovated mainstream brands successfully. The case of Miller 
Chill shows how an innovative premium product can fill useful gaps
in more than one market – its success in the USA followed by an
equally successful launch in Australia. In Poland and Russia, the
strategy of marketing the Redd’s brand to women is generating
good results. Other successes are detailed in this section. 
As the global beer market overview on page 6 explains,
most of our markets exhibit at least three major trends.
One is premiumisation as consumers move up the scale 
from economy to mainstream and mainstream to premium
beers in search of brands that offer prestige and differentiation.
Another is fragmentation. Contrary to expectations a few years
ago, consumers at the top end are varying their choices and
becoming more interested in speciality brands, craft beers,
foreign imports and other sub-divisions of the premium
segment. And a third trend is the growing importance of
female consumers.
Our central strategy is to identify the trends and dynamics in 
each market, then to create the right mix of brands to capture 
the opportunities in each location. We’re helped in this respect 
by having a huge and varied global portfolio of brands on which
any of our businesses can draw – not to mention our ability to
innovate as consumers demand new tastes, new presentations
and new drinking experiences. The key is to deploy our brands 
so that each adds value through its own distinct positioning. 
Developing strong, relevant brand 
portfolios in the local market Strategic priority two 13
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
The main strength of the Miller portfolio in recent years 
has been the low-calorie flagship brand, Miller Lite. Its
weakness has been its heavy exposure to two declining
sectors, full-calorie and economy beers, and its under-
representation in the premium segment where most of 
the growth is happening. In late 2006, Miller developed 
a strategy to rebalance the portfolio and position the
company for long-term growth.
The first part of the strategy was to renovate Miller Lite 
with new packaging and advertising. Sales have responded
with a 1.1% rise during the year.
The second part was to capitalise on current trends in the
premium sector with brands drawn from a variety of sources.
Peroni, for example, is now the seventh-fastest growing
European import into the USA. The Leinenkugel’s brand, 
still brewed in the Wisconsin woods by the fifth generation 
of Leinenkugels, exploits the trend towards craft beers. 
The newly created Miller Chill trades on the growth in 
light beers and the fashion for all things Latin. 
The third aspect of the strategy seeks to slow the decline 
of the full-calorie Miller Genuine Draft and the economy
brands, Miller High Life and Milwaukee’s Best, recognising
both their heritage value and their contribution to cash flow.
Miller High Life has now returned to growth on the strength 
of its successful ‘Take Back the High Life’ campaign.
Today’s portfolio makes a much better fit with consumers’
demands and the strategy has played a large part in 
Miller’s resurgence.
Reshaping the portfolio in the USA
Peroni: winning in the UK market
Miller Brands (UK) was established in 2005 to handle SABMiller’s international premium
brands (Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft and Pilsner Urquell) in the mature UK
market. Its formation came as many of the UK’s existing premium brands were declining
and consumers were turning to more distinctive beers. With competitors reducing their
prices to maintain market share, Miller Brands chose to occupy the top end of the market
and maintain its premium price positions. 
In the case of Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Brands’ strategy has been to work closely 
with key UK retailers, developing exciting and innovative marketing and distributing only 
to outlets that attract the discerning target consumer. 
In a premium lager market that declined by 5%, Peroni Nastro Azzurro has both expanded
its sales volumes, growing 39%, and maintained its premium price. Miller Brands’ portfolio
has now been enhanced with the addition of Tyskie and Lech, respectively the number
one and two Polish beer brands in the UK. 
A full portfolio in Botswana
St Louis is Botswana’s only local beer brand,
with a market share of around 50%. By 2006,
however, it had become jaded and its sales were
declining. The decision was made to renovate
the brand and review the portfolio as a whole. 
In a country proud of its status as one of Africa’s
success stories, the first step was to create 
new packaging and associations to link 
St Louis with the taste and style of today’s
Botswana. In a break with local tradition, 
the revitalised brand was introduced in 
new returnable bottles instead of cans. 
As well as being more affordable, glass 
bottles are better environmentally.
The 2007 relaunch quickly reversed the 
decline of the previous few years. With 
St Louis successfully addressing the
mainstream market, the business has filled 
out the portfolio top and bottom by adding
Peroni Nastro Azzurro at the premium end 
and introducing Barons from Mozambique 
in the economy segment. The sorghum 
beer, Chibuku, retains its 97% share of 
the traditional beer market. 
Panama: a historic brand relaunched
SABMiller’s move into South America in 2005
was followed by a systematic analysis of the
marketplace and a strategy aimed at raising 
the perception of the beer category. One result 
in 2007 was the renovation of Panama’s oldest
brand, Balboa, which dates back to 1910. 
Under the theme of getting more flavour and
passion out of life, the relaunched product 
is directed at premium drinkers in their mid-
20s. The 330ml bottle and modern, stylish
label support the theme with an image 
of the swashbuckling Spanish explorer, 
Vasco Núñez de Balboa. The launch 
took the form of a beach party with live
bands and the distinctive red sofas used 
in the advertising to symbolise ‘the tribe’
enjoying life together.
Buoyed by the relaunch, Balboa’s sales 
rose 65% in the year to March 2008. 
The brand-building continues and includes
further special events to consolidate Balboa’s
strong connection with its consumers.

Introducing 430 million new returnable bottles in South Africa
Mainstream brands in South Africa have normally been sold in returnable quart 
bottles. Although standardisation made the product more affordable, it was hard 
to add distinctive labelling and the bottles themselves gradually became outdated.
The business therefore made a decision in 2007 to invest around US$70 million 
to replace its entire quart bottle stock in a phased project lasting 18 months. 
As well as using less glass, the new bottle shape has improved the image of the
mainstream category and lends itself to new labelling technology which in turn 
makes for stronger brand differentiation.
Running from April 2007, the project is a massive logistical task involving the
introduction of 430 million new bottles. The phased roll-out limits the company’s
flexibility to move stock around the country and infrastructure challenges have 
created further complications. Shortages of glass, for example, have required 
new sourcing from as far away as the Middle East. Despite the difficult logistics, 
the results are coming through as evidenced by a return to growth in the 
mainstream segment.
old new
While our operating performance compares well with 
that of the rest of the industry, we know we have to keep
improving to stay ahead. Our efforts in the past year 
have focused on three main aspects of the business.
The first is to become more efficient, especially in our manufacturing.
Because efficiency is part of our day-to-day management, we’ve
already gone a long way down this route and the opportunity for
further, large, cost-cutting projects is limited. Nevertheless, the 
rise in commodity costs compels us to do whatever we can to
counteract the squeeze on our margins. We’ve seen good
progress across the group, notably from Miller which again made
important savings in its brewing operations while producing less
waste and using fewer resources. 
The second area of focus – and one that’s hugely important to 
our success – is to improve our routes to market, both to remove
costs and to ensure that the right products reach the right outlets
in the right condition, accompanied by the right messages and
merchandising material. Colombia and South Africa are just two 
of several businesses that are working hard to re-engineer their
sales and distribution structures to make them more efficient and
effective. In markets such as the USA, where the business does 
not directly control its distribution, we’re making it easier for
distributors and customers to do business with SABMiller and are
looking for ways to add value to their operations as well as ours.
Thirdly, in our quest to raise local performance, we’re responding to
the consolidation of the retail sector by forming mutually beneficial
partnerships with major retailers. Our Polish business, for example,
has forged a closer relationship with Tesco while Miller has done
the same with chains such as Wal-Mart and 7-Eleven. 
The case studies on these two pages describe in more detail
some of the many ways in which SABMiller businesses around 
the world are improving their operating performance. 
Dealing with rising input costs 
The past two years have seen an unprecedented rise in 
the price of inputs, namely barley and hops for brewing 
and glass and aluminium for packaging. As one of the 
largest global buyers of these items, we have procurement
strategies for managing our risks and mitigating the impact. 
Thanks to our scale, we can procure more efficiently by
coordinating our buying effort globally but sourcing locally
according to where particular expertise lies. Europe, for
example, buys a significant amount of malt for the group 
while aluminium is purchased in the USA where the bulk of 
our cans are produced. This approach has helped to limit 
the increases in our commodity costs compared to prices 
on the open market. 
In addition, we have specific risk-management policies to 
limit our exposure to commodity market volatility. We use
hedging strategies to supplement long-term contracts with
suppliers in order to ensure supplies at target prices. In the
past year we’ve been able to limit the increase in the cost of
goods per hectolitre of beer produced (in constant currency) 
to mid-single digits – a successful result.  Strategic priority three 15

Developing relationships with large retailers
Expanding production in Colombia
After the transaction with Bavaria, SABMiller decided that production standards in all its
Latin American breweries should be lifted to the same stringent levels as in the rest of 
the group, to ensure that consumers enjoyed the highest quality of beer. As this included
fermenting the beer for longer, the move put further pressure on capacity at a time when
the local business was struggling to meet rapidly growing demand. 
In response, SABMiller has built a new brewery in extremely quick time on a site 
already earmarked by Bavaria for a future plant. The Valle facility in Colombia is based 
on Bavaria’s original plans with modifications to take account of SABMiller’s worldwide
experience and the need to meet the highest efficiency and environmental standards.
Operating since March 2008 and now the most advanced brewery in Colombia, the 
plant is capable of producing 180,000 bottles of beer an hour. 
The US$220 million Valle project is just one example of the heavy investment going 
on around the world to keep pace with rising demand for SABMiller’s beers.
Miller: Lower costs and a
smaller carbon footprint
In 2007, Miller embarked on Project
Unicorn with the aim of continuously
improving its operations and making
further savings in packaging, freight,
waste, utilities and maintenance. 
The programme incorporates the
principles of World Class Manufacturing
whereby employees are empowered to
search for solutions that cut the number
of stoppages on the production line. 
The resulting improvements have taken
Miller’s overall equipment effectiveness
to an all-time high of 74.9%.
Reducing the diameter of Miller’s 
can ends has cut the company’s use 
of aluminium by over 560 tonnes per
year – the equivalent of all the aluminium 
in 2.2 million cases of beer. A new
anaerobic wastewater treatment plant 
at one of Miller’s plants now generates
enough biogas to produce a megawatt
of electricity for the brewery each hour –
again saving energy and costs and
reducing the company’s carbon footprint. 
Seventeen months on from its launch,
Project Unicorn is on track to achieve 
its target of reducing costs by 
US$120 million over three years. 
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
In some markets, consumers are
increasingly buying their beer from
supermarkets and other retailers rather
than ordering it in bars and restaurants.
This presents a challenge to brewers in
that margins on retail sales tend to be
tighter. The difficulty is compounded
as the retail sector consolidates and
drives margins still lower.
Against this background, it’s important 
to learn how to work with retailers 
and ensure we become the preferred
supplier wherever possible. To this 
end, our Polish business has forged
relationships with Tesco and E.Leclerc
that involve developing joint plans for
store layouts and sales and promotions.
The Polish team has drawn on
SABMiller’s knowledge of consumers
and its skills in marketing to design 
new ways of displaying and promoting
its products in-store. These are now 
in place in three Polish hypermarkets –
two Tescos and one E.Leclerc. 
Thanks to this new relationship, 
Tesco Poland has made SABMiller’s
Polish subsidiary its principal beer
supplier and the business is now the
nationwide leader in hypermarkets and
supermarkets. Shoppers increasingly
perceive SABMiller brands as segment
leaders and both SABMiller and Tesco
are benefiting from a rise in sales.
Miller in the USA has made 
similar progress in understanding 
the objectives and strategies of the 
big national retail chains and is 
working with them to add value to 
the relationship. As a result, its sales
with the big four – Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven,
Kroger and Supervalu – are growing
faster than its sales overall. 16 Strategic priority four
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Strategic priority four
We take a similar approach to innovation. This, again, is essential
to our business, especially in a fragmenting marketplace where
consumers are increasingly looking for novelty and difference.
While the right innovation can generate enormous value (Miller 
Chill is a case in point), the process costs money and not every
innovation succeeds. Effective innovation must be technically
feasible, be an answer to known needs and be rooted in a
thorough analysis of the marketplace. 
Clearly, the more we can do to pool the relevant knowledge, 
the better our chances of succeeding. Rather than centralise 
the innovation process, we’re creating a virtual network to co-
ordinate efforts around the group and harness the best new
thinking wherever it exists. A tool known as SmartGate helps 
to standardise our approach to innovation, to manage the 
risks and to make the results widely available.
In all these Ways, we’re seeking to develop a collaborative, 
learning organisation that enables local businesses to compete
more effectively while at the same time extracting full value 
from our global scale.
As a global organisation, we’re constantly seeking to 
harness the benefits of our scale. At the same time, we 
have to recognise that beer is essentially a local business 
and that local managers are in the best position to identify
and exploit local opportunities. The question is how to
generate maximum value and advantage from our size 
without becoming over-centralised and losing our 
relevance and responsiveness in each market.
One example of how we’re tackling the issue is through the
SABMiller ‘Ways’. These address eight aspects of the business
essential to our success (manufacturing, corporate affairs,
operational finance and others) and provide tools, procedures 
and processes that encapsulate best practice in the group.
Without being prescriptive, they set out how things are expected
to be done and make it easier for essential knowledge to be
retained, transferred and made available to others. Each Way 
is put together collaboratively. Local businesses contribute their
experience and insights and are then responsible for applying the
Ways in their own marketplace. A number of the Ways are up and
running and the latest, the enhanced Marketing Way, will be rolled
out during 2008.
Leveraging our global scale Strategic priority four 17
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Leveraging our local value chain
Wherever possible, we try to incorporate local suppliers into 
our value chain with a view to benefiting both the business 
and the communities in which we operate. 
In recent years we’ve created opportunities for small-scale
farmers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania to 
supply us with barley and sorghum. In 2005 we began testing 
a similar model in Rajasthan in India. The aims were to create 
a high-quality, domestic source of malted barley for the
business and enable farmers to get better prices for their
produce by becoming part of SABMiller’s supply chain.
Under the scheme, 6,000 small-scale farmers supply 
SABMiller India and have access to good quality barley 
seeds and relevant agricultural training. Since 2005, the 
yield and quality of the local crop have shown improvements 
and farmers’ income from their crop has improved. The
programme is expected to grow to meet 50% of the barley
needs of SABMiller India over the next five years.
We also involve small-scale entrepreneurs in our downstream
activities. In Zambia, for example, we’ve created over 1,800 jobs
by setting up local people with their own kiosks and wholesale
outlets to distribute and sell our soft drinks. 
As Miller focuses increasingly on top-end premium 
brands, it faces a greater need to innovate and to offer the
distinctiveness that consumers demand. One recent response
is the creation of Miller Chill, a unique-tasting, chelada-style,
light beer with a touch of lime and salt. This innovative brand
exploits the growth in the light beer segment as well as the
growing Latin influence on mainstream American culture and
a greater willingness by consumers to pay a premium for
distinctive brands. Launched in the USA in 2007, Miller Chill
has beaten expectations in its home market and has now
been successfully introduced in Australia. 
Miller’s innovative skills are further demonstrated in the Miller 
Lite Brewers Collection, now being tested under the tagline, 
‘Craft beer. Done Lite’. Combining the refreshment of a light 
beer with the flavour and interest of a craft brew, the collection
potentially creates a new category in the competitive US
market. A tasting panel from Modern Brewery Age Weekly
described two of the beers in the collection as ‘superb in every
respect’ and the blonde ale as ‘arguably one of the best light
beers ever made’. 
Other businesses, too, are successfully innovating. Of the many
examples, South Africa recently introduced a new, uniquely
flavoured premium beer, Hansa Marzen Gold. This has been
followed by the highly successful Sarita apple-flavoured ale, 
its new variant Sarita Ruby Dry, and the flavoured alcoholic
beverage, Skelter’s Straight. 
A pipeline of innovative brands 
The SABMiller Marketing Way
The SABMiller ‘Ways’ are at various stages of development.
The enhanced Marketing Way, relaunched at the start of 2008, 
is a toolkit for helping businesses to ‘own the growth’ by
sharpening their skills in analysing and segmenting their
markets, identifying the profitable opportunities and deciding
where and how to concentrate their efforts.
The process of compiling the Marketing Way showed the kind
of collaborative learning that the group as a whole is working
towards. Instead of the corporate centre laying down the rules
or trying to manage the local marketing process, we took the
best ideas and expertise from around the world and distilled
them into clear principles, an end-to-end process framework
and a set of tools for businesses to apply as appropriate. 
In this way, each local team retains its autonomy but can
benefit from the learning and insight of SABMiller as a whole.
As the Marketing Way is rolled out, we’ll provide
comprehensive training and support to help our teams to 
work with it effectively and embed it into their operations.

Chief Financial Officer’s review
Volumes
The adjacent chart shows the group’s
organic growth in lager volumes for each 
of the last four years. The group’s growth 
in each year is significantly ahead of the
growth rate of the global beer industry. 
This year’s results demonstrate the
operating strength of our group and our
recent volume increases in part reflect our
strong presence in higher growth markets.
Total beverage volumes, including soft
drink volumes, grew by 6% on an organic
basis and 6% on a reported basis to 288
million hl. Within this total, lager volumes at
239 million hl were up by 7% on an organic
basis and 11% on a reported basis.
Particularly strong growth in lager volumes
was recorded in Europe and Africa & Asia. 
Revenue
Our revenue growth reflects the group’s
success in expanding its volumes while
also achieving significant price and mix
gains illustrating the strength of our 
brands, front-line pricing and good 
revenue management. The adjacent 
chart illustrates the organic growth in 
group revenue for each of the last four
years with each year’s performance 
shown in constant currency. 
Group revenue (including our share 
of associates of US$2,418 million) was
US$23,828 million. This represents an
increase of 9.6% on an organic, constant
currency basis and is ahead of the growth
in volumes. Real price/mix gains of 
3.3% were achieved, principally in North
America, Europe and Latin America, 
with stronger gains in the second half 
of the year.
Currency movements during the year
increased reported revenue by 5.5%, 
as the majority of the currencies in which
the group trade strengthened against the
US dollar with the exception of the South
African rand. Transactions completed in 
the financial year in the Netherlands and
Poland (offset by soft drinks business
disposals in Latin America and China) 
had the effect of increasing reported
revenue by 0.8%.
Since the Miller transaction in July 2002,
the group has grown revenue strongly, 
both on an organic basis and by acquisition.
The compound annual organic growth rate
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
SABMiller has a clear strategic focus, 
with four strategic priorities, as noted in 
the Chief Executive’s review. Management
use a range of KPIs to monitor progress
against these priorities. Some of the most
important measures used are: 
■ Volume growth on an organic basis; 
■ Group revenue growth on a reported
and organic constant currency basis;
■ Growth in volumes of premium brands
(also called worthmore brand volumes
in North America); 
■ Volume growth of selected international
and regional premium brands outside
their home markets;
■ Organic constant currency EBITA growth
and EBITA margin progression; and
■ In addition, various non-financial 
metrics relevant to functional areas.
Certain KPIs are discussed in further 
detail below within the review of the 
current year’s financial performance. 
Other non-financial KPIs have been 
dealt with in the Chief Executive’s review
and in the operations review.
Selected disclosures of results on an
organic, constant currency basis are 
made to illustrate underlying performance.
These exclude the effects of acquisitions
net of disposals, and changes in exchange
rates. Organic results exclude the first 
12 months’ results in the case of
acquisitions and investments, and the last
12 months’ results from disposals. Constant
currency results have been determined by
translating the local currency denominated
results for the year ended 31 March 2008
at the exchange rates for the comparable
period in the prior year.

in group EBITA margin trends in the 
chart above. In this year of significantly
rising input costs, revenue growth 
and production efficiencies enabled the 
group to recover the increases in costs
experienced and the group has maintained
its EBITA margin at 17.4%. This is a
noteworthy achievement. In addition to
the input price pressures experienced
the group suffered the adverse impact on
volume and mix of the loss to a competitor
of the licence to produce a premium brand
which had previously accounted for 9% of
volumes in South Africa.
The group’s reported EBITA margin 
on an organic constant currency basis 
is 10 basis points lower, as currency
movements that have favoured the
weighting of higher margin businesses 
in the group total are excluded from
this measure.
The group has continued investment 
in future growth, particularly capacity
expansion, and also in brand support 
and sales capability. There has also 
been a focus on productivity and cost
management. Overall this investment 
has led to some incremental cost in 
EBITA margin.
+9%
EBITA growth on organic 
constant currency basis
the group is managed. SABMiller believes
that the reported EBITA profit measures
give shareholders additional information 
on trends and make it easier to 
compare different segments. Segmental
performance is reported after the specific
apportionment of attributable head office
service costs.
The chart above shows the organic
increase in EBITA for each of the last four
years with each year’s performance shown
in constant currency. EBITA grew 9% on 
an organic, constant currency basis.
Reported EBITA, which includes the impact
of currency movements and acquisitions,
grew by 15% to US$4,141 million. Growth
in EBITA reflects the benefits of volume and
revenue increases as well as productivity.
The group has a record of improving its
productivity over time, notwithstanding
increases in capital investment and in 
sales and marketing expenses which can
impact productivity in any individual year. 
Double digit organic constant currency
growth in EBITA was achieved by Europe,
North America and Africa & Asia, which
enabled the group to absorb the EBITA
decline in South Africa and still achieve 
a good overall performance for the year.
Latin America is now the largest beverage
segment, contributing 25% of group EBITA
and this represents the significant progress
made by the group in developing a
balanced portfolio of businesses.
EBITA margin
The group has a strong record in protecting
and developing profitability to raise the
performance of local businesses, as seen
in volumes has been 5.6%. The group has
leveraged volume growth through price
and mix benefits to generate compound
annual group revenue growth of 9.3% 
over that period.
Input costs
Input cost pressures have been significant
in the past year. Most notably there have
been substantial increases in the market
prices of malt, barley and hops. The price
of malt and barley has more than doubled
in the last two years, while the price of
hops has increased by seven to ten times
over the same period, with a significant
spike in the last 12 months in particular.
The impact of this on profitability has been
tempered through supply contracts for
future requirements and an active hedging
programme, combined with programmes
to support development of local barley
farming in both Africa and India,
underpinning our supply in these areas. 
As a consequence the impact of input 
cost increases has been more muted, with
total raw material costs increasing 9% per
hl in constant currency. Our total cost of
goods sold per hl, which includes other
variable costs, is up about 6% on the 
same basis reflecting the lower cost
pressures experienced on other inputs.
EBITA 
EBITA is defined as operating profit 
before exceptional items and amortisation
of intangible assets (excluding software). 
It includes the group’s share of associates’
operating profit on a similar basis. We
choose to report EBITA in our results in
order to accord with the manner in which

Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Double digit organic constant currency growth in EBITA was achieved 
by Europe, North America and Africa & Asia. 20 Chief Financial Officer’s review
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Exceptional items 
Items that are material either by size or
incidence are classified as exceptional
items. Further details on the treatment 
of these items can be found in note 4 
to the financial statements.
Net exceptional charges of US$112 million
before tax were reported during the year
(2007: US$93 million). Of these, US$78
million relate to final restructuring costs
incurred in Latin America (2007: US$69
million), partially offset by a net profit of
US$17 million on the disposal of soft drinks
businesses in Costa Rica and Colombia.
Miller has also recorded costs of US$51
million in relation to retention accruals
pending the completion of the proposed
MillerCoors joint venture and certain
integration costs. In 2007, Europe reported
a net exceptional cost of US$24 million.
This comprised a profit on the disposal 
of land in Naples of US$14 million less
integration costs of US$7 million principally
incurred in Slovakia, and an adjustment to
goodwill at Birra Peroni. As required under
IFRS, to the extent that a business is able
to utilise, after an acquisition, previously
unrecognised deferred tax assets, an
adjustment to goodwill is required with a
compensating adjustment to tax. During
2007 we recorded such an adjustment 
for US$31 million in respect of Birra Peroni
and this had been included within
exceptional items. 
Finance costs and tax
Net finance costs increased to US$456
million, a 7% increase on the prior year’s
US$428 million. Finance costs in the
current year include a net benefit from 
the mark-to-market adjustments of various
derivatives amounting to US$35 million
(2007: nil) which are of a capital nature and
for which the group has been unable to
obtain hedge accounting. This benefit has
been excluded from the determination of
adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted net
finance costs, which exclude this benefit,
were US$491 million, up 15%, reflecting 
an increase in net debt following the
significant capital expenditure programme
currently being undertaken by the group
and the recent Grolsch acquisition. Interest
cover, based on pre-exceptional profit
before interest and tax and excluding the
impact of the mark to market movements
noted above, has increased to 7.9 times
from 7.8 times in the prior year.
The effective tax rate of 32.5% (2007:
34.5%) before amortisation of intangible
assets (other than software) and exceptional
items and the adjustment to interest noted
above, is below that of the prior year,
principally reflecting a more favourable
geographic mix of profits across the group,
local statutory rate reductions and ongoing
initiatives to manage our effective tax rate.
Currency
The South African rand has declined against
the US dollar during the year and ended
the financial year at R8.15 to the US dollar,
while the weighted average rand/dollar
rate weakened by 1% to R7.13 compared 
with R7.06 in the prior year. The Colombian
peso (COP) strengthened by almost 17%
against the US dollar compared to the prior
year end, and ended the year at COP1,822
to the US dollar, while the weighted average
COP/dollar rate improved by 15% to
COP1,997 from COP2,340.
Profit and earnings
Adjusted profit before tax of US$3,639
million increased by 15% over the prior year,
reflecting performance improvements across
the businesses and translation of results
into US dollars. On a statutory basis, profit
before tax of US$3,264 million was up
16%, including the impact of exceptional
items and the mark to market movements
in finance costs as noted above.
The group presents adjusted basic earnings
per share to exclude the impact of
amortisation of intangible assets (excluding
software) and other non-recurring items,
which include post-tax exceptional items,
in order to present a more meaningful
comparison for the years shown in the
consolidated financial statements. Adjusted
earnings increased by 20% to US$2,147
million and the weighted average number
of basic shares in issue for the year 
was 1,500 million, up from last year’s 
1,496 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased by
19%, the fifth year in the last six years with
double digit growth. The group’s adjusted
earnings per share also showed double-
digit increases when measured in South
African rand and sterling. A reconciliation 
of basic earnings per share to adjusted
earnings per share is shown in note 8 to
the financial statements and, on a statutory
basis, basic earnings per share were 
up 22%.

Dividends 
The board has proposed a final dividend 
of 42 US cents to make a total of 58 US
cents per share for the year – an increase
of 16% on the prior year. This represents 
a dividend cover of 2.5 times based on
adjusted earnings per share, as described
above (2007: 2.4 times). The group’s
guideline is to achieve dividend cover 
of between 2.0 and 2.5 times adjusted
earnings. The relationship between the
growth in dividends and adjusted earnings
per share is demonstrated in the chart
shown opposite. Details of payment 
dates and related matters are disclosed 
in the directors’ report. 
Acquisitions and disposals 
In December 2007, SABMiller plc 
and Molson Coors Brewing Company
announced that they had signed a definitive
transaction agreement to combine the 
US and Puerto Rico operations of their
respective subsidiaries, Miller and Coors, 
in a joint venture to create a stronger,
brand-led US brewer in the increasingly
competitive US marketplace. We hope 
to close the transaction, which is subject 
to US anti-trust clearance, in mid-2008.
In January 2008 the group completed the
acquisition of 99.96% of Browar Belgia Sp.
z o.o, the fourth largest brewer in Poland.
In February 2008 the group completed 
the acquisition of Royal Grolsch N.V. in 
the Netherlands and by 31 March 2008
had acquired a 99.65% shareholding.
In addition, our joint venture with Coca-
Cola Amatil Limited, Pacific Beverages
Pty Limited acquired Bluetongue Brewery
Pty Limited (Bluetongue), the Australian
premium brewer.
In May 2008, SABMiller announced it 
had agreed to acquire a 99.84% interest 
in the Ukrainian brewer CJSC Sarmat. The
transaction is subject to approval by the
Ukrainian competition authorities and other
customary pre-closing conditions.
During the year the group completed 
the disposals of its soft drinks business 
in Costa Rica and its juice business in
Colombia. The group has also purchased
further minority shareholdings in our
operating company in Panama.
Our associate in China, CR Snow, has
continued to consolidate its position as the
country’s largest brewer with the purchase
of further breweries. CR Snow completed
the disposal of a non-core water business.
Cash flow and investment highlights
The group has a good record of 
generating cash, as shown in the adjacent
chart. Increases in cash generation reflect
growth in profitability before interest and
tax payments and investment activities.
Net cash inflow from operating activities
before working capital movements
(EBITDA) rose 12% to US$4,518 million
from last year’s US$4,031 million. The
group’s cash flow generation was again
strong as demonstrated by the ratio of
EBITDA to revenue (both metrics excluding
results of associates) at 21% (2007: 22%).
The group maintained its net liability
position in working capital but there has
been a cash outflow from rising working
capital of US$242 million across the 
group mainly as a result of outflows in 
Latin America and Europe with higher
receivables from the Easter period the
most significant factor. As a result cash
generated from operations increased 
by only 6% over the prior year to reach
US$4,276 million.
The group has continued to invest in 
the business, and capital expenditure for
the year has grown to some US$1,978
million (2007: US$1,191 million) including
additional production capacity, new
containers and distribution to enable 
the business to take advantage of the
growth in its markets. Capital expenditure
as reflected in US dollars has also been
increased by the strengthening of certain
currencies in key markets against the US
dollar. Capital expenditure including the
capitalisation of intangible software costs is
US$2,034 million (2007: US$1,244 million).
Tax paid has risen by 21% to US$969
million from US$801 million, in excess of
profit before tax growth due to timing
considerations.

Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Financial structure and liquidity 
The group finances its operations through
cash generated by the business and a
mixture of short and medium-term bank
credit facilities, bank loans, corporate
bonds and commercial paper. In this 
way, the group avoids over-reliance on 
any particular liquidity source. The group
seeks to mitigate the effect of structural
currency exposures by borrowing, where
cost effective, in the same currency as 
the functional currency of its main units. 
The group borrows principally in US
dollars, South African rands, euros, 
Polish zlotys and Colombian pesos at 
both fixed and floating rates of interest. 
The group also enters into derivative
transactions to manage the currency,
commodities and interest rate risk arising
from its operations and financing activities.
It is group policy that no trading in financial
instruments is undertaken. 
The group’s policy is to borrow (directly 
or synthetically) in floating rates, reflecting
the fact that floating rates are generally
lower than fixed rates in the medium term.
However, in order to mitigate against the
impact of an upward change in interest
rates, the extent to which group debt may
be in floating rates is restricted to the lower
of (a) 75% of consolidated net debt and (b)
that amount of net borrowings in floating
rates that would, with a 1% increase in
interest rates, increase finance costs by an
amount equal to (but not more than) 1.2%
of EBITDA. This policy is not applied for
borrowings arising from recent acquisition
activity and inflation linked debt. 
Exposure to movements in interest rates 
in group borrowings is managed through
interest rate swaps and forward rate
agreements. As at 31 March 2008, 30% 
of the borrowings were at fixed rates,
taking into account interest rate swaps 
and forward rate agreements (2007: 34%).
A 1% move in interest rates would result in
a change to finance costs equivalent to a
0.65% (2007: 0.65%) impact on EBITDA
(excluding exceptional items).
Gross debt at 31 March 2008, comprising
borrowings together with the fair value 
of derivative assets or liabilities held to
manage interest rate and foreign currency
risk of borrowings, has increased to
US$9,733 million from US$7,358 million 
at 31 March 2007. Net debt comprising
gross debt net of cash and cash
equivalents has increased to US$9,060
million from US$6,877 million at 31 March
2007 reflecting payment for the acquisition
of Royal Grolsch N.V. (US$1,190 million)
and the assumption of its borrowings
(US$162 million) and the group’s increased
capital expenditure programme and the
translation impact resulting from a weaker
dollar against most of our trading currencies.
An analysis of net debt is provided in 
note 27. The group’s gearing (presented 
as a ratio of debt/equity) has increased to
49.7% from 45.8% at 31 March 2007.
In July 2007, the group’s South African
holding company for its South African
operations raised R1,600 million
(approximately US$230 million) in 5-year
notes. The notes, issued under a Domestic
Medium Term Note programme, are
guaranteed by SABMiller plc and are 
listed on BESA, the South African Bond
Exchange. The net proceeds have been
used to repay part of the existing loan
facilities of The South African Breweries Ltd.
The average loan maturity in respect of the
fixed rate debt portfolio is 3.9 years (2007:
4.7 years). The weighted average interest
rate for the total gross debt portfolio at 
31 March 2008 was 7.3% (2007: 7.6%)
reflecting the currency profile of the debt
and movements in rates in the year.
The group uses cash in hand, cash from
operations and short-term borrowings to
manage its liquidity. As at 31 March 2008,
the group had cash and cash equivalent
investments of US$673 million (2007:
US$481 million).
Our strong financial structure gives us
adequate resources to facilitate ongoing
business along with medium-term flexibility
to invest in appropriate growth opportunities
and manage the balance sheet. As a result
of the Grolsch acquisition, the group has
reduced committed undrawn borrowing
facilities from US$3,426 million at 31 March
2007 to US$1,222 million at 31 March
2008. Subsequent to the year end, in order
to provide supplementary headroom, the
group entered into an additional US$1,000
million committed facility maturing June
2009, and the refinancing of the US$600
million Miller bonds, maturing August 2008,
has been secured with additional three year
committed bank facilities.

Balance sheet profile
As outlined above, the group has continued
to enter new markets to strengthen its
positions through additional acquisitions
and investments. These transactions have
altered the balance sheet profile of the
group and details are given in note 28 to
the financial statements. 
Total assets increased to US$35,813
million from the prior year’s US$28,736
million. There was also an increase of
US$104 million in equity interests
attributable to minorities. 
Goodwill increased by US$2,350 million,
reflecting acquisitions, primarily in relation
to Royal Grolsch N.V. and as a result of
foreign exchange movements on goodwill
denominated in currencies other than the
US dollar (US$1,406 million).
Intangible assets increased by 
US$482 million primarily reflecting 
foreign exchange movements on assets
denominated in currencies other than 
the US dollar. A preliminary purchase 
price allocation for Royal Grolsch was
undertaken in March 2008 following its
acquisition in February 2008 and this did
not include the recognition of all potential
intangible assets. This exercise will be
completed in the next financial year and 
will probably involve the recognition of 
new intangible assets. 
Shareholder value
The value that a company returns to 
its owners is best measured by total
shareholder return (TSR) – a combination
of share price appreciation and dividends
returned over the medium to long term.
Recent measures of shareholder return
have been affected by the volatility of 
equity indices. Nevertheless, since
SABMiller moved its primary listing to the
London Stock Exchange in March 1999,
the FTSE 100 has produced a TSR of 23%
to March 2008 (to 31 March 2007: 31%),
while the group has delivered a TSR of
220% in sterling terms over the same
period (to 31 March 2007: 217%).
Accounting policies and definitions
The principal accounting policies used by
the group are shown as note 1 to the
financial statements. Note 1 also includes
recent accounting developments, none 
of which is expected to have a material
impact on the group. 
In addition, note 1 details the areas 
where a high degree of judgement has
been applied in the selection of a policy, 
an assumption or estimates used. 
These relate to the assumptions used 
in impairment tests of carrying values for
goodwill and intangible assets; estimates 
of useful economic lives and residual values
for intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment; assumptions required for 
the calculation of post-retirement benefit
obligations; and judgements in relation to
provision for taxes where the tax treatment
cannot be fully determined until a formal
resolution has been reached with the
relevant tax authority. 
The group’s operating results on a
segmental basis are set out in the
segmental analysis of operations, and 
the disclosures are in accordance with 
the basis on which the businesses are
managed and according to the differing 
risk and reward profiles. 
In the determination and disclosure 
of reported sales volumes, the group
aggregates the volumes of all consolidated
subsidiaries and its equity-accounted
associates, other than associates where
primary responsibility for day-to-day
management rests with others such as
Castel and Distell. In these latter cases, 
the financial results of operations are equity
accounted in terms of IFRS but volumes
are excluded. Although contract brewing
volumes are excluded from total volumes,
turnover from contract brewing is included
within group turnover. 
Translation differences on non-dollar 
assets and liabilities are recognised in 
the statement of recognised income and
expense. It is not the group’s policy to
hedge foreign currency earnings and their
translation is made at weighted (by monthly
revenue) average rates.

Our strong financial structure gives us adequate resources to facilitate 
ongoing business along with medium-term flexibility to invest in appropriate
growth opportunities and manage the balance sheet. 24 Operations review
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Operations review
In Latin America, execution of our 
strategy to renovate the beer category 
has continued and has delivered underlying
performance in line with our expectations
while laying a sound foundation for future
growth. In the year, lager volumes ended
5% up on the prior year despite high
comparative volume growth, particularly 
in the second half. Reported EBITA
performance benefited from strong local
currencies, particularly the Colombian peso
which strengthened by 15% against the 
US dollar (on a full year average basis).
There have been significant fixed cost
productivity improvements across the
business. Reported EBITA margin was
down on prior year due to rising raw
material input costs and a 40 basis point
negative impact as a result of changes to
the basis of recovering distribution costs.
On an organic constant currency basis,
EBITA growth was 6%, while revenue per
hectolitre increased by 4% on a like for like
basis. Significant capital investment was
incurred to increase capacity, modernise
production and logistics assets, upgrade
returnable containers and improve 
product quality.
In Colombia, the brand portfolio upgrade
continued with the launch of Redd’s in the
premium segment and the relaunches of
Aguila and Aguila Light in the mainstream
segment. Our Pony Malta brand was 
also relaunched with a new design and 
a new 350ml PET container. Premium 
lager volumes grew by over 60% in the
year, largely due to the continued strong
performance of Club Colombia. The new
500ml returnable bottle for Aguila and
various PET packs for Pony Malta further
helped to modernise and widen the appeal
of the product range. 
Trading conditions softened in the 
second half, as consumer credit interest
rates continued to rise and inflationary 
cost pressures resulted in retail price
increases. Nevertheless revenue per
hectolitre improved by 4% on a constant
currency basis with revenue management
and a focus on price compliance assisting
price and mix improvements. 
Lager growth rates slowed in the second
half of the year, ending up 4% for the full
year. However, our share of the alcohol
market increased by 190 basis points 
to 64.7%, gaining share mostly from 
local spirits. 
Further gains were made in operating
efficiencies and reducing overhead costs,
in order to assist in offsetting rising input
costs. The majority of the structural
changes to the route-to-market and the
product quality investments have now 
been implemented, while trade marketing
capability has been enhanced, establishing
a solid platform for future growth. 
The new Valle brewery was commissioned
in March 2008, with an initial annual capacity
of 3.2 million hl, which will bring supply and
demand into better balance in the western
region. Further capacity investment will be
required at the Barranquilla brewery and at
maltings plants in the coming year. During
the year the juice business in Colombia
was sold.
In Peru economic conditions have been
favourable with annual GDP growth of
nearly 9%. Lager volumes were up 8% on
the prior year despite major disruptions to
distribution due to mudslides and a severe
earthquake. The market has become
increasingly competitive with the entry
of a second competitor in the economy
segment. Our Pilsen Trujillo brand has
been successfully repositioned nationally
to combat low priced competition. 
+6%
EBITA growth on an organic 
constant currency basis
Premium volumes and share have
improved with the relaunch of Cusqueña
in the premium segment, which ended 
the year at 8% market share, partially
offsetting the mix impact of the growth 
of the economy segment including 
Pilsen Trujillo. Revenue per hectolitre 
has improved 1% on a constant currency
basis. Our overall market share ended 
the fourth quarter at 84% and the beer
market has gained share of alcohol and
now stands at 51%. The operation
continues to enhance its brand portfolio
and invest for future demand with capacity
and quality upgrades. The renovation 
of containers and the distribution fleet is
now largely complete and the programme
of trade marketing enhancements is 
being rolled out. 
Our Ecuador operations delivered a
commendable performance despite lower
economic growth, political uncertainty 
and torrential rains in the fourth quarter.
The operation has focused on securing
channel advocacy by the installation of 
over 5,000 coolers and our market
mapping to identify further opportunities 
for growth is complete. The change in 
our route-to-market has commenced 
with positive reception in the areas
affected. Lager volume growth of over 
5% was driven by our flagship brand
Pilsner, following its relaunch in October
2007, and the implementation of national
pricing in the same month. The premium
portfolio performed well led by the
renovation of the Club brand, which has
been successfully repositioned in the
premium segment, whilst maintaining
previous volumes. Beer’s share of alcohol
remained in line with the prior year at 41%
and our lager market share improved by 
80 basis points on a full year basis to 96%,
despite aggressive pricing campaigns from
our main competitor. Positive brand and
pack mix and increased prices have
boosted revenue. 
In Honduras lager volume growth of 4%
was fuelled by 10% growth in premium
segment volumes, led by our brands Barena
and Port Royal. Price compliance initiatives
and our beer outlet and cooler expansion
programmes contributed positively to
volume growth. Revenue management was
supported by premium volumes growing to
over 50% of the portfolio. Renewed focus
is now being placed on affordability and the
attractiveness of our mainstream brands.
Soft drinks reported growth of 9%, with 
our Tropical brand achieving growth 
of 23%, following a renewed imaging
campaign. Our market share of soft 
drinks improved by 4% to 55% through
improved sales execution activities, despite
continuing competition in the soft drink
market and the shift in mix to family one
way packs.

In Panama lager volumes were up by 
13% driven by the relaunch and upsizing

price increase during October 2007. Share
gains were strong and share of the beer
market increased by 120 basis points

impact of volume growth and price and mix
benefits boosted revenue and were partially
offset by increases in raw material costs.

EBITA margin was up 10 basis points. 
Marketing expenditure has increased 
but has benefited from scale economies. 
Reported EBITA growth of 30% was
impacted by currency translation gains 
and also included Royal Grolsch from mid
February 2008. On an organic constant
currency basis, EBITA growth was 15%. 
In Poland, strong economic fundamentals
underpinned growth of all alcoholic
beverages. Our organic domestic lager
volumes increased 11% (with inorganic
growth of 12%) against industry growth 
of 7% and market share for the year was
up 220 basis points to 40.8%. Tyskie and
Zubr, Poland’s two leading beer brands,
grew volumes by 9% and 17% respectively,
assisted by national consumer promotions,
leveraging sponsorships and increasing 
on-premise distribution. Lech grew 12%
supported by strong trade activation,
utilising music and leisure associations.
Premium brand Redd’s, with its three
flavour variants, grew 21% including 
sales of a new sleek can. We increased
prices by an average of 3% across the
portfolio, with a similar increase in constant
currency revenue per hectolitre being
achieved, continuing the trend started in
the previous year. Trade marketing support
was enhanced by new automated data
interchange with our main distributors and
the placement of additional coolers in the
trade. Further capacity expansion brought
total capacity to over 17 million hl, while
current year sales volume was 14.4 million
hl. In January 2008, we completed the
acquisition of Browar Belgia.
In Czech, our strategy is to pursue value
rather than volume in this mature market.
Beer industry volumes were up less than
1% and within this our domestic volumes
were marginally ahead. Focused channel
segmentation, expansion in on-premise,
increased pricing and premiumisation 
led to an increase in constant currency
revenue per hectolitre of 5% and an 
EBITA increase despite significantly 
higher commodity prices. In the premium
segment our national flagship brand 
Pilsner Urquell grew 3%, supported by
exclusively branded on-premise outlets 
and Beer Theatre concepts in the modern
off-premise channel. In the specialty
segment, we introduced the Master 
brand with super-premium pricing, 
and the Frisco brand continued to 
grow, by 23%. In mainstream, Kozel’s 
19% domestic volume growth offset
Gambrinus’s 5% decline as our average
6% price increase prompted some
switching. Kozel continued developing 
as a successful regional brand with annual
volumes of 2.8 million hl, up 12% regionally.
Significant cost productivity has been
Europe delivered another excellent 
result with total lager volume growth of 
9% (organic 8%) within which premium
volumes grew 11%. Volumes were
particularly strong in Poland, Romania 
and Russia and were assisted by warm
weather in the earlier months, but cycled
an exceptionally mild winter in the second
half of the prior year. Brewing raw material
and packaging costs increased significantly.
However, the pricing environment has
shown some signs of improvement and
with positive brand mix has resulted in
constant currency revenue per hectolitre
growing by 4%. This, together with
achieved in marketing and distribution 
by leveraging scale and rationalising 
media activities.
In Russia, beer industry volumes grew 
10% and share of the total alcohol market
increased 3% to 32%. Rapid growth in 
real incomes is driving share gains for the
premium beer segment and our volumes
were up 14% as we increased market
share. We expanded national retail
coverage with an increase of 300 staff 
in the sales force, and installed over 
75,000 coolers. We achieved average 
price increases of 11% across our portfolio 
over the year. Our biggest brand Zolotaya
Bochka grew 16% with strong marketing
support. Miller Genuine Draft was up 9%,
to almost 1 million hl, driven by expanding
distribution of the new half litre bottle, and
Kozel grew 13%. Redd’s has new primary
and secondary packaging, including a 
new can, and grew by 22%. The second
production site at Ulyanovsk is on track for
commissioning in May 2009 and its initial
capacity has been increased to 4 million hl.
Until then, with existing operations at full
capacity, contract brewing arrangements
have been put in place over the 
summer period. 
In Italy, Birra Peroni was the fastest
growing brewer in 2007 with a share 
gain of 100 basis points in a flat domestic
market. Our branded volumes grew 5%
with Peroni and Nastro Azzurro up 7% 
and 8% respectively. This growth has come
from success in the on-premise channel 
in the North particularly with Peroni 
draught and the 330ml Nastro Azzurro
bottle. Both brands have leveraged
national sponsorships in sport, music 
and film festivals, while premiumisation 
has been supported by international 
design events. Growth was achieved in all
channels, assisted by our own distribution,
and two price increases were successfully
implemented, the latest being 8% in
January 2008. The Rome and Bari
breweries are both being expanded to
satisfy ongoing export demand and total
capacity in Italy will be 6.3 million hl.
In Romania, industry volumes grew 
9% supported by increased real wages
and disposable income, and our new
mainstream PET offerings. Our volumes
were up 28% following capacity increases,
and our share grew by 3.5% to 25.4%.

achieved and all brands enjoyed significant

growth. Timisoreana grew 43%, extending
its reach in the off-premise channel with
our new PET packaging, and secured its
number one position in the market with an
estimated 14% share. The Ursus Premium
brand maintained its leadership in the
premium segment, with 8% growth, and
has increased penetration in upscale on-
premise outlets. All brands benefited from
better point of sale execution and a new
distributor incentive scheme, with intensive
display and tailored service packages in all
channels. Current capacity expansions will
bring overall capacity to 6.8 million hl.
In Hungary, consumers have been hit 
hard by the fiscal austerity measures. 
The beer market grew during the early
summer months with the introduction of
PET offerings, but volumes were lower in
the fourth quarter. In these conditions, our
volumes were level and our share was up
140 basis points. Our focus has been on
productivity and efficiencies which have
improved profitability.
In the United Kingdom, Miller Brands’
volumes grew 36% in a declining market,
driven by innovative marketing and
increased distribution, with Peroni Nastro
Azzurro up 39%. Performance was also
supported by double digit volume growth
for both our Polish brands, Lech and Tyskie.
In the Netherlands, our integration

Miller Brewing Company made progress
against all its strategic objectives, and
delivered strong earnings growth for the
fiscal year from increased volumes, an
industry-leading increase in revenue per
barrel of 4.0%, and effective cost reduction
despite higher fuel and raw material 
input costs.
Miller continued to migrate its brand
portfolio to higher margin, higher growth
segments of the market while enhancing
value for distributors and retailers, and 
its flagship Miller Lite brand posted 
volume gains with segment leading 
pricing. Increased spending on core brand
marketing and innovation was funded in
part from disciplined cost reduction and
efficiency savings. Notably for the first 
time, Miller was recognised as the number
one by distributors for overall supplier
performance in the US industry-wide
Tamarron survey.
Total US domestic beer industry shipments
to wholesalers (STWs) increased 1.1%,
while total import shipments were down
2.5% for the year. Craft beers continued
their strong growth, up 12% over prior
year. Against this backdrop, Miller’s US
domestic shipments to retailers (STRs)
were up 3.1% when adjusted for one
additional trading day against the prior 
year (up 3.5% unadjusted) and grew 
0.7% on an adjusted organic basis
(excluding Sparks and Steel Reserve).
Miller’s US domestic sales to wholesalers
(STWs) grew 3.9% on an unadjusted basis,
and were up 1.5% on an organic basis.
International shipments fell slightly.
Miller Lite STRs increased by 1.1% (1.5%
unadjusted) following a return to its intrinsic
brand marketing platform. Miller High Life
sales increased 1.1% (1.5% unadjusted) 
on the strength of its successful ‘Take 
Back the High Life’ campaign, which
helped reverse a three-year decline in the
franchise. Miller Genuine Draft declined by
10.6% adjusted (10.2% unadjusted) for the
year in a declining segment. Milwaukee’s
Best continued to experience declines in
the economy sector, while Icehouse and
Mickey’s volumes grew, helping to offset
partially the declines of both MGD and
Milwaukee’s Best. 
The national launch of Miller Chill 
exceeded expectations with the brand
selling approximately 500,000 barrels
during the year, and Miller’s worthmore
portfolio overall grew by nearly 50%.
Sparks, Peroni and Leinenkugel’s 
delivered strong full year double digit
growth. To capture the continuing growth
and consumer shift towards light beers,
Miller test-marketed new light beer brands
Miller Genuine Draft 64 (MGD 64) and 
Miller Lite Brewers Collection, which,
following a positive reaction, will be 
rolled out nationally in the next year.
Miller strengthened its chain sales
capabilities and enjoyed a 4.6% increase 
in chain sales volume. The success of 
its “model market” operations, a semi-
autonomous management framework,
in Texas and Florida/Georgia contributed 
to share growth in Texas and share
stabilisation in the Southeast. 
Total revenue grew 4.8% to US$5,120
million, while domestic revenue was 
up 7.4% to US$4,578 million. Contract
brewing revenue declined 15.8% due in
part to the purchase of Sparks and Steel
Reserve (which were previously brewed
under contract) from McKenzie River in
2006. Domestic revenue per barrel
increased 4.0% due to price increases

of 23% (organic growth of 15%) and
reported EBITA growth of 22% (organic
constant currency growth of 16%). EBITA
margin decreased from 17.5% to 16.9% 
as a result of the faster growth in the lower

an increase in Africa margins.
Africa
Lager volumes for Africa, excluding
Zimbabwe, grew 12% (organic growth 
of 6%) for the year as did total volumes,
benefiting from continued economic
growth in all countries, rising disposable
incomes, and ongoing brand renovation. 
Tanzania posted lager volume growth of
8% in a competitive market and our brand
portfolio, sales force and route-to-market
have been strengthened to capture further
growth. Growth has been led by Ndovu
Lager following its re-formulation as a full
malt beer. Eagle, our sorghum based lager,
was launched in the North East with early
success and positive consumer response.
Rising input costs were mitigated by
improved operating efficiencies and a
stable local currency. We have commenced
construction of a new 0.5 million hl brewery
in the Southern region.
Mozambique enjoyed its fourth consecutive
year of strong growth, with lager volumes
advancing 8%. The brand portfolio is well
balanced and differentiated and affordable
draught beer continues to deliver 
ahead of expectation by reaching new
consumers. Major capacity enhancements
were completed at both the Maputo and
Beira breweries, with operating efficiencies
improving, and further depots were opened
during the year. Construction of the new
road infrastructure along the Zambezi River 
will yield further growth opportunities in 
the North and as a result we have started
building a new 0.5 million hl brewery 
in Nampula.
Botswana grew strongly after two
disappointing years, with overall growth 
of 15% in aggregate volumes of lager 
and soft drinks. Key to this result was the
successful renovation of St. Louis Lager, 
the market leader, and the introduction 
of a new 750ml returnable bottle. The
returnable bottle has delivered ahead 
of expectation in this predominantly 
one way pack market, and offers the
consumer better value for money.
Uganda’s lager volumes grew 4% after
three prior years of exceptional growth.
After excellent growth in recent years,
volumes of our sorghum-based Eagle
brand declined following an excise
increase, while our mainstream lager
brands Nile Special and Club grew in 
mid double digits. The market continues 
to grow and has nearly doubled in the 
last four years, driven by the success 
of our portfolio extensions.
Angola’s economy continues to grow
strongly at approximately 20% per annum.
The infrastructure, however, is unable to
support the increasing demands for goods
and services and our total volume growth
of just under 10% was constrained by 
both the lack of infrastructure and limited
capacity. Total volumes for lager and soft
drinks for the year were almost 3.5 million
hl, including lager volumes of the recently
privatised Empresa De Cervejas N’gola in
which we invested at the end of last year.
We continued to expand our lager and 
soft drinks capacity, supported by new
local manufacture of glass and cans by
global suppliers.
+16%
EBITA increase on an organic
constant currency basis
of 2.4% for the year complemented by 
the mix benefits from the successful
growth of the worthmore portfolio,
including Miller Chill. 
Through continued brewing efficiencies 
and cost savings derived from successful
projects, the company was able largely to
offset commodity cost increases, resulting
in an increase in domestic cost of goods
sold per barrel of low single digits. Marketing
spending increased upper single digits.
EBITA for the period increased 27% to
US$477 million driven primarily by the
strong pricing, increased volume, effective
management of fixed costs, and including
a non-recurring gain of US$33 million from
the October 2007 settlement of a dispute
with the Ball Metal Beverage Container
Corporation. This resulted in a one-time
payment to Miller of some US$70 million, 
a portion of which is attributable to our
contract brewing partners. The gain
includes an amount of US$16 million
relating to materials supplied to Miller
during the prior year and US$17 million 
for other non-recurring contractual matters.
In preparation for the proposed joint
venture with Coors Brewing Company,
which remains subject to regulatory
clearance, a charge of US$51 million has
been recorded by Miller for staff retention
arrangements and certain integration
costs, and this has been treated as an
exceptional item. The group expects to
record further charges up to completion 
of the transaction which is not anticipated
to occur before the middle of calendar year
2008. These amounts were included in the
previously announced estimates of costs
associated with the proposed joint venture. 28 Operations review
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
In the premium segment, we have
launched Peroni Nastro Azzurro in five
African markets with good initial results 
and plan to roll out the brand to other
countries in due course. Grolsch will 
be launched in certain key markets.
Traditional sorghum-based beer returned
to growth (excluding Zimbabwe) this year,
with excellent results from both Malawi 
and Botswana. The category continues 
to play an important part in our African
portfolio and is less vulnerable than 
lager to international commodity cost
increases given the extensive use of 
local raw materials.
Castel enjoyed another strong year with
total volumes up 11% – lager 16% and soft
drinks 6%. Ethiopia and Angola continued
to provide above average growth for the
group, while further growth was captured
in its key markets of Cameroon, Gabon
and Morocco. The growth in Angola is
linked to underlying economic prosperity,
while in Ethiopia the growth has come
largely from market place activities
including portfolio segmentation and pack
innovations. Cameroon volumes advanced
in double digits in a competitive market.
While underlying EBITA growth was strong,
the strength of the Euro further assisted
reported performance in US dollars.
EBITA margin for our Africa business
advanced despite the impact of rising
commodity costs. These impacts on 
the business are limited due to significant
volume growth in soft drinks, which are
less dependent on agricultural inputs, 
and our sorghum beer, which is based
on local supply.
Asia
In China, our associate CR Snow
continued to outperform the industry 
with full year lager volume growth of 25%,
representing organic growth of 15%, and
full year market share improving to 18%.
Momentum for the first half (where CR
Snow’s organic lager volume growth of
30% was well above the industry and peer
group) slowed in the second half due to 
the combined effect of a severe winter,
reduced discretionary spend and price
increases in this period. The Snow brand 
is now China’s largest lager brand and 
it enjoyed exceptional growth again this 
year of 63%. 
+63%
increase in volumes of the 
Snow brand
EBITA grew but increases in commodity
prices and the acquisition of a number 
of breweries, which typically depresses
profits in the initial years, reduced margins.
Capacity was further increased with the
construction of greenfield breweries and
upgrades to existing plants. The non-core
water business was disposed of in May
2007 impacting total soft drink volumes.
India grew strongly with lager volume
growth of 23% (organic increase of 
19%) following strong growth in the prior
year. Total volumes of 4.4 million hl were
achieved, with national market share 
gain of 1% despite having no meaningful
presence in the key Southern state of 
Tamil Nadu. The Foster’s business has
been fully integrated and the brand led 
our growth as it was rolled out more 
widely. The strong beer segment continues
to grow ahead of mild beer, with our
brands continuing to do well.
Our new Asia joint ventures are building
momentum, with Australia ahead of
expectation due to strong performances
from Peroni Nastro Azzurro, MGD and the
recent successful launch of Miller Chill. 
We recently announced our intention to
build a greenfield brewery in New South
Wales and we are integrating the recently
acquired Bluetongue brewery. In Vietnam,
volumes are improving with the addition 
of Redd’s to the portfolio, and we have
commissioned a can line to expand our
pack range.

Economic growth in South Africa slowed 
in the second half of the year as the effects
of higher fuel and food costs as well as
increased levels of household debt in a
higher interest rate environment slowed
consumer spending. Gross domestic
product growth for calendar year 2007 
of 3.9% was down on the 5% growth 
rate for 2006.
Volume performance was satisfactory 
with lager volumes in line with those of 
the prior year, notwithstanding the loss 
of our licence for the Amstel brand in
March 2007 (9% of volumes in the year 
to March 2007). Soft drinks were 4% up
despite cycling tough comparatives in the
prior year, when volumes grew by 7%,
and the carbon dioxide shortages
experienced in the country over the fourth
quarter of this year, and despite a decline 
in volumes in the lower margin alternative
beverage category, primarily due to the
discontinuation of the Bibo fruit cordial 
and Milo brands. Operations review 29

financial year. EBITA benefited from some
foreign currency gains on contracts related
to procurement. Overall EBITA margin
decreased by 270 basis points to 23.1%.
Good progress was made in the phased
replacement of the 750ml returnable bottle
population for our mainstream brands 
and by March 2008 all but two of our
breweries were producing product in 
the new bottle. The market has reacted
positively to the modernised new bottle,
contributing to a resurgence in growth of
the mainstream category. This renovation
programme is scheduled to be complete
by September 2008. The phased
introduction of 430 million new bottles 
has added complexity to the supply 
grid which has resulted in increased
transport expenditure.
There were a number of new product
launches and pack renovations in the 
year. The May 2007 launch of Hansa
Marzen Gold proved to be very successful
and contributed over 23% of total premium
sales in the year. Innovation in the FAB
category saw two new brands being
launched in the last quarter of the 
financial year. Sarita Ruby, a dry, red,
apple-flavoured FAB and Skelter’s 
Straight, a citrus flavoured offering, 
were launched in February 2008 and
March 2008 respectively. Both the Hansa
Pilsener and Castle brands received label
redesigns in the year to coincide with the
introduction of the new 750ml returnable
bottle. In the premium segment, the Peroni
Nastro Azzurro range was extended to
include draught, 330ml cans and a new
660ml returnable bulk pack. 
Despite the slow progress by local
authorities in the granting of retail 
liquor licences, our Mahlasedi taverner
programme trained some 3,400 taverners
during the year, bringing the total number
to date to over 13,400. This is in line with
our commitment to invest US$14 million in
this initiative over five years. Administrative
delays at local government level continue
to hamper the progress of liquor licensing
across the country.
The Department of Trade and Industry
issued the final Broad Based Black
Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Codes
of Good Practice in early February 2007.
The liquor industry’s formulation of a Sector
Code had been suspended pending the
publication of the BBBEE Codes, but
resumed in mid 2007 with the active
involvement of the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI). The DTI has required that
the industry involve a very broad group of
stakeholders in the process. It is anticipated
that the Sector Code will be finalised
towards the end of calendar year 2008. 
Appletiser continued to show strong
volume growth of 18%, arising mainly 
from its international markets
Distell’s results benefited from
improvements in both domestic and
international volumes. Domestic sales
volume increases have been driven by
cider brands and the ready-to-drink
categories, despite shortages in the 
supply of packaging materials and 
carbon dioxide. Margins were also
improved through operating efficiencies.
Hotels and Gaming
SABMiller is a 49% shareholder in 
the Tsogo Sun group. The financial
performance of Tsogo Sun continues 
to be strong. The gaming industry in 
South Africa has grown steadily, with real
growth in casino win being experienced 
by all participants. However, economic
circumstances in recent months indicate 
a slowdown in activity.
The South African hotel industry has again
enjoyed strong Revpar growth as a result
of a robust local economy and growth in
international arrivals. Increased demand
coupled with limited capacity growth, has
assisted Tsogo Sun in achieving a year 
on year increase in Revpar of 24% in
constant currency. 
The improved level of trading, assisted by
control of costs, resulted in strong growth
in EBITA and margins.
Volumes grew in both the mainstream 
lager and flavoured alcoholic beverage
(FAB) categories. Robust growth in 
Hansa Pilsener and Castle Milk Stout
underpinned mid single digit growth in 
the mainstream category and strong
growth across the Brutal Fruit range
contributed to the double digit increase 
in FAB volumes. In the premium segment,
we successfully launched our new brand,
Hansa Marzen Gold, Castle Lite grew
strongly and Peroni Nastro Azzurro
volumes more than doubled, but this 
did not fully offset the anticipated loss 
of premium volumes as the competing
product re-entered the market.
Revenue grew by 6% on a constant
currency basis. Price increases were at 
a level somewhat below inflation for both
lager and soft drinks, and revenue growth
was constrained by adverse mix effects 
in lager, driven by the swing out of higher
priced premium brands into mainstream.
Higher raw material input costs in the beer
business placed margins under pressure.
Increasing international commodity prices
led to a large increase in key brewing raw
materials, and packaging costs rose on the
back of higher energy and oil prices. Glass
costs were also up significantly following the
importation of glass in the current year at a
premium to local supply, due to capacity
constraints at local glass manufacturers.
Distribution costs rose by over 30% in 
the current year. Higher international 
crude oil prices together with the
depreciation of the rand drove South
African diesel costs up by some 47% 
in the year to March 2008. This was
exacerbated by incremental distribution
costs associated with servicing the 16%
increase in main market outlets (totalling
23,400 outlets in the full year) which is in
line with our direct distribution initiative. 
EBITA on a constant currency basis for 
the year was 6% lower than the prior year,
driven primarily by higher raw material input
and distribution cost increases. In addition,
the EBITA impact of the loss of the Amstel
licence is estimated at approximately
US$50 million for the year driven by
adverse mix, incremental investments 
in marketing and new products and
packaging development. The competitor
product re-entered the South African
market in the second quarter of the

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Managing sustainable development issues is an integral part of a successful
global business. Our progress in this area is overseen by the Corporate
Accountability and Risk Assurance Committee (CARAC).
Sustainable development: Making a difference through beer
Sustainability and business
With a heritage rooted in Africa – a continent
with 66% of the world’s poor and 315 million
people living on less than a dollar a day –
we are very conscious of our responsibilities
to society. In itself, business activity serves
a social purpose – to provide the goods
and services that society wants. As long 
as markets are competitive and free,
companies will succeed and make profits
only when they manage relationships
effectively, use resources efficiently and
meet society’s needs.
Business is also part of society with 
a comprehensive set of relationships 
with all the many individuals involved 
in its activities. Business is at one and 
the same time an employer, a customer, 
a supplier and a taxpayer and the interests 
of business and the wider community 
are inextricably linked. This is perhaps 
truer for our business than for many
multinational companies as beer is 
typically a local product: brewed locally,
sold locally and consumed locally.
Accordingly, the health and prosperity 
of the communities in which we operate 
is intimately linked to our ability to grow
profitably. But this only holds true if we
operate in a responsible and accountable
way. Behaving responsibly towards all 
our stakeholders is part of our beliefs and
fundamental to building sustainable markets.
Making a difference through beer
The main way in which we add value 
to the economies, communities and
environments in which we operate is 
by being a responsible and profitable
business. Through employment, taxation
and the purchasing of goods and services,
we make a significant contribution to local
economic development. 
One example of our influence on the
economy comes from South Africa 
where, during the year, we recalculated 
our impact using the government’s
economic data. Here we directly employ
more than 9,000 permanent employees,
creating an estimated 48,000 jobs among
direct suppliers and as many as 378,000
full-time jobs (3% of total employment) in
South Africa as a whole. Total household
income directly and indirectly related to
SAB’s operations, amounts to just over
US$1 billion.
But the picture is broader than providing
jobs or income. For example, the United
Nations has estimated that a lack of
access to basic water and sanitation
services alone deprives sub-Saharan 
Africa of a further 5% of GDP . Programmes
linked to our sustainable development
priorities – in particular, engaging with
communities in responsible water
management, HIV/Aids testing and
treatment, enterprise development through
supply chain management and corporate
social investment – also contribute
indirectly to economic development.
Through running a successful business 
and taking these issues seriously, we 
are contributing to development and to
meeting the United Nations Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). In 2007, 
we underlined our commitment by
becoming a signatory to the Declaration 
on the Millennium Development Goals. 
This recognised the role business has 
to play in meeting the MDGs and
acknowledged that while progress has
been made, the international community
must accelerate its efforts if they are to 
be met by 2015.
We also remain committed to the 10
principles of the United Nations Global
Compact. During the year we identified
opportunities for leadership where we 
will focus our global efforts: discouraging
irresponsible drinking, making more 
beer but using less water and enterprise
development.
Discouraging irresponsible drinking
In the last year we have established 
a comprehensive Alcohol Framework. 
This builds on our previous Alcohol
Manifesto and provides a globally
consistent understanding of our beliefs 
on alcohol to ensure a consistent
philosophy that underpins our work and
guides our everyday decisions. In June we
joined more than 40 other businesses and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to
become a charter member of the European
Alcohol and Health Forum. This focuses 
on concrete actions to reduce harmful 
drinking in the European Union, including
the prevention of under-age drinking.
Through our involvement in the International
Center for Alcohol Policies, we have 
also contributed to the advancement of
responsible marketing practices around 
the world. In Africa we are working with
several governments, NGOs and public
health organisations to develop national
alcohol policies to reduce alcohol-related
harm. As a result of these efforts, Lesotho
adopted its first national policy in October
2007. Policies are nearing completion in
Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia, Malawi 
and Ghana.
Enterprise development
One of the dilemmas of a globalising 
world is the increasing dependence on
global supply chains which offer economies
of scale through a smaller number of 
higher volume suppliers. While this has 
its advantages, it also has a downside 
for smaller, national suppliers of goods 
and services. 
We believe that genuinely free trade
benefits all, especially the developing
world. However, there are factors which
strengthen the case for local sourcing
models, such as improved access to
quality raw materials. We manage our
supply chains with a view to the long-
term benefits to our operations. These
encompass the availability of key brewing
inputs such as malted barley and the
stimulus such purchasing gives to local
economic growth. On this basis, we have
invested extensively in small-scale supplier
relationships where these are possible,
particularly with smallholder farmers in
Africa, India and, increasingly, Latin
America, in order to build local agricultural
capacity and secure supplies of critical 
raw materials. As result we have created,
or improved, 10,500 jobs for farmers
working in these regions.

Our efforts on corporate social investment
also contribute to economic development,
For example our operations in South Africa
have been supporting entrepreneurs for
over 10 years. KickStart is a project that
promotes business awareness and
entrepreneurship among young people 
by providing training, grants, mentorship
and assistance during the setup phase of a
new business. Since its inception, SAB Ltd
has invested over US$5 million in KickStart,
equipping almost 22,700 young adults with
business skills and helping them to start 
up nearly 3,300 businesses. This approach
is now being applied elsewhere – in
Botswana for over four years and, more
recently, Colombia. 
Making more beer but using less water
In July 2007 we signed the CEO Water
Mandate, an initiative of the United 
Nations Global Compact, which 
committed SABMiller to leadership in 
water management. The principles of the
Mandate fit well with our own approach 
to water management and we look forward
to working further with other companies 
to make progress in this area.
Current water consumption for our 
brewing operations is 4.6 hectolitres of
water per hectolitre of beer produced. 
This compares favourably to our
competitors, and the industry benchmark
of 5.0 hectolitres of water per hectolitre
of beer published by the United Nations
Environment Programme. However, our
performance has remained static for the 
last few years. In the next year we will be
increasing our focus in this area to reduce
our water use.
Broader environmental performance
In the last 12 months we have reduced 
the use of energy in our brewing operations
marginally from 151 to 150 megajoules 
per hectolitre with related carbon emissions 
of 13.7 kilograms/hectolitre. We are
working to increase the amount of
renewable energy we produce and during
the year this figure increased to 1.5% of
total plant energy use, up from 0.9%
reported last year, largely through the
combustion of biogas from water treatment
plants. We continue to achieve high levels
of reuse with over half of our beers being
sold in reusable packaging and we
recycled/reused over 96% of our 
waste across the group as a whole.
We are committed to high standards 
of environmental performance in all new
capital investments. During the year we
established a new set of guidelines for 
all major capital investments. These state 
that all new breweries will aim to be within
10% of the current group best in terms of
their performance on water, energy and
carbon and waste. In this way, we are
making sure we consider the long-term
sustainability of all new plants.
Valuing and empowering our people
Attracting and retaining good people
remains a critical component of supporting
our growth and bringing new skills and
knowledge to the organisation, and during
the year staff each received an average 
of 3.9 days training. Our employees 
cover a vast mix of cultures, beliefs and
backgrounds and we both value and
respect this diversity. While 19% of our
total workforce is female, women account
for 26% of our management and executive
grades, up from 22% reported last year. 
Health and safety
During the year we recorded 1,446
industrial injuries, up from 1,091 reported
last year while overall days lost through
injury is down to 12,809 from 13,720. 
We have revised last year’s figure for days
lost to improve accuracy. It is with regret
that we report two fatalities in our business
during the year. The first occurred in
SABMiller India and related to an accident
at our Haryana brewery, and the second
was one of our truck drivers in South
Africa, the result of gunshot wounds 
from an attempted hijack.
Sustainable development governance
During the year our sustainable
development framework has been further
embedded into our operations. Our local
managing directors are responsible for
integrating sustainable development
considerations into their business plans, 
as appropriate for their own markets. 
In particular, we encourage our local
operations to consider how their business
can add value to our three global focus
areas, namely discouraging irresponsible
drinking, managing water responsibly 
and promoting enterprise development.
In March 2008 we agreed a new Code 
of Business Conduct and Ethics to which
all employees must adhere. This Code
represents a clear, conscious and personal
commitment to doing what is right. The
Code will be introduced across the group
in the coming year.

We are reducing the weight of
our packaging, reusing bottles
and encouraging recycling,
thereby saving money and raw
materials and reducing pressure
on local waste services. 
� Evaluate where existing
packaging materials can 
be substituted with better
alternatives.

Board of directors: composition 
and independence
The board currently consists of the Chairman (Mr Kahn); eight
independent non-executive directors (including Lord Fellowes, 
the Senior Independent Director); five non-executive directors 
who are not considered to be independent; and two executive
directors (Mr Mackay, the Chief Executive, and Mr Wyman, the
Chief Financial Officer). Biographical information concerning 
each of the directors is set out on pages 42 and 43.
The size and certain aspects of the composition of the board 
and of the audit, nomination and corporate accountability and 
risk assurance committees are determined primarily by the terms
of our relationship agreement with Altria, which was originally
approved by shareholders in 2002 as part of the Miller transaction,
and was amended, with shareholders’ approval, in 2005 as part 
of the Bavaria transaction, and by the terms of our relationship
agreement with BevCo (a holding company of the Santo Domingo
Group), which was approved by shareholders in 2005 as part 
of the Bavaria transaction.
The agreement with Altria limits the size of the board to a
maximum of 15 directors, of whom no more than two are to be
executive directors, up to three are to be non-executive directors
nominated by Altria, up to two are to be non-executive directors
nominated by BevCo, and up to eight are to be non-executive
directors appointed by the board. The agreement with BevCo
allows BevCo to nominate up to two non-executive directors 
for appointment to the board.
The board is grateful to Altria for its indulgence in permitting for 
the time being the maximum number of directors allowed under
the relationship agreement to be exceeded, in order to assist 
the company to meet the requirements of the Combined Code.
Altria and BevCo have each exercised their right under their
respective agreements to nominate one director for appointment
to the nomination committee. BevCo has the right to nominate 
one director for appointment to the corporate accountability and
risk assurance committee (CARAC) (although it has not exercised
this right), and Altria has the right to nominate one director for
appointment to the audit committee (which it has exercised).
Ms De Lisi, who was nominated for appointment to the board 
and the audit committee by Altria, stepped down from the 
board on 30 April 2007, following her retirement from Altria. 
Altria nominated Mr Dinyar Devitre to replace Ms De Lisi. 
Mr Devitre was, until 31 March 2008, Senior Vice President 
and Chief Financial Officer of Altria and is currently a member 
of the board of Altria. He joined the board of SABMiller as a 
non-executive director with effect from 16 May 2007.
The board considers eight directors – Ms Doherty, Lord Fellowes,
Mr Manser, Mr Manzoni, Mr Morland, Mr Pieterse, Ms Ramos 
and Mr Ramaphosa – to be independent for the purposes of the
Combined Code. The board considers six non-executive directors
(including the Chairman) not to be independent for the purposes 
of the Combined Code: Mr Bible and Mr Devitre, as they are
nominees of Altria, the company’s largest shareholder; Mr Santo
Domingo Dávila and Mr Pérez Dávila, as they are nominees of the
Santo Domingo Group, the company’s second largest shareholder;
Lord Renwick of Clifton, because of his position with JPMorgan
Cazenove; and the Chairman, Mr Kahn, who is a former chief
executive of the company and has served continuously on the
board, or on the board of the company’s predecessor, since 1981
(although he has been a director of the company only since 1999)
and, as Chairman, is deemed not to be independent under the
Combined Code.
34 Corporate governance
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Corporate governance
1. 
The directors’ report on 
corporate governance
The directors are committed to maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance, which they see as fundamental to
discharging their stewardship responsibilities. The board strives 
to provide the right leadership, strategic oversight and control
environment to produce and sustain the delivery of value to all of 
the company’s shareholders. The board applies integrity, principles
of good governance and accountability throughout its activities and
each director brings independence of character and judgment to the
role. All of the members of the board are individually and collectively
aware of their responsibilities to the company’s stakeholders.
The principal governance rules applying to UK companies 
listed on the London Stock Exchange are currently contained in
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance adopted by the
Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (the Combined Code).
This report describes the board’s approach to corporate
governance and explains how it applies the Combined Code.
2. 
Application of the 
Combined Code
The board applied the principles and provisions of the Combined
Code throughout the year ended 31 March 2008, except in the
following respects (with items (a) to (d) being dealt with more 
fully in sections 3 and 5 of this report):
a) at least half the board, excluding the Chairman, were not
independent for the purposes of the Combined Code;
b) the audit committee did not consist solely of independent
directors, as the committee included Ms De Lisi, an Altria
Group, Inc. (‘Altria’) nominee, until her retirement on 30 April
2007, and then Mr Devitre, Altria’s nominated replacement 
for Ms De Lisi, neither of whom is independent for the 
purposes of the Combined Code;
c) the nomination committee did not comprise a majority 
of independent non-executive directors throughout the 
period following the appointment to the nomination committee, 
under the terms of the respective relationship agreements 
with Altria and BevCo Ltd (‘BevCo’) of Mr Bible and
Mr Santo Domingo Dávila to the nomination committee.
The appointments took effect on 14 November 2007; 
d) the chairman of the nomination committee, although
considered by the board to be independent in character 
and judgement, was not independent for the purposes of 
the Combined Code; and 
e) one director was not able to attend the 2007 annual general
meeting because of a longstanding prior commitment.
The board has taken a number of steps to redress the balance 
of independent directors on the board and nomination committee:
a) Ms Maria Ramos and Mr Rob Pieterse were appointed 
to the board on 15 May 2008. Both are independent 
non-executive directors; and
b) Mr Ramaphosa, an independent non-executive director, was
appointed to the nomination committee on 14 November 2007.
Lord Renwick of Clifton retires from the board on 31 July 2008. 
He stepped down as a member and as chairman of the
nomination committee on 31 March 2008. 
With effect from 15 May 2008, over half the board, excluding the
Chairman, were independent for the purposes of the Combined
Code and, with effect from 1 April 2008, a majority of the directors
on the nomination committee were independent for the purposes
of the Combined Code. Corporategovernance 35
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
For ease of reference, directors’ independence status for
Combined Code purposes is indicated in the table below.
The board continues to believe that its overall composition 
remains appropriate, having regard in particular to the
independence of character and integrity of all of its directors, 
and the experience and skills which they bring to their duties. 
The board is confident that the appointment of both Ms Ramos
and Mr Pieterse, two distinguished and internationally acclaimed
individuals, will make a significant contribution to its deliberations. 
It is now nine years since the company listed on the London Stock
Exchange. SABMiller has been fortunate to retain the services of
several distinguished non-executive directors, the Chairman, Lord
Fellowes, Mr Morland, Mr Ramaphosa and Lord Renwick, for the
entire nine-year period. They have provided considerable stability
to the board since the listing in 1999 and the board has benefited
greatly from the presence of individuals who have over time gained
valuable insight into the group, its markets and the industry. The
provisions of the Combined Code require the board to consider,
where a director has served for a period of more than nine years,
whether that director continues to be independent. The board has
conducted a rigorous review of the performance of the Chairman,
Lord Fellowes, Mr Morland and Mr Ramaphosa and considers 
that each of these directors brings invaluable integrity, wisdom and
experience to the board and that they continue to contribute to the
direct, robust and constructive debate held within the board and
committee deliberations. Therefore, the board is entirely satisfied
as to the continued independence of each of these directors.
Under the Combined Code, directors who have served for more
than nine years are required to stand for annual re-election and the
board has determined that they should do so. The board does not
consider it to be in the interests of the company or shareholders 
to require all four of the directors who have served for nine years 
to retire at the same time (as noted, Lord Renwick will be retiring 
in July 2008) and strongly favours ensuring continuity and stability
through orderly succession. 
While recognising the benefits of the experience and stability
brought by its long-standing directors, the board remains
committed to the progressive renewal of board membership 
and has therefore acted to bring about the appointment of 
Ms Ramos and Mr Pieterse. The board will continue to act 
in the best interests of the company and shareholders as it
considers further appointments and the future tenure of the
directors who have served for more than nine years.
The board considers that the composition of the audit 
committee remains appropriate, given Altria’s interest as the
company’s largest shareholder, and is satisfied that, having 
regard to the terms of the relationship agreement between 
the company and Altria, and to the experience and background 
in financial matters of Mr Devitre, the independence and
effectiveness of the audit committee in discharging its functions 
in terms of the Combined Code continue to be considerably
enhanced and not compromised. 
4.
How the board operates 
4.1 Board meetings and attendance
During the year there were six scheduled board meetings. 
Two additional board meetings were held to consider particular
projects. Individual directors’ attendance at board and committee
meetings and at the annual general meeting is set out in the table
below. The directors nominated by Altria waived their fees during
the period under review.
In the few instances where a director has not been able to attend 
a board or committee meeting, any comments which he or she
has had arising out of the papers to be considered at that meeting
have been relayed in advance to the relevant chairman.
4.2 Operation of the board 
The board sets the strategic objectives of the group, determines
investment policies, agrees on performance criteria and delegates
to management the detailed planning and implementation of 
those objectives and policies in accordance with appropriate 
risk parameters. The board monitors compliance with policies 
and achievement against objectives by holding management
accountable for its activities through monthly and quarterly
performance reporting and budget updates. In addition, the 
board receives regular presentations, on a rotational basis, from
the divisional managing directors as well as from directors of key
group functions (marketing, corporate affairs, human resources
and legal) enabling it to explore specific issues and developments
in greater detail.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Corporate governance continued
Board and committee meetings are held in an atmosphere of
intellectual honesty of purpose, integrity and mutual respect,
requiring reporting of the highest standard by management 
and direct, robust and constructive debate among board and
committee members.
4.3 Matters reserved for the board 
There is a schedule of matters which are dealt with exclusively 
by the board. These include approval of financial statements; 
the group’s business strategy; the annual capital expenditure plan;
major capital projects; major changes to the group’s management
and control structure; material investments or disposals; risk
management strategy; social and environmental policy; and
treasury policies.
The board governs through clearly mandated board committees,
accompanied by monitoring and reporting systems. Each standing
board committee has specific written terms of reference issued 
by the board and adopted in committee. The terms of reference 
of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees are
available on the company’s website or, on request, from the
Company Secretary. All committee chairmen report orally on 
the proceedings of their committees at the next meeting of the
board, and the minutes of the meetings of all board committees
are included in the papers distributed to board members in
advance of the next board meeting.
4.4 The roles of executive and non-executive directors 
The executive directors are responsible for proposing strategy and
for making and implementing operational decisions. Non-executive
directors complement the skills and experience of the executive
directors, bring an independent judgement and contribute to the
formulation of strategy, policy and decision making through their
knowledge and experience of other businesses and sectors.
4.5 Information and training 
The board and its committees are supplied with full and timely
information, including detailed financial information, to enable
directors to discharge their responsibilities. All directors have
access to the advice of the Company Secretary. Independent
professional advice is also available to directors in appropriate
circumstances, at the company’s expense, and the committees
have been provided with sufficient resources to undertake their
duties. None of the directors has sought independent external
advice through the company. The Company Secretary is
responsible for advising the board, through the Chairman, 
on matters of corporate governance.
Following the appointment of new directors to the board, tailored
induction programmes are arranged which involve industry-specific
training and include visits to the group’s businesses and meetings
with senior management, as appropriate. New directors are briefed
on internal controls at business unit level and are advised of the
legal and other duties they have as directors of a listed company
as well as on relevant company policies and governance-related
matters. The company arranges for major shareholders to have 
the opportunity to meet new appointees. The company is also
committed to the continuing development of directors in order 
that they may build on their expertise and develop an ever more
detailed understanding of the business and the markets in which
group companies operate. Members of board committees are
encouraged to attend internal and external briefings and courses
on aspects of their respective committee specialities and regular
updates on relevant legal, regulatory, corporate governance and
technical developments are presented to committee members
and, as appropriate, to the board.
4.6 Outside appointments 
Non-executive directors may serve on a number of outside 
boards provided that they continue to demonstrate the requisite
commitment to discharge effectively their duties to SABMiller plc.
The nomination committee keeps the extent of directors’ other
interests under review to ensure that the effectiveness of the board
is not compromised. The board is satisfied that the Chairman and
each of the non-executive directors commit sufficient time to the
fulfilment of their duties as Chairman and directors of the 
company, respectively.
The board believes, in principle, in the benefit of executive
directors and members of the executive committee accepting 
non-executive directorships of other companies in order to widen
their experience and knowledge for the benefit of the company.
Accordingly, executive directors and members of the executive
committee are permitted to accept external non-executive board
appointments, subject to the agreement of the board, and are
allowed to retain any fees received from such appointments.
Mr Mackay is a non-executive director of Reckitt Benckiser 
Group plc and is the Senior Independent Director and a member
of the remuneration committee of that company. Fees earned 
by Mr Mackay from this appointment are set out in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on page 56. Later in 2008 Mr Mackay will
join the board of Philip Morris International Inc. The board is satisfied
that these duties will not impinge on Mr Mackay’s commitment
and ability to discharge fully his duties to the company.
4.7 Chairman, Chief Executive and 
Senior Independent Director 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate 
with responsibilities divided between them. This separation 
of responsibilities is formalised in their respective letters of
appointment, approved by the board. There were no significant
changes to the Chairman’s external commitments during the year.
The Chairman is available to consult with shareholders throughout
the year and, in the month prior to the annual general meeting, he
also invites major shareholders to meet with him to deal with any
issues. The board is kept informed of the views of shareholders
through regular updates from the Chairman, the Company
Secretary and the executive directors, as well as through the
inclusion in the board papers of relevant reports and commentaries
of, and exchanges with, shareholders and investor bodies.
The Senior Independent Director is Lord Fellowes. Lord Fellowes 
is chairman of CARAC, and also serves on the audit, remuneration
and nomination committees. He is therefore well placed to
influence the governance of the company and to meet his
responsibilities as Senior Independent Director. Lord Fellowes
serves as an additional contact point for shareholders should 
they feel that their concerns are not being addressed through 
the normal channels. Lord Fellowes is also available to fellow 
non-executive directors, either individually or collectively, to discuss
any matters of concern in a forum that does not include executive
directors or the management of the company. In the year under
review, the Chairman hosted a meeting of the non-executive
directors without the executive directors present. Lord Fellowes
has, in addition, held a meeting of non-executive directors without
the presence of the Chairman at which, among other things, the
performance of the Chairman was discussed.
4.8 Board, committee and director performance evaluation 
A formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the
board and of the audit, remuneration, nomination and corporate
accountability and risk assurance committees is carried out each
year, led by the Chairman, with input from the Senior Independent
Director and in consultation with other directors and the Company
Secretary. The performance of the Chief Executive is reviewed by
the remuneration committee and this review is shared with and Corporategovernance 37
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
considered by the board. The performance of the Chief Financial
Officer is reviewed by the Chief Executive and the remuneration
committee, and reported to the board by the remuneration
committee. Each non-executive director’s performance is evaluated
by the Chairman, in consultation with the Senior Independent
Director, who in turn consults with the executive directors and the
Company Secretary. The Chairman’s performance is evaluated
against the same criteria by the Senior Independent Director, the
non-executive directors and the Company Secretary, taking into
account the views of the executive directors.
In considering the contribution of individual directors for the year
under review, performance was assessed against the company’s
selected criteria of strategy, expertise in their field, governance
factors, commitment, profile, knowledge of the industry and team
contribution, culminating in an overall contribution rating. The
importance of the different roles played by individual directors 
in bringing a balanced overall view to the board was recognised.
For the year under review, the Chairman has assessed that all
directors continue to make an effective contribution to the board. 
In reviewing the performance of the board and its committees, 
the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director were aligned 
in their conclusion that measured against the principal duties
expected of it, the board (including by extension its standing 
and ad hoc sub-committees) continued to operate effectively 
and to meet in full its obligations to support management, to
monitor performance across a wide area, and to maintain its
strategic oversight.
In a meeting of the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director, 
the committee chairmen and the Company Secretary, the results
of the performance and effectiveness evaluations conducted in
respect of the board, each of the directors, the Chairman, the
Senior Independent Director and each of the board’s four standing
committees were reviewed. Regarding the board committees,
each of the committee chairmen expressed their views regarding 
the operation of his committee against its terms of reference and
the performance and effectiveness of that committee. These 
views were discussed in an open and constructive manner with
recommendations arising from the discussions being brought
forward to the board and the respective committees. 
The results of the performance and effectiveness evaluation
process were also reviewed by the Chairman, the Senior
Independent Director, the Chief Executive and the Company
Secretary, all of whom concluded that the board and its
committees were operating effectively.
At the forthcoming annual general meeting, Ms Ramos and 
Mr Pieterse, having been initially appointed by the board of
directors will, pursuant to the company’s articles of association,
stand for election. Three directors, Mr Mackay, Mr Manzoni and 
Mr Ramaphosa are required to seek re-election in accordance 
with the company’s articles of association, having served for three 
years since their last election. As previously mentioned, the
Chairman, Lord Fellowes, Mr Morland and Mr Ramaphosa will 
by the time of the AGM each have served continuously on the
board for nine years and, under the Combined Code, are obliged
to offer themselves for re-election annually.
The Chairman confirms that each of the directors offering
themselves for re-election continues to perform effectively and 
to demonstrate commitment to his role. In addition, the Chairman
confirms that in relation to each of the directors who will have
served for nine years, the board is satisfied with his performance
and has determined that nine years’ service does not compromise
his independence. Lord Fellowes, as senior independent director,
confirms that the Chairman continues to perform effectively and to
demonstrate commitment to his role. Biographical details of
directors standing for election and re-election are included on
pages 42 and 43 of this report.
4.9 Retirement of directors 
New directors are subject to election at the first annual general
meeting following their appointment, and directors are subject 
to retirement and re-election by shareholders every three years.
The reappointment of non-executive directors is not automatic.
The board has determined that non-executive directors who have
served for nine years will be asked to stand for re-election annually,
provided that the board remains satisfied both with the director’s
performance and that nine years’ continuous service does not
compromise the director’s continuing independence.
4.10 The Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the board and 
its committees and he attended all meetings during the year 
under review. 
5. 
The board’s committees and the 
executive committee 
5.1 The executive committee 
The board delegates responsibility for determining and
implementing the group’s strategy and for managing the group 
to the Chief Executive, Mr Graham Mackay, who is supported 
by the executive committee (excom), which he chairs. Excom
members are appointed by Mr Mackay. The other members of
excom are the Chief Financial Officer, Mr Wyman; the divisional
managing directors responsible for managing the group’s regional
hubs (Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia); the Managing
Director of SAB Ltd; the President and Chief Executive Officer 
of Miller Brewing Company; the directors of key group functions
(marketing, corporate affairs, and human resources); and the
General Counsel and Group Company Secretary. Excom’s
purpose is to support the Chief Executive in carrying out the 
duties delegated to him by the board and, in that context, 
excom co-ordinates brand and operational execution, delivers
strategic plans, budgets and financial reports for the board’s
consideration and, through the Chief Executive, reports on 
these matters to the board.
Excom also ensures that effective internal controls are in place 
and functioning, and that there is an effective risk management
process in operation throughout the group.
5.2 The disclosure committee 
The disclosure committee consists of the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, a designated non-
executive director (Lord Fellowes), and the Company Secretary 
or the Deputy Company Secretary. The function of the disclosure
committee, in accordance with the group’s inside information
policy, is to assure compliance with the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules, and to ensure that the
routes of communication between excom members, the disclosure
committee, the in-house legal team, the company secretarial office
and investor relations are clear and provide for rapid escalation to
the disclosure committee and key advisers of any decision
regarding potential inside information, so that the company is able
to comply fully with its continuing obligations under the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules.
5.3 The audit committee 
During the year under review, the audit committee was chaired 
by Mr Manser, who has been chairman of the committee since
May 2002. Mr Manser qualified as a chartered accountant in 1964
and was made a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in 1976. Further biographical information concerning Mr Manser 
is set out on page 43. 
Lord Fellowes, Mr Morland, and Ms Doherty served on the
committee throughout the year. Ms De Lisi served until her
retirement on 30 April 2007 and was replaced by Mr Devitre who
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 38 Corporate governance
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Corporate governance continued
attended his first meeting of the committee on 4 September 2007.
Mr Morland has been a member of the committee from its first
meeting on 13 April 1999. Lord Fellowes was appointed to the
committee on 1 June 2001 and Ms Doherty was appointed on 
1 April 2006. The Chairman has recent and relevant financial
experience, as does Ms Doherty, who is Chief Financial Officer 
of Brambles Limited and was previously Group International
Finance Director of Tesco PLC, and Mr Devitre, having until 
31 March 2008 held the position of Chief Financial Officer of Altria. 
The committee met four times during the year. The external
auditors, the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and 
the Chief Internal Auditor attended each meeting by invitation.
Other members of the management team attended as required.
Under its terms of reference, the committee’s key duties include:
■ to review, and challenge where necessary, the annual financial
statements and interim and preliminary announcements before
their submission to the board for approval;
■ to examine and review the internal control environment 
and risk management systems within the group and review 
the group’s statement on internal control systems prior to
endorsement by the board and to review the independence,
objectivity and effectiveness of the external audit process; 
■ to make recommendations to the board regarding the
appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external
auditors and to approve and recommend to the board 
the remuneration and terms of engagement of the 
external auditors; 
■ to review annually the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function throughout the group, with particular focus on the
charter, annual work plans, activities, staffing, organisational
and reporting structure and status of the function; and
■ to review the effectiveness of the system for monitoring
compliance with laws and regulations (including the 
group’s bi-annual letters of representation) and the results 
of management’s investigation and follow-up (including
disciplinary action) of any instances of non-compliance.
The audit committee reports its activities and makes
recommendations to the board. During the year, the audit
committee discharged its responsibilities as they are defined 
in the committee’s terms of reference, and has been engaged in
ensuring that appropriate standards of governance, reporting and
compliance are being met. The committee has advised the board
on issues relating to the application of accounting standards as
they relate to published financial information. The committee has
also monitored the further progress which has been made during
the year in reviewing and upgrading internal controls in the major
business entities across the group, positioning the group to
achieve substantive compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley standards 
in due course (although the company is not an SEC registrant 
and is not required to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley standards).
The Chief Internal Auditor has direct access to the audit
committee, primarily through its chairman. The audit committee
has access to subsidiary company internal audit leadership. 
The reports of the divisional audit committees are also available 
to the audit committee. 
During the year, the committee met with the external auditors and
with the Chief Internal Auditor without management being present. 
In addition to the review of its performance, terms of reference 
and effectiveness led by the Chairman of the board, the committee
critically reviewed its own performance during the year by 
means of a questionnaire which each member of the committee
completed independently. The committee chairman then reviewed
the responses and conducted one-to-one discussions with
members of the committee where he felt it was necessary. 
The results of the self-assessment and any action plans arising
were then reported to the board.
5.4 The nomination committee 
During the year the nomination committee was chaired by Lord
Renwick. Lord Renwick retired as chairman and as a member of
the nomination committee with effect from 31 March 2008 and
was replaced as chairman by Mr Kahn. Both Lord Renwick and 
Mr Kahn were members of the committee throughout the year, as
were Lord Fellowes, Mr Morland and Mr Manser. During the year
Altria and BevCo exercised their rights under their relationship
agreements to nominate Mr Bible and Mr Santo Domingo Davila,
respectively, as members of the nomination committee with effect
from 14 November 2007. Mr Ramaphosa was appointed to the
committee at the same time. 
The committee is empowered to consider the composition of the
board and its committees. It is asked to consider the retirement,
appointment and replacement of directors, and is required to 
make appropriate recommendations to the board. 
The nomination committee has continued to evaluate the balance
of skills, knowledge and experience of the board. In order to
further strengthen the independence and balance of the board,
and as part of the continuing process of progressive renewal of 
the board, the committee successfully recruited Ms Ramos and 
Mr Pieterse to the board. Appropriate succession plans for the
non-executive directors approaching nine years service, for the
executive directors and for senior management were also kept
under review. 
Where non-executive vacancies arise, the committee may use 
the services of external consultants in order to identify suitable
candidates for the board to consider. Candidates are shortlisted
for consideration by the nomination committee on the basis of 
their relevant corporate or professional skills and experience. 
In accordance with the terms of the relationship agreement with
Altria, the only executive directors appointed to the board are 
the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer.
5.5 The remuneration committee 
The committee consists entirely of independent directors: 
Mr Morland (Chairman), Lord Fellowes, Mr Manzoni and Mr Manser. 
The committee is empowered by the board to set short-term,
medium-term and long-term remuneration for the executive
directors. More generally, the committee is responsible for the
assessment and approval of a broad remuneration strategy for 
the group and for the operation of the company’s share-based
incentive plans. This includes determination of short-term and
long-term incentives for executives across the group. 
During the year the remuneration committee has implemented 
its strategy of ensuring that employees and executives are
rewarded for their contribution to the group’s operating and
financial performance at levels which take account of industry,
market and country benchmarks. To ensure that the executives’
goals are aligned to those of the company, share incentives are
considered to be critical elements of executive incentive pay.
During the year, the committee engaged the services of
consultants, Kepler Associates and Mercer Human Resource
Consulting (Mercer). At levels below the company’s executive
committee, the company’s management consults, among others,
Hay Consulting, Ernst & Young and Towers Perrin, on a project
basis. More details of the company’s remuneration policy can be
found in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 49 to 59. Corporategovernance 39
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
5.6 The corporate accountability and 
risk assurance committee (CARAC) 
Lord Fellowes chaired the committee throughout the year. 
Mr Kahn, Mr Mackay, Mr Manser, Mr Manzoni, Mr Ramaphosa 
and Mr Wyman served as members. Additionally, the Director 
of Corporate Affairs, Ms Clark, met regularly with the chairman 
of CARAC to discuss implementation and planning issues, and
attended all meetings of the committee. 
The objective of CARAC is to assist the board in the discharge of
its responsibilities in relation to corporate accountability, including
sustainable development, corporate social responsibility, corporate
social investment and ethical commercial behaviour. More details
of the committee’s activities can be found in the sustainable
development review section of this report and in the company’s
separate Sustainable Development Report which is available 
on the company’s website and, upon request, in hard copy. 
During the year, the CARAC focused on company-specific and
industry issues which are critical to protecting the company’s
licence to operate.
6. 
Relationship with auditors 
PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed as auditors of the
company on 8 February 1999, subsequently becoming
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) in 2003. 
The company has in place a formal policy on auditor
independence and non-audit services, with which the external
auditors are required to comply, to ensure that the independence
of the auditors is not impaired by the nature of non-audit work. 
The policy stipulates work which is permitted or not permitted 
to be performed by the auditors, and provides for appropriate
approval and oversight processes. As a further safeguard, PwC
confirms in a formal report to the audit committee that processes
to ensure compliance with this policy are in place and that these
processes are monitored regularly. This report includes a
statement that, in its opinion, PwC believes that the nature of 
its non-audit services has not impaired the audit of the company.
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements has a breakdown
of non-audit services provided to the group by the auditors for 
the year under review.
The audit committee is satisfied that, for the period under review,
the independence of the auditors has not been affected by the
provision of non-audit services.
The committee has also implemented a formal system for the
review of the effectiveness of the external auditors. This process
involves the external auditors presenting to the committee their
proposed audit strategy followed by the output of their initial
discussions with management. At the audit committee meeting 
in May, the external auditors present the output of their detailed
year-end work. In making its assessment of external auditor
effectiveness, the committee reviews the audit engagement letters
before signature by management, reviews the external auditors’
summary of group and subsidiary issues and management’s
response to the summary, and conducts an overall review of 
the effectiveness of the external audit process and the external
auditors. This review is facilitated by the use of templates that 
rate effectiveness across 18 critical criteria.
7. 
Relations with shareholders 
During the year the company has continued to promote dialogue
with its major institutional shareholders. All shareholders were
again encouraged to attend the annual general meeting, which
provides shareholders with the opportunity to ask questions 
of the board and chairmen of all the board committees. All
resolutions were put to a poll at the annual general meeting in
2007. Voting at the meeting was conducted electronically, with 
the results being published on the Regulatory News Service and
on the company’s website. 
Alongside the facilities offered by the Company Secretary’s
department, the company maintains a dedicated investor relations
function which reports to the Director of Corporate Affairs. The
investor relations team builds and maintains long-term relationships
with institutional investors and analysts and, in partnership with our
corporate and divisional management teams and within the scope
of regulatory constraints, gives presentations on regional business
outlooks and strives to ensure that these are understood across
the global equity markets in subsequent one-to-one meetings 
with investors. Occasional business site visits are also arranged.
Dialogue on socially responsible investment is handled by 
the Head of Sustainable Development in the corporate affairs
department, who undertakes focused briefings with interested
investors and stakeholders. 
In addition to scheduled management-led programmes in which
executives interact with investors and analysts, the Chairman has,
independently, initiated formal contact with all shareholders (or
their representatives) holding more than 1% of the issued share
capital of the company. The purpose of this contact is to enable
the Chairman to address any queries shareholders may have
regarding the governance of the company or non-operational
aspects of company strategy. It is also, more broadly, designed 
to give the board a greater awareness of shareholder concerns.
Alongside the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director is also
available to discuss issues with shareholders and views expressed
will be communicated by the Chairman to the board. As part 
of this initiative, the Chairman offers to meet with significant
shareholders in the month before the annual general meeting
specifically to deal with issues arising from the annual report 
and notice of the annual general meeting. All non-executive
directors of the company are invited to participate in this process. 
Comment on the annual report is conveyed through the audit 
and remuneration committees and the Company Secretary 
to the board.
8. 
Risk management 
The group’s risk management system is subject to regular review
to ensure full compliance with the requirements of the Combined
Code and the Turnbull Guidance (2005) on internal control and 
risk management and is designed to deliver improved value to 
the operating businesses.
8.1 Risk and the board of directors 
The directors are ultimately responsible for the group’s risk
management system and for reviewing its effectiveness. The risk
management system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate,
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and there is an
ongoing process in place for identifying, assessing, managing,
monitoring and reporting on the significant risks faced by individual
group companies and by the group as a whole. This process has
been in place for the year under review up to and including the
date of approval of the annual report and accounts. The principal
risks and uncertainties facing the group are set out on page 8.
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 40 Corporate governance
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Corporate governance continued
8.2 Executive committee
Excom has specific responsibility as the risk management
committee for the group’s system of risk management. Bi-annually,
excom reviews the group’s significant risks and subsequently
reports to the board on material changes and the associated
mitigating actions.
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance (2005), reviews on the
effectiveness of the risk management system were carried out 
by the risk management committee in April and September 2007 
and in April 2008.
8.3 Enterprise-wide risk management 
Excom views the careful and appropriate management of risk 
as a key management role. Managing business risk to deliver
opportunities is a key element of all our business activities. 
This is undertaken using a practical and flexible framework 
which provides a consistent and sustained approach to risk
evaluation. The business risks, which may be strategic,
operational, financial, environmental or concerning the group’s
reputation, are understood and visible. The business context
determines in each situation the level of acceptable risk and
controls. We continue to seek improvement in the management 
of risk by sharing best practice throughout the organisation.
Key features of the group’s system of risk management are:
■ group statements on strategic direction, ethics and values; 
■ clear business objectives and business principles;
■ an established risk policy; 
■ a continuing process for identification and evaluation of
significant risks to the achievement of business objectives; 
■ management processes in place to mitigate significant risks 
to an acceptable level; 
■ ongoing monitoring of significant risks and internal and 
external environmental factors that may change the group’s 
risk profile; and 
■ a regular review by the group of both the type and amount of
external insurance that it buys, bearing in mind the availability 
of such cover, its cost and the likelihood and magnitude of 
the risks involved.
In addition to excom’s bi-annual reports to the board on key risks,
there is a process of regular reporting to the board through the
audit committee on the status of the risk management process.
Key annual reports include those that identify, rank, monitor and
measure strategic, operational and financial risks in each division
and on a group basis.
9. 
Internal control 
The Turnbull Guidance sets out best practice on internal control 
for UK listed companies to assist them in assessing the application
of the Combined Code’s principles and compliance with the
Combined Code’s provisions with regard to internal control. 
The group’s systems of internal control are designed and operated
to support the identification, evaluation and management of risks
affecting the group and the business environment in which it
operates. As such, they are subject to continuous review as
circumstances change and new risks emerge. The company 
has made significant progress towards achieving substantive
compliance with s404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act through an
Internal Financial Control (IFC) programme. This is a voluntary
initiative, and has led to a further strengthening of internal control
systems and processes within the group.
Key features of the systems of internal control are:
■ the risk management system described in the 
preceding section;
■ written policies and procedures within our businesses, 
which are detailed in policy manuals;
■ clearly defined lines of accountability and delegation 
of authority;
■ identification and regular testing of key financial 
controls through the IFC programme; 
■ key policies employed in managing operating risk involve
segregation of duties, transaction authorisation, monitoring,
financial and managerial and comprehensive reporting and
analysis against approved standards and budgets;
■ group treasury operations which manage exposure to interest
rate, counterparty, liquidity and currency transaction risks 
and co-ordinate the activities of group companies in this 
area. Treasury policies, risk limits and monitoring procedures
are reviewed regularly by the audit committee on behalf 
of the board; 
■ a group tax risk and tax operating framework which forms the
basis of tax governance across the group and is managed by 
a group tax function, which monitors tax risk and implements
strategies and procedures to control it;
■ minimisation of operating risk by using appropriate
infrastructure, controls, systems and people throughout 
the businesses; and 
■ business continuity planning, including preventative and
contingency measures, back-up capabilities and the purchase
of insurance. 
Assurance on compliance with systems of internal control and 
on their effectiveness is obtained through regular management
reviews, review of key financial controls, internal audit reviews 
and quality assurance described in section 10 opposite, testing 
of certain aspects of the internal financial control systems by the
external auditors during the course of their statutory examinations
and regular reports to the audit committee by the external
auditors. The group’s divisional Finance, Control and Assurance
committees consider the results of these reviews, to confirm 
that controls are functioning and to ensure that any material
breakdowns and remedial actions have been reported to the
appropriate boards of directors. This does not apply in respect 
of the group’s associated undertakings or joint ventures.
At the half year and at the year end the divisional managing
directors and finance directors of all the group’s operations, 
and each of the group’s functional directors, are required to 
submit formal letters of representation on controls, compliance 
and notification of continuing or potential material financial and 
legal exposures. 
These letters form the subject of reports to the audit committee.
They cover all subsidiary companies but do not cover associates
(except for Tsogo Sun, which does submit letters of representation)
or joint ventures. Where material, group executives sit on the
boards of associated companies. Directors and members of the
executive committee also make annual written declarations of
interests and are obliged to report without delay any potential 
or actual conflicts of interest which may arise.  Corporategovernance 41
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
The directors are responsible for the group’s systems of internal
control and for reviewing their effectiveness annually. The board
has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the group’s internal
controls covering material financial, operational and compliance
controls and risk management systems for the year under review.
Necessary actions have been, or are being, taken to remedy 
any significant weaknesses identified from the board’s review 
of the internal control system. The systems of internal control 
are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can provide reasonable, but
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
In reviewing these, the board has taken into account the results 
of all the work carried out by internal and external auditors. 
The board, with advice from the audit committee, has completed
its annual review of the effectiveness of the system of internal
control for the period since 1 April 2007 in accordance with the
Turnbull Guidance, and is satisfied that this system is in accordance
with that Guidance and that it has been in place throughout the
year under review and up to the date of this report.
10.
Internal audit 
The global internal audit function consists of local and regional
internal audit functions operating in each of the group’s principal
business units, centrally co-ordinated by the group internal audit
team and led by the Chief Internal Auditor. In keeping with the
group’s decentralised collaborative management structure, 
the local internal audit functions report to local senior finance
management but have direct access to local audit committees,
Group Internal Audit and the Chief Internal Auditor. The local 
and regional audit functions have continuous, unfettered interface
with the group internal audit function, which reports directly 
to the Chief Financial Officer and has direct access to the audit
committee through the Chief Internal Auditor. Internal audit
activities are performed either by teams of appropriate, qualified
and experienced employees, or through the engagement of
external practitioners upon specified and agreed terms with
equivalent access. The Chief Internal Auditor prepares formal
reports for each audit committee meeting as to the consolidated
activities and key findings of the global internal audit function. 
The global internal audit function utilises a standardised 
group-wide internal audit methodology and has implemented 
a formal global quality assurance and effectiveness programme.
Accordingly, detailed quality review assessments are performed
with regard to the local and regional internal audit teams, to ensure
compliance with defined quality and performance measures. This
process provides a basis for the annual review of the effectiveness
of the global internal audit function and results in a formal report
(prepared by the Chief Internal Auditor) to the audit committee 
to support the committee’s formal annual assessment of the
effectiveness of internal audit. In addition, periodic reviews by
independent external consultants are undertaken when deemed
necessary by the audit committee. In February 2008, an external
effectiveness review was performed by Deloitte, reporting positive
results and rating the group’s internal audit function as 
‘high quality’. 
The audit committee has therefore satisfied itself that adequate,
objective internal audit assurance standards and procedures 
exist within the group, and that continuous improvement in the
quality and objectivity of the global internal audit function remains 
a primary objective of the department.
11.
Whistleblowing measures 
All employees in most subsidiaries within the group have the
opportunity to make confidential disclosures about suspected
impropriety and wrongdoing. The Company Secretary or the
Deputy Company Secretary, in consultation with the Chief 
Internal Auditor, decides on the appropriate method and level 
of investigation. The audit committee is notified of all disclosures
made and receives reports on the results of all investigations and
actions taken. The audit committee has the power to request
further information, conduct its own inquiries or order additional
action as it sees fit.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
The directors have pleasure in submitting their report to
shareholders, together with the audited annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Principal activities and business review 
SABMiller plc is a holding company which has brewing and
beverage interests across six continents. The principal subsidiaries
and associates of the company are listed on pages 131 to 133 of
this annual report. The principal activities of the group are the
manufacture, distribution and sale of beverages. 
The company is required by the Companies Act 1985 to produce
a fair review of the business of the group including a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties it faces, its development
and performance during the year and the position of the group 
at the end of the year. The business review, including a review of
the development and performance of the group during the financial
year, its position at the end of the year, likely future developments
in the business of the group, key performance indicators and 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the
group, is set out on pages 4 to 5 and 7 to 29 of this annual 
report. Other key performance indicators and matters relating 
to environmental and employee matters required by the business
review are set out in the sustainable development review on pages

(approximately US$230 million) in 5-year notes. The notes, issued
under a R4,000 million Domestic Medium Term Note Programme,

African Bond Exchange. The net proceeds of the bond issue have
been used to repay part of existing loan facilities that were utilised
by The South African Breweries Ltd.

did not already own in its Panamanian subsidiaries Cervecería

Miller and Coors. The companies signed a definitive agreement 
to form MillerCoors LLC in December 2007. Closing of the

complete in the middle of 2008.

the Colombian Stock Exchange, the company’s effective interest in
Bavaria increased to 98.78% and Bavaria’s shares were delisted.
In November 2007, the company announced that it had 
reached agreement on the terms of a recommended offer for

Directors
The names and biographical details of the current directors are 
set out on pages 42 and 43. With the exception of Mr Devitre 
(who was appointed to the board on 16 May 2007) and 
Ms Ramos and Mr Pieterse (who were appointed to the board 
on 15 May 2008) all directors served throughout the period. 
In addition Ms De Lisi, Altria Group Inc.’s (“Altria”) nominee prior 
to the appointment of Mr Devitre, served as a director of the
company until her retirement on 30 April 2007. Details of the
interests in shares and/or options of the directors who held 
office at the end of the period and any persons connected 
to such directors are set out in the remuneration report on 
pages 49 to 59.
Corporate governance 
The directors are committed to maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance, which they see as fundamental to
discharging their stewardship responsibilities. The board strives 
to provide the right leadership, strategic oversight and control
environment to produce and sustain the delivery of value to all of
the company’s shareholders. The board applies integrity, principles
of good governance and accountability throughout its activities
and each director brings independence of character and judgment
to the role. All of the members of the board are individually and
collectively aware of their responsibilities to the company’s
stakeholders. Statements of our application of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance are set out in the corporate
governance report on pages 34 to 41 and the directors’
remuneration report on pages 49 to 59.
Share capital 
During the year, the issued ordinary share capital of the company
increased from 1,502,187,446 shares of 10 US cents each to
1,505,779,276 shares of 10 US cents each. 3,591,830 new
ordinary shares were issued to satisfy the exercise of options
granted under the SABMiller plc Mirror Executive Share Purchase
Scheme, the SABMiller plc Approved Executive Share Option
Scheme, the SABMiller plc Executive Share Option (No. 2)
Scheme and the SABMiller plc International Employee 
Share Scheme.
In addition, the company has 77,368,338 non-voting convertible
participating shares of 10 US cents each and 50,000 deferred
shares of £1 each in issue. No non-voting convertible participating
shares, convertible participating shares or deferred shares were
issued during the year.
In light of changes in the tax regime in the United Kingdom, 
the board has determined that the company should acquire the
77,368,338 non-voting convertible shares held by Safari Limited, 
a company incorporated in Jersey which is owned by a charitable
trust not connected with the company, and hold those shares as
treasury shares. In order for the shares to be held as treasury
shares, it is necessary that they convert into ordinary shares 
before being acquired by the company. The board is therefore
seeking shareholder approval of an amendment to the articles of
association and a contingent purchase contract in relation to this
transaction at the company’s forthcoming annual general meeting.
Purchase of own shares 
At the last annual general meeting, shareholder authority was
obtained for the company to purchase its own shares up to a
maximum of 10% of the number of ordinary shares in issue on 
16 May 2007. This authority is due to expire at the earlier of the
next annual general meeting or 31 October 2008, and remains
exercisable provided that certain conditions (relating to the
purchase) are met. 
The notice of annual general meeting proposes that shareholders
approve a resolution updating and renewing the authority allowing
the company to purchase its own shares. 
Shares in the company were purchased during the year by 
the trustee of the company’s employee benefit trust, details of
which are provided in the directors’ remuneration report. The
company did not repurchase any of its shares during the year 
for the purpose of cancellation, holding in treasury or for any 
other purpose. Directors’report 47
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
As noted above the board has determined that, subject 
to shareholder approval, the company should acquire the
77,368,338 non-voting convertible shares, following their
conversion into ordinary shares, and hold those shares as 
treasury shares.
Annual general meeting 
The company’s annual general meeting for 2008 will be held at the
InterContinental London Park Lane, One Hamilton Place, London,
W1V 7QY, UK at 11:00 am on Thursday 31 July 2008. Notice of
this meeting may be obtained from the company’s website.
Donations
During the year the group invested US$30 million in corporate
social investment programmes, of which US$10,855,000
represented charitable donations. Of this amount US$99,410 were
charitable donations made by the company and Miller Brands 
(UK) Limited for the benefit of various causes, both in the UK 
and overseas, comprising donations in respect of community
development, health and education, the environment and 
other causes. 
It remains the group’s policy that political donations are only 
made by exception, and where permitted by local laws, and 
must be consistent with building multi-party democracy.
Miller Brewing Company made contributions to individual
candidates for political office and to party committees in the 
USA, where permitted by applicable campaign finance laws.
Political donations in the USA are an accepted part of the local
socio-political environment. These contributions amounted to 
US$603,940 in aggregate.
The board has reaffirmed the group’s policy not to make 
donations to political organisations in the European Union.
Employment policies 
The aim of the group is to be the employer of choice in each
country in which it operates. In order to achieve this, each
operating company designs employment policies which attract,
retain and motivate the highest quality of staff. 
The group is committed to an active equal opportunities policy
from recruitment and selection, through training and development,
appraisal and promotion to retirement. Within the constraints of
local law, it is our policy to ensure that everyone is treated equally,
regardless of gender, colour, national origin, race, disability, marital
status, sexual orientation, religion or trade union affiliation.
Research and development 
The group continues to invest in research and development
leading to new products, packages and processes, as well as 
new manufacturing technologies to improve overall operational
effectiveness. The group’s upstream scientific research continues
to yield solid progress in brewing, raw materials, flavour stability,
packaging materials and environmental performances. During the
year under review, the aggregate amount spent by the group on
research and development was US$9 million (2007: US$6 million).
Payment of suppliers 
The group’s policy is to pay invoices in accordance with the terms
of payment agreed in advance. At the year end, the amount owed
by the group to trade creditors was equivalent to 56.7 days (2007:
60.9 days) of purchases from suppliers.
Overseas branches 
The company does not have any branches registered overseas.
Going concern and audit 
Page 60 details the directors’ responsibilities for preparing the
consolidated financial statements. As set out in that statement 
the directors are satisfied that SABMiller plc is a going concern. 
So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the group’s auditors are unaware, and each
director has taken all the steps necessary that he or she ought to
have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware
of the relevant audit information and to establish that the group’s
auditors are aware of that information. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have expressed their willingness 
to continue in office as auditors and resolutions proposing their re-
appointment and authorising the board to set their remuneration
will be submitted to the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Directors’ indemnities 
The company has granted rolling indemnities to the directors,
uncapped in amount, in relation to certain losses and liabilities
which they may incur in the course of acting as directors of the
company or of one or more of its subsidiaries. The Company
Secretary and Deputy Company Secretary have also been granted
indemnities, on similar terms, covering their roles as Company
Secretary and Deputy Company Secretary respectively of the
company and as directors or as company secretary of one or 
more of the company’s subsidiaries. The board believes that it is 
in the best interests of the group to attract and retain the services
of the most able and experienced directors and officers by offering
competitive terms of engagement, including the granting of 
such indemnities. 
The indemnities are categorised as qualifying third-party
indemnities for the purposes of the Companies Act and will
continue in force for the benefit of directors and officers for as long
as they remain in their positions.
Substantial shareholdings 
Details of notifications received by the company in accordance
with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules as at 14 May 2008
and of persons with significant direct or indirect holdings known to
the company at year end are set out in the ordinary shareholding
analyses on page 149 of this annual report. 
Financial instruments 
Information on the financial risk management objectives and
policies of the group and details of the group’s exposure to price
risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk are contained in
Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Other Companies Act disclosures
Following the implementation of the Takeovers Directive into UK
law, the directors’ report is required to disclose certain additional
information, irrespective of whether the company is involved in a
takeover situation. 
The structure of the company’s share capital, including the rights
and obligations attaching to each class of share and the percentage
of the share capital that each class of share comprises, is set out
in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements. There are no
securities of the company that grant the holder special control rights.
At year end the company’s employee benefit trust held 
4,644,176 ordinary shares in the company. By agreement with 
the company, the trustees do not exercise the voting rights
attached to these shares.

Directors’ report continued
The directors are responsible for the management of the 
business of the company and may exercise all the powers of 
the company subject to the company’s memorandum and articles
of association and relevant statutes. Powers of the directors
relating to the issuing and buying back of shares are set out in 
the articles of association. Such powers are subject to renewal 
by the shareholders of the company each year at the annual
general meeting. 
The company’s articles of association give the board of 
directors power to appoint directors. The articles of association
may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The
appointment of directors by the board is subject to re-appointment
by the shareholders at the next annual general meeting of the
company. Additionally, as disclosed in the corporate governance
report on pages 34 to 41, Altria and BevCo have power under their
respective relationship agreements with the company to nominate
directors for appointment to the board and certain committees.
These relationship agreements also regulate processes applicable in
relation to the acquisition or disposal of shares by Altria and BevCo. 
The company’s articles of association allow directors, in their
absolute discretion, to refuse to register the transfer of a share 
in certificated form which is not fully paid or the transfer of a share
in certificated form on which the company has a lien. If that share
has been admitted to Official List, the board may not refuse to
register the transfer if this would prevent dealings in the company’s
shares from taking place on an open and proper basis. They may
also refuse to register a transfer of a share in certificated form
unless the instrument of transfer is lodged, duly stamped (if
stampable), at the address at which the register of the company 
is held or at such other place as the directors may appoint, and
(except in the case of a transfer by a financial institution where 
a certificate has not been issued in respect of the share) is
accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it relates 
and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require
to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer, is in
respect of only one class of share and is in favour of not more 
than four transferees jointly.
Transfers of shares in uncertificated form must be made in
accordance with and subject to the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations (the ‘Regulations’), the facilities and requirements of
the relevant CREST system and such arrangements as the board
may determine in relation to the transfer of certicated shares
(subject to the Regulations).
Transfers of shares listed on the JSE Limited (‘JSE’) in
uncertificated form must be made in accordance with, and subject
to, the Securities Services Act 2004, the Rules and Directives of
the JSE and STRATE Ltd. Certificated shares may be transferred
prior to dematerialisation, but share certificates must be
dematerialised prior to trading in the STRATE environment.
In addition, subject to the Regulations, and each Act and statutory
instrument concerning and affecting companies for the time being
in force, and in exceptional circumstances approved by the FSA,
the board may refuse to register a transfer of a share (including a
fully paid share) if the refusal does not disturb the market in the
company’s shares.
Pursuant to the company’s code for securities transactions,
directors require, and employees may in certain circumstances
require, approval to deal in the company’s shares.
No shareholder shall, unless the directors otherwise determine, 
be entitled in respect of any share held by him/her to vote 
either personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to
shareholders’ meetings if any call or other sum presently payable
by him/her to the company in respect of that share remains
unpaid. In addition, no shareholder shall be entitled to vote if
he/she has been served with a notice after failing to provide the
company with information concerning interests in those shares
required to be provided under the Companies Acts. Restrictions
on the rights of the holders of convertible shares, non-voting
convertible shares and deferred shares are set out in Note 25.
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, or in relation to
corporate members by a corporate representative. The deadline
for delivering proxy forms is 48 hours before the time for holding
the meeting.
The company is also required to disclose any significant
agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change
of control following a takeover bid. The company has a number 
of facility agreements with banks which contain provisions giving
rights to the banks upon a change of control of the company. 
A change of control of the company would also give The Coca-
Cola Company certain rights under its bottling agreements 
with various subsidiaries of the company. Similarly, in certain
circumstances a change of control may give the company’s joint
venture partner, China Resources Enterprise, Limited the ability 
to exercise certain rights under a shareholder agreement in 
relation to the company’s associate CR Snow.
The company does not have any agreements with any director 
or officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or
employment resulting from a takeover.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Introduction 
This report and the recommendations of the remuneration
committee have been approved by the board and will be
submitted to shareholders for approval at the 2008 annual general
meeting.
Other than as is specifically indicated in this report, the committee
intends to apply the same policies to each component of executive
director remuneration in the future as in the year under review. 
This report complies with the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002, and, except where noted below, the company
applied throughout the reporting year the provisions of the 2006
Combined Code relating to remuneration. 
Information not subject to audit
Composition and terms of reference of the remuneration
committee
During the year ended 31 March 2008, the members of the
committee were Mr Morland (Chairman), Lord Fellowes, Mr
Manser and Mr Manzoni. Lord Renwick of Clifton, Mr Bible, 
Mr Santo Domingo and Mr Kahn joined meetings as observers.
Also present were the Chief Executive, Mr Mackay; the General
Counsel and Company Secretary, Mr Davidson; the Deputy
Company Secretary, Mr Shapiro; and the Group Head of
Compensation and Benefits, Mr Scoones, other than when 
their own remuneration was discussed. 
The committee deals with the remuneration of the executive
directors and other members of the executive committee, as well
as approving all grants and awards under the company’s share
incentive plans, in accordance with terms of reference approved
by the board. Consideration is also given to the company’s group-
wide compensation and incentive policies to ensure alignment. 
Advisers 
In the course of its deliberations, the committee considered the
views of the Chief Executive on the remuneration and performance
of the members of the executive committee. The Company
Secretary and the Group Head of Compensation and Benefits also
provided information to the committee on the co-ordination of
global pay policies, expatriate and local pay for international
deployments, and equity usage through share incentive plans. 
Kepler Associates and Mercer Human Resource Consulting have
been appointed by the committee to provide advice on market
information and other remuneration matters. Kepler Associates
does not provide any other advice or services to the group. Mercer
also provides advice to the company on pensions and risk matters. 
Remuneration policies 
In terms of the group’s remuneration philosophy, the committee
remains of the view that the overall effect of the revisions which
were made to the group’s long-term incentive plans in 2006, 
taking account of the share option and performance share target
numbers at current values, has been to target executive directors’
total compensation – excluding pensions – at or near the
comparative upper quartile, if and only if upper quartile
performance is delivered. In its review of the incentive plans, 
the Committee has placed shareholder interest and shareholder
alignment at the forefront, alongside the need to reaffirm that
senior executives, within the bounds of appropriate governance
limitations, will have confidence that the incentive plans will deliver
superior reward for superior performance, and little or no incentive
reward for average or under-performance. Any review of the level
of incentive performance will be guided by this philosophy.
The committee’s policy is to ensure that executive directors 
and members of the executive committee are rewarded for their
contribution to the group’s operating and financial performance 
at levels which take account of industry, market and country
benchmarks, and that their remuneration is appropriate to their
scale of responsibility and performance, and will attract, motivate
and retain individuals of the necessary calibre. The committee
takes account of the need to be competitive in the different parts
of the world in which the company operates. 
The committee has implemented its policy of agreeing a
remuneration package for each executive director comprising an
annual base salary, an annual cash bonus, long-term incentives
through participation in share option and share award plans,
pension contributions, other security and health benefits, and
benefits in kind. The base salaries, pensions and other benefits
provided are intended to establish a level of fixed pay which is
competitive with appropriate comparators. The variable pay
elements provided by short-term and long-term incentives form a
significant proportion of executive directors’ pay and are intended
to provide the opportunity for executives to earn superior total pay
for superior company and individual performance. The table and
charts below show the ratios of performance-related compensation
to base salary and benefits of the executive directors, and the
relative value of the different elements, including the target bonus
and fair value of the long-term share-based compensation
awarded in the year under review. The ratios accord with the
committee’s policy on the balance between fixed and variable pay.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Remuneration report continued
Share incentives are considered to be critical elements of
executive remuneration policy, to align the interests of the
executive directors and executive committee members with 
the interests of shareholders. The committee considers that 
all elements of the package are of importance in supporting 
the group’s remuneration policy. 
In setting target remuneration levels for the executive directors 
the committee has regard to the 30 FTSE companies ranked 
in the 15 places above and below SABMiller plc in terms of market
capitalisation. The committee also continued to have regard to 
pay levels and practices in the company’s principal international
competitors and in companies in the USA and South Africa
comparable to its divisions in those countries. 
As previously reported, in 2006 the committee revised the
structure of pay arrangements for the executive directors and
members of the executive committee, including grant levels,
performance criteria and vesting schedules. The committee
removed the limited retesting provision of the performance
condition for vesting of options granted under the company’s
Approved and No. 2 Schemes (as defined on page 51) for all
future awards under these plans. The committee also discontinued
the previous practice of awarding matching shares under the
Performance Share Scheme (whereby executives who retained
ownership of shares awarded to them after the initial three-year
performance period, and who remained in employment with the
group for a further two-year period, became eligible to receive an
additional 50% of the initial number of shares vesting) and decided
instead that the additional 50% would be incorporated into the
initial award and a separate performance condition applied to this
portion of the award over a five-year period. These changes were
applied to the options granted and awards made in May 2006 
and in subsequent years.
The committee also considered in 2006 the need to ensure an
appropriate balance of performance measures in the group’s 
long-term incentives. The committee decided that vesting for 
50% of future awards of performance shares would be subject to
SABMiller’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition,
and 50% would be subject to three-year adjusted earnings per
share (EPS) growth, with targets set according to the committee’s
judgement after considering, among other factors, historical and
forecast adjusted EPS growth for SABMiller’s peers (listed on page
52). For the three-year period ending 2010, the committee set 
last year an EPS growth target of 11% p.a. for full vesting with
threshold vesting of 25% at 6% p.a., measured in US dollars. 
For regional managing directors the profit element was based 
on regional, segmental EBITA targets over the three-year fiscal
cycle for their respective regions. For the three-year period ending
2011, the committee has set an EPS growth target of 10% p.a. 
for full vesting with threshold vesting of 25% at 6% p.a., measured
in US dollars. However, for this and for future three-year periods,
the committee has decided to discontinue the practice of setting
regional segmental EBITA targets for regional managing directors,
and instead to apply the group EPS growth targets for their
awards, on the same basis as for the executive directors. 
After two years’ experience, the committee has concluded that 
as a practical matter, the use of regional EBITA goals raises difficult
issues of equity among the regions, and that there are structural
biases (most significantly, foreign exchange) built into the regional
system which discriminate against some regions more than others,
and which can detract significantly from the line-of-sight value of
regional goals. 
The committee reviewed last year the way in which the TSR
performance condition should operate in the case of TSR
performance above the median of the peer group. It determined
that for the three-year period ending 2010 and for future periods,
the maximum number of shares should be earned if the company’s
TSR for the period exceeds the median by 25% with respect to 
the three-year vesting test and by 33% with respect to the five-
year vesting test. Of the maximum number of shares, 25% will
continue to be earned for TSR performance at the median of the
peer group. Intermediate outcomes will result in a pro rata number
of shares earned. 
The committee decided in 2006 to discontinue the approach of
adopting a fixed ratio for maximum awards to salary and changed
to a fixed ‘number of shares’ approach to long-term incentive
awards, in order to decouple salary from long-term incentive
values and to avoid the perverse effect of the typical multiple 
of salary approach, which automatically awards more shares 
when the share prices declines and fewer shares when the price
increases. This fixed number of shares approach also avoids
potentially inappropriate changes in the size of awards simply as 
a result of share price volatility in times of market turbulence which
is unrelated to company performance. The ‘number of shares’
approach also facilitates a more equitable distribution of share
awards among executives below board level across the various
jurisdictions in which the group operates. As to the future, the
committee’s expressed intention is that reviews of the appropriate
level of long-term incentives are expected to be conducted at
approximately three yearly intervals, and in the absence of wholly
exceptional circumstances, the 2006 level of long-term incentive
should remain unchanged until the next review. The long-term
incentive awards in 2007 and 2008 have accordingly been made
at the same level as in 2006, and will be subject to more detailed
review in 2009 in accordance with this philosophy.
Base pay 
The committee reviews the salaries of executive directors at the
beginning of each financial year. Details of the salaries applying
from 1 April 2008 and the percentage changes from 31 March 2008
levels for the executive directors are shown in the table below:
2008 2009 % change

MI Wyman 615,000 660,000 7.3
The committee received advice from consultants and the Chief
Executive on appropriate pay levels for the other members of the
company’s executive committee: 
■ for those executives based in the UK, salaries were 
determined by reference to appropriate UK benchmarks; 
■ for those executives, other than those resident in the USA,
whose primary responsibilities were for operations of business
units outside the UK, part of base pay was related to
appropriate benchmarks in their theatres of operation and 
the balance to UK pay levels; 
■ in the case of the executives responsible for the South African,
European and Africa/Asia operations respectively, salary was
determined on the assessment that 30% of their time was
spent on SABMiller plc duties and therefore related to the UK
and global markets, while 70% was spent on duties for their
businesses in their regions; and 
■ US salary levels have been determined by reference to the
relevant US market comparators. Remuneration report 51
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Annual incentive plans 
Each of the executive directors and members of the executive
committee is entitled to participate in an annual bonus plan that
rewards the achievement of group financial, divisional financial
(where applicable), strategic and personal performance objectives
agreed by the committee. The Chief Executive may earn a bonus
of up to 175% of base salary. The Chief Financial Officer may earn
a bonus of up to 120% of base salary and other executive
committee members may earn bonuses of up to 120% of their
base salary in the UK and 150% in the USA and South Africa. 
The group financial performance targets for executive director
annual incentive plans relate to adjusted EPS growth and EBITA.
The committee believes that linking short-term incentives to profit
growth reinforces the company’s business objectives. The divisional
financial targets vary according to divisional value drivers derived
from group needs and include EBITA, sales volumes, and other
appropriate measurements. Financial performance targets comprise
60% of the incentive bonus potential. The strategic and personal
targets which make up the remaining 40% are specific and
measurable, and include a range of specific non-financial key
performance indicators in appropriate circumstances. In setting
individual strategic and personal targets, the committee has
discretion to take into account all factors that it considers
appropriate, including environmental, social and governance
issues, while ensuring that the incentive structure for executive
directors does not raise the risks relating to environmental, social
and governance issues by inadvertently motivating irresponsible
behaviour. 
At its meeting on 13 May 2008, the committee received
assessments of the performance of the executives participating 
in the bonus plans against their agreed targets. In light of the
achievement against the group financial targets and the levels 
of achievement against their strategic and personal objectives, 
the committee agreed the payments of bonuses as shown below
to the executive directors:

Long-term incentive plans 
The descriptions of the long-term incentive plans in the section
below have been audited. 
Share Option Plans
At the time of its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange in
1999, the company established and has since operated: 
■ the SABMiller plc Approved Share Option Scheme (Approved
Scheme) approved by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in
the United Kingdom; 
■ the SABMiller plc Executive Share Option (No. 2) Scheme 
(No. 2 Scheme); and
■ the SABMiller plc Mirror Executive Share Purchase Scheme
(South Africa) (Mirror Scheme). 
On the acquisition of Miller in 2002, shareholders approved the
establishment of share incentive arrangements for international
employees of the group, principally in the Americas. These
arrangements comprised: 
■ the SABMiller plc International Employee Share Scheme
(International Scheme); and
■ the SABMiller plc International Employee Stock Appreciation
Rights Scheme (SARs Scheme). 
All grants of options or rights over shares under these plans have
to be at the market value of the company’s shares at the time 
of grant. These are issued, usually annually, to participating
employees on the basis of assessment of performance and
potential and vest over defined time periods in line with local
market conditions. 
The tables on page 57 to 59 give details of the grants made to 
the executive directors in 2007, those exercised during the year
and those still outstanding and unexercised from previous years. 
In the year under review, options over 230,000 shares were
granted to the Chief Executive and options over 140,000 shares 
to the Chief Financial Officer (with other executive committee
members employed in the UK being granted options over 
215,000 shares in the aggregate, depending on their roles and
responsibilities). For these annual grants, vesting is based on a
sliding scale performance condition, subject to testing at the third
anniversary of grant from a fixed base, for 67% of the award and 
a further test at the fifth anniversary of grant from a fixed base, 
for the remaining 33% of the award.
Options granted to executives under the Approved and the 
No. 2 Schemes may normally only be exercised between three
and 10 years after grant. The right to exercise is dependent on 
the achievement of adjusted EPS growth targets, calculated on 
the basis of the definition of Headline Earnings in the new South
African Circular 8/2007, chosen because of their ready visibility
both to executives and to shareholders. The adjusted EPS
performance conditions for options granted under these schemes
have been as follows:
■ options granted prior to 2002 to each executive director 
had a performance condition for vesting which required 
growth in adjusted EPS (expressed in sterling) of 3% per
annum compound in excess of the change in the Retail 
Price Index (RPI) over any three-year period within the 
10-year option life. This performance condition was satisfied 
in respect of all options granted to executive directors in 1999,
2000 and 2001;
■ options granted to executive directors in 2002 and until 2005
have a performance condition that the base annual award
(determined by reference to the previous grant levels of 130%
of annual salary for the Chief Executive, 115% of annual salary
for other executive directors and up to 100% for other
participants) would vest at compound annualised adjusted
EPS growth of RPI + 3% subject to testing at three, four 
and five-year intervals from a fixed base. Half of any additional
annual amount would vest at RPI + 4%; and the other half 
of any additional annual amount would vest at RPI + 5%
compound adjusted EPS growth, measured from a fixed base
and only capable of testing after three, four or five years. After
the five-year test any unvested portion of the option will lapse.
Details of the EPS levels of achievement by comparison with
the RPI movement over the respective periods are given in the
notes to the share option scheme tables on page 57; and
■ options granted in 2006 and onwards to each executive
director have the same performance conditions as for awards
made from 2002 to 2005, but the retesting provision has been
removed and the performance tests are applied to two-thirds
of the award after three years and one-third of the award after
five years.

Following the announcement of the results for the financial year,
Mercer undertook for the committee an assessment of whether
the performance condition applying to the vesting of any option
had been met. This assessment was reviewed by the company’s
auditors. 
Performance Share Award Plans
The company operates the following Performance Share Award
Schemes: 
■ the SABMiller plc Performance Share Award Scheme
(Performance Share Scheme); and
■ the SABMiller plc International Performance Share Award 
Sub-Scheme(s) (Performance Sub-Scheme(s)). 
The Performance Share Scheme is used for awards to the
executive directors, and is operated in conjunction with the
company’s Employees’ Benefit Trust (EBT). The trustee of the EBT
grants awards in consultation with the company. Awards made
under the plan prior to 2006 are subject solely to TSR performance
conditions applied after three years from date of grant, with a
provision that if vested awards are retained for a further two years
they will automatically be increased by an allocation of 50% of the
number of shares in the original award that vested. 
Relative TSR was chosen as the performance measure because it
allows for performance to be measured relative to other companies
and reflects the benefit to shareholders of management effort. 
For the purpose of calculating TSR the share prices and dividends
of the comparator companies are converted, as necessary, into
sterling at the exchange rates prevailing at the relevant times. The
conversion into sterling is intended to remove distortions arising
from differing rates of inflation in the countries in which the
comparator companies are listed. TSR and the relevant statistical
quartiles are determined in accordance with current market practice.
In 2006, the committee determined that 50% of awards under this
plan should be subject to a TSR performance condition and 50%
to an adjusted EPS growth performance condition. For 50% of the
awards made under this plan in 2006, vesting occurs only if three-
year TSR (change in value of a share and reinvested dividends
over the period), exceeds the median TSR of a comparator group
of companies identified at the time of award. On reaching the
median performance of the relevant comparator group, 25% of the
award vests and on reaching at least the upper quartile, 100% of
the award vests. Between these levels of achievement awards vest
pro rata. The TSR test is applied to two-thirds of this part of the
award after three years and to one-third of this part of the award
after five years.
The remaining 50% of the award granted is subject to three-year
adjusted EPS growth, with targets set by reference to historical
and forecast adjusted EPS growth for the six members of the
comparator group determined by the committee to be the
company’s closest peers in the global brewing industry, namely
Anheuser-Busch, Carlsberg, Heineken, Inbev, MolsonCoors and
Scottish & Newcastle (although Scottish & Newcastle has been
dropped from this group for the purposes of awards made in
2008). For awards made in the year under review the committee
set an EPS growth target of 11% p.a. for full vesting, with threshold
vesting of 25% at 6% p.a., and pro rata vesting between these
levels of achievement. For regional managing directors the profit
element is based on regional, segmental EBITA targets over the
three-year fiscal cycle for their respective regions awarded under
the Performance Sub-Scheme. As noted above, for 2008 and
future years, the committee has decided to discontinue the
practice of setting regional segmental EBITA targets for regional 
managing directors, and instead to apply the group EPS 
growth targets for their awards, on the same basis as for the
executive directors.
In the year under review, awards of 230,000 shares were made 
to the Chief Executive and 140,000 shares to the Chief Financial
Officer (with awards of 820,000 shares being made to other
executive committee members in the aggregate, depending on
their roles and responsibilities). The table on page 58 gives details
of the awards made to executive directors in 2007; those still
outstanding for 2006; and those made in 2004 and 2005 which
vested in 2007 and 2008. Details of the relative TSR performance
achieved for vesting of the 2004 and 2005 awards are given in the
notes to the table.
The companies comprising the two TSR comparator groups for 
all the performance share awards under the Performance Share
Scheme which had vested during 2007 or had not yet vested or
lapsed at 31 March 2008 are listed below.

8 January 2007. Ambev merged into Interbrew which changed its name to
Inbev on 29 March 2005 and has been removed from future measurement
from that date. Coors and Molson merged on 9 February 2005 and have
been replaced for future measurement by MolsonCoors Brewing Company.
Bavaria was consolidated into SABMiller plc with effect from 12 October
2005 and has been removed from the comparator group for the 2004
awards. Quinsa was consolidated into Ambev with effect from 9 August
2006 and has been removed from the comparator group for the 2004
awards. Grolsch was consolidated into SABMiller with effect from
12 February 2008 and has been removed from both comparator groups.
Scottish & Newcastle has been removed from both comparator groups
with effect from April 2008. Remuneration report 53
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
During the year Mercer undertook the assessment of the
company’s TSR performance relative to the comparator groups.
The methodology used and the final results for each award are
subject to review by the company’s auditors.
At its meeting in May 2004 the committee approved the
establishment of the Performance Sub-Scheme, within the
provisions of the Performance Share Scheme, to replace a cash
long-term incentive plan previously applicable to senior executives
at Miller. The plan is also operated in conjunction with the
company’s EBT. 
The trustee of the EBT grants awards in consultation with the
company. Annual awards made under the Performance Sub-
Scheme are subject to financial performance conditions and will
normally vest after three years. In order to deal with the transition
from the old Miller LTIP , which had end-to-end three-year cycles,
the first awards made under the new plan comprised both two-
year and three-year cycles, with both sets of awards being 
subject to a performance condition requiring Miller EBITA 
to reach specified levels over two and three years. 
In 2006, the committee extended the provisions of this plan to 
the South American business, with a first two-year and three-year
cycle beginning on 1 April 2006. This has also been extended 
to other regional hub businesses with a three-year fiscal cycle 
only. The performance condition specified is that their respective
regional EBITA reach a specified level over three years or two 
years, as the case may be. 
Dilution 
Taking account of all share options granted over the nine years 
to 31 March 2008 under all the company’s share option schemes
since listing on 8 March 1999, less lapses, potential dilution
amounts to 2.62% of the issued ordinary shares of the company
on 31 March 2008. Obligations under the company’s other 
long-term incentive schemes are settled by the EBT from shares
purchased in the market. The calculation excludes outstanding
options granted under the closed SAB Executive Share Purchase
Scheme prior to listing, as was disclosed in the original listing
particulars. At 31 March 2008 the number of shares held in the
EBT was 4,644,176, representing 0.31% of issued ordinary shares
of the company. 
During the year 1,411,702 ordinary shares were purchased by 
the trustee on behalf of the EBT (at an average price of £11.68 per
share) which amounted to 0.09% of the issued ordinary shares 
of the company, in order to ensure that the EBT continued to hold
sufficient ordinary shares to meet potential future obligations in
respect of performance shares conditionally awarded under the
Performance Share Award Schemes. The total consideration paid
amounted to £16,491,853.32.
Pensions 
It is the company’s policy to provide money purchase occupational
retirement funding schemes wherever possible so as to minimise
the company’s funding risk. Where feasible, the company applies
this policy to its new acquisitions. 
The rate of contribution from the company as a percentage of
salaries paid in sterling is set at 30% for the executive directors.
During the year the company made contributions for the executive
directors to the SABMiller plc Staff Pension Scheme, an Approved
Occupational Pension Scheme. Contributions were paid in respect
of each executive director to the extent appropriate in light of the
changes to government pension allowances that took effect in
2006, with any excess credited in an unfunded corporate plan.
The value of contributions made to each executive director during
the financial year is included in a note to the table of directors’
emoluments on page 56.
Service contracts 
Mr Mackay and Mr Wyman have service contracts with the
company which are terminable on not less than 12 months’ notice
to be given by the company or by the executive. A payment in lieu
of notice may be made on termination of employment, calculated
by reference to the executive’s base salary plus company pension
contributions for the relevant period, less any deduction
considered by the company to be appropriate and reasonable to
take account of accelerated receipt and the executive’s duty to
mitigate his loss.

Mr Bible, Ms De Lisi and Mr Devitre have waived their fees. Ms De Lisi resigned from the board on 30 April 2007, and Mr DS Devitre was appointed to the
board in her place on 16 May 2007.
Ms Ramos and Mr Pieterse were appointed to the board on 15 May 2008. 
The total emoluments reported for 2007 and 2008 exclude retirement contributions made by the company to the pension schemes as detailed above. 
Retirement contributions were paid on behalf of Mr Mackay and Mr Wyman in the amounts of £225,000 and £184,500 respectively being within the 
annual allowance (2007: £215,000 and £172,500), and contributions of £81,000 in excess of the annual allowance were paid on behalf of Mr Mackay 
(2007: £70,000).
During the year the group’s apartment in London was made available to Mr Mackay to occupy intermittently, subject to tax on this use for his account. 
Mr Mackay receives from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc an annual fee of £70,000 which he is permitted to retain, relating to his appointment as a non-
executive director of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. A proportion of this fee is applied to the purchase of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc ordinary shares.
* Included in benefits is a long-term service cash bonus for Mr Mackay in recognition of 30 years’ service, in accordance with SABMiller long-term service
group policy. The other items included within benefits are given on page 53.
Share incentive plans 
The interests of the executive directors in shares of the company provided in the form of options and awards since listing on 8 March 
1999 are shown in the tables below, which have been audited. During the year to 31 March 2008 the highest and lowest market prices 
for the company’s shares were £14.92 and £9.95 respectively and the market price on 31 March 2008 was £11.04. 
The tables below contain the aggregate expected values of each option grant or performance share award. The expected values of 
grants and awards made prior to November 2002 are the values previously disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Reports up to 
2003 and were calculated by Mercer. The expected values for the grants and awards made from 2003 to 2007 have been calculated 
by Mercer using: 
■ a binomial valuation model for the options that uses daily share price data and takes account of the option grant date, exercise price
and risk-free rate of return, with assumptions as to dividend yield, future volatility and forfeiture; and 
■ a Monte Carlo simulation model for the performance share awards using the same inputs and assumptions as for the binomial model,
but which projects, many thousands of times, the share price of the company along with the share prices of the comparator group
stocks to determine correlations between the companies. This produces a distribution of share prices and TSR rankings thus allowing
complex market-based hurdles to be modelled. 
The methods of calculation of expected values have not been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . Remuneration report 57

The expected values as shown are aggregates of the Black-Scholes values of each option grant up to 31 May 2002. The Black-Scholes values have 
been calculated using a model that uses daily share price and data and takes account of the option grant date, exercise price and time to maturity, with
assumptions as to dividend yield and the risk-free rate of return. Options granted from 23 May 2003 onwards are valued using the binomial method.
* The share options indicated were eligible to be tested against the performance condition described in this report for the three years ended 31 March
2008.The performance hurdle having been exceeded, these share options are eligible to be exercised as at 20 May 2008.
** The mid-market close on 21 May 2007 was £11.80. 
Note: Mr Mackay and Mr Wyman were granted 230,000 and 140,000 share options respectively at a subscription price of £12.50 per share on 16 May 2008.
In the year under review, options granted under the Approved and No. 2 Schemes in 2004 vested and became exercisable as the
company’s adjusted EPS for the year to 31 March 2007, at 63.4 pence (converted from US$ at the average exchange rate over the period
1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007) was more than 26.5% higher (the aggregate of RPI movement and 5% per annum compound growth) than
the adjusted EPS of 45.8 pence for the year ended 31 March 2004 (the base year calculation of the performance condition) converted
from US$ at the average exchange rate for the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004.

arising from the 11 November 1998 tranche. The price obtained was R171.00 per share.
The executive directors are not eligible to receive further awards under this scheme. The characteristics for this scheme are such that 
gains on exercise of options were recognised in prior years in respect of all the share rights reflected in the table. 
From 3 June 2000, the SAB Executive Share Purchase Scheme was closed for purposes of new awards, and replaced by the Mirror
Scheme for the purposes of new awards to employees of South African employers in the group and certain categories of other employees
of South African origin elsewhere in the group (other than SABMiller plc directors), principally in Africa. These are issued annually to
employees on the basis of assessment of performance and potential. The unconditional vesting period was reduced from a five-year 
period to a three-year period for the May 2006 and future grants, in line with local market practice.

Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 60 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
on the consolidated financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare consolidated
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have prepared the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated
financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the group and of the profit or loss 
of the group for that year.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
■ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
■ state that the consolidated financial statements comply 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
■ prepare the consolidated financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
group will continue in business. 
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the group and to enable them to ensure that
the consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
In addition, the Companies Act 1985 requires directors to provide
the group’s auditors with every opportunity to take whatever steps
and undertake whatever inspections the auditors consider to be
appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit
report. The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, 
confirm that:
■ so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the group’s auditors are unaware; and
■ each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have
taken as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the group’s auditors are
aware of that information.
The directors have reviewed the group’s budget and cash flow
forecasts. On the basis of this review, and in the light of the current
financial position and existing borrowing facilities, the directors are
satisfied that SABMiller plc is a going concern and have continued
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.
A copy of the financial statements of the group and the company
are placed on the company’s website. The directors are
responsible for the maintenance and integrity of statutory and
audited information on the company’s website. Information
published on the internet is accessible in many countries with
different legal requirements. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Independent auditors’ report 61
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
We have audited the group financial statements of SABMiller 
plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the
consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet,
the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement
of total recognised income and expense and the related notes.
These group financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of SABMiller plc for the year ended 31 March 2008
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the group
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information 
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the group 
financial statements. The information given in the Directors’
Report includes that specific information presented in the
Operating and Financial Review and the Ordinary Shareholding
Analyses that is cross referred from the principal activities and
business review and the substantial shareholdings sections
of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding director’s
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, 
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, as
described in the contents, and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited group financial statements. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the group financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the group financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and 
of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
■ the group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation; and
■ the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the group financial statements.

Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 66 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of the group’s financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the periods
presented, unless otherwise stated.
a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of SABMiller plc have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union,
IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical 
cost convention, except for share-based payments, pensions 
and post-retirement benefits and the revaluation to fair value 
of certain financial instruments as described in the accounting
policies below. The accounts have been prepared on a going
concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires the use 
of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise judgment in the process of applying 
the group’s accounting policies. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. 
b) Recent accounting developments
(i) Standards and interpretations of published standards 
effective during the year ended 31 March 2008.
■ IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, (effective from 1 May 2006)
provides guidance on the scope of IFRS 2.
■ IFRIC 9, ‘Re-assessment of embedded derivatives’, (effective
from 1 June 2006) provides guidance as to the circumstances
an embedded derivative can be reassessed.
■ IFRIC 10, ‘Interim financial reporting and impairment’ (effective
from 1 November 2006) prohibits the reversal of impairment
losses recognised in an interim period in the annual period.
■ IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2—Group and treasury share transactions’
(effective from 1 March 2007) provides guidance on share-
based payment arrangements with a Group of companies.
■ IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and the
amendment to IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements –
Capital Disclosures”, (effective from 1 January 2007), introduce
new disclosures to improve the information about financial
instruments. It requires the disclosures of qualitative and
quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from
financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures
about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including
sensitivity analysis to market risk. It replaces disclosure
requirements in IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation’. This standard does not have any impact on the
classification and valuation of the group’s financial instruments.
The adoption of these interpretations and IFRS 7 has not had a
material effect on the consolidated results of operations or
financial position of the group.
(ii) Standards and amendments to published standards that 
are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by 
the group.
The following standards and amendments have been published
that are mandatory for the group’s accounting periods beginning
on or after 1 April 2008 or later periods but that the group has 
not early adopted:
■ Amendment to IFRS 2, ‘Share-based Payment’ (effective 
from 1 January 2009), clarifies the definition of vesting
conditions and provides guidance on the accounting treatment
of cancellations by other parties. The group does not plan to
apply this Amendment early, and its adoption is not expected
to have a material impact on the group’s results.
■ IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’, (effective from 1 January 2009),
requires the amount reported for each operating segment item
to be the measure reported to management for the purposes 
of allocating resources to the segment and assessing its
performance. The group does not plan to apply IFRS 8 early,
and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on
the group’s current segmental reporting.
■ IAS 1 (revised), ‘Presentation of financial statements’, 
(effective from 1 January 2009), prohibits the presentation 
of items of income and expense (that is, ‘non-owner changes
in equity’) in the statement of changes in equity, requiring 
‘non-owner changes in equity’ to be presented separately 
from owner changes in equity. All non-owner changes in equity 
will be required to be shown in a performance statement 
but entities can choose whether to present one performance
statement (the statement of comprehensive income) or two
statements (the income statement and statement of
comprehensive income).
■ IAS 23 (revised), ‘Borrowing costs’ (effective from 1 January
2009), is still subject to endorsement by the European Union. 
It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of 
a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time
to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs
will be removed. The group will apply IAS 23 (revised) from 
1 April 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU. The group
does not plan to apply IAS 23 (revised) early, and its adoption
is not expected to have a material impact on the group’s results.
■ IAS 27 (revised), ‘Consolidated and separate financial
statements’, (effective from 1 July 2009), is still subject to
endorsement by the European Union. Among other changes 
it requires that the difference between the consideration 
paid or received and the recorded non-controlling interest 
is recognised in equity in respect of transactions with non-
controlling interests in group entities which do not result in a
change of control. In the case of the disposal of a subsidiary,
any retained interest will be re-measured to fair value and the
difference between fair value and the previous carrying value 
will be recognised immediately in the income statement. 
The group does not plan to apply IAS 27 (revised) early.
■ IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’, (effective from 
1 July 2009), is still subject to endorsement by the European
Union. Among other changes it requires transaction costs 
to be recognised immediately in the income statement, fair
value gains or losses on existing investments in an acquired
company to be recognised in the income statement on the
date of acquisition and adjustments to deferred tax outside 
of the hindsight period are recorded under IAS 12, as opposed
to affecting goodwill. In addition it requires the recognition 
of subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent
consideration in the income statement rather than 
against goodwill.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
1. Accounting policies Notes to the consolidated financial statements 67
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
c) Significant judgements and estimates
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is
often required where the choice of specific policy, assumption 
or accounting estimate to be followed could materially affect the
reported results or net position of the group, should it later be
determined that a different choice be more appropriate.
Management considers the following to be areas of significant
judgement and estimation for the group:
(i) Impairment reviews in respect of goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets are performed at least annually. More regular
reviews are performed if events indicate that this is necessary.
Details of the estimates used are set out in note 10.
(ii) The determination of the carrying amount of property, plant
and equipment and related depreciation; capitalisation of
costs, estimation of useful economic life and recoverability 
of such assets. The estimates in relation to these items are 
set out in part (i) to this note.
(iii) The group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision
for taxes as the tax treatment cannot be finally determined 
until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant 
tax authority. 
(iv) Pension accounting requires certain assumptions to be made
in order to value our obligations and to determine the charges
to be made to the income statement. Details of the
assumptions used are set out in note 30.
(v) The determination of the carrying amount and estimated useful
lives of intangible assets acquired in a business combination.
d) Segmental reporting
A reportable segment is a distinguishable business or
geographical component of the group that provides products 
or services that are different from those of other segments.
Segments results, assets and liabilities include items directly
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated
on a reasonable basis.
The group’s primary segmental analyses are in accordance with
the basis on which the businesses are managed and according 
to the differing risk and reward profiles. The group presents its
geographic analysis as its primary segmentation. 
The group presents its product analysis as its secondary
segmentation. This will be analysed between secondary segments
of Beer, Soft drinks and Other.
e) Basis of consolidation
SABMiller plc (the company) is a public limited company
incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and 
Wales. The consolidated financial statements include the financial
information of the subsidiary and associated entities owned by 
the company. 
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company, where 
control is the power directly or indirectly to govern the financial
and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit 
from its activities, regardless of whether this power is actually
exercised. Where the company’s interest in subsidiaries is less
than 100%, the share attributable to outside shareholders is
reflected in minority interests. Subsidiaries are included in the
financial statements from the date control commences until 
the date control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or
income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Some of the company’s subsidiaries have a local statutory
accounting reference date of 31 December. These are consolidated
using management prepared information on a basis coterminous
with the company’s accounting reference date.
(ii) Associates
Associates are entities in which the group has a long-term 
interest and over which the group has directly or indirectly
significant influence, where significant influence is the ability 
to influence the financial and operating policies of the entity.
The associate, Distell Group Ltd, has a statutory accounting
reference date of 30 June. In respect of each year ending 
31 March, this company is included based on financial statements
drawn up to the previous 31 December, but taking into account
any changes in the subsequent period from 1 January to 
31 March that would materially affect the results. All other
associates are included on a coterminous basis.
f) Foreign exchange
(i) Foreign exchange translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars
which is the group’s presentational currency. The South African
rand (ZAR) and Colombian peso (COP) exchange rates to US
dollar used in preparing the consolidated financial statements
were as follows:
Weighted average rate Closing rate
ZAR COP ZAR COP
Year ended 31 March 2007 7.06 2,340 7.29 2,190
Year ended 31 March 2008 7.13 1,997 8.15 1,822
The weighted average exchange rates have been calculated
based on the average of the exchange rates during the relevant
year and weighted according to the revenue of the group’s
businesses.
(ii) Transactions and balances
The financial statements for each group company have been
prepared on the basis that transactions in foreign currencies are
recorded in their functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling
at the date of the transaction. Monetary items denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date with the resultant translation differences
being included in operating profit in the income statement other
than those arising on financial assets and liabilities which are
recorded within net finance costs and those which are deferred 
in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net
investment hedges. Translation differences on non-monetary
assets such as equity investments classified as available for 
sale assets are included in equity. 
(iii) Overseas subsidiaries and associates
One-off items in the income and cash flow statements of 
overseas subsidiaries and associates expressed in currencies
other than the US dollar are translated to US dollars at the rates
of exchange prevailing on the day of the transaction. All other
items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange 
for the relevant reporting period. Assets and liabilities of these
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
1. Accounting policies continued 68 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
undertakings are translated at closing rates of exchange at 
each balance sheet date. All translation exchange differences
arising on the retranslation of opening net assets together with
differences between income statements translated at average 
and closing rates are recognised as a separate component of
equity. For these purposes net assets include loans between
group companies that form part of the net investment, for which
settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable
future and is either denominated in the functional currency of the
parent or the foreign entity. When a foreign operation is disposed
of, any related exchange differences in equity are recycled through
the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate.
g) Business combinations
(i) Subsidiaries
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries. The identifiable net assets (including intangibles),
are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of 
their fair value from the effective date of control, and the results 
of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the financial year 
are included in the group’s results from that date.
Control is presumed to exist when the group owns, directly or
indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the voting power 
of an entity unless, in exceptional circumstances, it can be clearly
demonstrated that such ownership does not constitute control.
Control also exists where the group has the ability to direct or
dominate decision-making in an entity, regardless of whether 
this power is actually exercised.
On the acquisition of a company or business, fair values 
reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed 
to the identifiable assets (including intangibles), liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired. Fair values of these assets and
liabilities are determined by reference to market values, where
available, or by reference to the current price at which similar
assets could be acquired or similar obligations entered into, or 
by discounting expected future cash flows to present value, 
using either market rates or the risk-free rates and risk-adjusted
expected future cash flows.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred 
or assumed at the date of the acquisition plus costs directly
attributable to the acquisition. It also includes the group’s estimate
of any deferred consideration payable. Where the business
combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost
that is contingent on future events, contingent consideration is
included in the cost of an acquisition if the adjustment is probable
(that is, more likely than not) and can be measured reliably. The
difference between the costs of acquisition and the share of the
net assets acquired is capitalised as goodwill.
Where the group purchases additional shares in subsidiaries such
purchases are reflected as separate acquisition processes and no
revised fair valuation is required. The difference between the costs
of acquisition and the share of the net assets acquired is
capitalised as goodwill. 
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously
acquired business, the results of the business are included in 
the group’s results up to the effective date of disposal. The profit
or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging or
crediting the amount of any related goodwill to the extent that it
has not previously been taken to the income statement.
(ii) Associates
The group’s share of the recognised income and expenses of
associates are accounted for using the equity method from the 
date significant influence commences to the date it ceases based
on present ownership interests. The date significant influence
commences is not necessarily the same as the closing date 
or any other date named in the contract.
The group recognises its share of associates’ results as a one 
line entry before tax in the income statement, after taking account
of the share of interest, tax and minority interests.
When the group’s interest in an associate has been reduced to 
nil because the group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in 
the associate, the group only provides for additional losses to the
extent that it has incurred legal or constructive obligations to fund
such losses, or make payments on behalf of the associate. Where
the disposal of an investment in an associate is considered highly
probable (that is, significantly more likely than probable), the
investment ceases to be equity accounted and, instead, is
classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying
amount and fair value less costs to dispose.
(iii) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
costs of acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets (including intangibles), liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition. Where
the fair value of the group’s share of identifiable net assets
acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the difference
is recorded as negative goodwill. Negative goodwill arising on an
acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses and is reviewed
for impairment on an annual basis. Any impairment identified 
is recognised immediately in the income statement and is 
not reversed.
The carrying amount of goodwill in respect of associates is 
included in the carrying value of the investment in the associate.
Where a business combination occurs in several stages, the
goodwill associated with each stage is calculated using fair value
information at the date of each additional share purchase. 
h) Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
on a straight-line basis (if applicable) and impairment losses. Cost
is usually determined as the amount paid by the group, unless the
asset has been acquired as part of a business combination.
Amortisation is included within net operating expenses in the
income statement. Internally generated intangibles are not
recognised except for applied development costs referred to
under research and development below.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortised but are
subject to annual reviews for impairment.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their
estimated useful economic lives, and only tested for impairment
where there is a triggering event. The directors’ assessment of 
the useful life of intangible assets is based on the nature of the
asset acquired, the durability of the products to which the asset
attaches and the expected future impact of competition on 
the business.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
1. Accounting policies continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements 69
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination 
are recognised separately when they are identifiable, it is probable
that economic benefits will flow to the group and the fair value 
can be measured reliably.
(i) Trademarks recognised as part of a business combination
Trademarks are recognised as an intangible asset where the
trademark has a long term value. Acquired trademarks are 
only recognised where title is clear or the trademark could be 
sold separately from the rest of the business and the earnings
attributable to it are separately identifiable. The group typically
arrives at the cost of such trademarks on a relief from 
royalty basis.
Where the acquired trademark is seen as having a finite useful
economic life, it is subject to amortisation, which in respect of
trademarks currently held is 10-40 years, being the period for
which the group has exclusive rights to those trademarks. 
Where the acquired trademark is seen as having an indefinite
useful economic life, the carrying value is subject to an annual
impairment review.
(ii) Contract brewing and other licences recognised as part 
of a business combination
Contractual arrangements for contract brewing and competitor
licensing arrangements are recognised as an intangible asset at 
a fair value representing the remaining contractual period with 
an assumption about the expectation that such a contract will be
renewed, together with a valuation of this extension. Contractual
arrangements and relationships with customers and distributors
are also valued on a similar basis. 
Where the acquired licence or contract is seen as having a finite
useful economic life, it is subject to amortisation, which is the
period for which the group has exclusive rights to these assets 
or income streams.
(iii) Customer lists and relationships recognised as part of 
a business combination
The fair value of businesses acquired may include customer lists
and distributor relationships. These are recognised as intangible
assets and are calculated by discounting the future revenue
stream attributable to these lists or relationships.
Where the acquired asset is seen as having a finite useful
economic life ranging from 10 to 15 years, it is subject to
amortisation over the period for which the group has the benefit 
of these assets.
(iv) Software
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related 
item of property, plant and equipment, the software is capitalised
as an intangible asset. 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis
of the costs incurred to acquire and bring them to use. Direct
costs associated with the production of identifiable and unique
internally generated software products controlled by the group
that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs
beyond one year are capitalised. Direct costs include software
development employment costs (including those of contractors
used) and an appropriate portion of overheads. Capitalised
computer software, licence and development costs are amortised
over their useful economic lives of between 3 and 8 years.
Internally generated costs associated with maintaining computer
software programmes are expensed as incurred.
(v) Research and development
Research and general development expenditure is written 
off in the period in which it is incurred. 
Certain applied development costs are only capitalised as
internally generated intangible assets where there is a clearly
defined project, separately identifiable expenditure, an outcome
assessed with reasonable certainty (in terms of feasibility and
commerciality), future costs exceed expected revenue and the
group has the resources to complete the task. Such assets are
amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives. 
i) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the
acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in 
the asset’s carrying value or recognised as a separate asset as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the specific asset will flow to the group and the
cost can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs
are charged to the income statement during the financial period 
in which they are incurred. 
(i) Assets in the course of construction
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any
impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and for qualifying
assets certain borrowing costs as determined below. When these
assets are ready for their intended use, they are transferred into
the appropriate category. At this point depreciation commences
on the same basis as on other property, plant and equipment.
(ii) Assets held under finance leases
Assets held under finance leases which result in the group 
bearing substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership are capitalised as property, plant and equipment.
Finance lease assets are initially recognised at an amount 
equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, then
depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element of future
obligations under the leases is included as a liability in the balance
sheet classified, as appropriate, as a current or non-current
liability. The interest element of the lease obligations is charged 
to the income statement over the period of the lease term to
reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the obligation for each financial period.
(iii) Containers
Containers in circulation are recorded within property, plant and
equipment at cost net of accumulated depreciation less any
impairment loss. 
Depreciation of returnable bottles and containers is recorded 
to write the containers off over the course of their economic life. 
This is typically undertaken in a two stage process; 
■ The excess over deposit value is written down over a period 
of 1-3 years. 
■ Provisions are made against the deposit values for breakages
and loss in trade together with a design obsolescence
provision held to write off the deposit value over the expected
bottle design period – which is a period of no more than 
10 years from the inception of a bottle design. This period is
shortened where appropriate by reference to market dynamics
and the ability of the entity to use bottles for different brands.
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
1. Accounting policies continued 70 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
(iv) Depreciation
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the 
course of construction. In respect of all other plant, property 
and equipment, depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis 
at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less the
estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful 
life as follows:
Freehold buildings 20-50 years
Leasehold buildings Shorter of the lease term 
or 50 years
Plant, vehicles and systems 2-30 years
Returnable containers 
(non-returnable containers 
are recorded as inventory) 1-10 years
Assets held under finance leases Lower of the lease term 
of life of the asset
The group regularly reviews all of its depreciation rates and
residual values to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the 
group takes into account are the expected rate of technological
developments, expected market requirements for the equipment
and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used. 
The profit or loss on the disposal of an asset is the difference
between the disposal proceeds and the net book amount.
(v) Capitalisation of borrowing costs
Direct financing costs incurred, before tax, on major capital
projects during the period of development or construction that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to be developed for
their intended use, are capitalised up to the time of completion 
of the project.
j) Advance payments made to customers (principally
hotels, restaurants, bars and clubs)
Advance payments made to customers are conditional on 
the achievement of contracted sales targets or marketing
commitments. The group records such payments as prepayments
initially at fair value and are amortised in the income statement
over the relevant period to which the customer commitment is
made (typically 3-5 years). These prepayments are recorded 
net of any impairment losses.
Where there is a volume target the amortised cost of the 
advance is included in sales discounts as a reduction to revenue
and where there are specific marketing activities/commitments 
the cost is included as an operating expense. The amounts
capitalised are reassessed annually for achievement of targets 
and are impaired where there is objective evidence that the
targets will not be achieved.
Assets held at customer premises are included within plant,
property and equipment and are depreciated in line with group
policies on similar assets. 
k) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost incurred in bringing
each product to its present location and condition, and net
realisable value, as follows:
■ Raw materials, consumables and goods for resale: Purchase
cost net of discounts and rebates on a first-in first-out basis
(FIFO).
■ Finished goods and work in progress: Raw material cost plus
direct costs and a proportion of manufacturing overhead
expenses on a FIFO basis.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further
costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
l) Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recorded 
at fair value (plus any directly attributable transactions costs 
where applicable). For those financial instruments that are not
subsequently held at fair value, the group assesses whether 
there is any objective evidence of impairment at each balance
sheet date. 
Financial assets are recognised when the group has rights or
other access to economic benefits. Such assets consist of 
cash, equity instruments, a contractual right to receive cash or
another financial asset, or a contractual right to exchange financial
instruments with another entity on potentially favourable terms.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash
flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred and
the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards 
of ownership.
Financial liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation 
to transfer benefits and that obligation is a contractual liability 
to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial
instruments with another entity on potentially unfavourable terms.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished,
that is discharged, cancelled or expired.
If a legally enforceable right exists to set off recognised 
amounts of financial assets and liabilities, which are in
determinable monetary amounts, the relevant financial assets 
and liabilities are offset.
Interest costs are charged against income in the year in which
they accrue. Premiums or discounts arising from the difference
between the net proceeds of financial instruments purchased 
or issued and the amounts receivable or repayable at maturity 
are included in the effective interest calculation and taken to 
net interest payable over the life of the instrument.
There are four categories of financial assets and financial liabilities.
These are described as follows: 
(i) Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss
Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value though profit 
or loss includes derivative assets and derivative liabilities not
designated as effective hedging instruments.
All gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial
assets or financial liabilities within this category are recognised in
the income statement.
a Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are financial
instruments whose value changes in response to an underlying
variable, require little or no initial investment and are settled in 
the future. 
These include derivatives embedded in host contracts. Such
embedded derivatives need not be accounted for separately if 
the host contract is already fair valued; if it is not considered as 
a derivative if it was freestanding; or if it can be demonstrated that 
it is closely related to the host contract. There are certain currency
exemptions which the group has applied to these rules which 
limit the need to account for certain potential embedded foreign
exchange derivatives. These are: if a contract is denominated in
the functional currency of either party; where that currency is
commonly used in international trade of the good traded; or 
if it is commonly used for local transactions in an economic
environment. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1. Accounting policies continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements 71
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are analysed between
current and non-current assets and liabilities on the face of the
balance sheet, depending on when they are expected to mature. 
For derivatives that have not been designated to a hedging
relationship, all fair value movements are recognised immediately 
in the income statement. (See note (x) for the group’s accounting
policy on hedge accounting).
(ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They arise when the group provides money, goods 
or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading 
the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for
maturities of greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date
which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables
are initially recognised at fair value including originating fees and
transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Loans and receivables include trade receivables, amounts owed
by associates – trade, accrued income and cash and cash
equivalents.
a Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision 
for impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established
when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the
receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between
the asset’s carrying value and the present value of the estimated
future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
This provision is recognised in the income statement.
b Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank deposits
repayable on demand and other short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
(iii) Available for sale investments
Available for sale investments are non-derivative financial assets
that are either designated in this category or not classified as
financial assets at fair value through the income statement, or
loans and receivables. Investments in this category are included 
in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose 
of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs
and are subsequently re-measured at fair value and tested for
impairment. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value including any related foreign exchange movements are
recognised in equity. On disposal or impairment of available 
for sale investments, any gains or losses in equity are recycled
through the income statement.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the date
on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash
flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred
and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards 
of ownership. 
(iv) Financial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables,
accruals, amounts owed to associates – trade, other payables
and borrowings.
a Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. Trade payables are analysed between current
and non-current liabilities on the face of the balance sheet,
depending on when the obligation to settle will be realised.
b Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transactions
costs and are subsequently stated at amortised cost and include
accrued interest and prepaid interest. Borrowings are classified 
as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right 
to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months from the
balance sheet date. Borrowings classified as hedged items are
subject to hedge accounting requirements (see note (x)). Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities and 
are included within cash and cash equivalents on the face of the
cash flow statement as they form an integral part of the group’s
cash management.
m) Impairment
This policy covers all assets except inventories (see note k),
financial assets (see note l), non-current assets classified as 
held for sale (see note n), and deferred tax assets (see note u).
Impairment reviews are performed by comparing the carrying
value of the non-current asset to its recoverable amount, being
the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
The fair value less costs to sell is considered to be the amount
that could be obtained on disposal of the asset. The value in 
use of the asset is determined by discounting, at a market based 
pre-tax discount rate, the expected future cash flows resulting
from its continued use, including those arising from its final
disposal. When the carrying values of non-current assets are
written down by any impairment amount, the loss is recognised 
in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. 
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
independent from the cash flows of other assets, the group
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating 
unit (CGU) to which the assets belongs. For the purpose of
conducting impairment reviews, CGUs are considered to be
groups of assets and liabilities that have separately identifiable
cash flows. They also include those assets and liabilities directly
involved in producing the income and a suitable proportion of
those used to produce more than one income stream.
When an impairment is recognised, the impairment loss is held
firstly against any specifically impaired assets of the CGU, then
taken against goodwill balances and if there is a remaining loss 
it is set against the remaining intangible and tangible assets 
on a pro-rata basis.
Should circumstances or events change and give rise to a reversal
of a previous impairment loss, the reversal is recognised in the
income statement in the period in which it occurs and the carrying
value of the asset is increased. The increase in the carrying value
of the asset is restricted to the amount that it would have been
had the original impairment not occurred. Impairment losses in
respect of goodwill are irreversible.
Intangible non-current assets with an indefinite life and goodwill
are tested annually for impairment. Assets subject to amortisation
are reviewed for impairment if circumstances or events change 
to indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
1. Accounting policies continued 72 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
n) Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities classified as held
for resale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair
value less costs to sell. 
Such assets are classified as held for resale if their carrying
amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than
through continued use. This condition is regarded as met only
when a sale is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is
available for immediate sale in its present condition and when
management is committed to the sale which is expected to 
qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year 
from date of classification.
o) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation,
whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for 
which it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount of the obligation. Such provisions are
calculated on a discounted basis where the effect is material to
the original undiscounted provision. The carrying amount of the
provision increases in each period to reflect the passage of time
and the unwinding of the discount and the movement is
recognised in the income statement within interest costs. 
Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties 
and employee termination payments. Provisions are not
recognised for future operating losses however provisions are
recognised for onerous contracts where the unavoidable cost
exceeds the expected benefit.
p) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. The non-voting
convertible shares are also classified as equity. Incremental 
costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares
or options, or for the acquisition of a business, are included in 
the share premium account.
q) Investments in own shares and those shares held 
by employee benefit trusts
Shares held by employee share ownership plans and employee
benefit trusts are treated as a deduction from equity until the shares
are cancelled, reissued, or disposed of. The SABMiller plc shares
held by Safari Ltd, a special purpose vehicle, are classified similarly. 
Purchases of such shares are classified in the cash flow statement
as a purchase of own shares for share trusts within net cash from
financing activities.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued any
consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
costs and related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to
the company’s equity shareholders. 
r) Revenue recognition
(i) Sale of goods and services
Revenue represents the fair value at consideration received or
receivable for goods and services provided to third parties and 
is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are
substantially transferred. 
The group presents revenue gross of excise duties because 
unlike value added tax, excise is not directly related to the value 
of sales. It is not generally recognised as a separate item on
invoices, increases in excise are not always directly passed on 
to customers, and the group cannot reclaim the excise where
customers do not pay for product received. The group therefore
considers excise as a cost to the group and reflects it as a
production cost. Consequently any excise that is recovered 
in the sale price is included in revenue. 
Revenue excludes value added tax. It is stated net of price
discounts, promotional discounts, settlement discounts and after
an appropriate amount has been provided to cover the sales value
of credit notes yet to be issued that relate to the current and 
prior periods.
The same recognition criteria also apply to the sale of by-products
and waste (such as spent grain, malt dust and yeast) with the
exception that these are included within other income. 
(ii) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the
effective interest method. 
When a receivable is impaired the group reduces the carrying
amount to its recoverable amount by discounting the estimated
future cash flows at the original effective interest rate, and
continuing to unwind the discount as interest income.
(iii) Royalty income
Royalty income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance
with the relevant agreements and is included in other income. 
(iv) Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment
is established. 
s) Operating leases
Rentals paid and incentives received on operating leases are
charged or credited to the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
t) Exceptional items
Where certain expense or revenue items recorded in a period 
are material by their size or incidence, the group reflects such
items as exceptional items within a separate line on the income
statement except for those exceptional items that relate to
associates, interest and tax. (Associates, interest and tax
exceptional items are only referred to in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements).
Exceptional items are also summarised by class in the segmental
analyses, excluding those that relate to interest and tax. 
Where certain income statement items incurred are of a capital
nature or are considered material and non-recurring, the group
proposes to continue to present alternative earnings per share
calculations both on a headline (under the CFA Society of the 
UK definition) and on an adjusted basis. 
u) Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred
tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, 
in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is based on the results for the period as
adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible. The
group’s liability for current taxation is calculated using tax rates
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
1. Accounting policies continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements 73
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method, in respect
of all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated
financial statements, except where the temporary difference arises
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than a business
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised where the carrying value 
of an asset is greater than its tax base, or where the carrying
value of a liability is less than its tax base. Deferred tax is
recognised in full on temporary differences arising from investment
in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. This includes taxation in respect of 
the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent
that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued 
as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings 
in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary. Deferred
income tax is also recognised in respect of the unremitted retained
earnings of overseas associates as the group is not able to
determine when such earnings will be remitted and when such
additional tax such as withholding taxes might be payable.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences (including carried forward tax losses)
can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates expected to apply 
in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at balance sheet date. Deferred tax is
measured on a non-discounted basis.
v) Dividend distributions
Dividend distributions to equity holders of the parent are
recognised as a liability in the group’s financial statements in 
the period in which the dividends are approved by the company’s
shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when approved 
by the board. Dividends declared after the balance sheet date are
not recognised, as there is no present obligation at the balance
sheet date.
w) Employee benefits
(i) Wages and salaries
Wages and salaries for current employees are recognised in 
the income statement as the employees’ services are rendered.
(ii) Vacation and long-term service awards costs
The group recognises a liability and an expense for accrued
vacation pay when such benefits are earned and not when 
these benefits are paid. 
The group also recognises a liability and an expense for long-term
service awards where cash is paid to the employee at certain
milestone dates in a career with the group. Such accruals are
appropriately discounted to reflect the future payment dates 
at discount rates determined by reference to local high quality
corporate bonds.
(iii) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and
profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration
the profit attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain
adjustments. 
The group recognises a provision where contractually obliged 
or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive
obligation. At a mid year point an accrual is maintained for the
appropriate proportion of the expected bonuses which would
become payable at the year end.
(iv) Share-based compensation
The group operates a variety of equity-settled, share-based
compensation plans. These comprise share option plans (with 
and without non-market performance conditions attached) and 
a performance share award scheme (with market conditions
attached). An expense is recognised to spread the fair value 
of each award granted after 7 November 2002 over the vesting
period on a straight-line basis, after allowing for an estimate of 
the share awards that will eventually vest. This expense is offset
by a corresponding adjustment made to equity over the remaining
vesting period. The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed 
at least annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being
recognised immediately. The charge is based on the fair value 
of the award as at the date of grant, as calculated by various
binomial model calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
The charge is not reversed if the options are not exercised
because the market value of the shares is lower than the option
price at the date of grant.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction
costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share
premium when the options are exercised.
(v) Pension obligations
The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined
benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan
assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past service
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest
rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to
maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments
and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full as
they arise outside of income statement and are presented in the
statement of recognised income and expense, with the exception
of gains or losses arising from changes in the benefits regarding
past services, which are recognised in the income statement.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income
statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional
on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of
time. In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised 
as an expense as the costs become payable. The contributions
are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent
that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments 
is available.
(vi) Other post-employment obligations
Some group companies provide post-retirement healthcare
benefits to qualifying employees. The expected costs of these
benefits are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified
actuaries and contributions are made to the relevant funds over
the expected service lives of the employees entitled to those
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
1. Accounting policies continued 74 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
funds. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience
adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions are
recognised in full as they arise outside the income statement 
and are presented in the statement of recognised income 
and expense. These obligations are valued annually by
independent qualified actuaries.
(vii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is 
terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The group recognises termination benefits when it is
demonstrably committed to terminating the employment of current
employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility
of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of 
an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits 
falling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are
discounted to present value in a similar manner to all long-term
employee benefits.
x) Derivative financial instruments – hedge accounting
Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss include all derivative financial instruments. The derivative
instruments used by the group, which are used solely for hedging
purposes (i.e. to offset foreign exchange and interest rate risks),
comprise interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward
foreign exchange contracts. Such derivative instruments are used
to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the
group in line with the group’s risk management policies. The
group also has derivatives embedded in other contracts primarily
cross border foreign currency supply contracts for raw materials.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a derivative
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their
fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss
depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging
instrument, and if so, the nature of the hedging relationship. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required 
to document at inception, the relationship between the hedged
item and the hedging instrument as well as its risk management
objectives and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions. 
The group is also required to document and demonstrate that the
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument
will be highly effective. This effectiveness test is re-performed at
each period end to ensure that the hedge has remained and will
continue to remain highly effective.
The group designates certain derivatives as either: hedges of 
the fair of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment 
(fair value hedge); hedges of highly probable forecast transactions
or commitment (cash flow hedge); or hedges of net investments 
in foreign operations (net investment hedge).
(i) Fair value hedges
Fair value hedges comprise derivative financial instruments
designated in a hedging relationship to manage the group’s
interest rate risk to which the fair value of certain assets and
liabilities are exposed. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
offset the relevant changes in the fair value of the underlying
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the income
statement in the period incurred.
Gains or losses on fair value hedges that are regarded as highly
effective are recorded in the income statement together with the
gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
(ii) Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges comprise derivative financial instruments
designated in a hedging relationship to manage currency risk to
which the cash flows of certain liabilities are exposed. The effective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is
designated and qualifies for hedge accounting is recognised as a
separate component of equity. The ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated 
in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period in
which the hedged item affects profit or loss. However, where a
forecasted transaction results in a non-financial asset or liability,
the accumulated fair value movements previously deferred in
equity are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.
(iii) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations comprise 
either foreign currency borrowings or derivatives (typically forward
exchange contracts and cross currency swaps) designated in 
a hedging relationship. 
Gains or losses on hedging instruments that are regarded as
highly effective are recognised in equity. These largely offset
foreign currency gains or losses arising on the translation of net
investments that are recorded in equity, in the foreign currency
translation reserve. The ineffective portion of gains or losses on
hedging instruments is recognised immediately in the income
statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are only recycled to
the income statement upon disposal of the net investment.
Where a derivative ceases to meet the criteria of being a hedging
instrument or the underlying exposure which it is hedging is sold,
matures or is extinguished, hedge accounting is discontinued.
A similar treatment is applied where the hedge is of a future
transaction and that transaction is no longer likely to occur.
Certain derivative instruments, whilst providing effective economic
hedges under the group’s policies, are not designated as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not
qualify or have not been designated as hedges are recognised
immediately in the income statement. The group does not hold 
or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
y) Deposits by customers
Bottles and containers in circulation are recorded within property,
plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded 
in respect of the obligation to repay the customers’ deposits.
Deposits paid by customers for branded returnable containers 
are reflected in the balance sheet within current liabilities. 
Any estimated liability that may arise in respect of deposits 
for unbranded containers and bottles is shown in provisions.
z) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share represents the profit on ordinary
activities after taxation attributable to the equity shareholders 
of the parent entity, divided by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue during the year, less the weighted average
number of ordinary shares held in the group’s employee benefit
trust during the year.
Diluted earnings per share represents the profit on ordinary
activities after taxation attributable to the equity shareholders,
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in
issue during the year, less the weighted average number of
ordinary shares held in the group’s employee benefit trust during
the year, plus the weighted average number of dilutive shares
resulting from share options and other potential ordinary shares
outstanding during the year.

because the exercise price of the option exceeds the fair value of the shares during the year, and 6,971,801 (2007: 7,707,155) share
options that were anti-dilutive for the year because the performance conditions attached to the options have not been met. These
options could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future.

Adjusted and headline earnings
The group has also presented an adjusted earnings per share figure to exclude the impact of amortisation of intangible assets
(excluding capitalised software) and other non-recurring items in order to present a more useful comparison for the years shown in the
consolidated financial statements. Adjusted earnings per share has been based on adjusted headline earnings for each financial year
and on the same number of weighted average shares in issue as the basic earnings per share calculation. Headline earnings per share
has been calculated in accordance with the new South African Circular 8/2007 entitled ‘Headline Earnings’ which forms part of the
listing requirements for the JSE Ltd (JSE). The adjustments made to arrive at headline earnings and adjusted earnings are as follows:

In addition, the directors are proposing a final dividend of 42.0 US cents per share in respect of the financial year ended 31 March
2008, which will absorb an estimated US$632 million of shareholders’ funds. If approved by shareholders, the dividend will be paid on 
7 August 2008 to shareholders registered on the London and Johannesburg Registers on 11 July 2008. The total dividend per share 
for the year is 58.0 US cents (2007: 50.0 US cents).
Safari Ltd waived its rights to interim dividends of US$12 million (2007: US$11 million), and to the final dividend in respect of 2007 of 
US$28 million (2006: US$24 million). Dividends amounting to US$32 million in respect of the proposed final dividend for 2008 have
been waived by Safari Ltd and have been deducted in arriving at the estimated amount of shareholders’ funds to be absorbed.
The employee benefit trust which holds shares for the various executive share incentive schemes has waived its rights to dividends.
Dividends are paid between group companies out of profits available for distribution subject to, amongst other things (in the case of
companies incorporated in Great Britain), the provisions of the companies’ Articles of Association and the Companies Act 1985 (as
amended). There are restrictions over the distribution by a company incorporated in Great Britain of any profits which are not generated
from external cash receipts as defined in Technical Release 1/08, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
The final dividend of the company of US$537 million paid on 7 August 2007, relating to the year ended 31 March 2007 and the interim
dividend of US$232 million paid on 21 December 2007, relating to the six months ended 30 September 2007, were paid out of profits
available for distribution and the final dividend of the company of US$632 million proposed to be paid on 7 August 2008, relating to 
the year ended 31 March 2008, will be paid out of profits available for distribution as at 31 March 2008.

Assumptions
The recoverable amount for a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. The basis for the value-in-use calculations are
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering five-year periods, after which a long-term growth
rate is applied. The discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) is calculated using the Modigliani-Miller methodology, which reflects
the group’s debt cost after tax, returns from United States treasury bonds with maturity of 10 years, relevant individual country risk
profiles and an SABMiller-specific beta.
The group applies local post-tax discount rates to local post-tax cash flows and this closely approximates to applying pre-tax discount
rates to pre-tax cash flows. The following table presents the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations in each of the
group’s primary segments:

these brands have a remaining amortisation period of 37 years. The brands which arose on the Bavaria transaction in 2005 were valued
on a relief from royalty basis using the same post-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates as those applied to the goodwill
impairment review.

The group holds collateral as security for past due trade receivables to the value of US$33 million (2007: US$28 million).
At 31 March 2008, trade receivables of US$176 million (2007: US$141 million) were determined to be specifically impaired and provided
for. The amount of the provision at 31 March 2008 was US$143 million (2007: US$107 million) and reflects trade receivables from
customers which are considered to be experiencing difficult economic situations. It was assessed that a portion of these receivables 
is expected to be recovered. The group holds collateral as security for specifically impaired trade receivables with a fair value of
US$24 million (2007: US$19 million).
At 31 March 2008, other receivables of US$136 million (2007: US$121 million) were determined to be specifically impaired and provided
for. The amount of the provision at 31 March 2008 was US$42 million (2007: US$27 million) and reflects loans to customers which 
are considered to be experiencing difficult economic situations. It was assessed that a portion of these receivables is expected to 
be recovered. The group holds collateral as security against specifically impaired other receivables equal to the net carrying value 
at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007.
Collateral held primarily includes bank guarantees, charges over assets and concurrent amounts owing to associates.

Cash and short-term deposits of US$77 million (2007: US$68 million) are held in African countries (including South Africa) and are
subject to local exchange control regulations. These local exchange control regulations provide for restrictions on exporting capital from
those countries, other than through normal dividends.
During the year the group set up notional cash pools. The structure facilitates interest and balance compensation of cash and bank
overdrafts. This notional pooling arrangement does not meet the strict set-off rules under IFRS, and as a result, the cash and bank
overdraft balances have been reported ‘gross’ on the balance sheet. On a ‘netted’ pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents and
overdraft balances would have been US$127 million lower, resulting in US$546 million cash and cash equivalents and US$358 million
bank overdraft balances as at 31 March 2008.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the deferred tax assets and
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
The deferred tax assets arise due to timing differences on provisions in Europe, Africa and Asia, North and Latin America. Given both
recent and forecast trading, the directors are of the opinion that the level of profits in the foreseeable future is more likely than not to 
be sufficient to recover these assets. 
Deferred tax liabilities of US$1,703 million (2007: US$1,377 million) are expected to be recovered after more than one year.
Deferred tax assets of US$160 million (2007: US$43 million) are expected to be recovered after more than one year.

Tax losses 62 28
Tax credits 57 8
Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 8 1
Share-based payments 5 7
132 44
These deferred tax assets will not expire, with the exception of US$43 million tax credits which may expire if conditions for utilisation 
are not met.
Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where there is an intention to distribute those 
reserves. A deferred tax liability of US$35 million (2007: US$27 million) has been recognised. A deferred tax liability of US$31 million 
(2007: US$28 million) has also been recognised in respect of unremitted profits of associates where a dividend policy is not in place.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings where either the overseas profits
will not be distributed in the forseeable future, or where there are plans to remit overseas earnings of subsidiaries, it is not expected that
such distributions will give rise to a tax liability. Temporary differences on which deferred tax has not been recognised are estimated at
US$4,600 million (2007: US$2,900 million).

Financial Risk Management
Overview
In the normal course of business, the group is exposed to the following financial risks: 
■ Market risk
■ Credit risk
■ Liquidity risk
This note explains the group’s exposure to each of the above risks, aided by quantitative disclosures included throughout these
consolidated accounts, and it summarises the policies and processes that are in place to measure and manage the risks arising,
including those related to the management of capital. 
The directors are ultimately responsible for the establishment and oversight of the group’s risk management framework. An essential
part of this framework is the role undertaken by the audit committee of the board, supported by the internal audit function, and by 
the Chief Financial Officer, who in this regard is supported by the treasury committee and the group treasury function. Amongst other
responsibilities, the audit committee reviews the internal control environment and risk management systems within the group and it
reports its activities to the board. The board also receives a quarterly report on treasury activities, including confirmation of compliance
with treasury risk management policies. 
The group treasury function is responsible for the management of cash, borrowings and the financial risks arising in relation to 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The responsibility for the management of commodities exposures lies with the procurement
functions within the group. In relation to brewing materials, these activities are co-ordinated by a global sourcing council. Some of the
risk management strategies include the use of derivatives, principally in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, cross currency
swaps, interest rate swaps and exchange traded futures contracts, in order to manage the currency, interest rate and commodities
exposures arising from the group’s operations. The group also purchases call options where these provide a cost-effective hedging
alternative and, where they form part of an option collar strategy, the group also sells put options to reduce or eliminate the cost of
purchased options. It is group policy that no trading in financial instruments be taken. 
The group’s treasury policies are established to identify and analyse the financial risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits
and controls and to monitor exposures and adherence to limits.
a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The group is exposed to transactional currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the
respective functional currencies of group entities. These exposures are presently managed locally by group entities who, subject to
regulatory constraints or currency market limitations, hedge a proportion of their foreign currency exposure estimated to arise over a
period of up to 18 months. Committed transactional exposures that are certain are hedged fully without limitation in time. The group
principally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge currency risk.
Subject to special exemptions approved by the audit committee, the value of unhedged net monetary assets or liabilities within group
entities denominated in a non-functional currency is required to be lower than US$60 million in aggregate, having taken into account 
net investment hedges held by the group. Furthermore, the impact of a 10% change in foreign exchange rates on this aggregate value
is required to be less than 1% of group operating profit (excluding exceptional items). 
The group seeks to mitigate the effect of structural currency exposures, where cost effective, by borrowing in the same currencies as
the functional currencies of its main operating units or by achieving the same effect through the use of currency swaps. An approximate
nominal value of US$1,580 million of US dollar borrowings has been swapped into currencies that match the currency of the underlying
operations of the group, primarily Rand, but also Czech Koruna, Polish Zloty and Euro. These swaps are accounted for as net
investment hedges.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Currency risks arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being 
of a monetary nature.
The group holds net investment hedges totalling US$2,079 million at 31 March 2008 (2007: US$1,275 million). The foreign exchange
gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in the foreign currency translation reserve and partially offset the foreign currency
translation risk on the group’s foreign currency net assets.
The tables above assumes a 10 per cent increase/(decrease) of the functional currency against the foreign currency using the
asymmetric method where a 10% increase of the currency is calculated using a ratio of 1.1 whereas a 10% decrease of the currency 
is calculated using a ratio of 0.9. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis
is performed on the same basis for 2007.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The group’s policy is to borrow (directly or synthetically) in floating rates, reflecting the fact that floating rates are generally lower 
than fixed rates in the medium term. However, a minimum of 25% of consolidated net borrowings is required to be in fixed rates for a
minimum duration of 12 months and the extent to which group borrowings may be in floating rates is restricted to the lower of 75% of
consolidated net borrowings and that amount of net borrowings in floating rates that with a 1% increase in interest rates would increase
finance costs by an amount equal to (but not more than) 1.20% of EBITDA. Borrowings arising from recent mergers and acquisitions
and any inflation linked debt, where there will be a natural hedge within business operations, are excluded from these requirements. 
Exposure to movements in interest rates in group borrowings is managed through fixed rate coupons, interest rate swaps and forward
rate agreements. As at 31 March 2008, 30% (2007: 34%) of consolidated net borrowings were in fixed rates, taking into account
interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. Based on the group’s policy, the impact of a 1% rise in interest rates on borrowings 
in floating rates would be equivalent to 0.65% (2007: 0.65%) of EBITDA (excluding exceptional items).

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed income instruments
Changes in the market interest rates of non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rates only affect income if these are
measured at their fair value. As such, all financial instruments with fixed rates of interest that are accounted for at amortised cost are 
not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7. 
The group holds derivative contracts with a nominal value of US$1,100 million as at 31 March 2008 (2007: US$1,100 million) which 
are designated as fair value hedges. In the case of these instruments and the underlying fixed rate bonds, changes in the fair values of
the hedged item and the hedging instrument attributable to interest rate movements net-off almost completely in the income statement
in the same period. As a result, these instruments are also not exposed to interest rate risk.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and the income 
statement by the amounts shown above. This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007.

Total interest bearing 9,658 – 9,658 7,231 – 7,231
(iii) Price risk
Commodity price risk
The group is exposed to variability in the price of commodities used in the production or in the packaging of finished products, 
such as the price of malt, barley, sugar and aluminium. These price risks are managed principally through multi year fixed price
contracts with suppliers internationally.
At 31 March 2008 the notional value of commodity derivatives amounted to US$48 million (2007: US$nil). No sensitivity analysis 
has been provided on these outstanding contracts.
Equity securities price risk
The group is exposed to equity securities price risk on investments held by the group and classified on the balance sheet as available
for sale.
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations.
Cash and cash equivalents
The group limits its exposure to financial institutions by setting credit limits on a sliding scale based on credit ratings and generally 
only with counterparties with a credit rating of at least BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Baa3 from Moody’s. For banks with a lower
credit rating, or with no international credit rating, a maximum limit of US$3 million is applied, unless specific approval is obtained 
from either the Chief Financial Officer or the audit committee of the board.
Derivative financial assets 
The group calculates credit exposures on derivatives based on their positive market values and including a percentage of the 
notional amount, representing the potential increased credit risk during the unwind period. This credit exposure is included in the 
overall exposure to financial institutions. The group has ISDA Master Agreements with most of its counterparties for financial derivatives,
which permits net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances, thereby reducing the group’s credit exposure to individual
counterparties.
Trade and other receivables
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the group has a large number of customers which 
are internationally dispersed. The type of customers range from wholesalers and distributors to smaller retailers. The group has
implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence. Credit risk is managed 
by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any one counterparty.
The group considers its maximum credit risk to be $2,760m (2007: $1,900m) which is the total of the group’s financial assets.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
22. Financial risk factors continued
c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The group finances its operations through cash generated by the business and a mixture of short-term and medium-term bank credit
facilities, bank loans, corporate bonds and commercial paper with a range of maturity dates. In this way, the group ensures that it is 
not overly reliant on any particular liquidity source and that maturities of borrowings sourced in this way are not overly concentrated.
Subsidiaries have access to local bank credit facilities, but are principally funded by the group.
The group has the following core lines of credit that are available for general corporate purposes and which are maintained 
by SABMiller plc:
■ US$2,000 million committed facility maturing in December 2012. 
■ US$1,000 million committed facility maturing in September 2008, including the right of the company to term out any amounts 
drawn for a maximum period of one year from the date of maturity of the facility.
Liquidity risk faced by the group is mitigated by having diverse sources of finance available to it and by maintaining substantial 
unutilised banking facilities and reserve borrowing capacity, as indicated by the level of undrawn facilities.
Subsequent to the year end, the SABMiller plc put in place a new committed facility of US$1,000 million with a final maturity date 
of 30 June 2009 and a new three-year committed facility totalling US$600 million.
Including the new facilities arranged subsequent to the year end, borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities amounted 
to US$2,822 million.
The table below analyses the group’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based 
on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual

Capital management
The capital structure of the group consists of net borrowings and shareholders’ equity. 
Besides the statutory minimum capitalisation rules that may apply to subsidiaries in different countries, the group is not subject 
to any externally imposed capital requirements. 
The group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
the future development of the business.
The group is currently rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, both with stable outlook.
Key credit metrics that underpin the group’s rating are reviewed by the treasury committee on a quarterly basis. Financial covenants
included in the group’s core bank facilities were complied with throughout the year.

Derivatives designated as hedging instruments
(i) Fair value hedges
The group has entered into several interest rate swaps to pay floating and receive fixed interest which have been designated as fair
value hedges to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate borrowings. The borrowings and the interest rate swaps
have the same critical terms.
As at 31 March 2008, the notional amount of these interest rate swaps was US$1,100 million (2007: US$1,100 million). The fixed interest
rates received vary from 5.5% to 6.625% (2007: 5.5% to 6.625%) and floating interest rates paid vary from LIBOR plus 71.6 basis points
to LIBOR plus 131.75 basis points (2007: LIBOR plus 71.6 basis points to LIBOR plus 131.75 basis points) on the notional amount.
As at 31 March 2008, the carrying value of the hedged borrowings was US$1,215 million (2007: US$1,117 million).

Demerged entities and litigation
During the year ended 31 March 1998, the group recognised a provision of US$117 million for the disposal of certain demerged entities
in relation to equity injections which were not regarded as recoverable, as well as potential liabilities arising on warranties and the sale
agreements. During the year ended 31 March 2008, US$0.3 million of this provision was further utilised in regard to costs associated
with SAB Ltd’s previously disposed of remaining retail interests. The residual balance of US$16 million relates mainly to the disposal of
OK Bazaars (1929) Ltd to Shoprite Holdings Ltd (Shoprite). As disclosed in previous annual reports, a number of claims were made by
Shoprite in relation to the valuation of the net assets of OK Bazaars at the time of the sale and for alleged breaches by SAB Ltd of
warranties contained in the sale agreements. These claims are being contested by SAB Ltd.
While a full provision for all claims has already been made, the actual outcome of the dispute and the timing of the resolution cannot 
be estimated by the directors at this time. The further information ordinarily required by IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and
contingent assets has not been disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the dispute.
There are US$27 million (2007: US$21 million) of provisions in respect of outstanding litigation within various operations, based on
management expectation the outcomes of these disputes are expected to be resolved within the forthcoming five years.
Post-retirement benefits
The provision for post-retirement benefits represents the provision for medical benefits for retired employees and their dependants in
South Africa, for post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their dependants in North America, and
pension provisions for employees in North and South America, South Africa, Europe and Africa and Asia. The principal assumptions 
on which these provisions are based are disclosed in note 30.

24. Provisions continued
Insurance
Insurance provisions of US$29 million (2007: US$34 million) represent amounts provided in respect of claims made by employees 
for health insurance and work-related accidents. Management estimates that the provision will be substantially utilised in the next one 
to two years.
Taxation-related
The group has recognised various provisions in relation to taxation exposures it believes may arise. The provisions principally relate to
non-corporate taxation and interest and penalties on corporate taxation in respect of a number of group companies. Any settlement 
in respect of these amounts will occur as and when the assessments are finalised with the respective tax authorities.
Onerous contracts
The group has made provision for certain contracts which are deemed to be onerous. The provisions are expected to be utilised within 
the year.
Restructuring
This includes provision for restructuring costs primarily related to Europe which management expects to be utilised within one year.
Other provisions
Included within other provisions are payroll related provisions of US$21 million (2007: US$38 million) which includes US$9 million 
(2007: US$9 million) within South Africa relating to employee long service awards. These are expected to be utilised on an ongoing
basis when the service awards fall due.

Rights and restrictions relating to share capital
Convertible participating shares
Altria is entitled to require the company to convert its ordinary shares into convertible participating shares so as to ensure that Altria’s
voting shareholding, if Altria so chooses, does not exceed 24.99% of the total voting shareholding.
If such an event occurs, the convertible participating shares will rank pari passu with the ordinary shares and the non-voting convertible
shares in all respects and no action shall be taken by the company in relation to ordinary shares unless the same action is taken in
respect of the convertible participating shares and the non-voting convertible shares. On distribution of the profits (whether by cash
dividend, dividend in specie, scrip dividend, capitalisation issue or otherwise), the convertible participating shares will rank pari passu
with the ordinary shares and the non-voting convertible shares. On a return of capital (whether winding-up or otherwise), the convertible
participating shares will rank pari passu with the ordinary shares and the non-voting convertible shares.
Altria shall be entitled to vote its convertible participating shares at general meetings of the company on a poll on the basis of one-tenth
of a vote for every convertible participating share on all resolutions other than a resolution:
(i) proposed by any person other than Altria, to wind-up the company;
(ii) proposed by any person other than Altria, to appoint an administrator or to approve any arrangement with the company’s creditors;
(iii) proposed by the board, to sell all or substantially all of the undertaking of the company; or
(iv) proposed by any person other than Altria, to alter any of the class rights attaching to the convertible participating shares or to
approve the creation of any new class of shares, in which case Altria shall be entitled on a poll to vote on the resolution on the basis
of one vote for each convertible participating share, but, for the purposes of any resolution other than a resolution mentioned above,
the convertible participating shares shall be treated as being of the same class as the ordinary shares and no separate meeting or
resolution of the holders of the convertible participating shares shall be required to be convened or passed.
Upon a transfer of convertible participating shares by Altria other than to an affiliate, such convertible participating shares shall convert
into ordinary shares.
Altria shall be entitled to require the company to convert its convertible participating shares into ordinary shares if:
(i) a third party has made a takeover offer for the company and (if such offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects)
it would result in the voting shareholding of the third party being more than 30% of the total voting shareholding; and
(ii) Altria has communicated to the company in writing its intention not itself to make an offer competing with such third party offer,
provided that the conversion date shall be no earlier than the date on which the third party’s offer becomes or is declared
unconditional in all respects.
Altria shall be entitled to require the company to convert its convertible participating shares into ordinary shares if the voting
shareholding of a third party should be more than 24.99%, provided that:
(i) the number of ordinary shares held by Altria following such conversion shall be limited to one ordinary share more than the number 
of ordinary shares held by the third party; and
(ii) such conversion shall at no time result in Altria’s voting shareholding being equal to or greater than the voting shareholding which
would require Altria to make a mandatory offer in terms of rule 9 of the City Code.
If Altria wishes to acquire additional ordinary shares (other than pursuant to a pre-emptive issue of new ordinary shares or with the 
prior approval of the board), Altria shall first convert into ordinary shares the lesser of:
(i) such number of convertible participating shares as would result in Altria’s voting shareholding being such percentage as would, in
the event of Altria subsequently acquiring one additional ordinary share, require Altria to make a mandatory offer in terms of rule 9 
of the City Code; and
(ii) all of its remaining convertible participating shares.
The company shall use its best endeavours to procure that the ordinary shares arising on conversion of the convertible participating
shares and the non-voting convertible shares are admitted to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s market for
listed securities, admitted to listing and trading on the JSE Securities Exchange South Africa, and admitted to listing and trading on any
other stock exchange upon which the ordinary shares are from time to time listed and traded, but no admission to listing or trading shall
be sought for the convertible participating shares or the non-voting convertible shares whilst they remain convertible participating shares
or non-voting convertible shares (as the case may be).
Non-voting convertible shares
Safari Limited (Safari) holds non-voting convertible shares of 10 US cents each. Safari shall not be entitled to vote its non-voting
convertible shares on any resolution other than a resolution to alter any of the class rights attaching to the non-voting convertible
shares, in which case Safari shall be entitled to vote on the resolution on the basis of one vote for each non-voting convertible share.
The non-voting convertible shares rank pari passu with the ordinary shares and the convertible participating shares in all respects and
no action shall be taken by the company in relation to ordinary shares unless the same action is taken in respect of the non-voting
convertible shares and the convertible participating shares. On distribution of the profits (whether by cash dividend, dividend in specie,
scrip dividend, capitalisation issue or otherwise), the non-voting convertible shares rank pari passu with the ordinary shares and the
convertible participating shares. On a return of capital (whether winding-up or otherwise), the non-voting convertible shares each rank
pari passu with the ordinary shares and the convertible participating shares.
The non-voting convertible shares are convertible into ordinary shares on a transfer to a third party unconnected with SABMiller, 
or Altria or any of their affiliates or any person deemed to be acting in concert with SABMiller or Altria.

Deferred shares
The deferred shares do not carry any voting rights and do not entitle holders thereof to receive any dividends or other distributions. 
In the event of a winding up deferred shareholders would receive no more than the nominal value. Deferred shares represent the only
non-equity share capital of the group.
Ordinary shares 
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the company’s report and accounts, attend, speak and vote at general meetings
and appoint proxies to exercise voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may also receive a dividend (subject to the provisions of the
company’s articles of association) and on winding up of the company may share in the assets of the company.

f) International Employee Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Scheme
During the year the International Employee Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme was modified such that all outstanding shares are 
now equity-settled rather than cash-settled. Prior to this modification the group issued to certain employees SAR that require the 
group to pay the intrinsic value of the SAR to the employee at the date of the exercise. The group has recorded a liability of US$nil
(2007: US$48 million) in respect of the SAR scheme.
The intrinsic value of liabilities which have vested at 31 March 2008 is US$ nil (2007: US$16 million).

Share-based payments have been valued using a binomial model approach except for the Performance Share awards which have been
valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
The Monte Carlo simulation methodology is necessary for valuing share-based payments with Total Shareholder Return performance
hurdles. This is achieved by projecting SABMIller plc’s share price forwards, together with those of companies in the same comparator
group, over the vesting period and/or life of the options after considering their respective volatilities.
Weighted average fair value assumptions
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options
granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a binomial model for share options. 
The following weighted average assumptions were used in these option pricing models during the year:
2008 2007
Share price*
– South African schemes (R) 178.02 136.24
– All other schemes (£) 11.95 10.30
Exercise price*
– South African schemes (R) 174.89 136.67
– All other schemes (£) 7.84 8.89
Expected volatility (all schemes)** 22.5% 22.5%
Dividend yield (all schemes) 2.1% 2.1%
Annual forfeiture rate
– South African schemes 7.5% 7.5%
– All other schemes 3.0% 3.0%
Risk-free interest rate
– South African schemes 8.1% 8.0%
– All other schemes 5.1% 4.4%
* The calculation is based on the weighted fair values of issues made during the financial year.
** Expected volatility is calculated by assessing the historic share price data in the United Kingdom and South Africa since May 1999 and May 2001 respectively.

Contracts placed for future expenditure primarily relate to Miller’s various long-term non-cancellable advertising and promotion
commitments which, at 31 March 2008, are principally due between 2008 and 2013.
In addition, Miller has various long-term supply contracts with unrelated third parties to purchase certain materials used in its production
and packaging process. The terms of these contracts generally stipulate that Miller must use the designated suppliers for expected
minimum percentages of its annual purchase requirements of the specified materials. However, Miller is not obliged to make any
purchases unless it requires supplies of such materials. Supply contracts outstanding at 31 March 2008 for malt, bottles, labels and
cans expire between 2008 and 2015.

29. Commitments, contingencies and guarantees continued
(i) Trade loans
Trade loans primarily relate to guarantees given by Royal Grolsch N.V. to banks in relation to loans taken out by trade customers.
(ii) Staff loans and pension guarantees
Staff loans and pension guarantees above primarily relate to the present value of Miller pension guarantees. Miller and Pabst Brewing
Company (Pabst) are responsible for the Milwaukee Brewery Workers’ Pension Plan. In connection with Pabst’s closure of its Milwaukee,
Wisconsin brewery and its contract brewing agreement with Miller, Pabst entered into a withdrawal liability settlement agreement which
requires annual payments by Pabst to this pension plan of approximately US$4 million until 2013. In the event that Pabst is unable to
fulfil its pension plan obligation, the plan would have recourse to all the assets of Pabst and its parent company. If such assets do not
satisfy Pabst’s remaining pension obligation, Miller would be required to fund the remaining Pabst withdrawal liability until 2013.
(iii) Jointly held contingent liability
Bavaria S.A. is jointly and severally liable with Valorem S.A. (part of Santo Domingo Group (SDG)) for the pension obligations of Avianca
S.A. (formerly part of the SDG group but which was sold by SDG in 2004). The maximum obligation is for $150 million which
corresponds to the initial actuarial value of the pensions obligation. At 31 March 2008 no claim has been made against the group in
respect of this obligation.
(iv) Litigation
The group has a number of activities in a wide variety of geographic areas and is subject to certain legal claims incidental to its operations.
In the opinion of the directors, after taking appropriate legal advice, these claims are not expected to have, either individually or in aggregate,
a material adverse effect upon the group’s financial position, except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
The company, with Miller Brewing Company, in common with other participants in the beer and spirits industries in the USA, was a
defendant in putative class action lawsuits alleging that the defendants have intentionally targeted the marketing of certain alcoholic
beverage brands to persons under the legal drinking age. The plaintiffs alleged several causes of action, including violations of state
consumer protection laws, unjust enrichment, negligence, public nuisance, and civil conspiracy. The complaints sought, on behalf of a
putative class of parents and guardians, an injunction to stop certain unspecified marketing practices and unspecified money damages
(including civil fines, punitive damages, and disgorgement of profits). None of the lawsuits progressed past the pleading stage.
Of the nine lawsuits filed, three have been withdrawn and in the remaining six the defendants’ motions to dismiss the cases have been
upheld. In five of these cases, the decisions to dismiss were upheld on appeal. In the sixth, plaintiffs dismissed their appeal.
Other
SABMiller and Altria entered into a tax matters agreement (the Agreement) on 30 May 2002 to regulate the conduct of tax matters
between them with regard to the acquisition of Miller and to allocate responsibility for contingent tax costs. SABMiller has agreed to
indemnify Altria against any taxes, losses, liabilities and costs that Altria incurs arising out of or in connection with a breach by SABMiller
of any representation, agreement or covenant in the Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
The group has exposures to various environmental risks. Although it is difficult to predict the group’s liability with respect to these risks,
future payments, if any, would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material to the group’s financial position,
except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
30. Pensions and post-retirement benefits
The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. These schemes have been designed and are administered 
in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit
schemes. The majority of the schemes are funded and the schemes’ assets are held independently of the group’s finances. Pension
and post-retirement benefit costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Generally, the projected unit method is applied to measure the defined benefit scheme liabilities.
The group also provides medical benefits, which are mainly unfunded, for retired employees and their dependants in South Africa, Miller
and Latin America. Miller provides post-retirement benefits, as well as retiree medical and life insurance benefits, which are unfunded, 
to eligible employees and their dependants. Salaried non-union employees hired after 31 August 2003 are not eligible for company
subsidised retiree medical benefits.
The total pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs recognised in the income statement, and related liabilities on the balance
sheet are as follows:
2008 2007
US$m US$m
Defined contribution scheme costs 94 79
Defined benefit pension plan costs 26 41

30. Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued
The group operates various defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. Details of the main defined benefit schemes 
is provided below: 
Miller pension schemes
The Miller Pension Plan is a single qualified defined benefit scheme covering both salaried non-union and union employees while
maintaining separate benefit structures across the various employee groups. Substantially all salaried non-union employees hired prior
to 1 January 2005 are covered by the plan which provides benefits for this employee group based on final average pay and years of
service. Benefit accruals for salaried non-union employees ceased as of 31 December 2007. Benefit accruals for union employees are
the subject of collective bargaining and are based on a flat rate per year of service. In addition, through negotiations, benefit accruals
have been frozen for some of the union employee groups covered by the plan. As of 31 March 2008, the plan had a deficit of 
US$112 million given plan assets with a fair market value of US$887 million. This represents a funding level of 89%.
Miller has two qualified defined contribution schemes that cover salaried non-union and union employees separately. The plan covering
salaried non-union employees provides a basic company contribution equal to 5% of an employee’s pay along with a one-for-one
company matching contribution up to 4% of an employee’s own contributions. For the plan covering union employees, the company
makes contributions for some of the union groups either through company matching contributions based on the employee’s own
contributions or a flat hourly contribution rate. In addition, substantially all salaried employees are covered by a survivor income benefit
plan and a long-term disability plan.
The company provides non-qualified unfunded defined benefit and defined contribution plans for certain employees whose benefits
under the qualified plans are limited by regulation. As of 31 March 2008 the liabilities for these plans are US$13 million and US$1 million
respectively.
The most recent actuarial valuation of Miller’s post-retirement plan was carried out by independent professionally qualified actuaries at 
1 January 2007 using the projected unit credit method.
Certain of Miller’s hourly employees participate in the Milwaukee Brewery Workers’ Pension Plan. As part of a withdrawal settlement,
Pabst, which had participated in the plan prior to 1997, agreed to make annual contributions of approximately US$4 million to this plan
until 2013. The plan’s funded status net of the present value of Pabst’s withdrawal payments at 31 March 2008 is set out below.

South Africa pension schemes
The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout South Africa. Details of the major scheme are provided below:
The ABI pension fund Suncrush Pension Fund and Suncrush Retirement Fund are funded schemes of the defined benefit type based
on average salary with assets held in separately administered funds. The latest valuation of these funds was carried out at 31 March
2008 by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The liabilities were based on the transfer values of the active
members and surplus allocated to the members, former members and pensioners as at 31 March 2008.
From 1 July 2005 the funds were closed, all active members were transferred to either the ABI Provident Fund or the SAB Staff
Provident Fund. The funds will be deregistered and liquidated once all assets and liabilities have been settled.
The surplus apportionment scheme for the ABI Pension Fund has been approved by the Financial Services Board. Approval for 
the surplus apportionment scheme for the Suncrush Pension Fund and Suncrush Retirement Fund is still outstanding. With regards to
the apportionment of the ABI Pension Fund surplus, in the current year the employer received their share of the surplus. The surplus
due to the members, former members and pensioners is yet to be distributed.
Bavaria pension schemes
The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout Latin America. Details of the major scheme are provided below:
The Colombian Labour Code Pension Plan is an unfunded scheme of the defined benefit type and covers all salaried and hourly
employees in Colombia who are not covered by social security or who have at least 10 years of service prior to 1 January 1967. The plan
is financed entirely through company reserves and there are no external assets. The most recent actuarial valuation of the Colombian
Labour Code Pension Plan was carried out by independent professionally qualified actuaries at 31 December 2006 using the projected
unit credit method. All salaried employees are now covered by the Social Security provisions. The principal economic assumptions used
in the preparation of the pension valuations are set out below and take into consideration changes in the Colombian economy. 
Grolsch pension scheme
The Grolsch pension plan, named Stichting Pensioenfonds van de Grolsche Bierbrouwerij, is a funded scheme of the defined benefit
type, based on average salary with assets held in separately administered funds. The latest valuation of the Royal Grolsch pension fund
was carried out at 31 March 2008 by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The principal assumptions used in
the valuation are listed below. The breakdown of the plan assets, based on the data as at 31 January 2008, is approximately 57% in
bonds, 37% in equity and 6% in real estate.

The expected long-term rate of return on Miller fund assets is 8%. This is determined by considering the weighted expected return of
each asset class within the fund, based on input from both Russell Investments, the Miller Pension Plan’s investment manager and Hewitt
Associates, the Plan’s actuary. All funds are actively managed and returns are based on both the expected performance of the asset
class and the performance of fund managers.

In respect of South Africa, the pension asset recognised must be limited to the extent that the employer is able to recover a surplus 
either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme. The limit has been set equal to nil as the 
surplus apportionment exercise required in terms of the South African legislation has not yet been performed. In addition, the net
income statement gain of US$4 million (2007: charge of US$43 million) and net actuarial loss taken directly to equity of US$21 million
(2007: gain of US$27 million) are not recognised in the financial statements.

The group comprises a large number of companies. The list above only includes those subsidiary undertakings which materially affect
the profit or net assets of the group, or a business segment, together with the principal intermediate holding companies of the group.
With the exception of the companies noted in (4) above, the principal country in which each of the above subsidiary undertakings
operates is the same as the country in which each is incorporated.
Where the group’s nominal interest in the equity share capital of an undertaking is less than 50%, the basis on which the undertaking 
is a subsidiary undertaking of the group is as follows:
African operations
The group’s effective interest in its African operations was diluted as a result of the disposal of a 38% interest in SABMiller Africa BV 
on 1 April 2001, in exchange for a 20% interest in the Castel group’s African beverage interests. The operations continue to be
consolidated due to SABMiller Africa BV’s majority shareholdings, and ability to control the operations.
Botswana Breweries (Pty) Ltd and Kgalagadi Breweries (Pty) Ltd
SABMiller Africa holds a 40% interest in each of Botswana Breweries (Pty) Ltd and Kgalagadi Breweries (Pty) Ltd with the remaining
60% interest in each held by Sechaba Brewery Holdings Ltd. SABMiller Africa’s shares entitle the holder to twice the voting rights of
those shares held by Sechaba Brewery Holdings Ltd. SABMiller Africa’s 10.1% indirect interest (2007: 10.1%) is held via a 16.8%
interest (2007: 16.8%) in Sechaba Brewery Holdings Ltd.
Lesotho Brewing Company (Pty) Ltd (Lesotho Brewing)
SABMiller Africa holds a 39% interest in Lesotho Brewing with the remaining interest held by a government authority, the Lesotho
National Development Corporation (51%), and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (10%). Lesotho Brewing is treated as 
a subsidiary undertaking based on the group’s ability to control its operations through its board representation. The day-to-day 
business operations are managed in accordance with a management agreement with Bevman Services AG, a group company.

Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 134 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors
have prepared the parent company financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice). The parent company financial statements are required
by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company for that year.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
■ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
■ state that the consolidated financial statements comply 
with applicable UK Accounting Standards; and
■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the 
above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration
Report comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In addition, the Companies Act 1985 requires directors to provide
the company’s auditors with every opportunity to take whatever
steps and undertake whatever inspections the auditors consider
to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their
audit report. The directors, having made appropriate enquiries,
confirm that:
■ so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
■ each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have
taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
The directors’ responsibilities for publishing the company
accounts on the internet are stated on page 60.

the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having
been audited.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements 
of SABMiller plc for the year ended 31 March 2008. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent company
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared 
for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that
specific information presented in the Operating and Financial
Review and the Ordinary Shareholding Analyses that is cross
referred from the principal activities and business review and 
the substantial shareholdings sections of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, 
as described in the contents, and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited parent company financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments 
made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ the parent company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as 
at 31 March 2008;
■ the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985; and
■ the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Notes to the company financial statements
a) Statement of compliance
SABMiller plc (the company) is a public limited company
incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales.
The company financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, as modified for the revaluation of
financial instruments, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom
(UK GAAP). A summary of the significant company accounting
policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where
changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption 
of new accounting standards in the year.
The company has not presented a cash flow statement or
provided details of related party transactions as permitted under
FRS 1 (revised) (Cash Flow Statements) and FRS 8 (Related 
Party Disclosures) respectively.
b) Investments in subsidiary undertakings
These comprise investments in shares and loans that the 
directors intend to hold on a continuing basis in the company’s
business. The investments are stated at cost less provisions for
impairment. A review for the potential impairment of an investment
is carried out if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
Such impairment reviews are performed in accordance with 
FRS 11.
c) Foreign currencies
The financial statements are presented in US dollars which is the
company’s functional and presentational currency. 
The South African Rand (ZAR) and British Pound (GBP) exchange
rates to US Dollar used in preparing the company financial
statements were as follows:
Weighted average rate Closing rate
ZAR GBP ZAR GBP
Year ended 31 March 2007 7.06 1.89 7.29 1.97
Year ended 31 March 2008 7.13 2.01 8.15 1.98
Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date with the
resultant translation differences being included in operating profit,
other than those arising on financial liabilities which are recorded
within net finance costs.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost
in a foreign currency are translated at the rate of exchange ruling
at the date of the transaction. All other non-monetary items
denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the rate of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
d) Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets under
construction. In respect of all other tangible fixed assets,
depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated
to write off the cost or valuation, less the estimated residual value
of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Office equipment and software 2-30 years
Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of the lease term or 
50 years
The company regularly reviews its depreciation rates to take
account of any changes in circumstances. When setting useful
economic lives, the principal factors the company takes into
account are the expected rate of technological developments,
expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity
at which the assets are expected to be used. The profit or loss 
on the sale of an asset is the difference between the disposal
proceeds and the net book value, including any revaluation, of 
the asset.
e) Impairment
In accordance with FRS 11 (Impairment of fixed assets and
goodwill), fixed assets are subject to an impairment review if
circumstances or events change to indicate that the carrying 
value may not be fully recoverable. The review is performed by
comparing the carrying value of the fixed asset to its recoverable
amount, being the higher of the net realisable value and value in
use. The net realisable value is considered to be the amount that
could be obtained on disposal of the asset. The value in use 
of the asset is determined by discounting, at a market based
discount rate, the expected future cash flows resulting from its
continued use, including those arising from its final disposal. 
When the carrying values of fixed assets are written down by 
any impairment amount, the loss is recognised in the profit 
and loss account in the period in which it is incurred. Should
circumstances or events change and give rise to a reversal of a
previous impairment loss, the reversal is recognised in the profit
and loss account in the period in which it occurs and the carrying
value of the asset is increased.
The increase in the carrying value of the asset will only be up to
the amount that it would have been had the original impairment
not occurred. For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews,
income generating units are considered to be the lowest groups
of assets and liabilities that generate income, and are largely
independent of other income streams. They also include those
assets and liabilities directly involved in producing the income 
and a suitable proportion of those used to produce more than 
one income stream.
f) Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recorded at 
fair value (plus any directly attributable transactions costs 
where applicable). For those financial instruments that are not
subsequently held at fair value, the company assesses whether
there is any objective evidence of impairment at each balance
sheet date.
Financial assets are recognised when the company has rights or
other access to economic benefits. Such assets consist of cash,
equity instruments, a contractual right to receive cash or another
financial asset, or a contractual right to exchange financial
instruments with another entity on potentially favourable terms.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash
flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred and
the company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards 
of ownership.
1. Accounting policies 138 Notes to the company financial statements
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Notes to the company financial statements 
continued
Financial liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation to
transfer benefits and that obligation is a contractual liability to
deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial
instruments with another entity on potentially unfavourable terms.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished,
that is discharged, cancelled or expired. If a legally enforceable
right exists to set off recognised amounts of financial assets 
and liabilities, which are in determinable monetary amounts, 
the relevant financial assets and liabilities are offset. Interest 
costs are charged against income in the year in which they
accrue. Premiums or discounts arising from the difference
between the net proceeds of financial instruments purchased 
or issued and the amounts receivable or repayable at maturity 
are included in the effective interest calculation and taken to net
interest payable over the life of the instrument.
(i) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They arise when the company provides money, goods 
or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the
receivable. They are included in current assets, except for
maturities of greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date
which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables
are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Investments in this category are initially recognised at fair value
including originating fees and transaction costs, and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method
less provision for impairment.
(ii) Trade debtors
Trade debtors are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for
impairment. A provision for impairment of trade debtors is
established when there is objective evidence that the company 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
terms of the receivables. The impairment is recognised in the
income statement.
(iii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank deposits
repayable on demand, other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Term deposits with
maturities of more than three months are shown as term deposits
on the balance sheet. Bank overdrafts are shown within creditors
– amounts falling due within one year.
(iv) Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are financial
instruments whose value changes in response to an underlying
variable, require little or no initial investment and are settled in 
the future.
These include derivatives embedded in host contracts. Such
embedded derivatives need not be accounted for separately if the
host contract is already fair valued, if it would not be considered
as a derivative if it was freestanding, or if it can be demonstrated
that it is closely related to the host contract. There are certain
currency exemptions which the company has applied to these
rules which limit the need to account for certain potential
embedded foreign exchange derivatives. These are: if a contract 
is denominated in the functional currency of either party; where
that currency is commonly used in international trade of the 
good traded; or if it is commonly used for local transactions 
in an economic environment.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are analysed between
current and non-current assets and liabilities on the face of the
balance sheet, depending on when they are expected to mature.
For derivatives that have not been designated to a hedging
relationship, all fair value movements are recognised immediately
in the income statement. See note k for the company’s
accounting policy on hedge accounting.
(v) Trade creditors
Trade creditors are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade creditors are analysed between current and non-current
liabilities on the face of the balance sheet, depending on when 
the obligation to settle will be realised.
(vi) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction
costs and are subsequently stated at amortised cost and include
accrued interest and prepaid interest. Borrowings are classified as
current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to
defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months from the
balance sheet date.
(vii) Financial guarantees
FRS 26 (Amendment) requires that issued financial guarantees,
other than those previously asserted by the entity to be insurance
contracts, are to be initially recognised at their fair value and
subsequently measured at the higher of the amount initially
recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised and the
amount determined in accordance with FRS 12 ‘Provisions
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’.
Financial guarantee contracts are defined in FRS 26 as contracts
that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse
the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to
make payment when due in accordance with the original or
modified terms of a debt instrument. 
g) Revenue recognition 
(i) Interest income 
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the
effective interest method.
(ii) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment
is established.
h) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax
in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred
at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable
taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses
and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences
can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are
expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
1. Accounting policies continued Notes to the company financial statements 139
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
i) Dividend distributions
In accordance with FRS 21, dividend distributions to equity
holders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements 
of the company in the period in which the dividends are approved 
by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised
when paid. Dividends declared after the balance sheet date are
not recognised, as there is no present obligation at the balance
sheet date.
j) Share-based compensation
The company operates several equity-settled share-based
compensation schemes. These include option plans (with and
without non-market performance conditions attached).
In accordance with FRS 20, an expense is recognised to spread
the fair value of each award granted after 7 November 2002 
over the vesting period on a straight-line basis, after allowing for
an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest. This
expense is offset by a corresponding adjustment made to equity
over the remaining vesting period. The estimate of the level of
vesting is reviewed at least annually, with any impact on the
cumulative charge being recognised immediately. The charge 
is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, 
as calculated by binomial model calculations.
The charge is not reversed if the options have not been 
exercised because the market value of the shares is lower than
the option price at the date of grant. The proceeds received net 
of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share 
capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options 
are exercised.
The issuance by the company to its subsidiaries of a grant over
the company’s options represents additional capital contributions
by the company in its subsidiaries, except to the extent the
company is reimbursed. An additional investment in subsidiaries
results in a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity. The
additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the
grant issued allocated over the underlying grant’s vesting period.
k) Hedge accounting
The derivative instruments used by the company, which are 
used solely for hedging purposes (i.e. to offset foreign exchange
and interest rate risks), comprise interest rate swaps and forward
foreign exchange contracts. Such derivative instruments are 
used to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure 
of the company in line with the company’s risk management
policies. The company also has derivatives embedded in other
contracts, primarily cross border foreign currency supply contracts
forraw materials. 
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-
measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of 
the hedging relationship. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the company is required
to document the relationship between the hedged item and the
hedging instrument. The company is also required to document
and demonstrate that the relationship between the hedged 
item and the hedging instrument will be highly effective. This
effectiveness test is re-performed at each period end to ensure
that the hedge has remained and will continue to remain 
highly effective.
The company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the 
fair of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair
value hedge). Interest costs are charged against income in the
year in which they accrue. Premiums or discounts arising from 
the difference between the net proceeds of financial instruments
purchased or issued and the amounts receivable or repayable 
at maturity are included in the effective interest calculation and
taken to net interest payable over the life of the instrument.
(i) Fair value hedges
Fair value hedges comprise derivative financial instruments
designated in a hedging relationship to manage the company’s
interest rate risk to which the fair value of certain assets and
liabilities are exposed. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
offset the relevant changes in the fair value of the underlying
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the profit and 
loss account in the period incurred. Gains or losses on fair value
hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recorded in the
profit and loss account together with the gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Where a derivative ceases to meet the criteria of being a hedging
instrument or the underlying exposure which it is hedging is sold,
matures or is extinguished, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Certain derivative instruments, while providing effective economic
hedges under the company’s policies, are not designated as
hedges. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments
that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges are
recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. The
company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for speculative purposes.
Details of the group’s financial risk management objectives 
and policies are provided on pages 39 and 40.
(ii) Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges comprise derivative financial instruments
designated in a hedging relationship to manage currency risk 
to which the cash flows of certain liabilities are exposed. The
effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that
is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting is recognised 
as a separate component of equity. The ineffective portion is
recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts
accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the
period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. However,
where a forecasted transaction results in a non-financial asset or
liability, the accumulated fair value movements previously deferred
in equity are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.
l) Operating leases
Rentals paid on operating leases are charged to the profit and
loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
m) Pension obligations
The company operates a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions to this scheme are charged to the profit and loss
account as incurred.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2008
An explanation of some of the terms and abbreviations used 
in this annual report is shown below.
Financial definitions
Adjusted earnings
Adjusted earnings are calculated by adjusting headline earnings
for the amortisation of intangible assets (excluding software),
integration and reorganisation costs and the fair value movements
in relation to capital items for which hedge accounting cannot be
applied. The tax and minority interests in respect of these items
are also adjusted.
Adjusted profit before tax (Clean PBT)
This is defined as profit before tax and exceptional items and
includes the share of post-tax results of associates (before
exceptional items).
CAGR
The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is the average
compounded growth rate recorded over a series of years for 
a particular metric such as volume or revenue.
Constant currency
Constant currency results have been determined by translating
the local currency denominated results for the year ended 
31 March at the exchange rates for the comparable period 
in the prior year.
EBITA
This comprises operating profit before exceptional items,
amortisation of intangible assets excluding software and 
includes the group’s share of associates’ operating profit 
on a similar basis.
EBITA margin (%)
This is calculated by expressing EBITA as a percentage of group
revenue (including share of associates’ revenue).
EBITDA
Earnings Before Interest Taxation Depreciation and Amortisation 
of intangibles excluding software (EBITDA). This comprises the 
net cash generated from operations before working capital
movements.
EBITDA margin (%)
This is calculated on a pre-exceptional basis, by expressing
EBITDA as a percentage of revenue (excluding share of
associates’ revenue).
Effective tax rate (%) 
This is calculated by expressing total taxation (including share of
associates’ tax), excluding tax on exceptional items (both group
and share of associates’) and tax on amortisation of intangible
assets (excluding software), as a percentage of profit before tax,
exceptional items, items of a capital nature and amortisation 
of intangible assets (excluding software) and including share 
of operating profit of associates and including their share of net
finance costs (before tax, minority interest and exceptional items).
Net asset value per share 
This is calculated by expressing shareholders’ funds as 
a percentage of the closing number of shares in issue.
Return on equity (%)
This is calculated by expressing adjusted earnings as 
a percentage of total shareholders’ equity.
TSR
Total shareholder return (TSR) is the measure of the returns that 
a company has provided for its shareholders, reflecting share
price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.
Volumes
In the determination and disclosure of reported sales volumes, 
the group aggregates the volumes of all consolidated subsidiaries
and its equity-accounted associates, other than associates where
primary responsibility for day-to-day management rests with
others such as Castel and Distell. In these latter cases, the
financial results of operations are equity accounted in terms 
of IFRS but volumes are excluded. Although contract brewing
volumes are excluded from total volumes, turnover from 
contract brewing is included within group turnover.
Non-financial definitions
Combined Code
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance, published 
by the UK Financial Reporting Council.
Economy segment
Taking an index where the bulk of the market volume is at a price
index of 100, the economy sector would index at around 85.
Normally, all brands in this segment will be local brands. In the
beer market, the economy segment is usually dominated by 
local brands.
FAB
Flavoured alcoholic beverage. A ready-mixed alcoholic drink, 
often containing some form of fruit flavouring. ‘FAB’ also stands
for fruit alcohol beverage which specifically refers to a ready-mixed
alcoholic drink containing fruit flavouring as opposed to non-fruit
flavouring such as caramel.
International brewers index
The index of International brewers charts the share price
progression of an index of the company’s closest peers in the
global brewing industry (Anheuser-Busch, Carlsberg, Heineken,
Inbev and MolsonCoors) relative to 1 April 2003. The index is
weighted relative to the market capitalisation of the brewers 
as at 1 April 2003.
Mainstream segment
Mainstream represents the group of brands that constitute the
bulk of the market volume at a price index of 100. Key to this
group is the leading volume brand in any market. Mainstream
brands tend to be local.
Organic growth
Refers to a company’s growth rate, excluding the effects from,
acquisitions or disposals.
PET
PET is short for polyethylene terephthalate, a form of plastic 
which is used for bottling alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.
Premium segment (worthmore segment in the US)
The premium segment is dominated by international brands. 
They are brands which consumers perceive to offer greater value
than mainstream brands and for which they are willing to pay a
premium. Mainstream brands are priced at about a price index 
of 100 and premium brands index at around 120 and above. As 
a result, the premium segment, although small in volume terms,
often generates a disproportionate level of profit, when compared
to the mainstream and economy segments.
STRATE

STRATE
Dealings and settlements on the JSE Limited (JSE) are now exclusively in electronic form through the STRATE system such that share
certificates are no longer good for delivery on that exchange. Shareholders resident in South Africa who currently retain their share
certificates and who may wish to deal on the JSE are advised to contact Computershare Johannesburg or their professional adviser
regarding the options available to enable them to do so through the STRATE system. 
Unsolicited investment advice – warning to shareholders
The Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) In the United Kingdom have
published a joint warning to shareholders:
Over the last year, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target shareholders offering 
to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. 
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and a 2006 survey by the FSA has reported that the average amount lost 
by investors is around £20,000. It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way; many of the victims had been
successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a discount or offers of free reports into the company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
■ Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation
■ Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved. You can check at www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk
■ The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors and any
approach from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date and any other appropriate
action can be considered. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form at:
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.s
■ Inform our Registrar’s Compliance Department by email: ssd@capitaregistrars.com
Details of any sharedealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in company mailings.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found on the FSA website www.fsa.gov.uk/consumer/
A new multi-agency operation was launched in January 2007 to target boiler room scams and to gather information from 
consumers who have been approached by or been a victim of boiler room operators. 
Operation Archway, an initiative by the City of London police, combines resources from the FSA, the Serious Fraud Office, 
the Serious Organised Crime Agency and every police force in the country.
To report any approaches made by suspected boiler rooms to the FSA consumer helpline please e-mail 
operationarchway@city-of-london.pnn.police.uk or ring 0845 606 1234.
South African shareholders may report such approaches to the Financial Services Board (FSB) on:

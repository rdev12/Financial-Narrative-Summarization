Financial Performance Summary
229432 Security Research AR pp01-pp07  23/07/2013  15:48  Page 2 Another year of strong turnover and excellent profit figures have been
achieved, although slightly down on last year. This year’s turnover at
£29,363,893 and last year’s at £37,272,645 were substantially better than
historical levels.
Profit before tax and exceptional items for the year was £6,682,042 compared
with a profit before tax and exceptional items of £12,070,793 in the prior year .
The substantial level of profits earned during the period is due to the
application of engineering, manufacturing and sales techniques in supplying
world beating products.
Shareholders will no doubt have welcomed the £15,191,577 returned to them
through two share buy backs in the year which, together with £3,083,155
returned to them in the previous year, equates to  £18,274,732, amounting to
94p per share based on the 19.4 million shares currently in issue. £5.4 million
cash was retained at the year end.
A two year MOD contract came to an end with all equipment delivered,
approved and accepted by this exacting customer.  Product deployment in
December 2012 was a satisfying end to two years of dedicated work. However,
changes in operational requirements for overseas forces, the impending
withdrawal of ISAF forces from Afghanistan and the change in tactics employed
by insurgents have resulted in a substantial reduction in the deployment of
our innovative and unique detector at present.
The Specialist Electronics Division has now been able to concentrate its
resource and effort on developing new products and markets, and to place
emphasis on a global sales drive. Reference is made in the financial statements
to a number of innovative devices having unique selling points. These products
are predominantly for use in non‐conflict situations and are being marketed
in the UK and in a number of other selected countries.
At the annual Distributor Conference held in Corby in April 2013, attended by
more than 30 Distributors from across the globe, these products were
launched and enthusiastically received.  
Property Information Services (PSG) and Packaging Solutions (Moore & Buckle)
both had a profitable year. 
We are grateful to the outstanding commitment and loyalty of our employees
who have been substantially responsible for the excellent achievements.
The Specialist Electronics Division is our main focus as it redevelops and re‐
energises its core marketplace supported by a dynamic marketing strategy.
The positive response it is receiving from potential customers can be attributed
to the rapid and cooperative dovetailing of the sales and engineering teams.
We look forward to reporting to shareholders the results of these initiatives in
due course.
Jonathan Mervis, Chairman                                                                 23 July 2013

The past year has seen changes to the Senior Management Team in the
Specialist Electronics Division.  
Damian Rowbotham, previously Finance Director for ComfortDelGro’s UK &
Ireland businesses, joined us in April 2012 as the Managing Director of Audiotel
International. In addition, Barney Hubble who was critical to the success of the
recent MOD contract, was appointed to the board as Business Development
Director during the year.  
Julie Brown (Resources Director) retired after 17 years dedicated service to
Audiotel and in recent months Debbie Braybrook (Finance Director) has moved
on to pastures new as part of a major re‐organisation of the team.  
We now have a stronger, more broadly experienced and focussed sales team
moving forward, which under the direction of the new Senior Management
Team, will bring the recently launched products to the global marketplace in
the current year.
During the MOD contract we operated from two separate premises in Corby,
but have recently merged all our operations in one centre.  This provides a
fully modern, well equipped factory and office complex ready to take on the
new challenges that will be presented in the years to come.
The end of the MOD contract has seen serious downsizing of the production
team and I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those staff who were
employed with us for their dedicated service during the last two years.
Property Information Services
The PSG team based in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, have performed well under
the supervision of Andrea Glover (Managing Director) in a very challenging
marketplace.
The PSG Franchisee Network continues to promote and market a
comprehensive selection of legal reports and services under the online PSG
Connect banner.  The unique combination of a truly national supplier with a
‘local’ service is the envy of its competitors.  
Packaging Solutions
The small Moore & Buckle team based in St Helens have remained stable and
continue to perform profitably in a niche marketplace.

2013 was a year of two distinct parts for the Specialist Electronics Division.
The first part was all about delivery when the entire Division, and in particular
the production and technical teams, rose to the challenge of successfully
delivering the MOD contract, on time and on budget.  The second part was
focused on raising the company and brand profile, achieved through sales and
marketing activity and a raft of new product releases. The rebranding activity
and product innovation were very well received by our distribution network
and customer base. Turnover for the year was £23,566,245 compared with
£31,281,262 in the prior year. The operating profit before exceptional items
for the year was £6,765,220 compared with  an operating profit  before
exceptional items of £11,635,491 in the prior year.
Product and Technical Leadership
The conclusion of the MOD contract during the year allowed the technical
team to focus their expertise on new product development. The results have
been especially pleasing with our latest releases being not only world beating
in terms of performance, but also unique in their application. Our NLJD
Archway for electronics detection, a world first, has attracted a great deal of
interest, most significantly in Asia and Eastern Europe. Our new portable
Meeting Guard, released earlier this year, provides 24/7 real‐time protection
from eavesdropping, with remote monitoring if required, and once again is a
unique proposition generating a great deal of interest. We have a clear
roadmap for technical development with a range of innovative products in the
pipeline, which we are extremely excited about, and we continue to invest in
focused research to help preserve technical leadership in our field.
Manufacturing Excellence
Quality remains at the heart of our business and our global reputation has
certainly been strengthened through our work with the UK Government.
Following contract completion, the production team numbers were reduced,
but fortunately we were able to retain the most skilled and flexible staff for
the business going forward. Our capability has been substantially enhanced
over the last few years, with both facilities and skills markedly better . We now
boast the flexibility to be able to manufacture both highly complex low volume
electronic products and high volume batches as required. 
Sales Development 
One of our recent goals was to raise the division’s profile globally. This activity
commenced in earnest with a rebranding exercise, new marketing collateral and
importantly a refreshed website. These were successfully launched to our global
network of distributors in April 2013, together with our latest products and
technical roadmap. The distribution network has been energised by the speed
and quality of product development activity and also welcomed our increased
dynamism in supporting their sales efforts.

Effectively locating concealed electronic devices.
The new Superbroom (SB) range is our latest advance in lightweight powerful
Non‐Linear Junction Detector (NLJD) technology.
A versatile device which incorporates the best elements from our 35 years of
developing NLJDs. SB is available in a range of output powers, 2W , 4W and 10W .
An Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) variant is also available, which
incorporates a metal detector for increased target detection and discrimination.
Archway
Detecting concealed items. 
The Archway is the future in Intellectual Property theft protection. Specifically
designed using the advanced technology of Non‐Linear Junction Detection, it
is able to detect concealed devices even if they are turned off.
Suitable for detecting a wide range of electronic components and devices
including mobile phones, SIM cards, USB memory sticks, listening and recording
devices or cameras.
The Archway can be used as a conventional security‐style archway or, for a more
discreet approach, it can be supplied as a single panel. The versatility of the
Archway makes it an essential part of your security.
Meeting Guard
Meeting room protection.
The Meeting Guard provides a flexible solution for keeping meeting rooms,
office and public areas safe from eavesdropping.  Providing real‐time protection
from active devices as well as transmission from store and forward devices.
The Meeting Guard benefits from a compact and portable design that allows it
to be deployed easily with no additional infrastructure and minimal training.

229432 Security Research AR pp01-pp07  23/07/2013  15:48  Page 6 Review
Turnover for the Property Information Services division for the year was
£4,234,208 compared with £4,576,410 in the previous year . The operating profit
before exceptional items for the year was £152,244 compared with an operating
profit before exceptional items of £743,503 for the previous year. A goodwill
impairment  charge of £1,416,694 was incurred in the year which, in addition
to the £3,537,539 incurred in the previous year, reflects the fact that housing
transactions are unlikely to return to historic levels for some considerable time. 
Property Search Group and its network of franchisees continue to work in
harmony, presenting a nationwide brand revered and respected by the legal
community. There have been substantial improvements to the online ordering
platform that consistently scores top marks with PSG’s clients when compared
to other platforms supplied by its competitors.  In addition, internal IT systems
across the network have been updated to provide seamless, end‐to‐end delivery
of products that have improved service to clients, decreased administration
tasks, added additional quality controls and increased efficiency.  
Review
Moore & Buckle remained a stable, consistent performer in a very specialist
marketplace.
Turnover for the year was £1,563,440 compared with £1,414,973 in the previous
year. The operating profit before exceptional items for the year was £301,947
compared with an operating profit before exceptional items of £272,725 in the
previous year. A goodwill impairment charge of £287,058 was incurred in the
year which, in addition to £600,000 incurred in the previous year, reflects a
harsher business climate for this sector of the marketplace.

directors’ report
The directors present herewith their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013.
principal activities
The principal activities of the Group are those of the manufacture and sale of specialist electronic equipment, the sale and
operation of property search franchises together with the provision of other property information services, and the manufacture of
flexible packaging products.
business review 
The business review forms part of the directors’ report. The principal activities of the Group, the business review and future
developments are all described in the chairman’s statement, the CEO’s update and divisional reports. 
results
The Group’s consolidated income statement for the year is set out on page 15 of the financial statements.
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group
As far as our specialist electronics business is concerned turnover is generated from a mix of small and large orders. The timing of
the order placement and delivery of larger orders is inherently difficult to predict, potentially causing material fluctuations in actual
results compared with expectations. 
If the current situation in the property market changes it could affect the results of our property information business either
beneficially or detrimentally.  
Our packaging solutions business depends on small orders and could be affected by any change in the economic environment. 
dividends
The directors do not recommend payment of a dividend having already returned over £15m to shareholders during the year.
research and development
Audiotel International Limited continues its policy of investment in research and development in order to retain a competitive
position in its market.

Purchase of own shares during the year is referred to in the chairman’s statement and note 22 of the financial statements.

payment of creditors
The Group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to agree payment terms with individual suppliers in advance, and ensure that
these suppliers are aware of those terms and abide by such terms. 
The Group’s payment days as at 31 March 2013 for trade creditors were 40 days (2012: 48 days).
the environment 
The Group regards compliance with relevant environmental laws and the adoption of responsible standards as integral to its
business operation. It is also committed to introducing measures to limit any adverse effects its business may have on the
environment and will promote continuous improvement in accordance with the best available techniques. 
financial risk management
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed relate to liquidity and credit. The policies and strategies for managing
these risks are summarised as follows:
(a) liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains sufficient funds for current operations and planned expansions.
(b) credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. The
Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating financial risks from defaults.
Nevertheless risk has increased due to the current economic circumstances.
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade receivables. The Group has no significant concentration of
credit risk with exposure spread over a large number of customers. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and
duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating. The amounts presented in the statement of financial
position are net of allowances for doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s management, based on prior experience and their
assessment of the current economic environment.

directors have elected to prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and the Group’s profit or
loss for that year. In preparing these financial statements, directors are required to:
•        select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•        make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•        state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•        prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in
business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors have reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the annual report includes information required by the AIM Rules. 
The maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information on the Group’s website is the responsibility of the
directors. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Board’s statement on corporate governance is set out on page 13.
auditors
A resolution proposing that Milsted Langdon LLP be re‐appointed as auditors of the Company will be put to the Annual General
Meeting.
There is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and the directors have taken all the steps that
they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors
are aware of that information.

directors’ report
229432 Security Research AR pp08-pp14  23/07/2013  15:50  Page 12 Being a Company whose shares are admitted to AIM, the Company is not a listed company and therefore is not required to comply
with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board has however adopted the following:
board committees
The Board has two sub‐committees, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee, both of which include the Finance
Director.
audit committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by J D G Holme FCA, with its other member being J A Warwick FCA. Any director may attend by
invitation. The external auditors may be invited to attend the meetings and have direct access to members of the Committee. The
Audit Committee may examine any matters relating to the financial affairs of the Group including reviews of the annual and interim
financial statements, announcements, internal control procedures and accounting policies. 
remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by J D G Holme FCA, reviews the performance of the executive directors, considers
and approves all Board and senior executive appointments, remuneration and benefits including share options and service
contracts. J A Warwick FCA is the other member of the Committee.
internal financial control
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal financial control. A system can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance regarding:
•        the safeguarding of assets against unauthorised use or disposition;
•        the minimisation of risk of material loss whilst in pursuit of the Group’s business objectives; and 
•        the maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information within the business or for
publication.
Due to the size of the Group, a key control procedure during the year was the close day‐to‐day supervision by the executive
directors.
auditor independence
The Audit Committee reviews the services provided by the external auditors at least on an annual basis. This review includes
consideration of the confirmation of independence which the external auditors provide to the Company on an annual basis and of
the services which they provide to the Group, in order to ensure that their independence is not compromised.
relations with shareholders
The directors seek to ensure that all shareholders are kept informed about the Group and its activities. A comprehensive annual
report and financial statements and an interim report are sent to shareholders and there is frequent dialogue with institutional
investors. The Annual General Meeting provides shareholders with the opportunity to meet and question directors. Details of the
resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 29 August 2013, are set out in the notice of Annual
General Meeting which is attached to this report.
going concern
The directors consider, after making appropriate enquiries, that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.

corporate governance
229432 Security Research AR pp08-pp14  23/07/2013  15:50  Page 13 We have audited the financial statements of Security Research Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which comprise the
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company
Statements of Changes in Equity, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Group and Parent Company
Statements of Cash Flows, and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent
Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, for this report or for
the opinions we have formed.
respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 12 the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition we read all the financial and non‐financial information in the
directors’ report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
–        the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at
31 March 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
–        the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
–        the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
–        the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial statements. 
matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
–        adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
–        the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
–        certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
–        we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2013
1. accounting policies 
Security Research Group plc, company number 03170812, is domiciled and incorporated in England under the Companies Act 1985. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs),
International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations
adopted for use by the European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting
under IFRSs. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
There were no new standards or interpretations that have been adopted by the Group in the current period.
There are no interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been issued but are not yet effective that will have a
material impact on the financial statements and have not been early adopted by the Group. 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Although
these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ
from those estimates.
The directors have used significant judgements relating to assumptions concerning goodwill. 
The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount is
determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice
of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. 
The following accounting policies have been used consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the
Group’s financial statements:
(a) consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include those of the Company and its subsidiaries from their date of acquisition. All
acquisitions of subsidiaries have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
(b) revenue
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods, services and set up costs in respect of installation of production facilities net of
VAT and discount and intra‐Group transactions.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group, it can be reliably measured
and the following criteria are met:
(i) sale of goods
Sale of goods are recognised when risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the customer. Certain income is
recognised on a milestone basis subject to meeting the criteria as stated within the relevant contract.
(ii) rendering of services
Rendering of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the
specific transaction.
(iii) set up costs
Set up costs are recognised evenly over the life of the relevant contract.

notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2013
1. accounting policies (continued)
(c) property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment costs. 
Depreciation is provided to write‐off the cost less estimated residual value (based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition) in
annual instalments over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The depreciation rates used are as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% straight line
Leasehold property Straight line over the life of the lease/life of contract
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 15% ‐ 33.3% straight line/life of contract 
Motor vehicles 25% ‐ 40% straight line 
(d) investments
Investments in subsidiary companies are valued at cost less provision for diminution in value.
(e) goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid on the acquisition of a business and the fair
value of the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subjected to annual impairment reviews. Any excess of goodwill over the value in
use of the underlying assets is written off to the income statement. The directors consider that the goodwill has an infinite life.
(f) foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional and
presentational currency.
The Group has foreign currency transactions arising from the sales and purchases by an operating subsidiary in a currency other
than the subsidiary’s functional currency. Under the Group’s foreign exchange policy, such transactions are recorded at the rate of
exchange prevailing at the transaction date. 
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
All exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement.
(g) leasing
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(h) deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of taxation deferred by timing differences between the treatment of certain items for
taxation and accounting purposes.
The deferred tax balance has not been discounted.
(i) liquid resources
Liquid resources are defined as short term bank deposits and cash in hand.
(j) development expenditure and web design costs
Development expenditure and web design costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation, shown as other intangible assets, are
written off over the period for which they are estimated to benefit future profitability of the Group but for no longer than 3 years.
(k) inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the First In First Out (FIFO) cost basis. Costs include all
direct costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, including where appropriate, a proportion of
manufacturing overheads. 
(l) pensions
The pension costs charged represent the contribution payable by the Group in the year.

notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2013
1. accounting policies (continued)
(m) share based payments
The Group issues equity‐settled share based payments to certain directors. Equity‐settled share based payments are measured at
fair value (excluding the effect of non market‐based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant
date of the equity‐settled share based payments is expensed on a straight‐line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black‐Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted,
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non‐transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

Goodwill acquired through acquisition has been allocated to individual cash generating units (‘CGUs’) for impairment testing. These
are independent income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for
management purposes. The carrying value of goodwill is as follows:
                                                                                                                                                                                             2013 2012

Cumulative goodwill written off against reserves is £11,354,613 (2012: £9,650,861).
Goodwill written off during the year amounted to £1,416,694 (2012: £3,537,539) relating to the goodwill of the property
information services business and £287,058 (2012: £600,000) relating to the packaging solutions business. In the case of property
information services this reflects the fact that the level of housing transactions are unlikely to return to their previous levels for
some considerable time and in the case of the packaging solutions business reflects the harsher climate for businesses in general. 
Goodwill is reviewed annually or when other events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully
recoverable. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations use pre‐tax cash
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period. Cash flows beyond this five year
period are extrapolated using a growth rate of up to 2.25% which does not exceed the long term average growth for the United
Kingdom. The key assumptions in these calculations are as follows:    
–        The achievement of budgeted operating profit over the next 5 years (2012: 5 years).
–        A growth rate of up to 2.25% for the final 5 years (2012: 2.25%).
–        The cash flows were discounted using a pre‐tax discount rate of 5.0% (2012: 5.0%).

Sensitivity analysis:
The value in use calculations in respect of the property information services division is dependent on the budgeted number of
housing market property transactions being achieved. If a reasonable change in the level of housing market property transactions
was realised, namely a fall of 7% from those budgeted, and all other variables remained stable the carrying value of the goodwill in
relation to the property information services division would not be further impaired. 
The budgeted operating profit over the next 5 years assumes that the number of housing transactions increase from the present
level of 650,000 per annum. Each 100,000 increase in the level of housing transactions should benefit the operating profit by not
less than £150,000. 
The value in use calculations in respect of the packaging solutions division is dependent upon the budgeted sales being achieved. If a
reasonable change in the level of sales was realised, namely a fall of 16% from those budgeted and all other variables remained
stable the carrying value of the goodwill in relation to the packaging solutions division would not be further impaired.

share based payments
The options for directors were introduced in February 2006 and April 2007. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to
the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 5 years or 8 years following the
vesting period. There are no reload features. Exercise of an option is dependent on continued employment. Options were valued
using the Black‐Scholes option‐pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. The expected
dividends factored into the model are £Nil. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as
follows:

24. financial instruments
capital management
The Group finances its operations through retained earnings and the management of working capital.
financial risk management
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed relate to liquidity and credit. The policies and strategies for managing
these risks are summarised as follows:
(a) liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains sufficient funds for operations and planned expansions.
(b) credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. The
Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating financial risk from defaults.
Nevertheless risk has increased due to the current economic circumstances. 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade receivables. The Group has no significant concentration of
credit risk with exposure spread over a large number of customers. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and
duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating. The amounts presented in the statement of financial
position are net of allowances for doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s management, based on prior experience and their
assessment of the current economic environment. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks
with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The directors consider that the maximum exposure of the
Group to credit risk to be the current assets of the Group excluding inventories.

fair values of financial assets
The fair value is an amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and
willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
The fair value of cash deposits approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.

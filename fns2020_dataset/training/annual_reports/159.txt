A quality African gold producer
ABG is Tanzania’s largest gold producer and one of the five largest gold producers in 
Africa. We have four producing mines, all located in north west Tanzania, and several 
exploration projects at various stages of development. With a high-quality asset base, solid 
growth opportunities and a clear strategy, we have the objective of increasing our existing 
production to one million ounces per year by 2014. 
We aim to achieve this by:
 – driving operating efficiencies to optimise production from our existing asset base;
 – growing through near mine expansion and development of advanced-stage projects; and
 – organic greenfield growth and acquisitions in Africa.
Maintaining our licence to operate through acting responsibly in relation to our people, the 
environment and the communities in which we operate is central to achieving our objectives. 
ABG is a UK public company with its headquarters in London. W e are listed on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange under the symbol ABG. Historically and prior to our 
initial public offering (IPO), our operations comprised the Tanzanian gold mining business 
of Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick), our majority shareholder.

Where we operate
Currently, all of ABG’s mining operations 
are in Tanzania. We believe that Tanzania 
possesses significant mining potential. 
Critically, it has an established legal and 
regulatory framework for mining companies 
and a history of political stability and 
democratically elected governments.  
At present, we have four gold producing 
mines, all in north west Tanzania. These  
are Bulyanhulu, Buzwagi, Tulawaka and  
North Mara.

Exploration
Approach Priorities
At ABG, our strategy is to maintain a mix of 
projects at different stages in the exploration 
and development sequence. W e hold one of the 
largest land packages in T anzania, over highly 
prospective greenstones and around the major 
gold-mining projects in the Lake Victoria 
greenstone belt. W e are in a strong position to 
execute our strategy of increasing reserves and 
resources by focusing on exploration in and 
around our existing operations, as well as on 
early-stage exploration programmes.
Our most recent exploration focus has been 
on realising value around our existing mines, 
as well as identifying new opportunities 
in Tanzania. We believe that we are well 
positioned from our base in Tanzania to 
expand our exploration programmes into 
other parts of Africa.

Defining milestones along our journey
Over a ten-year period, ABG has become 
the largest gold producer in Tanzania, 
growing from no production in 2000 
to 700,934 attributable ounces in 2010. 
To date, we have produced 5.3 million 
attributable ounces of gold since beginning 
operations in Tanzania. We are one of 
Africa’s five largest gold producers. 
Future growth –  
where will it come from?
Greg Hawkins, CEO, explains his priorities
One of my key priorities for 2011 is to 
ensure that we continue to build our 
pipeline of growth opportunities. While 
we have a substantial platform of current 
production with a long mine life and 
attractive grade profile we are by no means 
complacent as to the importance of building

future growth. This is precisely why we have 
more than doubled our exploration budget 
for 2011 to US$55 million. This investment 
will help to advance our projects at Tulawaka, 
Golden Ridge, North Mara Underground 
and Bulyanhulu Upper East Zone, which 
between them have the potential to 
substantially boost Group production over 
the next 2-3 years. In addition, it will fund 
the next group of projects, such as the 
Nyanzaga project, which can provide 
medium-term growth while also enabling 
earlier stage generative work on our 
significant land package. At the same time, 
we continue to monitor potential  
acquisition targets and greenfield 
opportunities across Africa to further  
expand our existing asset base.

per Ordinary Share, in addition to the interim dividend of US1.6 cents 
per share that we paid in September.
Throughout 2010, we have focused on continually improving 
productivity and efficiency at our existing operations while reviewing 
opportunities for new sources of value to enhance growth. In this 
way, we have sought to underpin the Company’s long-term future and 
to deliver on our commitment to realise value for our shareholders. 
As we move into 2011, our business strategy will remain to optimise, 
expand and grow. Our ability to deliver on this strategy is based on 
the fundamental strengths described below.
High-quality asset base
In total, over US$2 billion has been invested in the current asset 
base of the Company, and we intend to maintain this commitment 
in the future. This underpins the four operating mines, our range of 
development projects, 26.9 million ounces of reserves and resources, 
and substantial land holdings for exploration.
Dear Shareholders,
It is a privilege to present ABG’s first annual report as a listed Company. 
I am delighted to be able to serve as Chairman of the new Company 
as it establishes its own identity in the public markets. ABG has come 
to market at a time of unprecedented interest in the gold industry, 
against a background of continuing global economic uncertainty. 
We have set some challenging objectives for ourselves to grow the 
business over the medium-to-long term, and I am convinced that we 
have the management team, the asset base and the financial resources 
to deliver on these.
Our first year has not been without challenges, all of which have been 
dealt with decisively by our management team with the full support 
of the Board. Despite these, our production for 2010 was still in excess 
of 700,000 ounces, which enabled us to deliver robust financial results 
for our shareholders. Our revenues were US$975 million, we had an 
operating cash flow of US$345 million and net income of US$218 
million, with a net cash balance in excess of US$400 million at the end 
of the year. This provides us with the significant strategic flexibility we 
need as we look to grow the business in the coming years. It has also

ABG ethics
Our core values are rooted in honesty, integrity, the highest ethical 
standards and a commitment to corporate responsibility. As one of the 
largest foreign investors in Tanzania, we are determined to contribute 
not only to the national economy, but also to the socio-economic 
development of our host communities, leaving a positive legacy 
for future generations. We are committed to operating in a socially 
responsible way over the life cycle of our mines. We recognise that 
fostering strong and mutually beneficial relationships with our host 
communities is critical if we are to secure a ‘social licence to operate’ 
and realise the social and economic opportunities it presents. 
Outlook
As we go into 2011, I remain optimistic about the prospects for our 
industry and I believe that ABG is well positioned to continue to be one 
of the leading players within the African gold mining industry. We must 
apply the lessons learned from the challenges we have already faced and 
overcome to deliver on the potential of our asset base and reward our 
shareholders for their loyalty throughout 2010. 
The coming year will not be without its challenges but I am convinced 
that we have the elements in place to achieve our objectives. Finally, 
I would like to thank my fellow Board members for their hard work, 
dedication and valuable guidance throughout the year, and I look 
forward to reporting again on our progress in 12 months’ time.
Aaron Regent, Chairman
Operational expertise
In Tanzania, we have grown our business from zero production 
to over 700,000 ounces through the acquisition, development and 
operation of four high-quality mines. This experience provides a 
significant competitive advantage when assessing growth opportunities 
throughout Africa.
Experienced leadership and management strength 
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate 
governance. Our Board consists of some of the most respected figures in 
the mining industry. It possesses the expertise, knowledge, experience 
and commitment necessary to help us achieve our business objectives. 
Collectively, the Board sets our standards, values and strategic aims 
and reviews all material strategic issues, financial performance, risk 
management and critical business issues.
Furthermore, at the time of our initial public offering and through 
subsequent additions of talent and expertise throughout the year, 
we have put in place a management team with substantial industry 
experience – critically, one with the capacity both to maximise the value 
of our existing assets and to deliver the growth we have targeted.
Growth potential
Our existing mines offer a number of additional opportunities to 
grow their existing production levels. Coupled with other greenfield 
potential, such as the Nyanzaga Project, and our capability and appetite 
for acquisitions, we have a range of growth options for the business.
Balance sheet
With a production platform successfully generating strong cash flows, 
over US$400 million of net cash and an unused US$150 million credit 
facility, we have significant balance sheet strength and the flexibility 
needed both to carry out our organic growth plans and to realistically 
assess acquisition opportunities.
Our supportive majority shareholder
We have access to industry-leading expertise and a strong talent pool to 
augment our own resources through our relationship with our majority 
shareholder, Barrick. We believe that this provides an important source 
of advantage over our competitors.
As we go into 2011, I remain optimistic about the prospects for 
our industry and I believe that ABG is well positioned to continue 
to be one of the leading players within it. 10
www.africanbarrickgold.com
The last 12 months have marked the beginning of a vibrant new chapter 
for our business, for me personally and for many colleagues. Several 
months of preparations culminated in March with the creation of 
ABG and our IPO, turning what was formerly a regional business unit 
of Barrick into a significant independent business. Today, we have a 
mandate to build on our already substantial asset base and strengthen 
our position within the gold mining industry.
Our key focus over this past year has been to ensure that our assets are 
positioned to generate long-term, consistent operating performance. 
This has been evident in the achievements at Bulyanhulu and North 
Mara, the mine life extension at Tulawaka and our determined 
approach to overcoming the challenges at Buzwagi. This marks the 
approach ABG will continue to take with the business, to ensure that it 
can be run consistently and sustainably, to manage business risks and 
to apply all of our available resources to deal with any challenges. This 
underpins our strategy of building growth on a solid operating base and 
adding value for our shareholders.
Throughout the year, we have maintained our absolute commitment 
to operating in a responsible manner in close co-operation with 
our host communities and to ensuring that we further embed the 
culture of health and safety in all our operations and activities. It is 
deeply regrettable that we suffered four fatalities at our Bulyanhulu 
mine during the year. We must learn from these incidents and from 
the thorough investigations we subsequently carried out to reduce 
the possibility of any recurrence. All our financial and operating 
achievements must be judged in the context of our over-riding 
corporate goals of ensuring that everyone goes home safe and healthy 
every day and of making a positive contribution to the areas where we 
operate. We made substantial progress in these goals in 2010, during 
which our mines all achieved one million work hours without lost time 
injuries. This is highly encouraging, but we are conscious that we must 
continue to maintain our focus on achieving constant improvement.
Operating and financial performance
With the positive performances at Bulyanhulu and North Mara, as 
well as the contribution from Tulawaka, we finished the year with 
production of 700,934 ounces of gold at a cash cost of US$569 per 
ounce. With the positive evolution in gold prices over 2010, we are 
pleased to report a robust operating cash flow of US$345 million, 
and a year-end net cash position of US$401 million. We were also 
successful in growing our overall resource base by 3.5% to 26.9 million 
ounces, of which 63% are classified as reserves. However, despite these 
achievements the issues faced at Buzwagi meant that we did not meet 
all of our 2010 targets. As such, resolving the issues at Buzwagi was a 
top priority for our management team during much of 2010, with the 
objective of ensuring that the mine entered 2011 in a position to deliver 
on expectations. 
This work included a number of senior management changes, including 
the Chief Operating Officer and the General Manager at Buzwagi, as 
well as significant additional investment in mining and process plant 
equipment, security infrastructure, personnel hiring and training 
following the discovery of systematic fuel thefts at the site, and a 
significant tightening of security measures. We are confident that these 
initiatives have helped to put the mine back on a more stable footing.

Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Overview
Driving efficiency and growth
We implemented a range of plans in 2010 to help drive further 
efficiency and growth in our business, and we will continue to invest 
in these in 2011. We aim to reach one million ounces of production per 
year by 2014, representing growth of 40% from 2010 levels. We plan 
to achieve this while also delivering cost-base efficiencies. These are 
fundamental pillars of our focus on creating shareholder value and we 
aim to deliver them by:
•	 optimising our existing assets;
•	 expanding through organic growth; and
•	 growing through acquisitions in Africa. 
Optimising our existing assets 
In order to ensure that our assets remain world class and continue to 
operate at maximum efficiency levels, we continue to undertake a range 
of capital investment measures and efficiency programmes. Against a 
backdrop of cost pressures in the industry, we believe that these will 
help us to continue to operate at or below the midpoint of the industry 
cost curve.
In 2010, these activities included a significant upgrade of the ventilation 
system at Bulyanhulu, fleet expansion at Buzwagi and T ulawaka, and de-
bottlenecking at our North Mara process plant to increase throughput. 
We also significantly streamlined our procurement and supply chain 
functions, as well as re-organising our office in Dar es Salaam. In 2011, 
we have a capital expenditure budget of US$140 million for sustaining 
and development capital, US$24 million for expansion projects and 
US$73 million for waste stripping. Key capital investment projects 
include the water treatment facility at North Mara, the addition of 
pebble ports and back-up generating capacity at our Buzwagi process 
plant, additional underground mining equipment for Tulawaka and 
continued security investment. 
Expanding through organic growth
The optimisation projects for all four of our mine sites remain on track 
to deliver substantial and sustainable additional production within 
four years and we have made encouraging progress on these projects 
throughout 2010. 
At Bulyanhulu, we are continuing to dewater and rehabilitate access to 
the Upper East Zone. The feasibility study for this project is progressing, 
and we expect to finalise it during the first half of 2011. 
At North Mara, we have been encouraged by the drill results below the 
Gokona and Nyabigena pits, where we released an initial high-grade 
resource of 370,000 gold ounces during the fourth quarter of 2010. We 
are targeting expanding this to one million ounces through an intensive 
drill programme in 2011, and the feasibility study for this project is also 
on track to be completed during the first half of 2011. 
As announced in our preliminary results, we are extending the life of 
our Tulawaka mine for the full year 2011 and into the second quarter of 
2012. We will continue our exploration drilling at the site with the aim 
of further increasing the life of mine. If successful, we anticipate this will 
be based solely on the underground operation through the addition of a 
second portal. We expect to provide an update on this later in the year.

More recently, we were pleased to announce an initial mineral resource 
at our Golden Ridge project. The initial resource consists of an indicated 
mineral resource of 527,000 gold ounces with an average grade of 2.94 
grams of gold per tonne and an inferred mineral resource of 152,000 
gold ounces with an average grade of 2.52 grams of gold per tonne. 
We intend to conduct additional exploration work throughout 2011 at 
Golden Ridge in furtherance of these encouraging results and aim to 
complete the feasibility study for the project by mid 2011.
We also made encouraging progress at the greenfield Nyanzaga project 
in 2010 following completion of our acquisition of Tusker Gold, 
notably with the discovery of mineralisation closer to surface as well 
as increasing grades at depth. We are stepping up the drill programme 
in 2011, with the aim of initiating a scoping study later in the year. 
Elsewhere, the main focus of our generative exploration work was in the 
North Mara area along the Gokona Corridor, with some exciting initial 
results that we will follow up on in 2011.
In recognition of the critical importance of organic growth to our long-
term ambitions, we are increasing our total exploration budget in 2011 
to US$55 million, including US$26 million of capitalised expenditure. 
This represents a 103% increase on 2010. 
In addition to our organic growth plans, acquisitions to expand our 
footprint more broadly in Africa remain an important part of our 
strategy. We have undeniable strengths in this area, with substantial 
capital flexibility gained through our cash holdings and credit facility, 
a management structure that will enable us to acquire and develop 
businesses in other parts of Africa, and the operational expertise to add 
value to the assets we acquire. W e analysed a number of targets during 
2010 and we continue to actively seek out opportunities. 
Strengthening our management team
We have continued to strengthen our management team over the 
course of the year, employing and promoting individuals with a track 
record of leadership and the skill set and experience to help take our 
business forward. 
In September, we announced the appointment of Marco Zolezzi as 
our Chief Operating Officer. Marco has significant expertise in running 
mines and bringing complex, large-scale projects through to full 
ramp up. He has been of significant value as we continue to focus on 
delivering consistent performance at our operating mines and driving 
forward our organic growth projects. 
W e also appointed Boyd Timler as General Manager at Buzwagi. Boyd 
has 28 years of mining experience and has been instrumental in defining 
and implementing the action plan used to address issues at the mine 
in 2010. T owards the end of the year, we also appointed Basie Maree as 
General Manager of T ulawaka. Basie brings substantial experience of the 
industry, including a number of years with Anglo American, and will 
lead T ulawaka forward into a new stage of its development.
With these and other appointments, I am confident that we now 
have a management team in place with the necessary experience, 
energy and enthusiasm to further develop the business and deliver 
on ABG’s potential. 
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Outlook
As I have already mentioned, 2010 was a year of significant achievement 
while we also faced a number of challenges that impacted production 
and cash cost targets. However, with the measures we have taken, with 
the investments made and with the additional expertise we have added 
to our team, we ended 2010 strongly and enter 2011 with an impressive 
platform on which to build. 
We are aiming to develop the business further through the following 
key objectives for 2011:
•	 achieving attributable Group production between 700,000 and 
760,000 ounces;
•	 maintaining cash cost of between US$590 and US$650 per ounce 
sold, and direct cash operating costs of between US$545 and US$605 
per ounce sold;
•	 increasing Group throughput and recoveries;
•	 completing feasibility studies at our brownfield projects;
•	 achieving growth in our overall resource base;
•	 improving further on our safety record; and
•	 continuing our focus on opportunities for strategic acquisitions 
to expand our footprint throughout Africa.
Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their commitment, 
enthusiasm and hard work throughout what has been an extraordinary 
year in the development of our business. I would also like to thank 
our Board for their unwavering support, their wise counsel and their 
commitment throughout the year.

Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Overview
In 2010, the global economic recovery continued 
at a slow and uneven pace. While growth in 
emerging economies, led by China, was generally 
strong, growth in the largest developed economies 
including the United States, the Eurozone and Japan, 
was muted and held back by fiscal deficits, sovereign 
debt concerns and high unemployment. Global 
monetary conditions remain historically loose and 
the recovery process is expected to continue at a 
sluggish rate, with downside risks predicated mainly 
on concerns of sovereign defaults and subsequent 
tightening of credit conditions. 
During the year, the gold price showed an upward 
trend. The US dollar generally declined against 
other global currencies, primarily as a result of low 
US dollar interest rates, continued allocation by 
investors into riskier assets and concerns about  
the level of US government borrowings and 
deficits. Gold has historically been inversely 
correlated to the US dollar, and that trend 
continued in 2010, with gold prices trading up to 
all-time highs in a number of major currencies.
Gold
The market price of gold is the most significant factor in determining 
the earnings and cash flow-generating capacity of ABG’s operations. 
The price of gold is subject to volatile price movements over short 
periods of time and is affected by numerous industry and macro-
economic factors that are beyond our control. Gold price volatility 
remained high in 2010, with the price ranging from US$1,045 to 
US$1,431 per ounce during the year. The average market price for the 
year of US$1,225 per ounce was an all-time high. The market price of 
gold has been influenced by low US dollar interest rates, sovereign debt 
concerns, investment demand and the monetary policies put in place 
by the world’s most prominent central banks. As a result of the global 
easing of monetary policy, as well as large fiscal deficits incurred in the 
US and other major developed economies, we believe that there is a 
possibility that both inflation and US dollar depreciation could emerge 
in the coming years. Gold is viewed as a hedge against inflation and has 
historically been inversely correlated to the US dollar. Therefore, higher 
inflation and/or depreciation in the US dollar should be positive for the 
price of gold. As a result, we believe the long-term upward trend in gold 
prices will continue. 
Throughout 2010, we continued to see increased interest in holding 
gold as an investment. This was evidenced by the increased volumes 
held by exchange traded funds (ETFs) and global exchanges, as well 
as the worldwide demand for physical gold, in forms such as bars 
and coins, as investors seek a safe haven against the uncertain global 
economic outlook.
We believe that the outlook for global gold mine production will be 
one of declining supply in the years to come. While modest increases 
in production have occurred in recent years, primarily as a result of 
the increase in gold prices, we expect a decline over the long term. 
The primary drivers for the global decline are: a trend of lower-grade 
production by many producers; increasing time requirements and 
impediments in bringing projects – especially large-scale projects – 
to the production stage; a lack of global exploration success in recent 
years; and a scarcity of new, promising regions for gold exploration 
and production. A decrease in global industry production raises the 
potential for a higher sustainable long-term gold price.
Gold sales from the official sector under the Central Bank Gold 
Agreement (CBGA) also have a significant impact on gold prices. 
Sales for the year ended September 2010 were less than 2% of the 
full-year quota of 400 tonnes, excluding sales from the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). We are now in the second year of the current 
CBGA which runs to September 2014 and allows for the sale of up 
to 400 tonnes per year. In 2010, the IMF completed their previously 
announced sale of 403 tonnes of gold, with no future sales anticipated 
at this time. Net official sector sales have been declining in recent 
years and, in fact, central banks were net buyers of gold in 2010.
The reserve gold holdings of emerging market countries such as the 
BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) are significantly 
lower than the reserve holdings of more developed countries. The 
central banks of these developing economies hold a significant 
portion of their reserves in US dollars. As they identify a need to 
diversify their portfolio and reduce their exposure to the US dollar, we 
believe that gold will be one of the main benefactors. In conjunction 
with the below-quota selling of gold under the CBGA, which is 
expected to continue in the current year of the agreement, the net 
purchases of gold by global central banks provide a strong indication 
that gold is viewed as a reserve asset and a de-facto currency.
Market review
The context for our operations 14
www.africanbarrickgold.com
Currency exchange rates
A portion of the Company’ s costs are incurred in currencies other than  
US dollars. The exposure relating to other currencies is approximately 
25% of the Company’ s total operating expenditure of which the main 
contributing currencies are the T anzanian Shilling and the South African 
Rand. The Company has not entered into any long-term currency hedging 
but it may consider hedging currencies at times when the opportunity 
exists to protect itself against significant currency movements.
Throughout the year, the Rand strengthened versus the US dollar. 
It traded between R6.63 and R7.96, and averaged R7.32 per US dollar. 
Its strength was primarily driven by US dollar weakness, as well as 
strong precious metals prices and investors purchasing riskier assets.
In 2010, the Tanzanian Shilling weakened versus the US dollar. It 
traded between Tsh1,333 and Tsh1,525, and averaged Tsh1,442 per 
US dollar. Its weakness was due to increased government borrowing 
used to finance the large growth in government debt and a current 
account deficit.
Market review continued
Copper
Copper prices generally rose throughout 2010, particularly in the 
second half, as London Metals Exchange (LME) copper prices traded 
in a wide range of US$2.74 to US$4.42 per pound. They averaged 
US$3.42 per pound and closed the year at an all-time high of US$4.42 
per pound. Copper’s rise to all-time highs occurred mainly as a result 
of factors including strong demand from emerging markets, especially 
China, decreasing exchange stockpiles and increasing investor interest 
in base metals with strong forward-looking supply/demand outlooks. 
Copper prices should continue to be positively influenced by factors like 
demand from Asia, global economic growth, the limited availability of 
scrap metal and production levels of mines and smelters in the future.
Utilising option collar strategies, we have put in place floor protection 
on approximately 60% and 45% of our expected copper production for 
2011 and 2012 respectively, at an average floor price of US$3.25 per 
pound and an average ceiling price of US$4.77 per pound.

US dollar interest rates 
Beginning in 2008, in response to the contraction of global credit 
markets and in an effort to spur economic activity and avoid 
potential deflation, the US Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark 
rate to between 0% and 0.25%. The benchmark was kept at this level 
throughout 2010. We expect that short-term rates will remain at 
low levels through 2011 and into 2012, with the US Federal Reserve 
continuing to use monetary policy initiatives in an effort to keep long-
term interest rates low. We expect such initiatives to be followed by 
incremental increases to short-term rates once economic conditions 
and credit markets normalise.
At present, our interest-rate exposure mainly relates to interest 
receipts on our cash balances (US$401 million at the end of the year). 
Fuel
During 2010, oil prices traded between US$63 and US$92 per barrel. 
They averaged US$80 per barrel and closed the year at US$91 per barrel 
as the global economy returned to growth.
We consume on average approximately 60 million litres of diesel fuel 
annually across all our mines. Diesel fuel is refined from crude oil 
and is therefore subject to the same price volatility affecting crude oil 
prices. Volatility in crude prices has a direct and indirect impact on 
our production costs. Based on current consumption figures at our 
operations, we estimate that an increase of US$10 per barrel of crude 
oil would result in an approximate increase of US$5-US$6 in cash costs 
per ounce of gold sold. Although the Company has no diesel-price 
hedging positions it may consider hedging its diesel-price exposure to 
protect against adverse cost impacts that come with significant increases 
in diesel prices. We will look at opportunities to hedge the exposure in 
the future.

The North Mara grid-connection project
In late October 2006, the North Mara 
gold mine entered into a memorandum of 
understanding with the Tanzania National 
Power Utility, TANESCO, to examine the 
feasibility of connecting to the TANESCO 
electricity grid. Until then the mine had  
been supplied by diesel generators. The 
project scope involved the installation  
of 88 kilometres of 132kV overhead power 
line from the Musoma substation to the 
town of Nyamongo, the construction 
of a new substation at Nyamongo and 
modifications to the Musoma and Bunda 
substations. This also included any voltage 
support compensation required, and was 
called the ‘Grid Connection Project’ .
ABG and TANESCO completed a 
National Grid network study to finalise 
the requirements for the voltage support 
compensation. To support the network, 
a number of static variable compensators 
were relocated and capacitor banks 
upgraded in what was known as the  
‘Grid Stability Project’ .
The final costs were in the order of  
US$40 million for the two projects.
The project ran from January 2008 to 
September 2009. Following commission, 
further modifications were made to 
address power-quality and grid-stability 
issues. These allow essential equipment 
to run on diesel generators until the grid 
power stabilises, with around 4Mw of the 
12Mw on this ‘spinning’ power. 
In 2010, the mine benefited significantly 
from the project’s outcome, thanks to its 
reduced reliance on more expensive diesel-
generated power.

Overview
North Mara Underground
ABG is currently investigating the 
potential for starting an underground 
mine at North Mara to access a resource 
that is currently outside the final planned 
limits of the open pits. This would also 
allow for simultaneous underground and 
open pit mining for a period of time which 
would both add to our production profile 
and increase the life of the mine. 
Initial investigations into possible 
resource-expansion at Gokona have shown 
positive results. In December 2010, we 
announced an initial mineral resource 
at the project, indicating the potential 
to develop a substantial underground 
operation at the Gokona and Nyabigena 
deposits with an attractive grade profile. 
We are continuing deep drilling in 
order to identify further high-grade 
gold mineralisation with the objective 
of locating an underground resource of 
up to one million ounces. We are also 
undertaking studies into suitable mining 
methods, potential operating and capital 
costs, infrastructure and risk analysis 
assessments to assess the overall feasibility 
for this resource expansion. We expect  
to complete this phase of the study in 
mid-2011.
The initial resource announcement and 
on-going project reviews confirm the 
encouraging progress ABG has made on 
assessing the upside potential of North 
Mara. It is a testament to our strategy of 
realising the additional potential of our 
existing portfolio of high-quality assets.

Overview
Nyanzaga
The acquisition of Tusker Gold in the 
first half of 2010 resulted in ABG gaining 
100% control of the Nyanzaga project, 
which hosts the Tusker and Kilimani 
gold deposits as well as several other 
exploration targets. The Nyanzaga project 
covers some 353 square kilometres of 
prospective Archaean greenstone geology 
and lies approximately 35 kilometres 
north east of ABG’s Bulyanhulu gold 
mine. Previous resource estimates by 
Tusker Gold and Sub Sahara Resources 
NL reported inferred resources of 
approximately four million ounces for 
Tusker and Kilimani projects (although 
ABG has so far only recognised a 
resource of 963,000 ounces). The 
Tusker and Kilimani gold deposits and 
the surrounding exploration targets 
together represent an opportunity to add 
significantly to the Company’s resource-
base, with the potential to contribute 
substantially to annual production in the 
medium to long term.
The Company is presently continuing 
step-out and infill resource drilling on 
the Tusker and Kilimani deposits along 
with scout exploration drill programmes 
across various geophysical and 
geochemical targets within the project. 
In late 2010, our drilling on the Tusker 
resource area identified additional near-
surface mineralisation on the northern 
end of the resource and new zones of 
broad, higher-grade mineralisation 
on the southern end of the resource. 
These intercepts indicate the potential 
to identify broad, higher-grade zones 
within the very large Tusker gold deposit, 
and the current drill programmes are 
specifically aimed at extending these 
newly-identified zones. 
The Company plans to drill more than 
50,000 metres of resource definition and 
exploration drilling across the Nyanzaga 
property in 2011. These drill programmes 
are focused on identifying additional 
gold deposits and satellite ore sources 
that could enhance the economics of any 
operation established on the Nyanzaga 
project. We also aim to initiate a scoping 
study later in 2011 as we gain a greater 
understanding of the mineralisation in 
this area.

The Bulyanhulu Underground  
Training Centre
As the Bulyanhulu mine makes progress 
towards growing production using the 
conventional cut-and-fill mining method, 
there is an increased need to train large 
numbers of miners. ABG carried out an 
onsite gap assessment to highlight our 
training needs and to ensure we have 
the capacity to meet the demand. To 
meet this challenge, the mining team 
has recruited a number of highly skilled 
trainers from one of South Africa’s 
leading mine training schools and has 
converted the mined-out 4700 level into 
an underground mining school. 
The space contains a number of areas to 
hold formal classroom lectures as well as 
practical areas where employees can learn 
basic skills such as pipe-fitting, inspecting 
vehicles and rigging. They can then 
progress to more demanding training on 
subjects such as jack legs and winches. 
All training can be carried out in a genuine 
underground environment without the 
added pressure of being in a production 
area. This makes the training highly 
effective and gives people who are  
new to mining the opportunity to start 
their career by learning in a safe and 
controlled environment.
The next phase is to start a low-priority 
‘production’ heading, where students can 
experience actual working conditions 
without the added pressure of a fully- 
fledged production environment. We 
are also currently carrying out a gap 
assessment on all underground employees, 
who will be undergoing training at the 
centre to ensure we have the skills required 
to make the mine a success. In the longer 
term, we envisage that the centre will also 
provide training for employees from other 
ABG underground operations.

Tulawaka extension
Tulawaka commenced open pit operations 
in 2005 with a declared reserve of 546,000 
ounces. It had produced 808,000 ounces 
up until the end of December 2010.
In 2009, open pit mining ceased and 
underground mining commenced, 
exploiting the deeper extent of the ore 
body while supplementing production 
with surface stockpiles. Operations 
were due to cease in 2011. However 
underground resource delineation 
drilling has resulted in an initial mine life 
extension into the second quarter of 2012. 
We will further explore opportunities 
during 2011 to build on this initial mine 
life extension. 
In addition to underground extensions, 
drilling programmes have indicated the 
potential to recommence open pit mining 
from the West pit extension, something 
which had not been economically viable 
in the past. Because this would be an 
extension of historic open pit mining, no 
additional permitting would be required. 
ABG is currently examining the overall 
viability of this opportunity.
We provide further information on the

The Gokona Corridor
A group of 57 prospecting licences 
surround the North Mara operation, 
encompassing approximately 691 square 
kilometres of highly prospective Archaean 
geology. ABG controls the majority of 
this prospective greenstone belt, with 
most licences owned 100% by members 
of the Group. Currently, the top priority 
target in the region is the 15 kilometre 
long Gokona Corridor that straddles the 
Gokona and Nyabigena gold deposits and 
which is interpreted to extend some five to 
six kilometres to the north west and nine 
to ten kilometres to the south east of the 
open pits. Other targets in the North Mara 
project include the Komarera trend four 
kilometres south east of the Nyabirama 
open pit and, more regionally, the Dett 
and Surubu prospects some 45 kilometres 
west of the North Mara operation.
ABG believes that the North Mara 
District, particularly the Gokona 
Corridor, is one of the most highly 
prospective exploration areas in its 
current portfolio and that the region 
could eventually add significantly to 
the existing North Mara resource base. 
The Company has plans to expand the 
2010 reverse circulation scout drilling 
programme on the Gokona Corridor and 
infill reverse circulation and diamond 
core drilling by July 2011. 
To date, reverse circulation scout drilling 
has identified favourable rock types, 
alteration and some gold anomalism in 
limited drilling. This is very encouraging 
for what has initially been a broad-spaced 
reconnaissance programme. Drilling in 
2011 will continue to target extensions 
to the existing Gokona-Nyabigena 
mineralised system, with the objective 
of locating new high-grade gold deposits 
within trucking distance of the North 
Mara plant. These programmes will run in 
conjunction with the programme being 
undertaken by North Mara mine to add 
and convert resources in the Gokona and 
Nyabigena underground areas.

net profit or loss for the 
period excluding:
•	 income tax expense;
•	 finance expense;
•	 finance income; and
•	 depreciation and amortisation 
(including goodwill 
impairment charges).
Earnings per share (EPS) 
is calculated as the net 
profit attributable to equity 
shareholders divided by 
the weighted average of the 
number of Ordinary Shares 
in issue. 
Operating cash flow per 
share is the cash generated 
from or utilised in operating 
activities, divided by the 
weighted average of the 
number of Ordinary Shares 
in issue.
Cash cost per ounce sold 
is calculated by dividing the 
aggregate of cash costs by 
attributed gold ounces sold. 
Cash cost per tonne 
milled is calculated by 
dividing the aggregate  
of these cash costs  
by attributed ore  
tonnes milled.
T otal shareholder return 
is the return on investment 
a shareholder receives over

. 
Earnings per share amounted 
to US53.2 cents for 2010, an 
increase of 272% on 2009. The 
increase was driven by net 
profit for the year.
Operating cash flow per 
share was US84.2 cents, a 78% 
increase on 2009, as a result of 
improved revenue. 
Cash cost per ounce sold was 
US$569 per ounce for 2010, 
a 7% increase on 2009. The 
increase was primarily due 
to increased costs incurred 
at Buzwagi when compared 
to lower-than-expected 
production levels at the mine.
Cash cost per tonne 
milled was US$55 
per tonne for 2010, 
slightly lower than 2009, 
primarily as a result of 
the overall incremental 
increase in tonnes milled 
from open pit operations. 
T otal shareholder return  
was 6.4% for the year. This 
measure was driven by the 
change in ABG share price 
since the IPO. As this is the 
first year of ABG’s existence as 
a listed company no prior year 
comparator is shown.
Attributable production for 
the year was 700,934 ounces,

net profit or loss for the 
period excluding:
•	 income tax expense;
•	 finance expense;
•	 finance income; and
•	 depreciation and amortisation 
(including goodwill 
impairment charges).
Earnings per share (EPS) 
is calculated as the net 
profit attributable to equity 
shareholders divided by 
the weighted average of the 
number of Ordinary Shares 
in issue. 
Operating cash flow per 
share is the cash generated 
from or utilised in operating 
activities, divided by the

Operationally, 2010 has seen unprecedented levels of activity for ABG. 
For the first time, all four of our mines were operational for the full year, 
although we faced certain challenges in our operating environment 
that impacted on our overall Group production levels. Nonetheless, 
our Group production for the year was 700,934 ounces. 
With respect to our cash costs for the year, we saw a 7% increase over 
2009 to US$569 per ounce sold. The increase was primarily due to lower-
than-expected production levels at Buzwagi, increased costs incurred 
at the mine and industry cost pressures generally. Cash costs of US$55 
per tonne milled for the year were slightly lower than the 2009 figure of 
US$57 per tonne, primarily as a result of the overall incremental increase 
in tonnes milled from open pit operations. 
ABG sold 724,083 gold ounces for the year, up by 6% on 2009 (683,687 
ounces), despite the decrease in our overall production. The increase 
was driven by the sale of concentrate ounces on hand at Bulyanhulu and 
Buzwagi at the end of 2009. 
W e mined 40.0 million tonnes of ore and waste for the year, compared to 
36.8 million in 2009. The increase was driven primarily by the focus on 
waste-stripping at the Gokona open pit, in order to access high-grade ore 
from 2012.

Overview Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Performance
T onnes of ore processed for the year totalled 7.7 million, an 18% increase 
on 2009 levels (6.5 million tonnes). The increase was mainly driven by 
increased throughput at North Mara and at Buzwagi compared to the 
prior period, which only reflected eight months’ production at Buzwagi. 
The average grade for the year was 3.3 grams of gold per tonne, 15% lower 
than the prior year period. The decrease was due to three key issues: the 
processing of low-grade stockpiles at Buzwagi in the third and fourth 
quarters; the lower grade of the transitional ore processed overall at 
Buzwagi when compared to the oxide material mined during 2009; and 
the low-grade stockpiles processed throughout the year at T ulawaka. 
Our copper production for the year of eight million pounds represents 
a 17% increase on 2009, which only reflected eight months of production 
at Buzwagi. 
Bulyanhulu delivered in line with expectations throughout the year; 
however, it was deeply regrettable that we suffered three fatalities as a result 
of a rock fall in March as well as a further fatality from a non-mining related 
accident later in the year. As Greg has noted, it is imperative that we learn 
from these incidents and from the thorough investigations we subsequently 
carried out to ensure that there is no recurrence. 
North Mara delivered production ahead of budget and at a slightly 
lower cash cost per ounce sold, when compared to 2009. In addition, the 
announcement of a high-grade initial underground resource beneath the 
planned final Gokona and Nyabigena open pits highlights the potential 
for North Mara both to extend its mine life and to add significant ounces 
to ABG’ s production base going forward.
T ulawaka has continued to outperform its original feasibility study for 
its underground operation, with an initial extension of its life-of-mine, 
through to the second quarter of 2012. During the year, we also invested 
in the infrastructure of the operation, particularly its mobile fleet, to 
ensure consistency of production and continuing profitability.
At Buzwagi, a number of challenges impacted production and cash 
costs at the mine. In the first part of the year, the layer of transitional 
ore between the oxide cap and the primary sulphide ore proved to be 
both slightly deeper than expected and of a higher grind index. This 
caused a number of equipment failures in the process plant, which were 
compounded by a series of unscheduled power outages that negatively 
impacted production. In addition, during the third quarter we uncovered 
an organised and systematic onsite fuel theft, which had a further 
impact on production at the mine. Investigations indicated that criminal 
fuel theft syndicates had widely infiltrated our mining department. In 
response, we suspended approximately 60 employees and a number of 
contractors, representing over 40% of mining department personnel. 
Unfortunately, the reduction in mining capacity further delayed the 
mining of higher-grade ore and the processing of low-grade stockpiles.
W e implemented a series of measures to address these issues during the 
year. These included:
•	 strengthening the senior management team with Boyd Timler’ s 
appointment as General Manager;
•	 bringing forward mining fleet expansion from 2011 to accelerate stage 
two mining;
•	 optimising the drill-and-blast programme in the open pit;
•	 hiring and training replacement mining personnel following the  
fuel theft;
•	 recommissioning the sulphur plant and optimising the flotation plant;
•	 ordering additional pebble ports and back-up generating power for 
2011; and
•	 conducting a full site security review, and implementing additional 
security measures.
Overall, we are confident that the measures undertaken in 2010 will 
have a positive long-term impact at Buzwagi. In addition, our recent 
announcement of an initial mineral resource at our Golden Ridge project 
underpins our belief and confidence in the potential of this project to 
become a significant satellite operation to the Buzwagi mine in the future.
The stability of power supply posed a number of challenges to production 
throughout 2010. We anticipate sporadic interruptions in power 
supply throughout 2011 and will continue to monitor this issue and the 
impact that this may have on our production levels closely throughout 
the forthcoming year. So far, we have made progress in connecting 
Bulyanhulu, Buzwagi and North Mara to the national grid system 
(T ulawaka remains exclusively diesel powered). Currently, we maintain 
back up diesel power generating capacity at Bulyanhulu and North Mara, 
in order to mitigate the risks posed by power supply interruptions at 
our largest operations and we expect to install 6MW of backup power at 
Buzwagi by mid 2011. From a State perspective, TANESCO continues to 
expand its transmission network and its generating capacity to meet the 
increasing energy demands of the growing T anzanian economy. W e have 
been, and will continue to be, supportive of this expansion through our 
on-going relationship with TANESCO. An overview of our relationship 
with TANESCO is provided on pages 18, 19 and 83.
In addition, the recent shortage of rainfall in T anzania has raised the 
possibility that there could be a reduction in the availability of electricity 
generated from hydropower which may impact our operations if, as a 
result, total electricity supply is insufficient to meet demand. W e will 
continue to monitor this development and the impact that it may have 
on our operations. 
Further details on our initiatives to address power supply and the risks 
that power stoppages, shortages and interruption of utilities supply have 
on our operations have been provided on pages 18, 19, 60, 67 and 68.
As discussed at the time of our IPO, the North Mara MDA and mining 
licence are due to expire on 7 September 2011. Applications to renew 
both of these agreements were submitted in the third quarter of 2010. W e 
expect the renewal of the MDA to be on the same terms as the existing 
agreements and for the remainder of North Mara’ s life of mine. 
Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on the 
potential of the Company’ s asset base as we enter 2011. This year, our 
focus will remain on achieving operational excellence in order to deliver 
stable and profitable production levels.

Overview Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Performance
Cash costs for the year of US$539 per ounce sold were 17% lower 
than the prior year of US$651. This was primarily a result of our 
improved production base and increased co-product revenue, which 
was driven by increased copper prices. Other contributing factors 
include improved cost-management measures, with lower consumables 
costs, lower maintenance cost due to investments made in new mining 
equipment, and a decrease in contracted services costs as a result of 
insourcing Alimak mining activities. The cost benefits of these measures 
were partially offset with an increase in labour costs due to increased 
headcount and inflationary pressure. 
Cash costs per tonne milled fell to US$148 in 2010 (US$173 in 2009) 
as a result of mining cost reductions and increased copper revenues.
Capital expenditure for the year of US$80.5 million was 35% higher 
than the prior year of US$59.6 million. This was mainly driven by a 
number of investments made in the underground mine and surface 
infrastructure. Notable investments included the new refrigeration 
plant, the shaft dewatering system, the underground workshop and 
additional mining equipment.
We suffered four fatalities at the mine this year, which is deeply 
regrettable. Details of these fatalities and the actions that we have taken 
in response to this are provided as part of our health and safety report 
on page 61.
Bulyanhulu mine overview
The Bulyanhulu gold mine is located in north west Tanzania, in the 
Kahama district of the Shinyanga region, approximately 55 kilometres 
south of Lake Victoria and approximately 150 kilometres south west of 
the city of Mwanza, a regional business and economic hub. Site access is 
good with a private airport and local unpaved roads connecting to the 
main highway close to Kahama. The average annual temperatures range 
between 15° and 35°C. Average annual rainfall in the region is 953mm. 
The mine consists of an underground mine, a process plant, waste 
rock dumps, tailings containment, water management ponds and 
associated facilities. The mine is an underground trackless operation 
using long-hole as its principal stoping method, and it is transitioning 
towards narrow-vein conventional mining as its principal mining 
method. As at 31 December 2010, a total of 2,940 individuals were 
employed at Bulyanhulu, consisting of 2,437 Group employees and 
503 contracted personnel. 
Bulyanhulu is a narrow-vein gold mine containing gold, silver and copper 
mineralisation in sulphides. Mineralisation of Bulyanhulu is associated 
with steeply-dipping reefs. T o date a number of distinct reefs have been 
identified including Reef Zero, Reef One and Reef Two. Bulyanhulu’ s 
life-of-mine is currently estimated to be in excess of 25 years, based on 
its proven and probable gold reserves of 11,026,000 ounces. 
Operating performance
Bulyanhulu delivered solid results in 2010, hitting key production 
targets for the year. 
Gold production for the year was 259,873 ounces, 4% higher than the 
prior year period’s total of 248,991 ounces mainly due to the higher-
grade ore mined in 2010. 
Gold ounces sold for the year were 262,442 ounces, which was 1% 
higher than the production figure and also 3% higher than 2009. The 
difference in sales was due to selling all unsold gold concentrate from 
the previous year, bringing the year-end finished gold inventories back 
to normalised levels, combined with an increase in the production base 
of 10,882 ounces. 38

Buzwagi – Overcoming challenges
Mine profile
The Buzwagi mine is located in north west Tanzania in the 
Kahama district of the Shinyanga region, approximately 97 
kilometres from Bulyanhulu and six kilometres south east from 
the town of Kahama. The mill is designed with a throughput 
capacity of 12,000 tonnes of ore per day, and the mine is capable 
of moving approximately 4.4 million tonnes of ore per year.
Repositioning Buzwagi
The focus at Buzwagi throughout 2010 has been 
on implementing a detailed action plan with the 
following areas of focus: 
Process plant 
A review of the process plant highlighted a number 
of measures and ways in which we could maximise 
future performance. Measures included rebuilding 
the primary crusher concave liners and replacing the 
secondary crusher liners, rebuilding the low pressure 
water pumps, relining the SAG mill shell and 
redesigning the pebble ports, recommissioning the 
sulphur plant with a complete process review and 
optimising the flotation plant to increase the copper 
contained in the concentrate. Investments in these 
measures should help to ensure that the plant meets 
its target levels of throughput and recoveries.
Mine
The pit scheduling was reassessed and revised 
following changes to equipment availability 
expectations. We expanded the mining fleet 
throughout the year in order to have appropriate 
capacity to deal with task-specific support. This 
helped to ensure optimal availability for open pit 
mining operations. There has also been a full review 
of the drill-and-blast programme which has led 
2011 priorities
•	 Continue the development and training of workforce
•	 Continue the acceleration of stage two mining by additional expansion of the 
mining fleet
•	 Upgrade Detox circuit for improved mill recoveries and lower soluble copper levels
•	 Install back-up power generation to reduce the impact of power outages, realising 
higher mill availability
•	 Automate the flotation circuit to improve copper and gold concentration values
•	 Improve SAG mill discharge for increased mill throughput

Overview Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Performance
Gold ounces sold during the year amounted to 198,221, exceeding 
production by 7% and representing a 29% increase over the previous 
year (153,682). The increase in gold ounces sold versus the prior year 
as well as versus 2010 production was due to a combination of the gold 
concentrate and gold in circuit inventories that built up in the process 
throughout 2009 and which were subsequently sold in 2010. 
Cash costs for the year were US$685 per ounce sold, compared to 
US$422 in 2009. Key factors which negatively impacted cash costs 
included: (i) the lower-than-expected production levels; (ii) higher 
energy costs resulting from the fuel theft; and (iii) higher maintenance 
and contracted services costs incurred in addressing mill downtime 
and processing issues. In addition, a number of measures were taken to 
enhance security and onsite management in response to the fuel theft, 
which resulted in increased labour-related costs. 
Cash costs per tonne milled increased to US$38 in 2010 (US$24 
in 2009). The increase in costs was primarily due to the key factors 
explained above and lower monthly average milling throughput due 
to power outages and unplanned breakdowns.
Capital expenditure for the year was US$29.8 million compared to 
US$109.3 million in 2009. Capital investment in 2009 included project 
development costs of US$101.2 million, whereas capital investment in 
2010 was primarily focused on mining equipment and improving the 
production plant to optimise operations.
Buzwagi mine overview
The Buzwagi mine is located in north west Tanzania in the Kahama 
district of the Shinyanga region, approximately 97 kilometres from 
Bulyanhulu and six kilometres south east of the town of Kahama. The 
Buzwagi mine is Tanzania’s second-largest mining operation and the 
largest single open pit mine in the country. Accessibility to Buzwagi is 
good, with the location of the site immediately beside a paved highway 
and a 1,580-metre airstrip. The site is also 40 kilometres from Isaka, 
a railway hub with links to the port of Dar es Salaam, located on the 
Indian Ocean. The annual average temperature ranges between 16° 
and 29°C. Average annual rainfall in the region is 953mm. 
The Buzwagi mine consists of an open pit mine, ore-processing 
facilities, a waste-rock storage facility, a tailings storage facility, water 
management and other ancillary facilities. As at 31 December 2010, 
a total of 1,992 individuals were employed at Buzwagi, consisting of 
802 Group employees and 1,190 contracted personnel.
Buzwagi is a shear-hosted quartz-veined deposit hosted in 
porphyritic granite. Buzwagi’s life-of-mine is currently estimated to 
be approximately 13 years, based on its proven and probable gold 
reserves of 2,892,000 ounces. 
Operating performance
Buzwagi’ s gold production for the year was 186,019 ounces, compared 
to 189,031 ounces for the previous year, which only reflected 
eight months of production. This production level was lower than 
management’s expectations for the year and was primarily due to two 
reasons: firstly, the longer-than-expected time taken to process the 
low-grade transitional ore, which adversely impacted throughput and 
plant recoveries, and, secondly, the short-term impact of measures 
taken to address the systematic onsite fuel theft discovered during the 
third quarter. To address these production challenges, management 
focused efforts on training new mining and maintenance personnel and 
improving plant and equipment availability. We also made a number 
of investments in additional mobile mining equipment to help advance 
mining activities and to address delays in the overall production 
timetable. In addition to production challenges, it was also necessary 
to address mill downtime resulting from unplanned breakdown 
and power outages throughout the year, which remain an ongoing 
issue. Production improved over the second half of November and 
throughout December, as the operational measures taken during the 
year began to take effect. The grade of 2.0 g/t was 20% lower than the 
previous year’s (2.5 g/t). This decrease was primarily due to processing 
a different material blend and lower-grade ore when compared to 2009.
to a number of operational improvements, aimed 
at increasing blasting effectiveness and reducing 
wall damage. We intend to continue the expansion 
of our mining fleet in 2011 so as to continue the 
acceleration of stage two mining in the open pit. 
Security
We implemented a number of measures to 
maximise site security. We have enhanced security 
infrastructure with the installation of additional 
perimeter fencing and surveillance equipment and 
we implemented a number of new security checks 
and procedures. We also increased security presence 
both onsite and around the site perimeter and in 
surrounding communities. 
We began to see the positive impact of actions 
undertaken in the fourth quarter, in terms of 
improved plant availability, throughput and 
recoveries. Overall, we believe that Buzwagi is 
now better positioned to deliver on its long-term 
objectives and targets as a result of the actions that  
we have undertaken.  40

Gold ounces sold for the year were 218,684, 3% higher than the 
production of 212,947 ounces and 4% higher than the previous year’s 
ounces sold of 209,495 ounces. The increase in sales ounces was mainly 
due to the sale of ounces on hand at the end of the previous year.
Cash costs for the year were US$472 per ounce sold compared to 
US$508 in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by 
lower administrative expenditure, cost savings achieved in the energy, 
consumables and maintenance areas and the capitalisation of Gokona 
stripping costs.
Cash costs per tonne milled decreased to US$36 in 2010 (US$41 in 
2009). The decrease was primarily due to improved mill productivity, 
processing and administrative costs savings. 
Capital expenditure for the year totalled US$91.4 million, 98% higher 
than the US$46.1 million in the prior year. Key capital expenditure 
driving the increase included capitalised waste stripping mainly relating 
to the Gokona stage two push back (US$49.8 million) and capitalised 
exploration expenditure (US$8.1 million) to define the Gokona Deeps 
underground project.
North Mara mine overview
The North Mara gold mine is located in north west Tanzania in the 
Tarime district of the Mara region, approximately 100 kilometres east 
of Lake Victoria and 20 kilometres south of the Kenyan border. The 
site is accessible by various means, including through the national road 
system and an airstrip located seven kilometres from the processing 
plant. The annual average temperature ranges between 16° and 29°C. 
Average annual rainfall for the region is 1,300mm. 
The North Mara mine consists of four open pit deposits: Nyabirama, 
Gokona and Nyabigena and development potential at Komarera.  
There are also a process plant, waste rock dumps, a tailings containment 
pond and other associated facilities. As at 31 December 2010, a total 
of 1,753 individuals were employed at North Mara, consisting of 829 
Group employees and 924 contracted personnel.
The North Mara gold deposits are situated in the Mara Musoma 
greenstone belt, and there are several types of gold mineralisation, 
including shear-zone-related quartz vein and disseminated gold. North 
Mara’s life-of-mine is estimated to be approximately ten years based on 
its proven and probable gold reserves of 2,836,000 ounces.
Operating performance
North Mara performed in line with expectations and showed stable 
production results. 
The mine’s gold production for the year was 212,947 ounces, remaining 
flat when compared to the prior year figure of 212,358 ounces, where 
lower mine production was offset by strong mill performance. The 
decrease in ore tonnes mined was a result of our continued focus on 
stripping at Gokona, which was offset by increased ore tonnes mined 
from Nyabirama. The 2010 grade of 2.8 g/t compared negatively to 
the 2009 grade of 3.2 g/t. This was the result of processing a higher 
proportion of lower-grade stockpiled ore in the second half of 2010 to 
supplement lower production from the Nyabirama and Nyabigena open 
pits. The processing plant’s throughput of 2,860 Kt was 10% higher than 
the previous year owing to high mill uptime and a favourable ore blend.  42

Operating performance
Tulawaka has successfully outperformed its original feasibility for 
the underground operation in terms of reserve additions and ounce 
production. Throughout the year a key focus of the mine’s management 
has been on exploration and definition drilling to extend the mine life 
beyond 2011. We were pleased to announce an initial extension of the 
life-of-mine as part of our preliminary results announcement and will 
continue to focus on further extensions in 2011. 
The mine’s attributable gold production for the year was 42,094 
ounces compared to the 65,926 ounces achieved in 2009. This lower 
gold production level resulted from mining lower-grade ore from 
the underground pit and processing lower-grade material from the 
stockpiles than in 2009.
Gold ounces sold amounted to 44,736 for the year, 6% higher than 
production and down 32% compared to 2009, reflecting the decline 
in production.
Cash costs for the year were US$709 per ounce sold compared to 
US$413 in the prior year. This cost increase was mainly due to the lower 
production base and increased mining costs compared with 2009. 
The increased mining costs were driven by higher fuel, labour and 
maintenance costs. 
Cash costs per tonne milled increased to US$93 in 2010 (US$87 in 
2009) primarily as a result of the higher cost of underground mining. 
Capital expenditure for the year totalled US$15.5 million compared 
to US$7.9 million for the previous year. Notable investments included 
additional mining equipment (US$4.4 million), increased exploration 
development (US$2.8 million) and the support of mine life extension.
T ulawaka mine overview
The Tulawaka gold mine is located in north west Tanzania in the 
Biharamulo district of the Kagera region. It borders the Bukombe 
district of the Shinyanga region, south west of Lake Victoria near 
the north west border with Rwanda. The mine is approximately 120 
kilometres west of the Bulyanhulu mine and 1,000 kilometres from 
Dar es Salaam. The site is accessible through the existing road network. 
The main paved highway from the railway line from Isaka to Burundi 
passes about 20 kilometres to the south of the mine, while the old 
Dar es Salaam to Burundi laterite road crosses the property three 
kilometres south of the camp. Local roads connect the property to the 
Geita-Biharamulo laterite road. The annual average temperature ranges 
between 25° and 40°C. The average annual rainfall is in the region 
of 860mm. 
The mine consists of a completed open pit mine with an underground 
access ramp located at the bottom of the pit, waste rock dumps, an ore 
stockpile area and crushing plant, a processing plant as well as water, 
waste disposal and ancillary facilities. As at 31 December 2010, a total 
of  13 individuals were employed, comprising 426 Group employees 
and 287 contracted personnel.
Pangea Minerals Limited owns and operates the Tulawaka mine 
assets. However, all capital and operating costs associated with the 
Tulawaka mine and net cash generated by the mine are divided on a 
70:30 basis between ABG subsidiary Pangea Goldfields Inc (70%), and 
MDN (30%), ABG’s joint venture partner for the mine. Further details 
regarding this relationship and the related Tulawaka Agreement are 
provided on page 83. 
The Tulawaka mine comprises two ore bodies, the East Zone and the 
West Zone. The East Zone is the main gold deposit. The West Zone is 
still being explored. Tulawaka’s life-of-mine is currently estimated to 
take operation to the second quarter of 2012, based on its proven and 
probable gold reserves of 67,000 ounces.  44

Exploration review
Progress across the portfolio
ABG is committed to expanding its gold 
resources, reserves and production profile 
through exploration. The current platform of 
operating mines benefits from a significant 
resource base that underpins the Company’s life-
of-mine plans. This resource base has been built 
on our exploration efforts where our average 
finding cost is around US$15 per ounce.

work in a number of countries, assessing the potential for projects 
that would add value through both enhancing our growth profile and 
adding strategically important geographic diversification. From a 
greenfield perspective, in May 2010 we completed the acquisition of 
Tusker Gold for a consideration of approximately US$63 million, net 
of cash acquired. As a result of this acquisition, we now control 100% 
of the Nyanzaga project, which includes the Tusker deposit. This is one 
of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Tanzania.
Overall, the positive progression of our exploration projects and efforts 
throughout the year by the Exploration and Technical Services teams 
clearly shows ABG’s ability to recognise near mine opportunities 
and additional upside opportunities across regional areas. This is 
strategically important, as it supports both our existing production 
platform and organic growth prospects.
Organic growth projects
Brownfield projects 
The North Mara Underground extension
This project is focused on developing underground resources beneath 
the Gokona and Nyabigena open pits. The objective is to bring 
underground resources into production as soon as possible, with the 
aim of processing higher-grade underground ore and displacing some 
of the lower-grade open pit ore in order to increase production levels 
and at the same time extend life-of-mine at North Mara.
As announced in December 2010, following an earlier scoping study, 
we have delineated and validated an initial high-grade underground 
indicated resource of 370,000 ounces of gold at 8.29 g/t beneath the 
planned final Gokona and Nyabigena open pits. This indicates that 
there is the potential to develop a substantial underground operation 
at the Gokona and Nyabigena deposits with an attractive grade profile. 
The underground feasibility study to assess the full potential of the 
current resource on the Gokona-Nyabigena project is on schedule for 
its targeted completion in mid-2011.
ABG’ s commitment to exploration continues to grow, and for 2011 our 
exploration budget is again being increased following the additional 
expenditure in 2010. For 2011, we are budgeting total exploration 
expenditure, both expensed and capitalised, of US$55 million. This 
represents a 103% increase on 2010.
The core objectives under which these funds will be deployed in our 
exploration and development activities are threefold: 
•	 to continue to drive our strategy of organic growth through near 
mine exploration and resource expansion;
•	 to optimise our existing assets through the identification and 
delineation of higher-grade satellite deposits; and 
•	 to progress regional exploration in order to evaluate new 
opportunities throughout Africa, particularly through acquisitions.
Throughout 2010, our Exploration and Technical Services teams 
have principally focused on advancing our organic growth projects 
in and around each of ABG’s current Tanzanian operations, as well as 
advancing important regional exploration programmes at our North 
Mara and Nyanzaga projects.
We are undertaking ongoing feasibility studies at four key projects: 
Golden Ridge, North Mara Underground, Bulyanhulu Upper East 
Zone and the Tulawaka East Zone Underground extension. All four 
studies have progressed in line with our expectations. Of particular 
note were the ongoing feasibility studies at Golden Ridge and 
Bulyanhulu’s Upper East Zone which progressed positively through 
the year. So have our efforts on the East Zone Underground extension 
at Tulawaka, where we have achieved an initial extension of the life of 
the mine. Key achievements during the year included the declaration 
of an initial underground resource at North Mara. Although at an 
earlier stage, we also reported a number of successes in the continuing 
developments of the drill programmes we have been carrying out at the 
Nyanzaga project.
During 2010, ABG reviewed a number of opportunities for regional 
expansion. We are continuing to undertake exploration and evaluation 
Drilling on Gokona Deeps 46
www.africanbarrickgold.com
Exploration continued
In addition, ABG’s exploration group has been completing deep 
diamond drilling in and around the current Gokona underground 
resource area. This drill programme is aimed at extending and 
validating higher-grade mineralised zones. Assay results for this drilling 
programme have now been received for six holes. Results from most of 
these holes have better delineated the extent of higher grade shoots and 
the potential extension of the Gokona West high-grade shoot at depth. 
Based on the positive results of the initial resource estimate and the 
exploration drilling programme we are scheduled to begin a significant 
resource drill-out programme early in 2011. The resource drill-out is 
aimed at expanding the total underground resource to greater than  
one million ounces. We will also use these programmes to demonstrate 
and validate the economic viability of the project. 
North Mara – Nyabigena East
Grade-control activities that we conducted throughout the year 
identified opportunities to extend the Nyabigena resource area at the 
eastern end of the existing open pit. A reverse circulation drilling 
programme initiated during the first quarter of 2010 produced good 
results, highlighting the opportunity to extend mining operations in the 
Nyabigena East Main Zone and significantly close the gap between the 
Nyabigena main pit and the Nyabigena East mineralisation. 
The results of infill programmes conducted during the year have 
led to the upgrade from ‘Inferred’ to ‘Indicated’ of the resource of 
Nyabigena East, for which a pit has been outlined as part of the 
Nyabigena operations. 
North Mara – Gokona Corridor
In addition to the underground targets at North Mara, we are also 
undertaking significant additional exploration elsewhere around the 
mine, particularly along the Gokona Corridor.
The Gokona Corridor extends approximately six kilometres north west 
of the Gokona deposit and approximately ten kilometres south east of 
the Nyabigena deposit. Historically, very little effective drilling has been 
completed outside the immediate mine area. For this reason, during 
2010 we completed a reverse circulation scout drilling programme 
along this corridor to test for additional gold deposits. Initial results 
are encouraging with several holes intersecting anomalous gold zones 
(>100ppb Au) along with zones of alteration and veining. To build on 
this progress and accurately assess gold deposit potential, we are now 
carrying out a significant programme of multi-element geochemistry 
on the drill samples in conjunction with the gold analysis. Additional 
scout drilling and follow-up of the 2010 scout drilling will be ongoing 
throughout 2011. 
Tulawaka East Zone Underground extension
Throughout the year, the focus of our near mine expansion programmes 
at Tulawaka was on the East Zone Underground extensions. The 
objective of the drilling here is to identify and delineate additional 
high-grade gold reserves and resources below the current East Zone 
underground infrastructure, with the primary purpose of extending 
the life of the Tulawaka mine.
Our exploration drilling continued to extend the known high-grade 
mineralised shoots below the Level 7 resource we had previously 
defined, indicating potential to extend the mine life further. Overall, 
our drilling programmes indicate that existing mineralised zones 
continue to at least 150 metres below the floor of Tulawaka’s now-
completed open pit. We expect to continue drill programmes 
throughout 2011, which will aim to extend known high-grade zones 
for a further 100-200 metres below currently defined depths. In this 
way, we will be able to assess the possible significant expansion of our 
current resource base to add further reserves and extend the mine life 
through an exclusively underground operation. 
Golden Ridge
Approximately 55 kilometres north of the Buzwagi operation, the 
Golden Ridge project represents an important opportunity for ABG 
to exploit a higher-grade mineralisation deposit as a satellite feed to 
the Buzwagi mill. Findings to date indicate that it has the potential to 
produce between 70,000 and 100,000 ounces per year from 2013/14.
Tulawaka East Zone – West Pit Portal into Underground Annual Report and Accounts 2010
47
Overview Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Performance
We are actively progressing the feasibility study, which is scheduled 
for completion by mid-2011, in furtherance of our initial resource 
declaration. ABG’s exploration team completed a programme of infill 
reverse circulation drilling and metallurgical test-work diamond 
drilling during 2010. Elements of this programme confirmed the 
width and tenor of mineralisation in the main zone and indicated the 
potential for further exploration drilling to target higher-grade areas. 
Bulyanhulu Upper East Zone
The Bulyanhulu Upper East Zone is approximately 2.5 kilometres east 
of the main Bulyanhulu shaft and contains approximately one million 
gold ounces at 10 g/t within Reef 1 and 2. The mineralisation in the 
Bulyanhulu Upper East Zone is included in current reserves, but it 
was not scheduled for mining until later in the mine life. However, 
following review of planning models and previous feasibility studies, 
we are now considering accelerating the timetable for mining the Upper 
East Zone within the overall life of mine. This would make use of an 
existing 1.8-kilometre decline to this zone, which is being dewatered 
and rehabilitated, as well as utilising excess milling capacity in the 
process plant.
We started a further feasibility study into the Upper East Zone area 
during the year. We intend to complete this study in the first half of 
2011, allowing us to assess the viability of mining the reserves in the 
zone earlier than anticipated in the current life-of-mine plan. 
Bulyanhulu Reef 1 and 2 West
During the year, we completed reverse circulation drilling programmes 
on areas of Reef 2 West, along with Reef 1 and Reef 0b targets where 
there has previously been relatively limited exploration drilling. 
Favourable results from this programme warrant a second phase 
of follow-up drilling so that we can identify additional near surface 
resources for either open pit or underground mining. We are planning 
deeper drill holes targeting extensions of higher-grade zones in early 
2011 from the existing underground development at Bulyanhulu.
Greenfield projects
The Nyanzaga project 
W e took control of 100% of the Nyanzaga project following completion 
of our acquisition of Tusker Gold in May 2010. Since then the focus 
of our exploration activities has remained on further delineating and 
expanding the project’s current resources. 
The actions we have taken include an aggressive reverse circulation 
and diamond-core step-out and infill drill programme on the Tusker 
and Kilimani resource areas. Additionally, these drill programmes 
also commenced testing of geophysical and geochemical targets across 
the Nyanzaga project area for large-scale gold deposits and additional 
satellite opportunities within 15 kilometres of the Tusker resource area. 
T usker Gold declared an inferred resource of approximately 4.2 million 
ounces for the Nyanzaga project in June 2009. Our current drill 
programme aims to confirm and expand this resource base, and it has 
shown positive results to date. Step-out and infill drilling on the southern 
strike extensions of the T usker prospect have identified wide, higher-grade 
extensions of gold mineralisation. In particular, recent intercepts indicate 
that mineralisation on the southern extensions of the Tusker resource 
area occurs closer to surface than previously modelled, and deeper 
intersections indicate the potential for grade quality to increase with depth 
in this area of the system. In addition, results obtained from the drill 
programme are showing potential to locate additional resources on the 
north end of the T usker resource area. 
In 2011, our drilling will continue to focus on extending mineralisation 
on the northern, western and southern domains of the T usker deposit, 
and given the success of the drill programme to date, we will expand 
step-out drilling to allow accelerated follow-up of identified positive 
intersections. Infill drilling on the main resource area will commence 
to upgrade the existing mineral inventory and inferred resources. 
We aim to initiate a scoping study later in 2011 as we gain a greater 
understanding of the extent of the mineralisation on the Tusker and 
Kilimani project areas.

The purpose of this review is to provide a detailed analysis of the 
ABG Group’s consolidated 2010 results and the main factors affecting 
financial performance. This section should be read in conjunction 
with the financial statements and accompanying notes on pages 
100-147, which have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European 
Union (IFRS).
The ABG Group achieved robust financial results over the course of 
the year. Increased revenue from higher sales volume and increases in 
the average realised gold price for the full year have had a very positive 
impact on Group earnings and cash flow. Overall, increased sales and 
average realised gold prices resulted in a year-end cash position of 
approximately US$401 million. The US$150 million undrawn revolving 
credit facility, which we finalised during the latter half of the year 
strengthens the Company’s financial position and provides us with 
additional financial flexibility going into 2011. Cash costs per ounce 
averaged at US$569, mainly as a result of additional expenses incurred  
at Buzwagi. 
Revenue
Revenue for the year of US$975.0 million was 37% higher than the prior 
year period of US$711.2 million after restating 2009 revenue to include 
co-product revenue as set out below. The Group generated a year-on-
year sales volume increase of 40,396 ounces and benefited from higher 
average realised gold prices resulting from global economic conditions 
that drove market gold prices to record levels. The increase in sales was 
primarily due to the sale of unsold ounces on hand at the beginning of 
the year in gold concentrate at Buzwagi and Bulyanhulu. The average 
realised gold price was US$1,240 per ounce in 2010 compared to 
US$974 per ounce in 2009.
Co-product revenue totalled US$53.7 million for the year. This 
represents an increase of 202% from the prior year period (US$17.8 
million). The ramp-up of Buzwagi production of gold/copper 
The ABG Group achieved robust financial

to be positively influenced by factors such as demand from Asia, 
global economic growth, the limited availability of scrap metal, and 
production levels of mines and smelters in the future.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales was US$589.0 million for the year ended 31 December 
2010, representing an increase of 21% from the prior year period 
(US$487.0 million) after restating 2009 cost of sales to reclassify co-
product revenue as noted above. The key operational activities that 
impacted cost of sales during the year included the following: (i) the 
transition of Buzwagi from a project to a full-year operation and the 
associated operational challenges it faced in 2010; (ii) the transition 
of the North Mara mine from a three-pit operation to focusing on the 
investment in the stage two push back at the Gokona open pit; and (iii) 
production stability at Bulyanhulu providing the opportunity to focus 
on cost optimisation.
During 2009, a significant build-up in low-grade ore stockpiles at 
North Mara and Buzwagi and copper concentrate at Buzwagi increased 
inventories by US$63 million. The unsold gold was subsequently 
sold in 2010. 
Revenue-related costs such as royalties and third-party smelting and 
refining fees increased by US$15.9 million following the rising trend 
in revenue and concentrate volume. The increase in the third-party 
smelting and refining charges has been impacted by increased metal 
prices and costs attributable to sales of gold and copper concentrate 
at Buzwagi, when compared to no such sales in 2009. Depreciation 
and amortisation was US$109.5 million for the year. This represents 
an increase of 17% from the prior year period (US$93.4 million). This 
increase is due to the higher capital investment base employed in 2010 
as a result of the commercial completion of Buzwagi and the rate of 
depreciation when compared to other older operations.

The consolidated direct mining expenses totalled US$437.4 million for 
the year. This represents an increase of 5% from the prior year period 
(US$418.3 million). The key reasons for the increase can be attributed 
to a full-year of operating costs at Buzwagi, compared to eight months 
of operating costs in 2009, and the operational challenges it faced.  
concentrate contributed to the increase in copper sales volumes.  
The 2010 average realised copper price of US$3.55 per pound compared 
to the prior period realised price of US$2.24 per pound assisted greatly 
in the increase in co-product revenue. For these reasons, the Group 
has reclassified copper and silver as co-product revenue to reflect their 
increased significance as a percentage of revenue. The table below 
provides a reconciliation between gold and co-product revenue for 2010 
and the 2009 comparative.

Commodity prices
Gold prices have a significant impact on ABG’s operating earnings and 
its ability to generate cash flows. In 2010 the price of gold reached an 
all-time high, trading in a range of US$1,045 to US$1,431 per ounce 
and closing at US$1,421 per ounce. Market gold prices averaged 
US$1,225 per ounce, a new annual average record and a US$253 per 
ounce improvement on the US$972 per ounce average in the prior 
year period. 
The market price of gold has been influenced by low US dollar interest 
rates, sovereign debt concerns, investment demand and the monetary 
policies put in place by the world’s most prominent central banks. As 
a result of the global easing of monetary policy, as well as large fiscal 
deficits incurred in the US and other major developed economies, 
there is a possibility that both inflation and US dollar depreciation 
could emerge in the coming years. Gold is viewed as a hedge against 
inflation and has historically been inversely correlated to the US dollar. 
Therefore, higher inflation and/or depreciation in the US dollar should 
be positive for the price of gold. 
Gold prices also continue to be influenced by negative long-term 
trends in global gold mine production, the impact of central bank gold 
purchases and investor interest in owning gold. In 2010, gold sales by 
central banks were not significant, while investor interest led holdings 
by major global ETFs to increase by ten million ounces in the year to 
total 69 million ounces at the end of the period. Historically, gold has 
been viewed as a reliable store of value in times of financial uncertainty 
and inflation and as a de facto global currency. Investor interest in gold 
as an asset class has increased greatly as a result of this.
ABG also produces copper as a co-product that is recognised in 
revenue. Copper prices rose in 2010, particularly in the second half, 
trading in a range of US$2.74 to US$4.42 per pound. The average 
price for the year was US$3.42 per pound and closed the year at an 
all-time high of US$4.42 per pound. Copper’s rise during the period 
resulted from a number of factors including strong demand from 
emerging markets, especially China, decreasing exchange stockpiles 
and increasing investor interest in base metals with strong forward-
looking supply/demand outlooks. Copper prices should continue

•	 Maintenance costs on a comparable basis were higher, primarily 
driven by plant breakdowns and a full year of operation at Buzwagi. 
In addition, Tulawaka costs were high due to mining equipment 
failure and its transition to in-house maintenance. 
•	 Contractor services consist mainly of maintenance and repair 
contractors (‘MARC’) and drilling/geology services at Buzwagi and 
North Mara. MARC costs at Buzwagi increased due to the increase 
in size and age of the mining fleet and a full year of operation. 
•	 General and administrative costs increased modestly compared to 
2009 as a result of additional security costs at Buzwagi.
•	 Capitalised direct mining costs consisted of capitalised operating 
costs to reflect deferred stripping at North Mara, underground mine 
development at Bulyanhulu and, to a lesser extent, Tulawaka. 
Other operating costs in the previous year related to net realisable value 
write-downs relating to supplies inventory. 
Cash costs
Cash costs for 2010 were US$569 per ounce sold, a 7% increase over 
2009’ s cash cost per ounce sold (US$533). The increase can be explained 
by lower-than-expected production levels at Buzwagi, combined with 
increased costs incurred in dealing with operating challenges at the 
mine partially offset by improved co-product sales, now classified as 
revenue, which we deduct from cash costs as set out on page 54. Cash 
costs at Buzwagi for the year were US$685 per ounce sold, compared 
to the previous year’s US$422. Both North Mara and Bulyanhulu 
performed in line with expectations from a cash costs perspective. 
A lower production base at Tulawaka resulted in a 72% increase in 
cash costs per ounce sold at the mine, when compared to 2009.

Bulyanhulu showed an 8% (US$12.9 million) improvement in costs 
driven by improved cost management measures lowering consumable, 
maintenance, and contracted services costs, which were partially offset 
by increased labour costs from increased head count and inflationary 
increases in remuneration. Direct mining costs at North Mara remained 
flat versus 2009 and significant resources were focused on increased 
capitalised stripping of the Gokona stage two push back. Tulawaka costs 
increased by 23% (US$5.7 million) due to the cost of labour, energy, 
maintenance and administration costs required to mine and process 
ore at a lower grade. Buzwagi costs increased by 71%, due to the cost 
of operating the mine on a full year basis as opposed to eight months 
in 2009 and the costs incurred in addressing production challenges 
experienced during the year. In addition, the higher energy costs caused 
by the onsite fuel theft, and increased cost pressure from additional 
operational initiatives taken to improve performance resulted in higher 
labour, maintenance, consumables and administration expenditure.
Individual cost components comprise:
•	 Labour costs have been impacted by increased head count at Buzwagi 
and Bulyanhulu and inflationary pressure in remuneration to attract 
and retain personnel. 
•	 Energy and diesel fuel expenses account for all electricity, diesel 
fuel, and oil/lubricant expenditures. On a comparable basis Buzwagi 
drove costs higher partly due to increased milling activity and the 
consequence of the fuel theft. The realised WTI crude oil cost per 
barrel, the key input of diesel, rose from an average of US$62 to 
US$80 in 2010 contributing to higher energy costs. This increase 
in diesel costs was partially offset by North Mara converting from 
self-generation of electricity to drawing from the national power grid 
which resulted in lower costs and less exposure to global fuel prices. 
•	 Consumable costs on a comparable basis have remained in line 
with 2009 with Bulyanhulu driving cost savings through better cost 
management partly offset by higher costs at Buzwagi. Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Overview Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Performance
Finance expense and income
The finance expense decreased to US$1.8 million for the year, compared 
to US$6.1 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of the 
repayment of the external debt facility at North Mara during the first 
half of 2009. Finance expense for 2010 primarily relates to the interest 
expense associated with discounting of the environmental reclamation 
liabilities as well as the initial fee payable for the US$150 million credit 
facility that was completed during November 2010. The initial fees to 
complete the transaction such as the participation fee and related legal 
costs will be amortised over the 24-month term of the facility. ABG will 
incur a monthly commitment fee equal to 40% of the interest margin 
above LIBOR as negotiated in the agreement. Currently, ABG has no 
external debt. 
Finance income relates predominantly to interest charged on  
non-current receivables and interest received on cash balances.
T axation expense
The taxation expense increased to US$86.5 million for the year, 
compared to US$84.4 million in 2009. The 2010 expense consists 
of deferred tax of US$86.2 million and corporate taxes of US$0.3 
million which were incurred in 2010. The higher tax expense relates 
to the increased taxable income for 2010, which was generated mainly 
from North Mara and Bulyanhulu as a result of improved margins 
from higher gold prices. The effective tax rate in 2010 amounted to 
28% compared to 56% in 2009. The 2009 reconciliation includes an 
amount of US$36.9 million relating to an increase in the amount of 
unrecognised tax benefits carried forward.
Disposals and acquisitions
Acquisition of Tusker Gold
On 27 April 2010, ABG, through BUK Holdco Limited, one of its 
immediate subsidiaries, acquired Tusker Gold by way of a takeover offer 
for a total aggregate purchase price of US$74 million. Tusker Gold held 
a 49% interest in the Nyanzaga project, with the ABG Group owning 
the remaining 51%. ABG now owns 100% of the Nyanzaga project. 
Further details on this project are provided in the Exploration review 
and further details on the Tusker Gold acquisition are provided in note 
22 to the financial statements.
Net profit for the period
As a result of the factors discussed above, net profit for the year 
ended 31 December 2010 was US$222.6 million. This represents an 
increase of 237% from the prior year period (US$66.0 million). The 
key drivers were increased revenue as a result of a continued positive 
gold price environment combined with higher sales ounces. This 
was partially offset by increased costs of sales which were primarily 
due to the additional cost base from a full year of production at 
Buzwagi, increased direct mining expenditure across all sites, the 
increased taxation expense; and increased exploration and evaluation 
expenditure incurred.
Corporate administration costs
Corporate administration costs totalled US$35.4 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2010. This equated to a 6% decrease from 
the prior year period of US$37.8 million. Corporate administration 
comprised the expenses associated with maintaining the Dar es 
Salaam, Johannesburg and London offices. Costs include salaries, office 
rent, consulting, legal, audit fees and investor relations expenses. The 
decrease was predominantly driven by a saving in corporate labour 
costs due to the reorganisation exercise completed during the second 
half of 2009 with the transition from Dar es Salaam to Johannesburg. 
This was largely offset by the increased costs to run a publicly listed 
company and costs of a London office which was not fully functional 
until mid 2010. 
Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation costs are incurred to advance the 
exploration at our greenfield projects. For 2010, US$14.9 million was 
incurred, approximately 68% higher than the US$8.9 million incurred 
in the same period in 2009. Key focus for the year was exploration 
and step-out drilling at Nyanzaga of US$7.2 million, US$1.3 million 
at Golden Ridge to perform metallurgical sampling and resource 
modelling, and US$3.6 million at Tulawaka to test satellite open pit 
opportunities. The increased expenditure supports the current focus 
on growth projects around existing sites, some of which are close to 
entering the feasibility stage. 
Where it is probable that resources will be converted into reserves, the 
expenditure is capitalised. During 2010 an amount of US$12.2 million 
of exploration costs was capitalised compared to US$2.8 million in 2009. 
Other charges
Other charges amounted to US$26.0 million for the year, 22% up from 
the 2009 amount of US$21.4 million. Other charges consist mostly of 
one-off costs including foreign exchange gains and losses (previously 
deemed part of corporate administration), gains and losses on 
disposals, social development costs, IPO listing costs, asset write-downs 
and provision movements. The main contributors to the expense are 
the following: (i) foreign exchange losses of US$7.9 million (US$10.7 
million in 2009) from the continued devaluation of the Tanzanian 
shilling against the US dollar impairing the TZS denominated assets 
on the balance sheet; (ii) US$3.5 million spent during the year on 
corporate social programmes, compared to US$1.0 million in 2009; 
(iii) ABG’s entry into zero cost collar contracts as part of a programme 
to protect it against copper market volatilities, which resulted in an 
unrealised mark-to-market revaluation loss of US$3.7 million at year 
end; and (iv) IPO transaction costs of US$2.6 million. 
Other costs incurred related to the reversal of a Buzwagi fuel levy 
claim associated with the fuel theft of US$2.5 million, the net provision 
to account for the discounting impact of indirect tax receivables of 
US$6.8 million (US$6.9 million in 2009) and adjustments to existing 
indirect tax provisions which were offset with an insurance claim 
received in respect of a claim settled in relation to an excavator 
destroyed in 2009. 52

Cash flow from operating activities was US$345.1 million for the 
year, an increase of US$151.1 million on the prior year (US$194.0 
million). The increase primarily related to increased EBITDA which 
was partially offset by working capital movements. EBITDA has 
predominantly been driven by increased revenue due to both price 
and sales volume increases. Working capital was adversely impacted by 
the outflow associated with the increase in indirect tax receivable and 
prepayments of US$48.8 million; a decrease in trade and other payables 
of US$28.5 million; investment in ore inventory of US$16.0 million 
and supplies inventory of US$9.6 million which was in part offset 
by a reduction in gold sales receivables and finished gold due to the 
introduction of quarterly counterparty advance settlement and backlog 
concentrate sold during the year. 
Throughout 2010, ABG has been actively involved in discussions with 
the Tanzanian government and the Tanzanian Revenue Authority to 
resolve the status of fuel excise levies and V AT refunds for its operations. 
These issues have been outstanding for some time and were further 
complicated by amendments made to certain tax laws which were 
passed in 2009. The amendments conflicted with certain provisions 
contained in our existing MDAs which guarantee the fiscal stability 
of our operations. We are pleased to report that the Government has 
adopted legislation to reverse the amendments, which should allow for 
the fiscal and tax terms of our MDAs to be honoured. This represents a 
significant step in supporting the stability of the legal framework for the 
mining industry in Tanzania. As at 31 December 2010, the discounted 
outstanding amounts due to us were approximately US$121 million. We 
are in discussions with the authorities to agree terms for the repayment 
of these amounts, which is likely to be by way of tax offsets.
Cash flow used in investing activities equalled US$275.6 million for 
the year. This represents an increase of 11% from the prior year of 
US$248.5 million. The increase includes net cash of US$63.1 million 
used for the acquisition of Tusker Gold, taking into account the cash in 
that business on the purchase date, as well as US$9.7 million in settling 
outstanding Tusker Gold stock options. Total capital expenditure for 
the year of US$224.4 million increased slightly from the prior year 
figure of US$223.3 million. Key projects include the Bulyanhulu 
Underground development, Buzwagi mining equipment and additional 
North Mara processing and mining projects, North Mara deferred strip 
of US$51.1 million, as well as US$12.2 million relating to capitalised 
Net profit attributable to non-controlling interest
The net profit attributable to the non-controlling interest for the 
year ended 31 December 2010 was US$4.5 million. This represents 
a decrease of 39% on 2009 (US$7.4 million), due to lower production 
and increased exploration activity at the Tulawaka operation.
EBITDA
EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2010 increased by 68% to 
US$419.2 million compared to the prior year period (US$249.5 million) 
as a result of improved gold prices along with increased ounces sold 
supported further by record co-product revenue. This was partly offset 
by an increase in direct mining cost base predominantly driven by 
Buzwagi as it only reflected eight months’ direct mining costs in the 
prior year period, increased direct mining costs across some sites as well 
as increased revenue related costs such as royalties, smelting, refining 
and transport costs. Note that EBITDA includes the impact of other 
charges totalling US$26.0 million which comprise mostly one-off type 
expenditure. A reconciliation between net profit for the period and

2009 to US$258.5 million in 2010. The increase related to acquired 
exploration and evaluation properties of US$80.1 million as well as 
goodwill of US$22.0 million relating to the acquisition of Tusker.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment increased from 
US$1.5 billion in 2009 to US$1.6 billion in 2010. The main capital 
expenditure drivers have been explained in the cash flow used in 
investing activities section above, and have been offset by depreciation 
charges of US$107.1 million.
Total indirect tax receivables, net of a discount provision applied to 
the non-current portion, increased from US$77.8 million in 2009 to 
US$121.2 million in 2010. Throughout 2010 ABG has been actively 
involved in discussions with the Tanzanian Government and the 
Tanzanian Revenue Authority to recover the fuel excise levies and 
the V AT refunds for its operations, which is likely to be by way of 
tax offsets. 
The net deferred tax position decreased from a net deferred tax asset 
of US$93.3 million in 2009 to a net deferred tax liability of US$14.9 
million. This was driven by the taxable income generated during 
2010. Details of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are contained 
within Note 20 “Deferred tax assets and liabilities” to the 2009 
financial statements.
Net assets attributable to owners of the parent increased by US$1.9 
billion to US$2.5 billion at 31 December 2010. The increase reflects the 
net proceeds from the IPO including the exercise of the overallotment 
option of US$865.4 million net of transaction costs, the conversion 
of certain related party borrowings into equity as part of the pre-IPO 
reorganisation of US$1.0 billion as well as the current year profit 
attributable to owners of the parent of US$218.1 million. This was offset 
by the payment of a special dividend as part of the IPO reorganisation 
of US$253.0 million, the repayment of intergroup borrowings to other 
members of the Barrick Group and payment of an interim dividend of 
US$6.6 million to shareholders during 2010.
Debt decreased from US$1.4 billion in 2009 to zero in 2010. The 2009 
balance all related to related party borrowings from other entities in 
the Barrick Group. US$575.1 million of the debt was repaid through 
proceeds generated from the IPO while the remaining portion was 
converted into equity through the Pre-IPO Reorganisation.
exploration. The US$248.5 million capital spent in 2009 was primarily 
driven by US$101.2 million spent on the construction of Buzwagi.
Total cash capital decreased from the prior year and amounted to 
US$196.4 million for 2010 (US$207.4 million for 2009) and reflects 
adjustments made for non-cash reclamation additions.

2 Non-current asset movement relates to the investment in the powerline and land 
acquisitions reflected as prepaid operating leases; Tanzania government receivables; 
villlage housing project; and other items. Note that for 2010 the long-term indirect tax 
movement has been reflected as part of working capital in the cash flow from operational 
activities section which amounted to US$36.7 million. US$26.5 million was classified in 
2009 in the non-current asset movement as part of the cash flow from investing activities. 
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended 31 December 
2010 of US$262.0 million increased 268% from the prior year of 
US$71.0 million. The increase primarily relates to ABG’s IPO and is 
further supported by the partial exercise of the overallotment option. 
In total the IPO and the overallotment option proceeds resulted in 
US$865 million after deduction of transaction costs. This was in part 
offset by the payment of a special dividend and the repayment of inter-
group loans to other members of Barrick Group as part of the Pre-IPO 
Reorganisation. The inflow in 2009 was predominantly funded by 
Barrick to support the construction costs associated with Buzwagi and 
repayment of external debt at North Mara as well as distributions paid 
to non-controlling interests at Tulawaka. An interim dividend of US$6.6 
million was paid during Q3 of this year. 
At 31 December 2010 ABG had cash and cash equivalents of 
US$401.0 million.
Credit facility
On 24 November 2010, ABG and its wholly owned subsidiary BarbCo 
One Ltd entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial 
banks, for the provision of a revolving credit facility in a maximum 
aggregate amount of US$150 million. The facility has been provided 
to service the general corporate needs of the ABG Group and to fund 
potential acquisitions. All provisions contained in the credit facility 
documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and 
customary terms for such finance arrangements. The term of the 
facility is 24 months and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will 
be 350 basis points. No amounts were drawn down on the facility at 
31 December 2010.

Going concern statement 
The ABG Group’ s business activities, together with factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Overview and Performance sections of this report. The financial position 
of the ABG Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the preceding paragraphs of this financial 
review. In addition, Notes 28 and 29 to the financial statements include 
the Group’ s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
In assessing the ABG Group’s going concern status the Directors have 
taken into account the above factors, including the financial position 
of the ABG Group and in particular its significant cash position, the 
current gold and copper price and market expectations for the same 
in the medium term, and the ABG Group’s capital expenditure and 
financing plans. 
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that ABG 
and the ABG Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it is appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Non-IFRS Measures
ABG has identified certain measures in this report that are not 
measures defined under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures disclosed 
by management are provided as additional information to investors 
in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing 
ABG’s financial condition and operating results. These measures are 
not in accordance with, or a substitute for, IFRS, and may be different 
from or inconsistent with non-IFRS financial measures used by other 
companies. These measures are explained further below.
Average realised gold price per ounce sold is a non-IFRS financial 
measure which excludes from gold revenue:
•	 Unrealised gains and losses on non hedge derivative contracts
•	 Unrealised mark to market gains and losses on provisional pricing 
from copper and gold sales contracts; and
•	 Export duties.
Cash costs per ounce sold is a non-IFRS financial measure. Cash costs 
include all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as royalties, by-product 
credits, and production taxes, and exclude capitalised production 
stripping costs, inventory purchase accounting adjustments, unrealised 
gains/losses from non-hedge currency and commodity contracts, 
depreciation and amortisation and social development costs. Cash 
cost is further adjusted by deducting co-product revenue. This reflects 
a change in the cash cost measurement which follows the decision by 
management to present the sale of copper and silver as co-product 
revenue and part of total revenue.

Significant judgements in applying accounting policies and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty
Many of the amounts included in the Consolidated financial statements 
require management to make judgements and/or estimates. These 
judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are based 
on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant facts 
and circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the consolidated financial information included in this 
report. Information about such judgements and estimation is included 
in the accounting policies and/or notes to the Consolidated financial 
statements, and the key areas are summarised below.
Areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
Consolidated financial statements include:
•	 Estimates of the quantities of proven and probable gold reserves;
•	 The capitalisation of waste stripping costs;
•	 The capitalisation of exploration and evaluation expenditures;
•	 Review of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets carrying value, 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired and the 
measurement of impairment charges or reversals;
•	 The estimated fair values of cash generating units for impairment 
tests, including estimates of future costs to produce proven and 
probable reserves, future commodity prices, foreign exchange rates 
and discount rates;
•	 The estimated useful lives of tangible and long-lived assets and the 
measurement of depreciation expense; 
•	 Recognition of a provision for environmental rehabilitation and the 
estimation of the rehabilitation costs and timing of expenditure;
•	 Whether to recognise a liability for loss contingencies and the 
amount of any such provision;
•	 Whether to recognise a provision for accounts receivable and the 
impact of discounting the non-current element; Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information

Performance
The presentation of these statistics in this manner allows ABG to 
monitor and manage those factors that impact production costs on  
a monthly basis. ABG calculates cash costs based on its equity interest 
in production from its mines. Cash costs per ounce sold are calculated 
by dividing the aggregate of these costs by gold ounces sold. Cash costs 
and cash costs per ounce sold are calculated on a consistent basis for 
the periods presented. Refer to page 50 as part of the financial review 
section for a reconciliation of cost of sales to cash costs. 
EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. ABG calculates EBITDA 
as net profit or loss for the period excluding:
•	 Income tax expense;
•	 Finance expense;
•	 Finance income;
•	 Depreciation and amortisation; and
•	 Goodwill impairment charges.
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and 
analysts. It does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS 
and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures 
of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes 
the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects 
of changes in operating working capital balances, and therefore is not 
necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations 
as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate EBITDA 
differently. Refer to page 52 as part of the financial review section for 
a reconciliation of net profit to EBITDA. 
EBIT is a non-IFRS financial measure and reflects EBITDA adjusted 
for depreciation and amortisation and goodwill impairment charges.
Amortisation and other cost per ounce sold is a non-IFRS financial 
measure. Amortisation and other costs include amortisation and 
depreciation expenses and the inventory purchase accounting 
adjustments at ABG’s producing mines. ABG calculates amortisation 
and other costs based on its equity interest in production from its 
mines. Amortisation and other costs per ounce sold is calculated 
by dividing the aggregate of these costs by ounces of gold sold. 
Amortisation and other cost per ounce sold are calculated on a 
consistent basis for the periods presented.
Cash cost per tonne milled is a non-IFRS financial measure. Cash costs 
include all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as royalties, by-product 
credits, and production taxes, and exclude capitalised production 
stripping costs, inventory purchase accounting adjustments, unrealised 
gains/losses from non-hedge currency and commodity contracts, 
depreciation and amortisation and social development costs. Cash 
cost is calculated net of co-product revenue, and is measured on a co-
product basis. ABG calculates cash costs based on its equity interest in 
production from its mines. Cash costs per tonne milled are calculated 
by dividing the aggregate of these costs by total tonnes milled.
Operating cash flow per share is a non-IFRS financial measure and is 
calculated by dividing Net cash generated by operating activities by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue. 56

Over the course of 2010, positive developments were evident in all 
of these areas, and there has been a marked improvement in the 
relationships between our Company and our local stakeholders, 
particularly at North Mara where a number of legacy issues are being 
proactively addressed. 
Social management expertise
Operating in rural areas of Tanzania necessitates dealing with certain 
intrinsic challenges, with limited infrastructure and social services in 
place, and many members of the communities in which we operate 
faced with the daily challenges of poverty. That the country’s mining 
sector is in its relative infancy means that our host communities have 
high expectations of the economic benefits that an individual private-
sector organisation can deliver.
These challenges demand a strong understanding of the complexities 
of the operating environment in Tanzania. Consequently, ABG has 
instituted an energetic and committed Community Relations team of 50 
full-time employees with expertise in social management. During 2010 
Community Relations staffing levels were increased at three of our four 
mine sites and at North Mara internationally recognised consultancies 
continue to support the mine’s community relations and resettlement 
programmes. Recognising ABG’s focus on future expansion, during 
2010 the Community Relations function liaised more closely with our 
Exploration and Projects personnel to focus on laying the foundations 
for effective community relations at the earliest stage possible. 
In addition to the work this team carries out, we also enable effective 
social management through: 
•	 our senior management team’s extensive experience of operating 
in Africa; 
•	 a culture where it is the responsibility of every employee to ‘behave 
like an owner’ and act as a positive ambassador for the Company in 
our host communities;
•	 close collaboration with other disciplines such as environment, 
security, human resources and health and safety; and 
•	 the development of a community relations management system that 
will combine all our existing requirements, guidelines and tools into 
a single streamlined approach.
We believe that our people are our most valuable asset, and our 
objective is to become the employer of choice. We respect, value and 
support our people, and we are firm believers in investing in them to 
improve their skills and increase their job satisfaction. W e are committed 
to providing the training and development opportunities they need to 
advance in their careers and deliver on our business objectives. 
Guided by our corporate vision that ‘everyone goes home safe and 
healthy every day’ , safety is our most important consideration. We 
believe that work-related injuries or illnesses are unacceptable, and 
have set a zero incidence goal for the Company. Over the past year, we 
have implemented various health and safety initiatives to promote the 
achievement of superior safety performance among ABG workers by 
providing them with the skills and knowledge to perform their tasks 
in a safe and reliable way.
At ABG, we also strive to meet high environmental standards 
while continuously pursuing new avenues and opportunities for 
improvement. We adhere to Tanzania’s environmental laws and 
incorporate international best practice into our activities. This is all 
part of our commitment to reviewing and incorporating external best 
practice into our own environmental policies and procedures. 
Community relations
ABG is committed to operating in a socially responsible way over the 
entire life-cycle of our mines, to ensure that local communities have 
the opportunity to share in the benefits of our activities. 
The most important ways in which we do this are by:
•	 identifying and mitigating any potential negative impacts of mining;
•	 engaging in an open and meaningful manner and respecting 
stakeholders’ priorities and concerns;
•	 maximising community members’ opportunities to benefit from 
employment and local procurement; and 
•	 developing programmes to assist local communities to pursue their 
own long-term socio-economic priorities. 
Corporate responsibility
Acting responsibly
Working closely with 
communities in Tanzania
Developing positive community relations is a core 
part of the way ABG does business, not only as a 
corporate responsibility but as a vital requirement 
for our continued operational success. For me, 
Community Relations as a function not only deals 
with how we manage potential social impacts 
that mining creates but also how we enhance 
opportunities and benefits for the communities 
where we live and work. 
At ABG we believe it is critical to establish mutually beneficial relationships with 
the communities in which we operate. Maintaining our social licence to operate 
is central to our ethos of responsible mining. It will help to ensure a stable 
operating environment for our existing assets and allow our Exploration team 
access to prospective ground.  Overview Governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Externally, we continue to develop our community relations practices 
through engaging with key organisations including: 
•	 the International Council on Mining & Metals; 
•	 the World Bank; and 
•	 the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, T uberculosis and Malaria.
In 2011, we expect to have the opportunity to improve our performance 
by learning from the findings of a community benefit study conducted 
in 2010 by the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and Minerals and the 
World Bank. The study assesses the impact of mining operations in 
Tanzania, and features our mines at Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi.
Stakeholder engagement
We are committed to inclusive and transparent community engagement 
in order to build and maintain trust with our host communities and to 
ensure that our activities are informed by their perspectives, concerns 
and priorities. This process involves identifying stakeholders, engaging 
in disclosure and consultation processes and operating appropriate 
and effective feedback mechanisms. We give specific consideration to 
inclusivity and gender-sensitivity in all our activities.
We maintain an ongoing dialogue with individuals, community leaders, 
government representatives and non-governmental organisations. 
Furthermore, we have:
•	 established a formal grievance procedure which allows local 
stakeholders to have any complaints investigated and resolved;
•	 trained and employed local community members to act as village 
liaison officers providing a two-way conduit of information 
and feedback;
•	 created liaison centres within the communities around three of our 
mines to ensure that all community members have easy access to 
information about mine activities; and
•	 used sports programmes to build local relationships and convey key 
messages on issues such as public health.
Performance
Highlights from 2010 and our targets for 2011
Focus Achievements in 2010 Targets for 2011
Employees
Improvements made to ABG’s management team 
throughout the year and successful secondment 
programme to address personnel capacity issues faced  
at Buzwagi.
Continue development of ABG as an employer of choice 
and continue improvement of employee skillsets.
Health and Safety
All of ABG’s operations achieved one million working 
hours without lost time injuries in 2010.
Implementation of an ABG health and safety plan  
that will emphasise developing leadership skills in  
line management, common OHS standards, and 
continued development of Tanzanian employees  
in the OHS profession. 
Environment
Improvements in hydro carbon management and 
changes in the type of energy used at our operations have 
resulted in significant energy efficiencies and reduction 
in carbon dioxide emissions.
Continued improvement in energy efficiency and  
further reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
Community relations
The establishment of a formal site grievance mechanism. 
This allows us to address concerns raised by stakeholders 
in an appropriate and constructive manner.
Devote additional resources to community relations 
at exploration and development projects.
This calls for effective collaboration and engagement 
with key stakeholders. In my role, I look at how 
we can form partnerships to deliver sustainable 
community development initiatives to enhance 
health, education, water and sanitation provision. 
Tri-partite partnerships involve the community, 
government authorities and development partners  
in order to bring together the key ingredients 
for success.
During 2010 I began leading ABG’s workstream 
to conduct Health Impact Assessments around all 
our operations and projects. Working together with 
the government these studies will help us map out 
the health challenges facing our host communities 
and ensure that we are focusing our public health 
initiatives appropriately.

At North Mara, we have assisted local businessmen in forming a 
chamber of commerce and the establishment of a savings and credit co-
operative, which provides microfinance. At Bulyanhulu, we assisted with 
the formation of the IBUKA, a local community co-operative, whose 
5,288 members from 12 villages benefit from the income they generate 
from the labour and business services they provide to the mine.
Community development
Leaving a positive legacy requires a strong understanding of the social 
and economic relationships between our mines and the surrounding 
communities. A sustainable legacy also represents a shift from a traditional 
philanthropic approach to strategic social investment, partnership 
development and integration with the Tanzanian government’s 
development plans.
Our Community Relations teams work closely with host communities 
to create and implement integrated development programmes that 
take local priorities, concerns and needs into account, and focus on 
long-term sustainable development. Our operations seek to tackle the 
ongoing challenges of poverty, illegal activity and inadequate social 
service provision. In doing so, we liaise closely with local government 
authorities as well as a broad range of development partners. 
Education
We believe education and economic progress go hand in hand, and 
work closely with the Tanzanian Education Authority to support 
the Government’s priorities and programmes. ABG supports the 
development of school infrastructure in host communities and helps 
to facilitate stronger school attendance through the provision of 
educational scholarships. 
At Bulyanhulu, the mine’s scholarship programme enables Company 
employees to become actively engaged in assisting the local community 
and is now receiving further support through funds raised by Barrick 
employees based in Canada. At North Mara we are working with the 
local Government authorities to find a comprehensive solution to 
previous challenges faced by mine-community educational initiatives. 
Community health
In addition to its employee health programmes, ABG continues to be 
recognised for its support of public health initiatives. We have built 
strong partnerships with Government health authorities and a range of 
non-governmental organisations in order to combat HIV , malaria and 
tuberculosis and to improve access to health services. Examples of these 
partnerships include: 
•	 HIV awareness programmes, condom provision and training 
of peer health educators with EnGender Health and Population 
Services International;
•	 provision of a farm to Shidepha (a local health NGO) to enable 
income-generation by persons affected by HIV/AIDS;
•	 advocacy and awareness-creation for malaria prevention with 
Malaria No More;
•	 training in dental services for government clinical officers by 
Bridge2Aid;
•	 surgery for burns and cleft palates by Volunteer Surgical Missions 
Australia-Tanzania; and 
Social impact identification and mitigation
Identifying and mitigating any potential negative impacts of our 
operations is at the heart of our approach to community relations. We 
acknowledge that large-scale mining operations in rural communities 
can have negative as well as positive implications for local residents.  
So our commitment is to strive to minimise any negative impact,  
while ensuring that the opportunities our operations present result  
in a positive legacy for our host communities.
We believe that the foundation of effective community relations 
involves embedding social impact identification and mitigation in 
our day-to-day operations and making these integral elements of the 
way that we operate, from the exploration stage right through to mine 
closure. Some specific examples of this approach include: 
•	 comprehensive Social Impact Assessments conducted at the 
feasibility stage and systematically updated during the life of mine;
•	 involvement of the community relations function in all risk 
assessments;
•	 efforts to avoid, or at least minimise, involuntary resettlement by 
exploring alternative project designs whilst also addressing legacy 
challenges from previous resettlement programmes;
•	 our multi-functional workstream on road safety;
•	 collaboration with the exploration team on community engagement 
and influx management; and 
•	 alignment with the security team on our approach to illegal mining 
and trespassing and the protection of human rights through the 
Voluntary Principles (see security and human rights).
During 2010 we commenced a workstream to conduct Health Impact 
Assessments (HIA) at all ABG operations and development projects to 
assess potential impacts on public health and to inform our community 
health programmes. 
Local employment and procurement
Increasing ‘local content’ has been recognised as a key opportunity for 
mining operations to serve as catalysts for local economic development 
and within ABG increased focus has been put on local employment 
and local procurement. Jobs and business opportunities are both key 
benefits that our host communities expect to secure.
ABG seeks to recruit from our host communities as much as possible. 
However, the low education levels in some of the rural areas in which 
ABG operates makes always hiring locally a challenge. As one means of 
addressing this, ABG has provided funding for a national programme to 
develop the skills required by Tanzania’s mining sector. The Integrated 
Mining Technical Training (IMTT) programme, which commenced in 
2008, is a joint project of the Tanzanian Chamber of Minerals & Energy 
and the Tanzanian government. We provide sponsorships to young 
people living near our operations to attend IMTT and we offer them 
the possibility of employment at our operations upon the successful 
completion of their programmes. 
We attempt to give preference to purchasing goods and services 
locally or regionally. We have held information seminars in our host 
communities explaining the breadth of business opportunities available 
as well as the process required to become a supplier to ABG.

As part of ABG’s commitment to development and training, we 
encourage and sponsor employees who wish to pursue full-time, 
part-time or online studies. At present, over 100 students are using our 
employee study assistance programme in universities across the world 
and we have disbursed approximately £130,000 on employee study 
assistance. We also facilitate payments for membership of professional 
bodies for all employees.
Our commitment is not confined just to our employees. W e also offer a 
variety of career starters’ programmes that enable T anzanian citizens to 
commence their careers in the mining industry , give them an opportunity 
to gain practical experience and offer sponsorships for professional training. 
We have memoranda of understanding in place with the University 
of Dar es Salaam’s College of Engineering and Technology and with 
Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences. These allow us 
to provide training opportunities for students in areas close to our 
operations, a scholarship programme for lecturers, project sponsorships 
and bursaries for the best-performing students and laboratory 
equipment for the universities. Hundreds of students have benefited 
from these programmes and sponsorships, and we are proud to 
announce that two recipients of our scholarships recently completed 
their Masters in Metallurgy and Mining Engineering from the 
Laurentian University in Canada and are now assistant lecturers at the 
University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.
While expatriates are often necessary for the design and construction 
phase of a mine’s development, when possible we reduce their numbers 
as the mine goes into production. It is our goal to employ expatriates 
only when needed. 
Environment
Our Environmental Policy drives our commitment to responsible 
environmental management and wise environmental stewardship. 
W e are in the process of implementing an environmental management 
system at each of our operations to complement our existing 
environmental reporting. Going forward, this system will set the 
standards for our environmental conduct. Existing environmental 
reporting systems and procedures record all significant environmental 
impacts and incidents and track our corrective measures and 
actions taken across all our sites. In addition, regular third-party 
audits are undertaken to give us an independent assessment of our 
environmental performance.
Materials
We use ore and process materials such as consumables and reagents to 
extract copper and gold and to produce gold doré. Key consumables 
used are fuels, explosives, cyanide, nitric acid, sodium hydroxide, 
lime and grinding media. We have processes in place to manage all 
consumables, and we actively seek to use best practice in transporting 
and storing consumables and reagents.

Our community health initiatives also provide an opportunity for 
us to involve our contractors and suppliers in benefiting our host 
communities. For the past three years, we have held a fundraising 
dinner in Dar es Salaam which has, to date, contributed US$200,000 
towards Volunteer Surgical Missions Australia-Tanzania for life-
changing surgical operations.
Development and training
As large-scale gold mining is a relatively new industry for Tanzania, 
we initially encountered a dearth of experienced mining professionals to 
meet the Company’s requirements. In response, we have implemented 
a two-pronged solution. We are providing on-the-job training to all 
employees, and are working with technical colleges and universities to 
develop educational and training programmes that will produce a new 
wave of Tanzanian mining professionals.
As ABG continues the expansion of our business operations, we believe 
it is more important than ever to develop our human capital. We are 
proud of our diverse workforce, and strive to attract a broad mix of 
employees from both the traditional and non-traditional mining labour 
markets. This approach reflects the Company’s philosophy of equal 
opportunity and rests on the belief that a diverse workgroup gives a 
competitive advantage to our business, and allows us to create a unique 
company culture.
We want to see our employees reach their full potential, so we 
constantly seek to:
•	 improve the workplace environment;
•	 provide support tools and training for personal development;
•	 actively provide opportunities for professional development and 
career advancement; and 
•	 provide opportunities for assignments within the Barrick Group. 
Our two-year Compass Graduate Development Programme aims to 
provide a structured development programme for new graduates, 
developing their talent as a corporate worldwide asset. The programme, 
which attracts the best candidates from universities in Tanzania, 
focuses on developing graduate technical and leadership skills 
and blends ‘at the face’ work experiences with technical learning 
objectives. In addition to formal training, the graduates benefit from 
hands-on knowledge and experience of areas including courageous 
leadership, frontline management, continuous improvement, 
presentation and communication skills, field-level risk assessment 
and incident investigation. 
The Management Development Programme and Intermediate 
Management Development Programme, run by the University of 
Cape Town, aim to equip managers with essential business knowledge, 
basic management and leadership skills. The Supervisory Leadership 
Development Programme helps potential supervisors acquire the 
skills necessary to managing others, while the Graduate Diploma

Water
ABG’s sites are situated in different climatic regimes; Buzwagi is in an 
area of low rainfall (700mm per annum) while North Mara experiences 
high rainfall (1,300mm per annum). W ater is mainly used for ore 
processing, dust suppression and rock blasting. We obtain our water 
from both surface and groundwater sources. In 2010, ABG used 4.8 
million cubic metres of make-up water at our operations: 1.9 million 
cubic metres were sourced from groundwater and 2.9 million cubic 
metres from surface water.

Biodiversity
ABG is involved in efforts to protect, manage and reclaim lands. We 
manage 15,550 hectares of land that we either own or lease (including 
surface rights and mineral rights). Of this land, less than 18% has been 
disturbed for mining activities. Of the disturbed area, 71 hectares have 
been reclaimed to agreed post-mining uses.
Our Biodiversity Standard requires that we neither explore nor 
initiate mining within World Heritage sites and that we respect the 
requirements of legally designated protected areas. Fauna and flora 
surveys are undertaken on an annual basis on all our sites.
We remove and stockpile top soil from the areas disturbed by mining 
activities. We have closure plans at each operation that aim to minimise 
the area disturbed and to mitigate our impacts, leaving behind 
reclaimed lands that will support productive post-mining land use. 
Reclamation occurs throughout the mine life. 
Energy
We obtain our energy from fossil fuels and purchased electricity. 
Direct energy produced and consumed within our operational 
boundaries includes fuel to run mobile equipment, to produce power 
and heat onsite, for the aircraft we operate and for explosives used to 
mine ore. The largest consumption represents mobile diesel use and 
electricity generation. Indirect energy is also produced outside our 
boundaries, comprising the power we purchase from TANESCO. This 
makes up 85% of our total electricity usage at our operations and is 
sourced largely from renewable hydro-power. 
W e examine opportunities to reduce reliance on diesel power generation 
where possible. The North Mara grid connection project is a key example 
of this. North Mara is currently running on an 80:20 split with TANESCO 
and has realised a 79% reduction in carbon emissions largely as a result of 
this project. 
As part of our aim to conserve energy, our operations are undertaking 
a large number of efficiency improvements having assessed their energy 
usage and identified areas for making improvements in consumption.

The International Cyanide Code guides 
best practice for transporting and using 
cyanide. It is a voluntary initiative that is 
widely supported by major gold producers 
who maintain a registration with the 
International Cyanide Management 
Institute (ICMI). Three of ABG’s four sites 
are currently certified against this Code and 
submit to regular independent third-party 
audits. Bulyanhulu and Tulawaka have 
cyanide detoxification plants. North Mara 
will install a similar plant during 2011, and

At ABG, we place a strong emphasis on the training, competence, 
health and wellness of our employees. As part of this, we provide 
opportunities for learning, as well as reinforcing and monitoring the 
application of learned skills and knowledge on the job.
We have made a significant investment in procedures and controls, and 
have implemented various health and safety training initiatives as a 
means of giving workers the skills and knowledge they need to perform 
their tasks in a safe and reliable way. Our commitment to health and 
safety is reflected in the significant safety milestones we achieved in 
2010, with each of our mines achieving one million working hours 
without lost-time in injuries. In addition, ABG in total completed the 
fourth quarter of 2010 without a Lost-Time Injury.

Despite the positive achievements of the past year, there were four 
work-related fatalities at Bulyanhulu in 2010. On 16 March 2010, there 
was a rock fall incident at the Bulyanhulu mine, which resulted in three 
employee fatalities. ABG suspended mining activities for the rescue 
and recovery mission, and also for a period of mourning on 18 March 
2010. Mining activities were restored on 19 March 2010, however the 
areas affected by the rock fall remained closed until the completion of 
investigations into this incident. A team composed of Health and Safety, 
Engineering, and Geotechnical experts from other Barrick operations 
and support staff in Toronto thoroughly investigated this incident. As 
a result, all underground work areas were assessed by a geotechnical 
expert before work was restarted, with more extensive geotechnical 
evaluations following the initial assessment. Ground support systems 
were also reviewed and assessed to ensure they provide a safe working 
environment and employees were retrained in the installation of these 
systems. Regular inspections are made to ensure that both the correct 
ground support system is used and installed properly. Prior to this 
incident, the ABG Group had experienced no employee safety-related 
fatalities since 2006.
Emissions, effluents and wastes
W e monitor emissions, effluents and wastes generated by our operations. 
We track greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and are actively working 
to improve our energy efficiencies and identify alternative technologies. 
We also consider the management of climate related risks at all stages 
of our mine life cycles. Continued energy efficiencies and innovative 
energy strategies will serve to minimise GHG emissions of our total 
emissions for 2010. Indirect GHG emissions make up 52% of the total 
and direct emissions 48%.

Programmes are in place to manage dust, hazardous and non-
hazardous non-process waste, waste rock and tailings (the finely-
ground material that remains after the crushed and slurried ore passes 
through the process). Our tailings storage facilities are subject to risk 
assessments and are independently audited on a regular basis. In 
addition, tailings storage facilities are subject to an annual review to test 
physical and chemical stability. At Bulyanhulu, paste material is placed 
underground to fill the mined-out voids. On average, 40,000 to 50,000 
tonnes of paste is back-filled into the mine each month. This paste can 
contain up to 40% of tailings material, thereby reducing the amount 
required to be stored above ground.
Health and safety
The health and safety of our workforce is a critical component of 
ABG’s culture, and we have a comprehensive health, safety and 
risk management system for our underground and surface mining 
operations. We also require all contractors to provide and maintain 
a safe and healthy work environment, and ask that they meet, as a 
minimum, our health and safety standards.
Bulyanhulu’s Community Relations 
department is managing a project 
to produce biofuel for use at the 
mine, employing 92 members of the 
neighbouring community and sourcing 
materials locally. Since 2007, 121 
hectares have been planted with more 
than 200,000 jatropha curcas plants. 
By the end of 2016, the plantation will 
have increased to cover 1,246 hectares 
containing over 5.5 million jatropha 
plants within the Bulyanhulu lease area. 
The first batch of oil-bearing seeds is 
expected to be harvested in 2011.

Health risk assessments form a key part of this system, and we are 
continuously seeking to identify hazards, to evaluate exposure potential, 
to control and manage health risks, and to monitor health-related 
incidents. The operational aspects of the programme comprise health 
surveillance, training and competence, medical care and management, 
record-keeping and reporting, health promotion, employee assistance 
programmes, mine life cycle planning and community health.
We have also implemented HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention 
programmes, as well as tuberculosis and malaria programmes, 
for our employees, their families and the local communities at all 
ABG’s operating mines. All of our mine sites also have clinics that 
provide voluntary counselling and testing for all employees and their 
families. They also provide follow-up care and treatment for HIV-
positive employees.
Security and human rights
We believe that effective security controls, standards, policies and 
procedures contribute to the safety and protection of our employees 
as well as the communities in which we operate. 
Operating in some areas of Tanzania requires ABG, as well as the 
Tanzanian government and the local communities, to deal with law 
and order issues. A number of these issues have been related to specific 
events such as instability in areas at the time of elections, while others 
are longer term challenges, such as events of trespass and vandalism by 
intruders seeking to unlawfully take gold and other property from ABG 
operations. These challenges vary depending on the location of the 
operation and other circumstances. For example, the North Mara mine 
is located close to the Tanzanian border with Kenya, which attracts a 
number of transients and illegal miners. This area has had continuing 
law and order challenges, including illegal intruders at the North Mara 
mine. At Buzwagi, in 2010, ABG uncovered a syndicated theft ring 
involving employees collaborating with external parties to remove fuel 
from the operation. ABG has implemented, and continues to identify, 
alternatives to manage these security issues in a manner that places at its 
heart the safety and security of people, property and assets.
ABG employs security staff, retains security contractors and engages 
with the Government of Tanzania and the communities in which we 
operate. Since 2008, we have also introduced a comprehensive security 
management system, with continuous training programmes in place at 
all our operations. Central to this are the Voluntary Principles. These 
In addition, one employee died while using a faulty electric kettle to 
heat water and as a result we implemented a robust inspection regime 
and conducted extensive re-training for our employees on using 
electrical appliances.
Having recognised that driving incidents account for half of all 
potentially dangerous incidents, we have introduced a Drive First 
initiative, as part of a driving improvement programme, to educate 
and help employees improve their driving. The initiative has received a 
positive response from employees, and has highlighted the importance 
of safe driving at our operations. We are also in the process of installing 
advanced technology in our light vehicle and haul truck fleets that 
provides real time in-cab coaching to our operators so that safe driving 
behaviours are reinforced.
We provide two day ‘Courageous Safety Leadership’ training to 
employees and contractors at supervisor level, where they are given 
the opportunity to focus on those personal actions and behaviours that 
promote the goal of ‘everyone going home safe and healthy every day’ . 
Building on this training, non-supervisor-level employees are provided 
with a one-day course and subsequent refresher training to build on the 
skills initially learned in the programme. The programmes are designed 
to empower and encourage employees to take the initiative and reward 
them for identifying potential safety risks and speaking up when faced 
with a safety issue.
Another key initiative involves training employees in the use of 
risk-management tools. This focuses on identifying new hazards and 
risks that result from changes and improvements to ABG’s facilities, 
designs and plans, from exploration stage to closure. It enables our 
people to assess such changes and their consequent impact on people, 
environment, processes, equipment and facilities, so allowing them to 
mitigate the challenges involved. 
One of the most significant components of our health and safety 
management system is the global health programme, which we are 
implementing to ensure compliance with international, national and 
local legislation as well as ABG’s own policies and standards. The health 
programme emphasises health controls through a systematic approach 
to the anticipation, identification, evaluation, control and monitoring of 
health hazards and exposures in the workplace. The recent appointment 
of an Occupational Health Manager for ABG was made to help 
accelerate the implementation of this system.
Corporate responsibility continued
W e control our water resources carefully 
at all our operations and believe that 
water should be managed as a community 
resource, respecting the rights of other 
water users. Our sites have conducted 
risk assessments related to water, and 
we implement systematic monitoring 
programmes of water supply, storage, usage 
and discharge. In a unique approach at 
Buzwagi, rainwater is collected by a 73 ha 
plastic lined area and stored in a covered 
1,500,000 m
3
 water storage pond for use as 
‘make-up’ water in the process. Much of the 
water we use is recycled through our process 
facilities. For example, at Bulyanhulu up 
to 95% of the mine’ s water requirement is 
recycled through our practice of surificial 
paste technology in our tailings deposition.

addition, in accordance with the MOU, the police are specifically 
required to receive human rights training before being assigned 
to the mine sites. To our knowledge, ABG is the first and only 
private company to comprehensively engage with senior Tanzanian 
government officials and local law enforcement agencies to encourage 
and support the provision of Voluntary Principles training to these 
agencies and the adherence to international human rights norms.
ABG’s private security employees and contractors also all receive 
training and regular refresher courses in the security management 
systems (including human rights and use of force training). Security 
personnel comply with a strict use of force procedure that is compliant 
with the Voluntary Principles and has been validated by internal and 
external experts and shared with international human rights groups 
as a part of the Voluntary Principles process. In addition, security 
personnel are required, at all times, to comply with all applicable 
policies and procedures of ABG, including the ABG Code of Conduct. 
Most importantly, we maintain a continuous process of engagement 
with individuals and local community groups based in and around our 
mines in order to create an environment that is safe for our staff and 
the wider community as a whole.
Despite the challenges and as a result of the above initiatives, the 
co-operation between ABG and the police in working to develop 
community policing has led to a decrease of crime and violence in the 
general community. Also, significant security-related incidents and 
production stoppages as a result of violent incidents at the mine have 
declined over the past two years, and the overall security situation in 
the region and at the mines has improved. In contrast to the situation 
experienced by some of the region during the 2008 elections, the 
security environment during the 2010 elections was generally calm.
are a set of guidelines by which companies in the extractive sector can 
maintain the safety and security of their operations within an operating 
framework that ensures respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. Our majority shareholder, Barrick, is a signatory participant, 
and ABG’s security management system adheres to this commitment to 
respect people and their rights as laid out in the Voluntary Principles. 
We also continue to invest in security improvements, including the 
installation of additional perimeter fencing and walls and CCTV 
cameras in certain sensitive areas. We also make efforts to educate the 
local community about the inherent safety dangers associated with 
illegal mining and intrusion on to the mine sites and operational areas. 
ABG supports the Tanzanian Police Community Policing Unit and 
has assisted in establishing a pilot of community policing in the North 
Mara area. The community policing initiative was recognised by the US 
Department of State in their 2009 Human Rights report on Tanzania. 
This programme is reflective of the fact that armed violence and 
criminality impacts not just on ABG and its employees and contractors, 
but also impacts negatively on the wider community, and as such, 
a community based solution is desirable. 
We have entered into memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with the 
Tanzanian police force for the provision of police force patrols in the 
general area surrounding the mines for the purpose of maintaining 
law and order. The support provided by the mines is limited in scope 
and is conditioned upon police compliance with all relevant laws 
and international enforcement principles, including the Voluntary 
Principles. Pursuant to the MOUs, the police must follow all relevant 
domestic laws and must operate outside the mine sites except in 
emergencies, when they are specifically called to enter the site. In 
HIV/AIDS poses a significant threat not 
only to our employees but also to the 
communities in which our operations are 
located. Recent surveys indicate that the 
average prevalence rate for the regions 
in the Lake Zone of Tanzania is 7%, with 
some regions showing a prevalence of up 
to 9.6%. These statistics show the need for 
comprehensive programmes to address 
this scourge.
ABG has made a concerted effort 
to combat HIV/AIDS by bolstering 
prevention initiatives and supporting 
care and treatment services. To help 
prevent new infections, ABG has 
partnered with USAID, Engender Health 
(a renowned international NGO) and 
Deloitte & Touche under an innovative 
public private partnership called the 
P3P project. The objective is to train 
and empower volunteer Peer Health 
Educators to provide information about 
HIV/AIDS to their colleagues and the 
broader community. These peer educators 
emphasise the benefits of voluntary 
counselling and testing and condom use. 
The programme has seen an increase in 
people’s knowledge about HIV/AIDS and 
a reduction in risky behaviour that pre-
disposes individuals to HIV . ABG provides 
condoms to community members.
As a member of the Global Business 
Coalition for Tuberculosis, AIDS 
and Malaria, ABG has been able 
to join forces with other corporate 
members to define new strategies and 
integration opportunities.

Committee participation and review 
The Audit committee and Environmental, Health, Safety, Security 
and CSR committee (EHS&S) have active involvement in the risk 
management review process. 
ABG’s Audit committee plays a key role in reviewing the effectiveness 
of the ABG Group’s internal control and financial reporting risk 
management systems. As part of its responsibilities, it approves the 
annual internal and external audit plan and reviews all material findings 
of the internal and external audit functions. 
ABG’s EHS&S committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
environmental management programmes and systems and its health 
and safety systems. It also receives reports from management on 
ABG’s corporate social responsibility programme, including significant 
sustainable development, community relations and security policies  
and procedures. 
Where appropriate, each of these committees reports to the Board and 
makes recommendations to the Board and management on any areas 
within its respective remit where action or improvement is needed. 
Implementation and application
ABG’s management is accountable for the design and implementation 
of risk management processes and their consistent application to ensure 
that risk management compliance is embodied in the culture and 
practices of the ABG Group and its operations. Management ensures 
that relevant risk management matters are clearly communicated 
to all employees and ensures that all members of the corporate risk 
management function have unrestricted access to all personnel, records 
and property of the Group, and are entitled to such information and 
explanations as may be required for review purposes. 
Management, in consultation with ABG’s risk management function, 
is involved in a process of implementing and improving systems and 
procedures to ensure effective mechanisms are in place to identify and 
monitor risks internal and external to the Group. 
Internal audit
ABG’s Head of Risk and Internal Audit assists ABG’s Board and 
management in executing their responsibilities. This function plays a 
critical role in advising and producing guidance on risk-related matters. 
It assists management in conducting risk studies, reviewing risk profiles, 
interpreting risk data and integrating risk management in business

Overview
To achieve its vision and strategy and to protect its key values, ABG 
is committed to establishing the most effective possible management 
of risk. For this purpose, since our IPO the Board has adopted a risk 
management framework that incorporates the key requirements of ISO 
31000:2009, UK corporate governance standards and other generally 
accepted governance principles. In addition to ABG’s Code of Conduct, 
this framework includes the Company’s risk management charter, its 
risk management policy and a number of detailed risk management 
procedures. All members of the ABG Group, its material operations, 
its service organisations, its support functions and its processes and 
projects must comply with and adhere to the requirements of this risk 
management framework. 
Roles and responsibilities
Responsibility for risk management is allocated between key functions 
and tiers of ABG’s corporate governance structure to ensure that 
decisions taken that affect risk tolerance and mitigation remain prudent 
and effective. 
Oversight and review 
The Board is responsible for defining ABG’s risk appetite and tolerance 
and has overall responsibility for risk management compliance. It 
approves all key components of ABG’s risk management and internal 
control systems and is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness of 
these systems. As part of its risk management function, the Board or 
its committees: 
•	 approves ABG’s risk management strategy and policies recommended 
by ABG management and ABG’s Internal Audit function;
•	 monitors the ABG Group’s compliance with its risk 
management framework;
•	 reviews ABG’s significant business risks and internal controls;
•	 ensures that appropriate action is taken in controlling 
significant risks;
•	 conducts annual strategic risk workshops involving Directors and 
ABG management; and 
•	 ensures that the Head of Risk and Internal Audit has the co-
operation and support of ABG management, staff and all other 
relevant stakeholders. 
Significant risks for the ABG Group are assessed and reported on, and 
the Board receives quarterly reports on the status of the internal control 
environment through Audit committee reports. 
Risk management

Principal risks and uncertainties 
The Group faces a variety of risks, the occurrence of which could 
adversely affect its performance, earnings, financial position and 
prospects. Over the course of the year under review, the Group made 
material developments in the identification and management of its risk 
profile in order to focus on the most significant risks and events that 
could affect its operations, financials and performance. 
The following pages set out the principal risks affecting the ABG Group. 
ABG has taken a number of steps to mitigate some of these risks and 
will continue to evaluate ways in which it can manage and mitigate risks 
accordingly. Notwithstanding this, due to the very nature of risks no 
assurance can be given that mitigating actions taken or planned will be 
wholly effective. In addition, there may be additional risks unknown 
to ABG and other risks, which are currently believed to be immaterial, 
could turn out to be material. These risks, whether they materialise 
individually or simultaneously, could significantly affect the Group’s 
business and financial results. In addition, ABG could also be affected 
by risks relating to the gold mining industry generally and the risks and 
hazards involved in the business of mining metals, which are largely 
outside its control.

All of the ABG Group’s revenue is derived 
from production at its four facilities in 
Tanzania. In order to ensure continued 
growth, the Group needs to identify new 
resources and development opportunities 
through exploration and acquisition targets.
ABG assesses a wide range of potential 
growth opportunities to build on its existing 
portfolio, including external acquisition and 
development opportunities outside Tanzania 
to maximise growth potential.
High A review of exploration activities

and resources are estimates based on a 
range of assumptions, including geological, 
metallurgical and technical factors; there can 
be no assurance that the anticipated tonnages 
or grades will be achieved.
ABG management has implemented a 
number of processes to continuously monitor 
and evaluate the current life of the Company’s 
mine plans and production targets. The ABG 
Group’s resources and reserves are updated 
annually. ABG follows NI 43-101 of the 
Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy

Financial risks
Commodity prices
The ABG Group’s financial performance 
is highly dependent upon the price of gold 
and, to a lesser extent, the price of copper 
and silver. The prices of these commodities 
are affected by a number of factors beyond 
ABG’s control. Rapid fluctuations in pricing of 
these commodities will have a corresponding 
impact on ABG’s financial position.
ABG’s strategic objective is to provide 
maximum exposure to the price of gold. 
As such a no-gold-hedging policy has been 
adopted. ABG has implemented a number 
of processes to assess its exposure to other 
commodity price fluctuations. ABG has 
entered into hedging facilities in connection 
with copper price fluctuations and is 
reviewing appropriate hedging facilities to 
assist in the management of exposure to other 
commodities, such as diesel.

fluctuations in operating cash flow and capital 
expenditure may adversely affect ABG’s 
financial position.
ABG management continuously monitors 
operational costs and capital expenditure.

Political, legal and regulatory developments
The ABG Group’s exploration, development 
and operational activities are subject to 
extensive laws and regulations governing 
various matters in the jurisdictions in which 
it operates. Changes to existing law and 
regulations, or more stringent application or 
interpretation of current laws and regulations 
by relevant government authorities, could 
adversely affect the ABG Group’s operations 
and development projects. In particular, as 
ABG’s revenue is currently derived exclusively 
from the production of its facilities in 
Tanzania, its business operations and financial 
condition may be adversely affected by legal 
and regulatory changes and developments in 
Tanzania, or if existing mineral development 
agreements are not honoured by the 
Tanzanian government.
The Group may also be adversely affected 
by changes in global economic conditions, 
political and/or economic instability in 
Tanzania or any of its surrounding countries.
The Group assesses legal and political risks 
as part of its evaluation of potential projects. 
It actively monitors legal and political 
developments in countries in which its 
existing operations are located. 
The Group actively engages in dialogue with 
the Tanzanian government and legal policy 
makers to discuss all key legal and regulatory 
developments applicable to its operations, in 
particular developments in connection with 
the Tanzanian Mining Act and applicable 
environmental legislation.

could adversely affect Group operations and 
impact its financial condition. In addition, 
an increase in power costs would make 
production more costly and alternative power 
sources may not be available. 
Back-up or alternative power generation 
have been implemented at North Mara, 
Bulyanhulu and Tulawaka. ABG is in the 
process of implementing additional power 
back-up facilities to maintain critical systems 
at Buzwagi.
High Further information on the status 
of power supply is provided on 
page 35.
Community relations
A failure to adequately engage or manage 
relations with local communities and 
stakeholders could have a direct impact on 
the ABG Group’s ability to operate at its 
existing operations.
In addition to its existing corporate social 
responsibility programmes, the Group 
is implementing a number of additional 
initiatives to improve and build on local 
community relations, and has increased its 
social management capacity.

relations activities are set out

Operational risks
Loss of critical processes
The ABG Group’s mining, processing, 
development and exploration activities 
depend on the continuous availability of 
its operational infrastructure, in addition 
to reliable utilities and water supplies and 
access to roads. Any failure or unavailability 
of operational infrastructure, for example 
through equipment failure or disruption, 
could adversely affect production output 
and/or impact exploration and development 
activities. Deficiencies in core supply chain 
availability could also adversely affect 
Group operations.
Management assesses the critical components 
of ABG’s operational infrastructure on a 
continuous basis. In addition to external 
resources and when required, ABG has 
established channels through the support of 
the Barrick Group network to address critical 
disruptions to its technical services and plant 
equipment. Supply chain management and 
support are assessed and reviewed against 
business requirements on a regular basis.
High Risks relating to utility supply 
are summarised above. Further 
details of ABG’s infrastructure 
and processes are summarised on 
pages 18-19, 35 and 83.
Environmental hazards and rehabilitation
The ABG Group’s activities are subject to 
environmental hazards as a result of the 
processes and chemicals used in its extraction 
and production methods. The Group may 
be liable for losses and costs associated with 
environmental hazards at its operations, 
have its licences and permits withdrawn 
or suspended as a result of such hazards, 
or may be forced to undertake extensive 
clean-up and remediation action in respect of 
environmental hazards and incidents relating 
to its operations. Any such action could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, operations and financial condition.
The Group has committed itself to the 
application of global standards and 
implementing relevant International Council 
on Mining and Metal practices, and the 
International Cyanide Code standards. 
Compliance with applicable environmental 
standards is assessed on a continuous basis. 
Remediation and rehabilitation costs are 
assessed and reviewed annually.
High Details of the ABG Group’s 
environmental activities and 
compliance programmes are set 
out in the corporate responsibility 
section on pages 59-61.
Employees and contractors
The ABG Group’s business significantly 
depends upon its ability to recruit and retain 
qualified personnel, in particular members 
of the Senior Leadership Team and its skilled 
team of engineers and geologists. The loss of 
skilled workers and a failure to recruit and 
train equivalent replacements may negatively 
impact on ABG’s operations and production.
ABG depends on certain key contractors. 
Interruptions in contracted services could 
result in production slowdowns and/
or stoppages.
ABG regularly assesses its staff recruitment 
and retention policies to assist with labour 
stability, and maintains appropriate 
investment in training and development to 
safeguard the skills of its work force. It is also 
focused on furthering the nationalisation of 
its workforce in Tanzania and participates 
in a number of training programmes to help 
develop local industry expertise.
Assessments of arrangements with key 
contractors are undertaken on a regular basis 
to ensure that contracted services and support 
meet business requirements and expectations.
High Further detail on employee 
arrangements and related 
initiatives is provided in the 
corporate responsibility section

Operational risks
Security, trespass and vandalism
ABG faces certain risks in dealing with 
trespass, theft, corruption and vandalism 
at its mines and unauthorised small-scale 
mining in proximity to and on specific areas 
covered by ABG’s exploration and mining 
licences. The impact of such risks may have 
an adverse effect upon ABG’s operations 
and financial condition. 
The ABG Group has taken measures to 
protect its employees, mines and production 
facilities from various security and theft risks. 
Steps include increasing existing security 
personnel, the installation of additional 
perimeter fencing, surveillance equipment 
and the imposition of additional security 
checks and procedures. Where appropriate, 
the Group continues to work in collaboration 
with local law enforcement to address 
security-related matters. In addition, ABG 
adheres to the Voluntary Principles as part of 
its membership of the Barrick Group.
High Further information on security 
developments and initiatives 
can be found in the corporate 
responsibility section on  
pages 62-63.
Health and safety, infectious diseases
Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, 
a wide range of occupational health diseases, 
such as noise-induced hearing loss and 
lung diseases, pose a risk to the Group’s 
workforce. In addition, tropical and infectious 
diseases, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, 
pose significant health risks to the Group’s 
employees, due to the epidemic proportions 
that such diseases may have in areas at  
which the Group’s operations are located.  
The potential liabilities related to such diseases 
and the impact that these diseases may have 
on the Group’s workforce may have an adverse 
effect upon the Group’s operations and 
financial condition.
The Group has implemented a number 
of malaria and tuberculosis programmes 
and HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention 
programmes for its employees, their families 
and the local communities surrounding its 
operations. It also provides occupational 
health services to its employees at its 
mine clinics and it continues to improve 
preventative hygiene initiatives. Health and 
safety and risk management systems are in 
place onsite at all of ABG’s operations.

Overview Performance Financial statements Shareholder information Governance
All ABG employees and Directors must comply with these policies 
and procedures and with any additional applicable policies. 
Overall responsibility for the governance of the ABG Group lies 
with the Board, which intends wherever possible to comply with the 
main principles of the Combined Code and the new UK Corporate 
Governance Code which will apply to future reporting years. It will 
also review other international standards as appropriate for ABG’s 
operations. As part of its corporate governance compliance obligations, 
the Board is required to explain how it applied the main principles of 
the Combined Code during 2010. The relevant statement of compliance, 
and any departures from governance requirements that occurred, are 
explained below.
Board composition
The Board reviews its composition and balance on a regular basis. 
The Board currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, two 
Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors, of whom five are 
independent. For the reporting period, the Board considers that this 
is the appropriate structure and board balance between executives and 
non-executives for ABG to achieve its objectives.
ABG regards all of its Non-Executive Directors other than Aaron 
Regent and Stephen Galbraith as independent within the meaning 
defined in the Combined Code. The Board regards Andre Falzon as 
independent within the meaning of the Combined Code although he 
was an employee of the Barrick Group until 2006 and then provided 
consultancy services to the Barrick Group until 2008.

2010 Highlights and performance
As this is ABG’s first year as a listed company, the Board focused 
its attentions in 2010 on developing and confirming measures 
that support its effectiveness and strengthen the Company’s 
internal control and risk management systems. To this end, the 
Board and its committees have:
•	 undertaken assessments of ABG’s key risks, mitigation and 
process evaluation;
•	 conducted a review of internal systems and controls in line 
with Turnbull Guidance requirements;
•	 commenced the review of requirements for Board evaluations 
and succession planning; and
•	 progressed the implementation of reporting procedures and 
processes over and above those financial reporting procedures 
implemented as part of the IPO process.
Good governance is fundamental to 
the success of ABG’s business and its 
relationships with key stakeholders. 
Derek Pannell,  
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
ABG approach to governance
ABG committed to the highest standards of corporate governance 
at the time of its IPO. The Company adopted a number of procedures 
throughout the course of 2010 to underpin its governance systems 
and structure. These measures will remain under review, and 
additional processes will continue to be considered and developed to 
ensure that ABG’s approach to governance is appropriately aligned 
with its operating environment, its performance needs and its 
strategic requirements.
ABG has adopted a Code of Conduct as well as a number of other 
policies and procedures including an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
Policy, a Disclosure and Communications Policy and a Securities 
Dealing Code to support its governance framework.   74

Chairman and their related responsibilities are separated. Accordingly 
the divisions of responsibilities have been set out in writing and agreed

Board. He is responsible for ensuring that the Board plays a full 
and constructive part in the development and determination of the 
Company’s strategy and overall commercial objectives. The Chairman 
is responsible for setting the Board agenda, leading its discussions and 
ensuring effective communication with shareholders. The Chairman 
promotes the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate 
governance throughout ABG, particularly at Board level. 
ABG’s Chief Executive Officer is responsible for all executive 
management matters affecting ABG and is principally responsible

Overview Performance Financial statements Shareholder information Governance
In addition to scheduled Board meetings, all Directors have access 
to members of the Senior Leadership Team and to whatever further 
information they need to perform their duties and to satisfy their 
responsibilities. ABG’s independent Non-Executive Directors and 
committee chairmen meet with members of the Senior Leadership 
Team to receive more in-depth briefings on Board and committee 
matters, whenever required or requested. 
The Chairman and the Company Secretary review training and 
development needs. The induction training and process for new Directors 
is under development. All existing Directors and members of the Senior 
Leadership T eam participated in induction training, which included 
briefings on the responsibilities of Directors of a UK listed company, prior 
to the IPO. During the course of 2010, a number of Directors undertook 
operational site visits. All Directors continue to have free access to visit 
operations outside scheduled Board arrangements. 
Directors may take independent professional advice, as necessary, at 
ABG’s expense in the furtherance of their duties. In addition to this, 
each Board committee is entitled to seek independent professional 
advice at ABG’s expense where necessary to assist or guide the 
committee in the performance of its functions. 
Board meetings and attendance
The Board is scheduled to meet at least four times a year, and at such 
other times as are necessary to discharge its duties. 
The attendance record for each Director for 2010 is shown below. The 
Board met on five occasions during 2010, of which one meeting related 
to specific IPO matters.

Board effectiveness
Decision making
Board decisions are predominantly made by achieving a consensus at 
Board meetings. In exceptional circumstances, decisions may be taken 
by the majority of Board members. Questions arising at any meeting 
are determined by a majority of votes. In the case of an equality of 
votes, ABG’s articles of association do not provide the Chairman with 
a second or casting vote. All Directors are required to take decisions 
objectively and in the best interests of the Company. 
ABG’s Non-Executive Directors are expected to apply independent 
judgement to contribute to issues of strategy and performance and 
to scrutinise the performance of management. In addition, the 
committees of the Board play an active role in reviewing management’s 
performance and achievement of ABG objectives on the basis of 
responsibilities falling within the remit of each committee. 
Board briefings and development
The Board receives monthly management reports and quarterly 
reports outlining all material operational, financial and strategic 
developments. These ensure that members remain properly briefed on 
the performance and financial position of the ABG Group. Board and 
committee papers are circulated prior to all meetings to allow Directors 
to be briefed in advance of discussions. All Board meetings include a 
quarterly business and financial review to ensure that, in addition to 
specific scheduled matters and any other business, core operational 
matters are reviewed on a continuous basis.

Relationship with shareholders
Dialogue with the investment community
Members of the Board and senior management met with a number 
of international investors as part of ABG’s IPO process. Since the 
IPO, ABG has established a headquarters in London and appointed 
a Head of Corporate Development and Investor Relations to manage 
and develop the Company’s investor relations programme. The 
Head of Corporate Development and Investor Relations is primarily 
responsible for maintaining ABG’s ongoing relations with the investor 
and shareholder community, acting as the primary point of contact 
for members of this community. During the course of 2010, ABG 
conducted a number of international investor meetings and analyst 
presentations. ABG intends to meet with investors and analysts at least 
twice a year to discuss Group performance and respond to queries. 
ABG also conducts periodic telephone calls and meetings with the 
investment community to discuss results, and participates in mining 
conferences to meet with current and prospective investors. 
In addition to its annual and half-year reports, ABG publishes quarterly 
reports to the market, which provide further information on production 
and financial results, and updates on its business and operations. 
Majority shareholder
ABG was a wholly owned subsidiary of Barrick prior to its IPO. Barrick 
continues to hold approximately 74% of ABG, making it the Group’s 
majority shareholder. As a result of this relationship, ABG continues 
to have access to the Barrick Group for a number of support services 
and receives strategic shareholder support for its initiatives and goals. 
ABG and Barrick executed a number of agreements and arrangements 
as part of the IPO process to ensure that their ongoing relationship 
was appropriately structured, including a relationship agreement. The 
principal purpose of the relationship agreement is to ensure that ABG is 
capable of carrying on its business independently of the Barrick Group 
and that transactions and relationships with the Barrick Group are 
conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. 
Under the terms of the relationship agreement, Barrick has agreed to 
exercise its powers so far as possible to ensure that ABG is managed in 
accordance with the Combined Code. It has also agreed that it will not 
exercise its voting rights or powers which would cause ABG to breach 
any of the key eligibility criteria for its listing. 
Barrick is entitled to appoint Directors to the Board in line with 
a sliding scale that depends on Barrick’s percentage shareholding. 
Pursuant to the sliding scale Barrick is entitled to appoint the higher of:
•	 three Non-Executive Directors and the maximum number of Non-
Executive Directors that may be appointed while ensuring that the 
composition of the Board remains compliant with the Combined 
Code to the Board for so long as Barrick holds an interest in 40% 
or more of the issued share capital or voting rights of ABG;
Performance evaluation
The majority of the Directors were appointed in February 2010 as 
part of the corporate governance preparations for the IPO. In view of 
this, the Board believes that a meaningful evaluation of performance 
can only take place once the new Board has had a reasonable amount 
of time to work together. An evaluation process will therefore be 
implemented in the first half of 2011 for all of the Board members 
including the Chairman.
Retirement and re-election
Under ABG’s articles of association, all Directors are subject to 
retirement and re-election by the shareholders at the first Annual 
General Meeting following their appointment and every three years 
thereafter. As such, all members of the Board will offer themselves for 
re-election at the forthcoming AGM having been appointed by the 
Board during the year.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the ABG Group’ s system of internal control 
and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. In line with 
this responsibility, the Board has established ongoing processes and 
systems for identifying, evaluating and managing those significant risks 
that the Group faces. These systems were put in place as part of the IPO 
process and their implementation has been progressed throughout the 
year. ABG’ s system of internal controls and risk management takes into 
account the recommendations contained in the T urnbull Guidance on 
Internal Systems and Controls published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in October 2005 (the ‘T urnbull Guidance’). The system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
ABG’ s business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board principally bases its monitoring of internal controls on its 
review of management reports and assessments and on the quarterly 
reports it receives on the status of ABG’s internal control environment. 
This is supported by the risk profile reviews that ABG’s Internal Audit 
function carries out to help the Board identify and manage the most 
significant risks and events that could affect the Company’s operations, 
financials and performance. Where necessary, the Board is assisted by 
its committees in reviewing internal systems and controls, particularly 
the Audit committee which is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and financial risk management systems. 
An overview of ABG’s risk management systems and procedures is 
provided on page 64.
In compliance with its obligations, the Board has conducted an annual 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems. This review has covered all material 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls. 
In conjunction with ABG’ s Internal Audit Function and members of the 
Senior Leadership Team, the Board has conducted a specific assessment 
of internal controls for the purposes of this report. This assessment 
considered all significant aspects of internal control arising during the 
period covered by this report. During the course of its review of the 
system of internal control, the Board did not identify or hear of any 
failings or weaknesses which it determined to be material. Therefore a 
confirmation of any necessary actions undertaken is not required. Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Overview Performance Financial statements Shareholder information Governance
Greg Hawkins, Kevin Jennings and other members of senior 
management hold interests under Barrick’s restricted stock unit plan, 
which are not deemed to be material interests and will ultimately be 
replaced by interests under ABG’s share plans.
The Companies Act 2006 requires Directors to avoid situations where 
they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or 
may possibly conflict, with Company interests. However, the Act does 
allow Directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts of interests where a company’s articles of association contain 
a provision to that effect. ABG’s articles of association contain such 
provision and a procedure for this. In accordance with this procedure, 
the conflicts outlined above were declared and authorised by the Board 
prior to our IPO. 
The monitoring and, if appropriate, authorisation of any actual or 
potential conflict of interest is an ongoing process. Directors are 
required to notify the Company of any material changes in positions 
or situations that have already been considered and any new situations. 
In addition, Directors are required to declare interests in potential or 
actual transactions and are required to abstain from voting on such 
transactions, subject to permitted exceptions. If a question arises as 
to whether any interest of a Director prevents him or her from voting 
or being counted in a quorum in the context of a potential or actual 
transaction, the matter is referred to the Chairman, whose findings are 
final and conclusive. In the context of questions relating to any such 
conflict of the Chairman, the question may ultimately be decided by 
a resolution of the other Directors. 
Specifically as regards Directors appointed by Barrick, the relationship 
agreement provides that if any transaction or arrangement arises 
directly between a member of the Barrick Group and a member of the 
ABG Group and does or could, in the opinion of a majority of Directors 
(excluding any Director(s) appointed by Barrick), give rise to a conflict 
of interest between ABG and any Director appointed by Barrick, any 
such matter must be approved and authorised at a duly convened 
Board meeting or in writing by a majority of Directors (excluding any 
Director(s) appointed by Barrick) prior to the Company taking further 
action in relation to such matter.
Save for the matters set out above, none of the Directors has any 
notifiable conflict of interests between their ABG duties and their 
private interests or other duties during the reporting period.
•	 two Non-Executive Directors and one less than the maximum 
number of Non-Executive Directors that may be appointed while 
ensuring that the composition of the Board remains compliant with 
the Combined Code, for so long as it has an interest in 25% or more 
of the issued share capital or voting rights of ABG; and
•	 one Non-Executive Director and two less than the maximum number 
of Non-Executive Directors that may be appointed while ensuring that 
the composition of the Board remains compliant with the Combined 
Code, for so long as it has an interest in 15% or more in ABG.
In addition, subject to certain exceptions and only for so long as Barrick 
holds 30% or more of the issued share capital or voting rights of ABG, 
Barrick has undertaken that it shall not, and shall procure that other 
members of the Barrick Group shall not, carry on the exploration of 
gold or silver in Africa or acquire, whether through an asset purchase 
or the purchase of securities, a gold or silver mining business in Africa 
which competes with the Company, unless Barrick has first notified 
ABG in writing of such opportunity. If ABG indicates that it wishes 
to pursue such opportunity within 15 business days of receiving the 
notification, then neither Barrick, nor any other member of the Barrick 
Group, shall pursue the opportunity unless the Company subsequently 
decides not to pursue the opportunity or fails to do so within a 
reasonable period of time.
ABG has given a reciprocal non-compete commitment to Barrick in 
this regard.
The relationship agreement will continue for so long as ABG is listed on 
the London Stock Exchange and Barrick owns or controls in aggregate 
15% or more of its issued share capital or voting rights.
AGM
ABG’s first annual general meeting as a UK listed company will 
be held on 21 April 2011 at 2.00pm London time. The business of 
the meeting will be conducted in accordance with Companies Act 
2006 requirements and standards promoted by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Chairman and the chairmen of each of ABG’s 
Board committees will be available to answer questions put to them 
by shareholders at the meeting. The AGM Notice is included in the 
documentation which has been provided with this report and is also 
available on the Company’s website. In accordance with best practice, 
the notice has been sent to shareholders at least 20 business days prior 
to the date of the meeting. 
Conflicts of interest
Aaron Regent and Stephen Galbraith are nominee Directors appointed 
by Barrick in line with its rights under the relationship agreement. 
These individuals hold a number of cross-directorships with members 
of the Barrick Group. In particular, Mr Regent is Chief Executive 
Officer of Barrick and Mr Galbraith is Managing Director of Barrick 
International (Barbados) Corporation. These directorships and 
positions give rise to situations in which these Directors could have a 
direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with 
those of ABG. 78

Corporate governance report continued
Activities
As 2010 represents ABG’s first year as a listed company, the committee’s 
focus for the year was on the development and progression of internal 
controls and audit procedures suitable for ABG’s status. Key work 
undertaken by the committee included the following:
•	 c o ns ider a t io n 	 a n d 	 a p p r o v a l 	 o f 	 t h e 	 i n t ern a l 	 a ud i t 	 p la n: the committee 
met regularly with the Head of Risk and Internal Audit to review 
and progress the Group’s internal audit charter and internal audit 
UK Corporate Governance Compliance
ABG corporate governance practices are structured so as to comply 
wherever possible with the requirements of the Combined Code and 
the new UK Corporate Governance Code. For the year under review, 
this corporate governance report explains our governance structure on 
the basis of the requirements of both the Combined Code and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. For Listing Rule disclosure purposes, this 
compliance statement focuses on relevant confirmations in respect of 
the Combined Code. Going forward ABG will only report against the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, this being the version of the code that 
applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 29 June 2010.
ABG’s shares were admitted to trading on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange and to the Official List of the United Kingdom 
Listing Authority on 24 March 2010. Since ABG was listed for only part 
of the year, this report explains how ABG has applied and complied 
with the main principles of the Combined Code from the date of its 
listing and throughout the following months of the reporting period. 
Since its listing ABG has also complied with the detailed provisions of 
the Combined Code, save in the following respects:
•	 ABG’ s Chairman, Mr Regent, was not independent on appointment. 
The Directors consider that given Mr Regent’ s expertise in the industry, 
his familiarity with the assets comprised within the ABG Group and 
his leading role with Barrick, his presence as Chairman is in ABG’ s best 
interests, even though he was not independent on appointment within 
the meaning of the Combined Code.
•	 The Board and Chairman’ s evaluation have yet to be undertaken. 
As all members of the Board were appointed for purposes of the 
IPO, in January/February 2010, the Board believes that a meaningful 
evaluation of performance can only take place once the Directors have 
had a reasonable amount of time to work together. An evaluation 
process will therefore be implemented in the first half of 2011 for all 
of the Board members including the Chairman.
ABG’s external auditor has reviewed those parts of this statement which 
it is required to review under the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom 
Listing Authority.

The Board has established an Audit committee, a Compensation 
committee, a Nomination committee and an EHS&S committee.

services by ABG’s auditors. The provision of non-audit services is 
generally limited to services that are closely connected to the external 
audit or to projects that require a detailed understanding of the ABG 
Group. Details of fees payable for audit and non-audit services are 
contained on page 128 in Note 9 to the financial statements. As part

Directors’ indemnity insurance
In accordance with ABG’s articles of association and to the extent 
permitted by the Companies Act 2006, ABG may indemnify its 
Directors out of its own funds to cover liabilities incurred as a result 
of their office. The relevant provision contained in the Articles can

the Companies Act 2006. As part of IPO preparations, ABG adopted 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. This provides insurance 
cover for any claim brought against Directors or officers for wrongful 
acts in connection with their positions. The insurance provided does 
not extend to claims arising from fraud or dishonesty and it does not 
provide cover for civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed by law.

from no production in 2000 to approximately 701,000 attributable 
ounces in 2010. It has four producing mines, all located in north west 
Tanzania, and seven principal exploration projects. The ABG Group has 
substantial gold mining experience and expertise, from exploration and 
development through to mine construction and operation. 
Our four mines are: 
•	 Bulyanhulu: an underground gold mine, which began production 
in April 2001; 
•	 Buzwagi: an open pit gold mine, which began production in 
May 2009;

deposits, which began production in April 2002; and 
•	 Tulawaka: an open pit gold mine, which has transitioned to an 
underground operation. It began production in June 2005. 
The recent focus of ABG’s exploration has been on advancing the 
exploration opportunities around its existing operating mines, in order 
to increase the Company’s reserves and resources.

abides by anti-discrimination legislation in all jurisdictions in which it 
operates. These principles are also set out in ABG’s Code of Conduct 
which sets out the framework in which ABG expects all staff to operate. 
This is supported by anti-discrimination standards and training in 
offices and mine sites which identify the required standards and provide 
mechanisms to raise any concerns with management.
Dividends
An interim dividend of US1.6 cents per share was paid to shareholders 
on 27 September 2010. The Directors recommend the payment of 
a final dividend of US3.7 cents per share. Subject to shareholders’ 
approval of this recommendation at the AGM, the dividend will be paid 
on 26 May 2011 to shareholders on the register at 3 May 2011. The ex-
dividend date is 27 April 2011. 
ABG will declare the final dividend in US dollars. Unless a shareholder 
has elected or elects to receive dividends in US dollars, dividends will be 
paid in pounds sterling with the US dollar amount being converted into 
pounds sterling at exchange rates prevailing on or around 9 May 2011. 
Currency elections must be made by return of currency election forms 
by the deadline date of 6 May 2011.
Annual General Meeting
ABG’s first AGM will be held on 21 April 2011 at the InterContinental 
London Park Lane at 1 Hamilton Place, Park Lane, London W1J 7QY . 
The notice of AGM and all accompanying details of business to be 
conducted there are included in a separate document accompanying 
this report; they are also available on ABG’s website: www.
africanbarrickgold.com.
The right of a shareholder to participate in the business of the AGM 
shall include without limitation the right to speak, vote on a show of 
hands, vote on a poll, be represented by a proxy and have access to 
all documents which are required by the Companies Act 2006 or the 
articles of association to be made available to the meeting.
Share capital
As at 31 December 2010, ABG’s issued share capital comprised 
410,085,499 Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each. The voting rights of all 
ABG shares are identical, with each share carrying the right to one vote. 
ABG holds no Ordinary Shares in Treasury and does not have any class 
of share other than its Ordinary Shares. Further details on voting rights 
and rights relating to the transfer of shares are provided below.
ABG’s articles of association provide the authority for ABG to purchase 
its own shares (including any redeemable preference shares), provided 
that it complies with any applicable requirements contained in the 
Companies Act 2006, the CREST regulations or any other applicable  Annual Report and Accounts 2010

company, (PGI) and MDN Inc (MDN). The Tulawaka Agreement 
provides that all capital and operating costs associated with the 
Tulawaka mine are funded by PGI and MDN on a 70:30 basis, and 
that PGI is contractually obligated to pay MDN an amount equal 
to 30% of the net cash generated by the Tulawaka mine, less any 
applicable withholding.
•	 Mineral development agreements: each ABG Group operating 
mine has a mineral development agreement (MDA) with the 
Tanzanian government. The material terms and conditions of each 
such MDA are substantially similar and include provisions governing 
royalty payments, taxes and other charges, banking arrangements, 
local procurement obligations, and import rights. The MDAs also 
provide for no expropriation or nationalisation rights. Broadly these 
rights provide that the Tanzanian government will not nationalise 
or compulsorily acquire the whole or any part of ABG’s interest in 
the applicable special mining licences or any of its property or its 
contractors’ or subcontractors’ property used for the purpose of 
mining operations or in relation to the applicable special mining 
licences, without adequate compensation. Each MDA is governed by 
Tanzanian law. Adherence to the terms and conditions of the MDAs 
is of significant importance to ABG’s business, given the agreements 
overall importance to our operations.
•	 TANESCO relationship: The North Mara, Buzwagi and Bulyanhulu 
mines rely upon electrical power generated by the state power utility 
company, TANESCO. While North Mara and Bulyanhulu have 
diesel power generation facilities on site capable of supporting their 
operations, Buzwagi does not have such self-generation capacity 
and there is no readily available alternative power supply to the 
national grid. ABG has entered into a number of agreements and 
arrangements with TANESCO in respect of power supply and 
purchase prices. These agreements are reviewed on a regular basis. 
As national electricity generation and transmission systems in 
Tanzania are limited, ABG’s ongoing relationship with TANESCO 
is of significant importance to its operations and business. Any 
adverse change or development in this relationship could produce 
a material adverse effect on ABG’s operations, performance and 
financial condition.
All other material contracts and arrangements are summarised above, 
under ‘Material agreements containing change of control provisions’ .
Going concern
The Directors’ statement on going concern is contained on page 54 
of this report.
Corporate governance compliance
The statement on compliance with the Combined Code for the 
reporting period is contained on page 78 of this report.
Articles of association
The Company’s articles of association may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders. 
Shareholder rights 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Ordinary Shares contained 
in ABG’s articles of association are as follows: 
Material agreements containing change of control provisions
The Directors consider the following as material agreements and 
arrangements for ABG’s business and operations, which contain 
provisions which alter or terminate on a change of control of ABG: 
•	 Services Agreement: as part of its IPO preparations, ABG entered 
into a services agreement with Barrick under which Barrick provides 
certain services to ABG and the other members of the ABG Group 
for the ongoing operation of the business. These services include 
support for information technology, technical services, security and 
other administrative and corporate functions. The services agreement 
provides that the services are to be provided to the ABG Group 
for an initial period of 12 months and will continue in force unless 
terminated. The agreement’s termination events include a basis for 
either party to terminate the agreement with immediate effect in the 
event of specified breaches of the agreement, insolvency or analogous 
events or a change of control.
•	 Relationship Agreement: see pages 76 and 77 of this report for an 
overview of the Relationship Agreement. 
•	 Credit Agreement: an overview of the credit agreement between, 
among others, ABG and Citibank International plc as administrative 
agent, is provided on page 53 of this report. A change of control of 
ABG is a mandatory prepayment event under the credit agreement 
and, subject to certain exceptions, a termination event. 
ABG’s mining concessions are held by its operating companies in 
Tanzania. Under applicable law, a change of control of the operating 
companies requires the consent of the Minister of Energy and Minerals 
in Tanzania. 
There are no agreements in place between ABG and its Directors 
or employees which provide for compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a change of control of ABG. 
Special provisions also allow the early exercise of awards made 
under ABG’s Stock Option Plan and early vesting of awards made 
under ABG’s Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), in the event of a 
takeover, reconstruction or winding up. In such circumstances, the 
Compensation committee determines whether and to what extent 
options or awards become exercisable, by taking into account all 
relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, 
satisfaction of any applicable performance condition.
When determining the vesting of LTIP awards or options, the 
committee may proportionately reduce the award depending on the 
time which has elapsed between the first day of the performance 
period and the date of change of control. Alternatively, awards may 
be exchanged for new equivalent awards where appropriate.
Significant relationships
ABG’ s relationship with Barrick as its majority shareholder is summarised 
on pages 76 and 77 of this report. In addition to this relationship, 
the Directors consider the following contractual relationships and 
arrangements as essential for the conduct of ABG’s business:
•	 Tulawaka Agreement: although the Tulawaka mine is 100% owned 
and operated by Pangea Minerals Limited, the economic interest in 
the mine is divided on a 70:30 basis following a 1998 contractual joint 
venture agreement between Pangea Goldfields Inc, an ABG Group  84
www.africanbarrickgold.com
Directors’ report continued
The Directors may retain any dividend or other money payable on 
or in respect of a share on which ABG has a lien and may apply the 
same towards satisfaction of the monies payable to ABG in respect of 
that share.
Unless the Directors otherwise determine, the payment of any dividend 
or other money that would otherwise be payable in respect of shares 
will be withheld, and ABG shall have no obligation to pay interest on it, 
if such shares represent at least 0.25% of the nominal value of the issued 
share capital of their class and the holder, or any other person appearing 
to be interested in those shares, has been issued with a Section 793 
notice and has failed to supply the information required by such notice 
within 14 days. Furthermore, such a holder shall not be entitled to elect 
to receive shares instead of a dividend.
The payment by the Board of any unclaimed dividend or other monies 
on or in respect of a share into a separate account shall not constitute 
ABG a trustee in respect thereof. All dividends unclaimed for a period 
of 12 years after having been declared or become due for payment shall 
be forfeited and shall revert to ABG.
Transfer of shares
Subject to any applicable restrictions, each member may transfer all or 
any of his or her shares, which are in certificated form, by instrument 
of transfer in writing in any usual form or in any other form acceptable 
to the Board and may be under hand only. Such instrument shall be 
executed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a transfer 
of a share which is not fully paid up) by or on behalf of the transferee. 
The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of such share until 
the name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect of it.
All transfers of shares which are in uncertificated form shall, unless the 
CREST regulations otherwise provide, be effected on a relevant system. 
The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without giving 
any reason, refuse to register any transfer of a share in certificated form 
(or renunciation of a renounceable letter of allotment) unless:
(i) it is in respect of a share which is fully paid up;
(ii) it is in respect of only one class of shares;
(iii) it is in favour of not more than four joint transferees;
(iv) it is lodged duly stamped (if so required) at the transfer office;
(v)  it is accompanied by the relevant certificate for the shares to which 
it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably 
require to prove the title of the transferor and the due execution of 
the transfer or, if the transfer is executed by some other person on 
his behalf, the authority of that person to do so; and
(vi)  in the case of partly paid shares listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, such refusal would prevent dealings in such shares from 
taking place on an open and proper basis.
Voting rights
Subject to any special rights or voting restrictions contained in the 
articles of association for any class of share, at any general meeting every 
member who is present in person or by proxy shall on a show of hands 
have one vote and every member present in person or by proxy shall on 
a poll have one vote for each share of which he or she is the holder.
A resolution put to a vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show 
of hands, unless a poll is duly demanded. Subject to the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006, a poll may be demanded by the Chairman, 
by at least five members who have the right to vote at the meeting, by a 
member or members representing not less than one-tenth of the total 
voting rights of all the members having the right to vote at the meeting, 
or by a member or members holding shares conferring a right to vote 
at the meeting, being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid 
up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the 
shares conferring that right.
Unless the Directors otherwise determine, a shareholder is not entitled 
to vote at a shareholders’ meeting, either in person or by proxy, or 
to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to a 
shareholders’ meeting, unless and until all calls or other sums presently 
payable by him in respect of that share with interest and expenses (if 
any) have been paid to ABG or if he or any other person appearing to 
be interested in shares has been issued with a notice pursuant to Section 
793 of the Companies Act 2006 (requiring disclosure of interest in 
shares) and has failed to provide the required information within 14 
days from the service of the notice.
Dividend rights
The Board may declare and pay dividends on any class of shares 
carrying a fixed dividend expressed to be payable on fixed dates and 
may from time to time pay interim dividends as it thinks fit. Final 
dividends shall be declared by ordinary shareholder resolution, in 
accordance with Board recommendations. No dividend declared by 
shareholders shall exceed the amount recommended by the Board.
Provided that the Board acts in good faith, it shall not incur any liability 
to shareholders for any loss that they may suffer by the lawful payment 
of any fixed or interim dividend on any shares ranking after or pari 
passu with those shares.
Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all 
dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts 
paid up on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in 
respect of which the dividend is paid, but if any share is issued on terms 
providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, it 
shall rank for dividend accordingly. No amount paid up on a share in 
advance of the date on which a call is payable shall be treated as paid up 
on the share.
Payment of any dividend declared may be satisfied wholly or partly by 
the distribution of specific assets, and in particular of paid up shares or 
debentures of ABG, with shareholder approval. Annual Report and Accounts 2010
85
Overview Performance Financial statements Shareholder information Governance
liability or obligation of ABG or of any third party up to a maximum 
amount of two times the aggregate of the ABG Group’s adjusted total 
equity, calculated in accordance with the procedure contained in the 
articles of association. Borrowings in excess of this amount require 
prior shareholder approval. 
New issues of shares
The articles of association provide the Directors with a general and 
unconditional authority to allot new shares up to a maximum amount 
of one-third of ABG’s issued Ordinary Share capital for the period 
ending on the date of the forthcoming AGM. Pursuant to this, the 
Directors are empowered to allot any new equity securities wholly for 
cash pursuant to and within the terms of the allotment authority on a 
non-pre-emptive basis if the allotment is made in connection with a 
rights issue or, if not, up to a maximum aggregate amount that is equal 
to 5% of ABG’s issued Ordinary Share capital. The related authority to 
allot shares on a non-pre-emptive basis also expires on the date of the 
forthcoming AGM. These powers were not exercised during the year 
under review. 
These powers are capable of renewal by shareholder resolution. 
Resolutions for a renewal will be put to the shareholders at the 
forthcoming meeting. 
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Shareholders may appoint any person who is willing to act as a Director 
by ordinary resolution and may remove any Director by ordinary 
resolution. The Board may appoint any person to fill any vacancy or as 
an additional Director, provided that they are submitted for re-election 
by the shareholders at the AGM following their appointment. 
Each Director shall retire at the AGM held in the third calendar 
year following his or her election and subsequent re-elections. Non-
Executive Directors shall also retire at each AGM following the ninth 
anniversary of the date of their initial election. All retiring Directors 
shall be eligible for election or re-election unless otherwise determined 
by the Board. 
Specific conditions apply to the vacation of office, including cases where 
a Director becomes prohibited by law or regulation from holding office, 
or is persistently absent from Directors’ meetings, or if three-quarters 
of appointed Directors request his or her resignation or in the case of 
mental incapacity or bankruptcy. 
Barrick’s rights to appoint Directors are summarised on page 76.
Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions undertaken during the year are 
contained in Note 32 on pages 146-147 of the financial statements. 
Post balance sheet events
Particulars of any important events affecting the Company or the 
ABG Group since the year end are contained in Note 34 on page 147 
of the financial statements. 
Unless the Board otherwise determines, a transfer of shares will not 
be registered if the transferor or any other person appearing to be 
interested in the transferor’s shares has been issued with Section 793 
shares in respect of shares representing at least 0.25% of their class and 
the relevant information has not been supplied within 14 days. This 
restriction on transfer will not automatically apply if the member is not 
personally in default as regards supplying the information required and 
the proposed transfer is only part of the member’s holding, provided 
that certain requirements are satisfied at the time of presenting the 
transfer for registration.
Division of ABG assets on a winding up 
If ABG is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a 
shareholder special resolution, divide the whole or any part of ABG’s 
assets between shareholders. In such circumstances the liquidator may 
value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as 
between the shareholders or different classes of shareholder. Subject to 
certain requirements, the liquidator may also vest any part of the assets 
in trustees on such trusts for the benefit of the shareholders, but no 
shareholder shall be compelled to accept any assets on which there is 
a liability.
V ariation of rights
If at any time the share capital of ABG is divided into shares of different 
classes, rights attached to a class may only be varied in such manner 
(if any) as may be provided by prescribed rights or, in the absence of any 
such provision, either with the consent in writing of the holders of not 
less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class 
or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of the holders of shares of the class duly convened and held. 
Powers of Directors
Managing the business 
ABG’s business is managed by the Board, and the articles of association 
permit the Board to exercise all of ABG’s powers in this regard. These 
powers may be exercised by any meeting of the Board at which a 
quorum of two Directors is present. The power of the Board to manage 
the business is subject to any limitations imposed by the Companies 
Act, the articles of association or any directions given by special 
resolution of the shareholders applicable at a relevant time. 
The articles contain an express authority for the appointment of 
Executive Directors and provide the Directors with the authority to 
delegate or confer upon such Directors any of the powers exercisable by 
them upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they 
see fit. The articles contain additional authorities to delegate powers and 
discretions to committees and subcommittees. 
Borrowing powers
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the CREST 
regulations and any other applicable law, the Directors may exercise all 
the powers of ABG to borrow money, guarantee, indemnify, mortgage 
or charge its undertaking, property (present and future) and uncalled 
capital or any part or parts thereof and issue debentures and other 
securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt,  86

disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the ABG Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the ABG Group’s financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the ABG Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

ABG’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

•	 the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
report, includes a fair review of the development or performance of 
the business and the position of ABG and the undertakings included

Katrina White, Company Secretary
Audit information
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware 
there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) 
of the Companies Act 2006) of which the auditors are unaware and 
each Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as 
a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
Under applicable UK law, the Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report, the Directors’ Report, the Remuneration report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulation. 
Responsibility for financial statements
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the ABG Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the ABG Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and

Audit notes
In accordance with Section 421 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the ‘Regulations’), the 
following sections of the Annual Report have been audited: Directors’

Option Plan. The remaining sections are not subject to audit.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ report 
on remuneration for 2010, for which we will be seeking approval from 
shareholders at our Annual General Meeting. 
The Compensation committee is focused on ensuring the remuneration 
policy enables the Group to attract, retain and motivate the executive 
talent required for the successful delivery of our business strategy.
ABG listed on the London Stock Exchange in March 2010, following 
its part demerger from Barrick, which is listed on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange (ABX). Our remuneration arrangements for 2010 were 
largely inherited from Barrick. 
During 2010, the committee reviewed ABG’s remuneration levels with 
reference to the international gold mining companies with which we 
compete for talent, and against FTSE companies of similar size and 
complexity. Based on this review the committee approved the following 
salary increases:
•	 Chief Executive Officer: increase to £450,000 (12.5%); and
•	 Chief Financial Officer: increase to £327,000 (9%)
In the coming year, the committee is committed to further reviewing 
the Company’s remuneration practices to ensure that our executive 
remuneration arrangements continue to be appropriate for our 
particular circumstances and as a UK-listed company. In this way, we 
will ensure that we continue to attract, retain and motivate the executive 
talent required to ensure that we deliver long-term shareholder value.
Michael Kenyon,  
Chairman of the Compensation committee 
10 March 2011
Compensation committee
The committee’s principal responsibilities are: 
•	 setting, reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval 
the Company’s overall remuneration policy and strategy;
•	 setting, reviewing and approving individual remuneration 
arrangements for the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, including terms and conditions of 
employment and any changes;
•	 setting, reviewing and approving individual remuneration 
arrangements for the senior managers including terms and 
conditions of employment and any changes, after considering 
the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. The 
committee in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer shall 
be responsible for determining which employees comprise the 
senior managers;
•	 approving the rules, and launch, of any Company share, share 
option or cash-based incentive scheme and the grant, award, 
allocation or issue of shares, share options or payments under any 
such scheme;
•	 setting, reviewing and approving the corporate and individual 
performance goals for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer;
•	 setting, reviewing and approving the corporate and individual 
performance goals for the senior managers based on the 
Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations;
•	 assessing the achievement of corporate and individual 
performance goals of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer and senior managers;
•	 reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with 
regard to succession planning with respect to the Chief Executive 
Officer and other senior managers;
•	 ensuring that all provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration 
including pensions, as set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the Listing Rules and as required in connection with 
the preparation of the Directors’ remuneration report, are 
fulfilled; and
•	 establishing the selection criteria, selecting, appointing and 
setting the terms of reference for any remuneration consultants 
who advise the committee, and obtaining reliable, up-to-date 
information about remuneration in other companies. 88
www.africanbarrickgold.com
Remuneration report continued
•	 the Short Term Incentive (STI) – is designed to focus executives 
on the business priorities of the financial year and to reinforce the 
individual and Company performance ethic;
•	 the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) – aims to motivate participants 
to maximise total shareholder return (TSR) as measured against a 
comparator group of international gold mining companies over a 
period of three years; and
•	 the Stock Option Plan (SOP) – aims to drive shareholder value over 
the long term and encourage retention.
The three schemes complement each other and enable the measurement 
and reward of both short- and long-term performance. The committee 
considers that the three-year vesting period for the LTIP is appropriate 
as a measure of long-term performance, and that the phased vesting 
period over four years for the SOP is appropriate to encourage retention.
Activities in 2010
During 2010, the Compensation committee carried out the 
following activities:
•	 review of updates on the regulatory, legislative and governance 
environment for executive remuneration;
•	 review of competitive assessment of the remuneration arrangements 
for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Senior 
Managers for 2011;
•	 approval of remuneration arrangements for the Head of Corporate 
Development and Investor Relations, the Chief Operating Officer and 
the General Counsel and Company Secretary;
•	 review and approval of 2010 individual performance, forecast of 2010 
corporate performance results, and pay recommendations for the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managers; and
•	 approval of 2011 salary increases, STI payouts for 2010 and LTIP and 
SOP awards for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, 
Senior Leadership Team and other senior managers.
Components of remuneration
The current remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises 
performance-related and non-performance-related components. The 
performance-related components are the incentive schemes referred to 
above and the non-performance-related components are base salary , 
taxable benefits and pension entitlements. Pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group have been taken into account by the committee in 
determining the remuneration packages for Executive Directors.
The proportion of each Executive Director’ s total remuneration that is 
performance-related is significant even for target performance. For stretch 
performance, the proportion of total remuneration that is performance-
related is higher, as is the total amount of remuneration payable.
The average proportion of remuneration (including pension) that was 
performance-related in 2010 is illustrated by the following chart. In 
estimating the relative importance of those elements of remuneration 
that are, and those that are not, performance-related, a number of 
assumptions have had to be made about the Company’s share price 
growth and TSR, relative to the Company’ s comparator group, over the 
next three years.
The full terms of reference of the Compensation committee can be 
found on the ABG website and copies are available on request.
The committee comprises the Chairman of the Board and three 
independent Non-Executive Directors. It meets on at least one occasion 
each year and at such other times as the Chairman of the committee 
requires. The members during the year were:
•	 Michael Kenyon (Chairman)
•	 James Cross
•	 Andre Falzon
•	 Aaron Regent
Each member’s attendance at meetings held during the year is set 
out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 75. The following 
individuals attend meetings by invitation and provide advice to the 
committee to enable it to make informed decisions; 
•	 Greg Hawkins, Chief Executive Officer; and
•	 Kobus van Vuuren, Head of Human Resources.
No Director is present when his or her own remuneration is 
being discussed.
The committee also meets without management and receives 
information and advice from Kepler Associates, an independent 
executive remuneration consultancy firm appointed by the committee 
in 2010. During 2010, Kepler Associates provided advice to the 
committee on market trends, remuneration benchmarking and other 
remuneration issues. Kepler Associates does not advise the Company 
on any other issues.
Remuneration policy
ABG’s fundamental goal is to create value for its shareholders. In 
serving this goal, the Company’s remuneration policy is designed with 
the following objectives in mind:
•	 to align the interests of Executive Directors with the short- and long-
term interests of shareholders;
•	 to link executive remuneration to the performance of the Company 
and the individual;
•	 to leverage performance through emphasis on variable remuneration 
to reinforce key business imperatives and strategy;
•	 to reinforce the key elements of the Company’s strategy and align the 
Executive team with the strategy; and
•	 to remunerate the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer 
and senior managers at a level and in a manner that ensures that 
ABG is capable of attracting, motivating and retaining talent.
In defining the Company’s remuneration policy, the Compensation 
committee takes into account advice received from external consultants 
and also best practice guidelines set by institutional shareholder bodies, 
including the principles and guidelines on executive remuneration 
issued by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the provisions 
of Schedule A of the Combined Code.
To implement the policy, ABG utilises three complementary 
performance-related incentive schemes for executives: Annual Report and Accounts 2010
89
Overview Performance Financial statements Shareholder information Governance
For the Executive Directors, the performance measures for the 2010 
incentive year were weighted on Group measures, including safety, 
environment, security, government relations, community relations, 
human resources, compliance, production, operating costs, capital 
reserves, projects, the IPO, investor relations and earnings.
In determining the actual incentive payment, the committee considers 
these results against the context of the overall performance of the 
business and of the individual. The review of the overall performance 
of the business takes into consideration such factors as operational 
performance, strategy and business development activities and 
performance against industry peers. The review of individual 
performance takes into consideration achievements against the 
individual’s personal performance contract.
For the 2010 incentive year, taking into account overall business 
and individual performance, the committee has awarded the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer STI payments of 90% 
and 88% of base salary respectively.
Long-term incentives 
For 2010, to ensure continuity during the first year of listing since ABG’ s 
IPO, the long-term incentive plans are broadly commensurate with 
those of Barrick. Over the next 12 months, the committee will review the 
Company’ s long-term incentive offering to ensure that going forward it 
takes into account accepted UK executive remuneration practices.
The rules of the LTIP and SOP each permit a maximum award with a face 
value equal to 200% of salary in each year under normal circumstances. 
The committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances. The 
award is delivered 50% through the LTIP and 50% through the SOP for 
the year-end award. The target combined award granted during 2010 was 
170% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 148% of salary for the 
Chief Financial Officer. This includes the post admission grant awards. 
Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP)
A limited number of Senior Managers are allocated Company shares 
under the LTIP . The Company’s TSR performance against the market 
cap-weighted average TSR of a comparator group of companies over a 
three-year performance period commencing on the date of grant will 
determine what proportion of the allocated shares will be transferred 
into the ownership of the employee. There is no retest provision. 
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIP 
is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the 
performance conditions had been met at the time.
For the 2010 LTIP allocations, the comparator group comprises 16 
companies. The committee considers that this group represents an 
appropriate set of international gold mining companies against which 
ABG’s performance could be compared by shareholders.

Base salaries
Executive Directors’ salaries are reviewed each year with any changes 
normally taking effect from 1 January. This review takes into account 
individual performance and market competitiveness. Pensionable salary 
is derived from base salary only. 
In line with our remuneration policy, the committee benchmarks 
Executive Directors’ salaries against comparator groups, which, for the 
2010 salary review, were international gold mining, general mining 
and FTSE-listed companies of similar size and complexity. For 2011, 
Executive Director salaries will be between the lower quartile and 
median for these comparator groups.
The committee approved the following 2011 salary increases for 
Executive Directors:
 
2011 salary
Increase on  
2010 salary
Chief Executive Officer £450,000 12.5%
Chief Financial Officer £327,000 9%
Short T erm Incentive (STI)
The Group operates a cash-based STI, which in 2010 provided an 
incentive opportunity in the range of 0% to 150% of base salary for 
Executive Directors. For 2011 the committee approved the following 
STI opportunities for the Executive Directors:
2011 target 
STI opportunity
2011 maximum 
STI opportunity
Chief Executive Officer 75% 150%
Chief Financial Officer 75% 150%
At the start of each incentive year, the Board will set challenging budget 
and stretch financial performance targets and the committee endorses 
other performance measures, notably with respect to health, safety 
and environmental indicators. Short-term incentives at the higher end 
of the range are payable only for demonstrably superior Group and 
individual performance.  90
www.africanbarrickgold.com
Stock Option Plan (SOP)
The Company may grant options over its shares with the option price 
set at least at the fair market value at the time of the grant. Grants vest 
in equal parts over four years and expire seven years from the date of 
grant. A four-year vesting period is intended to aid in the retention 
of key talent. The committee may also, at its discretion, impose a 
performance condition on SOP grants. In 2010, options were granted 
with no performance conditions attached.
Legacy Barrick Incentive Plans
Following the IPO in March 2010, many of our Senior Managers, 
who were previously employees of Barrick, retained stock options and 
restricted share units under Barrick’s remuneration arrangements. 
Further details of these plans and any holdings are disclosed on page 
94. ABG Executive Directors are no longer eligible for further awards 
under the Barrick incentive plans.
Pensions
Executive Directors receive contributions of 25% of gross base salary 
into a personal pension scheme of the Executive Director’s choice,  
or a cash supplement of commensurate value. It is separately identified 
in the emoluments table on page 92.
The Group does not operate any defined benefit schemes. 
Dilution
No options have been exercised. In the event of all options and shares 
outstanding as at 31 December 2010 under ABG’ s share-based schemes 
(which involve the issue of new shares) becoming exercisable, the resulting 
issue of shares would represent approximately 0.30% of the issued share 
capital as at that date. 
Service contracts
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, including arrangements for 
early termination, are carefully considered by the committee and are 
designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required 
to manage the Company. The committee considers that a notice period 
of one year is appropriate. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide for compensation 
of 12 months’ salary in the event of early termination. 
Senior Managers below the Executive Directors
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior 
employees below the Executive Directors is entirely consistent with that 
for the Executive Directors. These Senior Managers all have a significant 
portion of their reward package linked to performance. They all qualify 
for annual bonus and LTIP and SOP awards, and their performance 
targets are the same as, or cascaded from, the targets for the Executive 
Directors. The committee reviews and approves the individual 
remuneration packages for the Senior Managers in accordance with 
the overriding objectives of our remuneration policy. Their individual 
performance is reviewed and their base salary increases, annual bonus 
payments and LTIP and SOP awards are subject to approval by the 
committee each year.
The companies in the comparator group are as follows:
Agnico-Eagle Mines Y amana Gold
Centamin Egypt Goldfields
Eldorado Gold AngloGold Ashanti
Harmony Gold Zijin
Iamgold Minas Buenaventura
Petropavlovsk Kinross
Randgold Resources Polyus Gold
Semafo Centerra Gold
The committee reviews this comparator group from time to time and 
intends to do so before making future allocations under the LTIP .
The committee has set the following performance conditions for 
allocations made under the LTIP:
ABG’s TSR % outperformance of comparator 
group weighted mean over three years
% of allocated 
 shares transferred
+20% 2x target
0% Target
-12.5% 0.5x target
Below -12.5% All allocated shares are forfeited
Where performance is between the above levels, the percentage of 
shares to be transferred is determined on a proportionate basis.

The following section of this report provides details of the 
remuneration, service contracts or letters of appointment and share 
interests of all the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Non-Executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre 
with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination committee. Their appointment 
is for an initial term of three years until 1 February 2013, subject to 
election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment. 
Upon the recommendation of the Nomination committee, they are 
re-appointed for a second term of three years, subject to re-election by 
shareholders. There is a three-month notice period and no provision 
for termination payments. 
The terms of engagement of the Non-Executive Directors are set out 
in a letter of appointment.
The basic annual fee paid to Non-Executive Directors is £50,000 
per annum. Additional fees of £10,000 are also payable for acting as 
Senior Independent Director or as Chairman of the Audit committee, 
Compensation committee or EHS&S committee. Fees are reviewed on 
a regular basis, taking into account time commitment, competition 
for high quality Non-Executive Directors and market conditions. A 
review is underway of the current level and components of the Non-
Executive Directors’ compensation and it is likely that the level will 
increase in 2011.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the 
Company’s share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
Chairman
Aaron Regent was appointed as Chairman with effect from 
1 February 2010. In line with the Non-Executive Directors, Mr Regent’s 
appointment is for a three-year term and there is no notice period and 
no provision for payment in the event of early termination. Mr Regent 
receives no fee.
Performance graph
The graph below shows ABG’s TSR performance for the period from 
the IPO date to 31 December 2010 (calculated in accordance with the 
regulations) against the performance of the FTSE 100. 
The FTSE 100 was chosen because this is a recognised broad 
equity market index of which the Company was a member for the 
reporting period. 92

Barrick Restricted Share Units (RSUs)
RSUs were granted in lieu of actual shares. Each RSU has a value equal to one Barrick common share. RSUs granted prior to 2008 vest and are paid 
out in cash on the third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs granted after December 2008 vest and are paid out in cash 30 months after the date of 
grant. Pursuant to the RSU plan, at vesting, each RSU will have a value equal to the then current average closing market price in Canadian dollars of 
one Barrick common share on each day during the last five trading days prior to the vesting date. Additional RSUs are credited to reflect dividends 
paid on Barrick common shares and are subject to the same vesting provisions as the underlying RSUs that were actually granted.
Barrick Performance Restricted Share Units (PRSUs)
The number of target PRSUs granted equalled the number of RSUs granted (25% of the total long-term incentive award). PRSUs vest based on the 
achievement of goals over a three-year performance period. 
Additional PRSUs are credited to reflect dividends paid on Barrick Common Shares during the performance period. PRSUs resulting from dividend 
equivalent credits are subject to the same vesting provisions as the underlying PRSUs that were actually granted. Overview Performance Financial statements Shareholder information

United Kingdom Reserves and resources 
 
Mineral reserves and mineral resources estimates contained in this 
report have been calculated as at 31 December 2010 in accordance 
with National Instrument 43-101 as required by Canadian securities 
regulatory authorities, unless otherwise stated. Canadian Institute of 
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) definitions were followed 
for mineral reserves and resources. Calculations have been reviewed, 
verified (including estimation methodology, sampling, analytical and 
test data) and compiled by ABG personnel under the supervision of 
ABG Qualified Persons: Nic Schoeman, Director of Technical 
Services, Richard Adofo, Corporate Manager, Geology and Robert 
van der Westhuizen, Corporate Mine Planning Manager. However, 
the figures stated are estimates and no assurances can be given that 
the indicated quantities of metal will be produced. 
Mineral reserves have been calculated using an assumed long-term 
average gold price of US$1,000.00 per ounce, a silver price of 
US$16.00 per ounce and a copper price of US$2.00 per pound. 
Reserve calculations incorporate current and/or expected mine plans 
and cost levels at each property. Mineral resources have been calculated 
using an assumed long-term average gold price of US$1,200.00 per 
ounce, a silver price of US$19.00 per ounce and a copper price of 
US$2.50 per pound. Resources have been estimated using varying cut-
off grades, depending on the type of mine or project, its maturity and 
ore types at each property. Reserve estimates are dynamic and are 
influenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues, 
environmental regulations and any other relevant new information 
and therefore these can vary from year to year. Resource estimates 
can also change and tend to be influenced mostly by new information 
pertaining to the understanding of the deposit and secondly the 
conversion to ore reserves. In addition, estimates of inferred mineral 
resources may not form the basis of an economic analysis and it 
cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource 
will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, investors are 
cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral 
resource exists, that it can be economically or legally mined, or that 
it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, investors are 
cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated 
mineral resources will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves. 
Tulawaka mineral reserves and resources are stated as ABG’s 70% 
attributable portion.  
The Nyanzaga mineral reserves and mineral resources estimates 
contained in this report are based on the inferred resource declaration 
made by Tusker Gold Limited in June 2009, which was calculated in 
accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration 
Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition. 
Definitions 
A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, 
natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilised organic 
material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial 
minerals in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of 
such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics 
and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. Mineral 
resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological 
confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories. 
An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for 
which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of 
geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, 
but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is 
based on limited information and sampling gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes. 
An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource  
for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical 
characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient 
to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 
parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed 
and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for 
geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for 
which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical 
characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with 
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical 
and economic parameters, to support production planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is 
based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations 
such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are 
spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 
Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. 
A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured  
or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary 
feasibility study. This study must include adequate information on 
mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant 
factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction can be justified. A mineral reserve includes diluting 
materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material  
is mined. Mineral reserves are subdivided in order of increasing 
confidence into probable mineral reserves and proven mineral reserves.  
A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an 
indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource 
demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. This study 
must include adequate information on mining, processing, 
metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, 
at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. 
A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a 
measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary 
feasibility study. This study must include adequate information on 
mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant 
factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction is justified.

www.africanbarrickgold.com Independent Auditors’ report to the members of  
African Barrick Gold plc 
 
We have audited the Group financial statements of African Barrick  
Gold plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement  
and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 86, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the Group financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at  
31 December 2010 and of its profit and cash flows for the year  
then ended;  
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and  
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006  
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:  
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit, or 
• a Corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the 
parent company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 54, in relation to 
going concern;  
• the part of the Corporate Governance report relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
Directors’ remuneration. 
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements  
of African Barrick Gold plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 and 
on the information in the Remuneration report that is described as 
having been audited.

Notes: 
(a) The maintenance and integrity of the African Barrick Gold plc website is the 
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility 
for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were 
initially presented on the website. 
(b) Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
a) Basis of preparation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRS), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretation and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The Company became the holding company for the Group pursuant to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation completed on 22 February 2010, as d etailed 
in Note 1. As this was a reorganisation of businesses under common control, the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 
31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 have been prepared on a basis that combines the results and assets and liabilities of each of the 
companies constituting the Group (the pooling of interest method of accounting).  
For the periods prior to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation, consolidated financial statements were not prepared for the Group. The accompanying 
consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries as if the Group had been in existence throughout the 
period presented and as if the Pre-IPO Reorganisation had occurred as at 1 January 2009.  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention basis, as modified by the revaluation of financial 
assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except 
when otherwise indicated.  
Where a change in the presentational format between the Prospectus and the consolidated financial statements has been made during the 
period, comparative figures have been restated accordingly. The following presentational changes were made during the current year: 
• Revenue from the sale of copper and silver is treated as co-product revenue, and included in total revenue in line with a management 
decision to record it as co-product revenue. Co-product revenue increased by 202% year-on-year. This is different from the Prospectus, 
where it was treated as by-product revenue as a credit to cost of sales. The change was a result of increased revenue from copper following 
the commencement of copper concentrate sales at Buzwagi. Refer to Notes 2k), 3, 4 and 5. 
• Assets relating to restrictive share unit liabilities of US$7.5 million have been reclassified and offset against the liability. This is different from 
the Prospectus where the asset was shown separately as part of non-current assets. As this amount has an immaterial impact on the opening 
position, no opening balance sheet is presented. Refer to Notes 2w), 3 and 21. 
• Gains and losses on the translation of foreign currency transactions are deemed to be part of other charges. This is different from the 
Prospectus where it was classified as part of corporate administration. Refer to Note 3. 
• Gains and losses on the translation of foreign currency transactions are deemed to be part of operating cash flows. This is different from the 
Prospectus where it was classified as part of working capital. Refer to Note 14. 
• The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be 
able to operate within the level of its current financing. 
• After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operat ional existence 
for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to adap t the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.

• IFRS 3 (revised), “Business combinations”, and consequential amendments to IAS 27 (revised), “Consolidated and separate financial 
statements”, IAS 28 “Investments in associates”, and IAS 31 “Interest in joint ventures”, are effective prospectively to business combinations 
for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with some significant changes compared 
with IFRS 3. For example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments 
classified as debt subsequently re-measured through the income statement. There is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to 
measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value 
or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-related costs are expensed. 
The revised standard was applied to the acquisition of the controlling interest in Tusker Gold Ltd on 27 April 2010. Acquisition-related costs 
of US$387,294 have been recognised in the consolidated income statement, which previously would have been included in the consideration 
for the business combination. See Note 22 for further details of the business combination that occurred in 2010. 
IAS 27 (revised) requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interest to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control 
and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost. 
Any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. IAS 27 (revised) did not 
have a material impact on the Group earnings or equity in the current period.  
• IAS 36 (amendment), “Impairment of assets”, effective 1 January 2010. The amendment clarifies that the largest cash-generating unit 
(or group of units) to which goodwill should be allocated for the purposes of impairment testing is an operating segment, as defined by 
paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, “Operating segments” (that is, before the aggregation of segments with similar economic characteristics). IAS 36 
(amendment) has had no impact on the current period as no impairment was identified when testing goodwill impairment at an operating 
segment level. 
• IFRS 2 (amendments), “Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions”, effective from 1 January 2010. In addition to incorporating 
IFRIC 8, “Scope of IFRS 2”, and IFRIC 11, “IFRS 2, Group and treasury share transactions”, the amendments expand on the guidance in 
IFRIC 11 to address the classification of Group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation. The application of the standard 
did not have a material effect on the Group. 
c) New and amended standards, and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 
1 January 2010 but not currently relevant to the Group (although they may affect the accounting for future 
transactions and events)  
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2010 or later periods, but are currently not relevant to the Group. 
• IFRIC 17, “Distribution of non-cash assets to owners” (effective on or after 1 July 2009). The interpretation was published in November 2008. 
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as 
a distribution of reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when 
they are amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present 
condition and the distribution is highly probable. 
• IFRIC 18, “Transfers of assets from customers”, effective for transfer of assets received on or after 1 July 2009. This interpretation clarifies the 
requirements of IFRSs for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity 
must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services 
(such as a supply of electricity, gas or water). In some cases, the entity receives cash from a customer that must be used only to acquire or 
construct the item of property, plant, and equipment in order to connect the customer to a network or provide the customer with ongoing 
access to a supply of goods or services (or to do both).

c) New and amended standards, and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning

transactions and events)  
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2010 or later periods, but are currently not relevant to the Group. 
• IFRIC 17, “Distribution of non-cash assets to owners” (effective on or after 1 July 2009). The interpretation was published in November 2008. 
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as 
a distribution of reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when 
they are amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present

construct the item of property, plant, and equipment in order to connect the customer to a network or provide the customer with ongoing 
access to a supply of goods or services (or to do both). 
 
 
 
• IFRIC 9, “Reassessment of embedded derivatives” and IAS 39, “Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement”, effective 1 July 2009. 
This amendment to IFRIC 9 requires an entity to assess whether an embedded derivative should be separated from a host contract when 
the entity reclassifies a hybrid financial asset out of the “fair value through profit or loss” category. This assessment is to be made based on 
circumstances that existed on the later of the date the entity first became a party to the contract and the date of any contract amendments 
that significantly change the cash flows of the contract. If the entity is unable to make this assessment, the hybrid instrument must remain 
classified as at fair value through profit or loss in its entirety. 
• IFRIC 16, “Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation” effective 1 July 2009. This amendment states that, in a hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation, qualifying hedging instruments may be held by any entity or entities within the Group, including the 
foreign operation itself, as long as the designation, documentation and effectiveness requirements of IAS 39 that relate to a net investment 
hedge are satisfied. In particular, the Group should clearly document its hedging strategy because of the possibility of different designations 
at different levels of the Group. 
• IAS 38 (amendment), “Intangible assets”, effective 1 January 2010. The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an 
intangible asset acquired in a business combination and permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has a similar 
useful economic life. 
• IAS 1 (amendment), “Presentation of financial statements”. The amendment clarifies that the potential settlement of a liability by the issue 
of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or non-current. By amending the definition of current liability, the amendment permits 
a liability to be classified as non-current (provided that the entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement by transfer of cash or other 
assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period) notwithstanding the fact that the entity could be required by the counterparty to 
settle in shares at any time. 
• IFRS 5 (amendment), “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”. The amendment clarifies that IFRS 5 specifies the 
disclosures required in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations. It also clarifies 
that the general requirements of IAS 1 still apply, in particular paragraph 15 (to achieve a fair presentation) and paragraph 125 (sources of 
estimation uncertainty) of IAS 1. 
d) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 
2010 and not early adopted 
The Group’s and parent entity’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below. 
• IFRS 9, “Financial instruments”, issued in November 2009. This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39, “Financial 
instruments: recognition and measurement”. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets. T he standard 
is not applicable until 1 January 2013 but is available for early adoption. However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.  
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact, however initial indications are that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact 
on the Group’s operating results or financial position. 
• IAS 24 (revised), “Related party disclosures”, issued in November 2009. It supersedes IAS 24, “Related party disclosures”, issued in 2003. IAS 
24 (revised) is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted. The revised 
standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party and removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose 
details of all transactions with the government and other government-related entities. The Group will apply the revised standard from 
1 January 2011. It is not expected to have any impact on the Group’s or the parent entity’s financial statements. 
• IAS 32 (amendment), “Classification of rights issues”, issued in October 2009. The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after 
1 February 2010. Earlier application is permitted. The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the issuer. Provided certain conditions are met, such rights issues are now classified as equity regardless of 
the currency in which the exercise price is denominated. Previously, these issues had to be accounted for as derivative liabili ties. The amendment 
applies retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8, “Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors”. The Group has not issued 
any rights issues.

d) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 
2010 and not early adopted continued 
• IFRIC 19, “Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments”, effective 1 July 2010. The interpretation clarifies the accounting by 
an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity 
to extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt for equity swap). It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss, which is 
measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued. If the fair 
value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the equity instruments should be measured to reflect the fair value of the 
financial liability extinguished. The Group will apply the interpretation from 1 January 2011. It is not expected to have any impact on the 
Group’s or the parent entity’s financial statements. 
• IFRIC 14 (amendments), “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement”. The amendments correct an unintended consequence of  
IFRIC 14, “IAS 19, The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction”. Without the amendments, 
entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments for minimum funding contributions. This was not intended 
when IFRIC 14 was issued, and the amendments correct this. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011. 
Earlier application is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to the earliest comparative period presented. It is not 
expected to have any impact on the Group’s or the parent entity’s financial statements. 
e) Significant judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Many of the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements require management to make judgements and/or estimates. These 
judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant facts and 
circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. The Life of Mine plans are 
central to a number of key estimates and are approved by the Board of Directors annually. Information about such judgements and estimation 
is included in the accounting policies and/or notes to the consolidated financial statements, and the key areas are summarised below. 
Areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements include: 
• Estimates of the quantities of proven and probable gold reserves – Note 2i); 
• The capitalisation of production stripping costs – Note 2j); 
• The capitalisation of exploration and evaluation expenditures – Notes 2m) and 7; 
• Review of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets’ carrying value, the determination of whether these assets are impaired and the 
measurement of impairment charges or reversals – Notes 2p), 2q), 2r), 2s), 18 and 19;

f) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2010 and 2009, and operating results and cash 
flows for the years then ended. The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and 
companies controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies in order 
to obtain benefits from their activities. Control is presumed to exist where the Company has more than one half of the voting r ights unless it can 
be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control. Control does not exist where other parties hold veto rights over significant operating 
and financial decisions. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible as well as other contractual 
arrangements that enable the Company to exercise control are taken into account. The consolidated financial statements include all of the 
assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany transactions as noted 
above. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control passed to the Group, and have been excluded 
from the date on which control transferred out of the Group. For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets and net earnings attributable to non-
controlling interests are presented as “Invested capital attributable to non-controlling interests” in the consolidated balance sheet and “Net 
profit attributable to non-controlling interests” in the consolidated income statement, respectively.  
g) Business combinations 
On acquiring a business, the acquisition method of accounting is used, whereby the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable net 
assets on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. Provisional fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months of 
the acquisition date. Acquisition costs are expensed.  
When purchase consideration is contingent on future events, the initial cost of the acquisition recorded includes an estimate of the fair value 
of the contingent amounts expected to be payable in the future. The cost of the acquisition is adjusted when revised estimates are made, with 
corresponding adjustments made to goodwill. 
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values of the identifiable net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill, which is 
reviewed for impairment annually or when there is an indication of impairment. If the fair value attributable to the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets exceeds the cost of acquisition, the difference is recognised in the income statement. 
h) Foreign currency translation 
The Group’s transactions are denominated in a number of different currencies (primarily US dollars, Tanzanian Shillings (“Shillings”), South 
African Rands (“Rands”), UK pound sterling (“Pounds”) and Australian dollars). The Group has liabilities that are primarily denominated in 
US dollars. The US dollar is the Company’s (and its main subsidiaries’) functional currency, as well as the Group’s presentation currency. 
Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar are translated at the exchange rates as at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the US dollar are translated to US dollars at year-end exchange rates. All differences that arise 
are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary assets measured at historical cost in a currency other than US dollars are translated using 
the exchange rates at the date of the initial transactions. Where non-monetary assets are measured at fair value in a currency other than US 
dollars they are translated into US dollars using the exchange rates on the date when the fair value was determined.  
The following exchange rates to the US dollar have been applied:

i) Determination of ore reserves 
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance 
with the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 43-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects” requirements. Reports 
to support these estimates are prepared each year. Proven and pr obable (2P) reserves, and for certain mines other mineral resou rces, determined in this 
way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, the assessment of life of mine stripping ratios and for 
forecasting the timing of the payments related to the environmental rehabilitation provision.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
i) Determination of ore reserves continued 
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral resources are only taken into account where there is a high degree of confidence 
of economic extraction.  
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change 
significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or 
recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in the reserves being revised. 
j) Stripping costs 
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove over burden and other waste materials to access ore from which minerals can be extracted 
economically. The process of mining overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping. Stripping costs incurred during the development 
stage of a mine (or pit) in order to provide initial access to the ore body (referred to as pre-production stripping) are capitalised as mine 
development costs and amortised over the ore reserves of the mine (or pit) using the units of production method. 
Stripping costs incurred during the production stage (referred to as production stripping) are accounted for according to the benefit received by 
the Group. Production stripping costs that benefit the current period are considered costs of current production and represent a component of 
inventory cost, which is charged to cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. Production stripping costs that generate a future economic 
benefit to the Group are capitalised as mine development costs and amortised over the ore reserves to be mined in the future on a units of 
production basis (similar to the accounting treatment of pre-production stripping costs) and included as a component of inventory cost as the 
applicable ore reserves are extracted. Production stripping costs incurred related to the further development of the mine (or pit), which 
generally requires a phase of unusually high waste removal activity that is similar to pre-production stripping, are considered to generate a 
future economic benefit to the Group. Such production stripping costs generate a future economic benefit when the related stripping activity: 
i) provides access to ore to be mined in the future; ii) increases the fair value of the mine (or pit), that is the mine (or pit) is more valuable after the 
waste material has been removed as access to future mineral reserves becomes less costly; (iii) increases the productive capacity or extends the 
productive life of the mine (or pit). Such production phase stripping costs are capitalised as mine development costs.  
For periods where production stripping activity generates a future economic benefit, the planned life of mine (or pit) waste-to-ore tonnes ratio 
(the “strip ratio”) is considered, along with other functions such as the length and intensity of the stripping campaign, to determine the amount 
of production stripping costs incurred related to current production versus the amount that relates to the future economic benefit.  
Where a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, stripping costs are 
accounted for separately by reference to the ore reserves from each separate pit (i.e. the initial stripping of the second and subsequent pits 
is considered to be pre-production stripping). If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and 
subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases, the initial stripping of the second 
and subsequent pits is considered to be production stripping relating to the combined operation. 
k) Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that all of the following criteria are met: 
• the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer; 
• neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods sold, 
has been retained; 
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;  
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group; and 
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be measured reliably. 
Gold doré sales 
Gold doré is unrefined gold bullion bars usually consisting of 90% gold that is refined to pure gold bullion prior to sale to our customers. 
Historically all doré sales were made to Barrick International Banking Corporation (“BIBC”), a related party. From May 2010 onwards gold 
doré was sold directly to third parties. Revenue from gold doré sales is recognised either at the time of sale to a third party or, in relation to 
quarter end settlements, at the time of shipment should the Group have received confirmation of sale to the third party. The sales price is 
based on the gold spot price at the time of sale.

economically. The process of mining overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping. Stripping costs incurred during the development 
stage of a mine (or pit) in order to provide initial access to the ore body (referred to as pre-production stripping) are capitalised as mine 
development costs and amortised over the ore reserves of the mine (or pit) using the units of production method. 
Stripping costs incurred during the production stage (referred to as production stripping) are accounted for according to the benefit received by 
the Group. Production stripping costs that benefit the current period are considered costs of current production and represent a component of 
inventory cost, which is charged to cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. Production stripping costs that generate a future economic 
benefit to the Group are capitalised as mine development costs and amortised over the ore reserves to be mined in the future on a units of 
production basis (similar to the accounting treatment of pre-production stripping costs) and included as a component of inventory cost as the 
applicable ore reserves are extracted. Production stripping costs incurred related to the further development of the mine (or pit), which 
generally requires a phase of unusually high waste removal activity that is similar to pre-production stripping, are considered to generate a 
future economic benefit to the Group. Such production stripping costs generate a future economic benefit when the related stripping activity: 
i) provides access to ore to be mined in the future; ii) increases the fair value of the mine (or pit), that is the mine (or pit) is more valuable after the 
waste material has been removed as access to future mineral reserves becomes less costly; (iii) increases the productive capacity or extends the 
productive life of the mine (or pit). Such production phase stripping costs are capitalised as mine development costs.  
For periods where production stripping activity generates a future economic benefit, the planned life of mine (or pit) waste-to-ore tonnes ratio 
(the “strip ratio”) is considered, along with other functions such as the length and intensity of the stripping campaign, to determine the amount 
of production stripping costs incurred related to current production versus the amount that relates to the future economic benefit.  
Where a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, stripping costs are 
accounted for separately by reference to the ore reserves from each separate pit (i.e. the initial stripping of the second and subsequent pits 
is considered to be pre-production stripping). If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and 
subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases, the initial stripping of the second 
and subsequent pits is considered to be production stripping relating to the combined operation. 
k) Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that all of the following criteria are met: 
• the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer; 
• neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods sold, 
has been retained; 
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;  
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group; and 
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be measured reliably. 
Gold doré sales 
Gold doré is unrefined gold bullion bars usually consisting of 90% gold that is refined to pure gold bullion prior to sale to our customers. 
Historically all doré sales were made to Barrick International Banking Corporation (“BIBC”), a related party. From May 2010 onwards gold 
doré was sold directly to third parties. Revenue from gold doré sales is recognised either at the time of sale to a third party or, in relation to 
quarter end settlements, at the time of shipment should the Group have received confirmation of sale to the third party. The sales price is 
based on the gold spot price at the time of sale. 
 
 
Concentrate sales 
Concentrate is a processing product containing the valuable ore mineral gold, copper and silver from which most of the waste mi neral has been 
eliminated, that undergoes a smelting process to convert it into gold bullion, copper and silver concentrate. Under the terms of concentrate 
sales contracts with independent smelting companies, gold, copper and silver in concentrate is sold at trailing monthly average spot prices 
based on contract quotational periods. 
Revenue is recorded, net of selling costs, at the time of shipment, which is also when risks and rewards pass to the smelting companies, using 
forward market prices on the expected date that final sales prices will be fixed. Variations between the price recorded at the shipment date and 
the actual final price set under the smelting contracts are caused by changes in market prices, and result in an embedded derivative in accounts 
receivable. The embedded derivative is recorded at fair value each period until final settlement occurs, with changes in fair value classified as 
provisional price adjustments and included as a component of revenue. Co-product revenues from the sale of by-products, such as copper and 
silver, contained in the concentrate are recognised in revenue. 
Co-products 
Revenue from the sale of co-products, such as copper and silver, contained in concentrates are recognised in revenue. As detailed in Note 2a) 
in the Prospectus co-product revenue was treated as a by-product and credited to cost of sales. As a result of co-product revenue becoming 
increasingly significant to the Group, reflected in the 202% year-on-year increase, primarily as a result of Buzwagi commencing its production 
of copper and increases in copper prices, copper sales have been reclassified as co-product revenue. 
l) Cost of sales 
Cost of sales consists of direct mining costs (which include personnel costs, general and administrative costs, energy costs (principally diesel 
fuel and electricity), maintenance and repair costs, operating supplies, external services, third-party smelting, refining and transport fees), 
and depreciation related to sales as well as production taxes and royalty expenses for the period. Cost of sales is based on average costing for 
contained or recoverable ounces sold as well as production taxes and royalty expense for the period. This is different to the Prospectus in which 
the sale of copper by-products was credited against cost of sales, as noted in Notes 2a) and 2k). All costs are net of any impairment to reduce 
inventory to its net realisable value. 
m) Exploration and evaluation  
Exploration expenditures 
Exploration expenditures relate to the initial search for mineral deposits with economic potential as well as expenditures incurred for the 
purposes of obtaining more information about existing mineral deposits. Exploration expenditures typically comprise costs that are directly 
attributable to:  
• researching and analysing existing exploration data;  
• conducting geological studies;  
• exploratory drilling and sampling for the purposes of obtaining core samples and the related metallurgical assay of these cores; and 
• drilling to determine the volume and grade of deposits in an area known to contain mineral resources or for the purposes of converting 
mineral resources into proven and probable reserves. 
Exploration expenditures incurred at greenfield sites (sites where the Group does not have any mineral deposits that are already being mined 
or developed) are expensed as incurred. Exploration expenditures incurred at brownfield sites (sites that are adjacent to a mineral deposit that 
is classified within proven and probable reserves and are already being mined or developed) are capitalised if the following criteria are met: 
• The drilling is being done in an inferred or measured and indicated resource; and  
• There is an existing proven and probable reserve that is contiguous or adjacent to where the drilling is being done; and  
• It is probable that the resource will be converted to a proven and probable reserve.  
The assessment of probability is based on the following factors: results from previous drill programmes; results from a geological study; results 
from a mine scoping study confirming economic viability of the resource; and preliminary estimates of the volume and grade of the deposit, 
and the net cash flows expected to be generated from its development. Costs incurred at brownfield sites that meet the above criteria are 
capitalised as a component of property, plant and equipment (“mine development costs”) pursuant to IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’. 
All other drilling and related exploration costs incurred at these sites are expensed as mine site exploration. Exploration expenditures incurred 
for the purposes of determining additional information on a mineral deposit that is classified within proven and probable reserves or for the 
purposes of extending an existing mineral deposit that is classified within proven and probable reserves and is already being mined or 
developed are also capitalised as mine development costs.

m) Exploration and evaluation continued 
Evaluation expenditures 
Evaluation expenditures arise from a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential 
in order to determine their technical feasibility and commercial viability. They typically include costs directly attributable to: 
• detailed engineering studies; 
• examination and testing of extraction methods and metallurgical/treatment processes; 
• surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements;  
• permitting activities; and 
• detailed economic evaluations to determine whether development of the reserves is commercially justified, including the preparation of 
scoping, pre-feasibility and final feasibility studies. 
Evaluation expenditures incurred at greenfield sites are expensed as incurred. Evaluation expenditures incurred at brownfield sites are expensed 
as incurred, unless it can be demonstrated that the related evaluation expenditures will generate a future economic benefit.  
Evaluation expenditures incurred at operating mines/development projects are capitalised as a component of property, plant and equipment, 
“Mining properties and development costs”, respectively.  
Acquired exploration and evaluation properties 
Exploration and evaluation stage properties acquired either as an acquisition of individual assets or as part of a business combination are capitalised 
as an intangible asset, “Acquired exploration and evaluation properties”. Exploration and evaluation stage properties represent interests in 
properties that do not have mineralised material classified within proven and probable reserves. The value of such properties is primarily driven 
by the nature and amount of mineralised material contained in such properties, including value attributable to the rights to explore or develop: 
i) a property containing mineralised material classified as a measured, indicated or inferred resource; or ii) a prospective greenfield property 
with significant exploration potential. Exploration and evaluation expenditures incurred on such properties subsequent to their acquisition are 
expensed as incurred until the technical and commercial viability of developing the property has been demonstrated under the same criteria 
described above for exploration and evaluation expenditures.  
n) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if additional 
Ordinary Shares are assumed to be issued under securities that entitle their holders to obtain Ordinary Shares in the future. For stock options, 
the number of additional shares for inclusion in diluted earnings per share calculations is determined using the treasury stock method. Under 
this method, stock options, whose exercise price is less than the average market price of our Ordinary Shares, are assumed to be exercised and 
the proceeds are used to repurchase Ordinary Shares at the average market price for the period. The incremental number of Ordinary Shares 
issued under stock options and repurchased from proceeds is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 
o) Inventory 
Material extracted from the Group’s mines is classified as either ore or waste. Ore represents material that, at the time of extraction, is expected 
to be processed into a saleable form and sold at a profit. Waste represents material that is required to be removed to access ore bodies. Ore is 
recorded as an asset that is classified within inventory as material is extracted from the open pit or underground mine. Ore is accumulated in 
stockpiles that are subsequently processed into gold in a saleable form under a mine plan that takes into consideration optimal scheduling of 
production of our reserves, present plant capacity, and the market price of gold and copper. Work in process inventory represents gold, copper 
and silver in the processing circuit that has not completed the production process, and is not yet in a saleable form. Finished goods inventory 
represents gold in saleable form that has not yet been shipped. Mine operating supplies represent commodities and other raw materials 
consumed in the production process, as well as spare parts and other maintenance supplies that are not classified as capital items. Inventories 
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis. Average costs are calculated 
by reference to the cost of inventory at the beginning of the period together with the cost of inventory produced in a period.

the proceeds are used to repurchase Ordinary Shares at the average market price for the period. The incremental number of Ordinary Shares 
issued under stock options and repurchased from proceeds is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 
o) Inventory 
Material extracted from the Group’s mines is classified as either ore or waste. Ore represents material that, at the time of extraction, is expected 
to be processed into a saleable form and sold at a profit. Waste represents material that is required to be removed to access ore bodies. Ore is 
recorded as an asset that is classified within inventory as material is extracted from the open pit or underground mine. Ore is accumulated in 
stockpiles that are subsequently processed into gold in a saleable form under a mine plan that takes into consideration optimal scheduling of 
production of our reserves, present plant capacity, and the market price of gold and copper. Work in process inventory represents gold, copper 
and silver in the processing circuit that has not completed the production process, and is not yet in a saleable form. Finished goods inventory 
represents gold in saleable form that has not yet been shipped. Mine operating supplies represent commodities and other raw materials 
consumed in the production process, as well as spare parts and other maintenance supplies that are not classified as capital items. Inventories 
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis. Average costs are calculated 
by reference to the cost of inventory at the beginning of the period together with the cost of inventory produced in a period.  
 
 
Gold, copper and silver ore contained in stockpiles is measured by estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the s tockpile, and 
the associated estimate of gold contained therein (based on assay data) and applying estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected 
processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to ore stockpiles based on quantities of material 
stockpiled using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore and include: direct labour costs; materia ls and contractor 
expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction of ore, including an alloca tion of stripping costs attributable to current period production; 
an allocation of capitalised stripping costs; an allocation of mine site overhead costs; and depreciation of mining properties and property, plant and 
equipment used in the extraction of ore. As ore is processed, costs are removed based on recoverable quantities of gold and the stockpile’s average 
cost per unit. Ore that is not expected to be processed in the 12 months following the balance sheet date is classified as non-current.  
Costs capitalised in process and finished goods inventory include: the cost of stockpiles processed; the cost of commodities and raw materials 
consumed in the production process; direct labour; repair and maintenance costs; energy costs; depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
used in the production process; and an allocation of mine site overhead costs. Costs are removed from finished goods inventory and recorded 
in cost of sales based on the average cost per ounce of gold, copper and silver sold in the period. 
Cost of mine operating supplies is the purchase cost, including allocated freight costs where applicable. 
Provisions are recorded to reduce ore stockpiles, in process and finished goods inventory to net realisable value where the net realisable value 
of the inventory is lower than its cost at each balance sheet date. Net realisable value is determined with reference to relevant market prices less 
applicable variable selling expenses. Provisions recorded also reflect an estimate of the remaining costs of completion to bring the inventory into 
its saleable form. Provisions are recorded to reduce mine operating supplies to net realisable value, which is generally calcul ated by reference to its 
salvage or scrap value, when it is determined that the supplies are slow moving and/or obsolete. Provisions are reversed to reflect subsequent 
recoveries in net realisable value where the inventory is still on hand at the balance sheet date.  
p) Property, plant and equipment 
Mineral properties and mine development costs 
Mineral properties and mine development costs are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and applicable accumulated impairment losses. 
The acquisition cost of a mineral property is the estimated fair value of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources 
acquired as a result of a business combination or asset acquisition. Capitalised mine development costs include: pre-production stripping costs; 
production stripping costs that result in a future economic benefit (refer to Note 2j) for capitalisation criteria for stripping costs); costs incurred 
to access reserves at underground mining operations; and exploration and evaluation expenditures that result in a probable future economic 
benefit (refer to Note 2m) for capitalisation criteria for exploration and evaluation expenditures).  
Development costs incurred at underground mines to build new shafts, drifts and ramps that provide physical access to the underground ore 
are capitalised as incurred. These costs can be incurred throughout the life of the underground mine.  
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and applicable impairment losses. Cost includes all expe nditures incurred 
to prepare an asset for its intended use including: the purchase price; brokers’ commissions; and installation costs including architectural, design 
and engineering fees, legal fees, survey costs, site preparation costs, freight charges, transportation insurance costs, and du ties. 
Costs that extend the productive capacity or useful economic life of an asset are capitalised. Costs incurred that do not extend the productive 
capacity or useful economic life of an asset are considered repairs and maintenance and expensed as incurred.  
The Group enters into leasing arrangements and arrangements that are in substance leasing arrangements. The determination of whether an 
arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date, including whether the fulfilment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment 
after inception is only made in specific circumstances. Leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the asset to the Group are classified as finance leases.  
Finance leases are recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value of the leased property and 
the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. Each lease payment is allocated 
between the liability and finance costs using the effective interest method, whereby a constant rate of interest expense is recognised on the 
balance of the liability outstanding. The interest element of the lease is charged to the income statement as a finance expense. The property, 
plant and equipment assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.  
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.

p) Property, plant and equipment continued 
Assets under construction 
Assets in the course of construction at both our development projects and operating mines are capitalised in the assets under construction 
account. The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working 
condition for its intended use, at which point it is transferred to property, plant and equipment and depreciation commences. Development 
projects are recorded at cost, less applicable accumulated impairment losses. Development projects represent interests in properties that contain 
proven and probable reserves and where development activities are ongoing. The cost of development projects is composed of: the estimated 
fair value of development stage assets acquired as a result of a business combination or an asset acquisition; and costs associated with the 
construction of tangible assets, such as processing plants, permanent housing facilities and other tangible infrastructure associated with the 
project. Assets under construction also contains deposits on long lead items. Assets under construction are not depreciated.  
Depreciation  
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter on a straight line basis. For 
mineral properties and mine development costs, the economic benefits of the assets are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production 
level. Such assets are depreciated on a unit of production basis. Depreciation commences when assets are available for their intended use. In 
applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated using the quantity of gold, copper and silver extracted from the 
mine (or pit) in the period as a percentage of the total quantity of material expected to be extracted in current and future periods based on 
estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves and, for some mines, mineral resources. Such non-reserve material may be included in 
the depreciation calculations where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction and the production of the non-reserve 
material is reflected in the life of mine plan.  
Development costs that relate to a discrete section of an ore body and which only provide benefit over the life of those reserves are depreciated 
over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of that discrete section. Discrete sections include capitalised underground development costs 
or production stripping costs incurred for the purposes of providing access to specific ore blocks or areas of the mine and which only provide 
an economic benefit over the period of mining that ore block or area. Development costs incurred which benefit the entire ore body are 
depreciated over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body.  
The expected depreciation rates of the major categories of assets are as follows: 
Mineral properties and development costs   UOP* 
Plant and equipment  4% – 25%
Underground mobile equipment   14.3% – 20%
Light vehicles and other mobile equipment  33.3% – 50%
Furniture, computer and office equipment   33.3% – 50%
* UOP indicates assets which are depreciated on the basis of units of production (“UOP”), in this case ounces of gold, copper and silver produced in a period divided by the total 
recoverable reserves and resources of gold, copper and silver expected to be mined based on the current life of mine plans. 
Each asset’s estimated residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis. The estimate of residual value 
and useful life is based on the physical condition and life limitations of buildings, plant and equipment and the present asses sment of economically 
recoverable reserves of the mine for the mining property and development cost asset. Changes to the estimated residual values or useful lives are 
accounted for prospectively. 
q) Goodwill  
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired 
at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially determined based on provisional fair values. Fair values are finalised within 12 months of the 
acquisition date. For non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially recorded based on the minorities’ proportion of the 
fair values for the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.  
Goodwill that is acquired through business combinations is allocated to cash generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each of the Group’s CGUs that has an allocation of goodwill is also an operating 
segment as defined by IFRS 8. Consequently, goodwill is tested for impairment at the individual CGU level. 
Goodwill is not amortised; rather it is tested annually for impairment in accordance with accounting policy Note 2s). Goodwill impairments 
are not reversible.

Assets under construction 
Assets in the course of construction at both our development projects and operating mines are capitalised in the assets under construction 
account. The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working 
condition for its intended use, at which point it is transferred to property, plant and equipment and depreciation commences. Development 
projects are recorded at cost, less applicable accumulated impairment losses. Development projects represent interests in properties that contain 
proven and probable reserves and where development activities are ongoing. The cost of development projects is composed of: the estimated 
fair value of development stage assets acquired as a result of a business combination or an asset acquisition; and costs associated with the 
construction of tangible assets, such as processing plants, permanent housing facilities and other tangible infrastructure associated with the 
project. Assets under construction also contains deposits on long lead items. Assets under construction are not depreciated.  
Depreciation  
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter on a straight line basis. For 
mineral properties and mine development costs, the economic benefits of the assets are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production 
level. Such assets are depreciated on a unit of production basis. Depreciation commences when assets are available for their intended use. In 
applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated using the quantity of gold, copper and silver extracted from the 
mine (or pit) in the period as a percentage of the total quantity of material expected to be extracted in current and future periods based on 
estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves and, for some mines, mineral resources. Such non-reserve material may be included in 
the depreciation calculations where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction and the production of the non-reserve 
material is reflected in the life of mine plan.  
Development costs that relate to a discrete section of an ore body and which only provide benefit over the life of those reserves are depreciated 
over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of that discrete section. Discrete sections include capitalised underground development costs 
or production stripping costs incurred for the purposes of providing access to specific ore blocks or areas of the mine and which only provide 
an economic benefit over the period of mining that ore block or area. Development costs incurred which benefit the entire ore body are 
depreciated over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body.  
The expected depreciation rates of the major categories of assets are as follows: 
Mineral properties and development costs   UOP* 
Plant and equipment  4% – 25%
Underground mobile equipment   14.3% – 20%
Light vehicles and other mobile equipment  33.3% – 50%
Furniture, computer and office equipment   33.3% – 50%
* UOP indicates assets which are depreciated on the basis of units of production (“UOP”), in this case ounces of gold, copper and silver produced in a period divided by the total 
recoverable reserves and resources of gold, copper and silver expected to be mined based on the current life of mine plans. 
Each asset’s estimated residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis. The estimate of residual value 
and useful life is based on the physical condition and life limitations of buildings, plant and equipment and the present asses sment of economically 
recoverable reserves of the mine for the mining property and development cost asset. Changes to the estimated residual values or useful lives are 
accounted for prospectively. 
q) Goodwill  
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired 
at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially determined based on provisional fair values. Fair values are finalised within 12 months of the 
acquisition date. For non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially recorded based on the minorities’ proportion of the 
fair values for the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.  
Goodwill that is acquired through business combinations is allocated to cash generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each of the Group’s CGUs that has an allocation of goodwill is also an operating 
segment as defined by IFRS 8. Consequently, goodwill is tested for impairment at the individual CGU level. 
Goodwill is not amortised; rather it is tested annually for impairment in accordance with accounting policy Note 2s). Goodwill impairments 
are not reversible.  
 
 
r) Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired by way of an asset acquisition or busi ness combination are recognised if the asset is separable or arises from contractual 
or legal rights and the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition. On acquisition of a mineral property in the exploration stage, we 
prepare an estimate of the fair value attributable to the explor ation potential, including mineral resources, if any, of that p roperty. The fair value of 
the exploration potential is recorded as an intangible asset (acquired exploration potential) as at the date of acquisition. When an exploration stage 
property moves into development, any acquired exploration intangible asset balance attributable to that property is transferred to non-depreciable 
mining interests within property, plant and equipment. 
Impairment testing and the reversal of impairments are conducted in accordance with accounting policy Note 2s). 
s) Impairment of non-current assets  
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or at any time during the year if an indicator of impairment is considered to exist.  
We review and test the carrying amounts of intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. 
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
An impairment loss recognised in prior years for non-financial assets other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. This reversal is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of income and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of any 
depreciation, had no impairment been recognised in prior years. After such a reversal, any depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use (“VIU”) being the net present value (“NPV”) of future 
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, and fair value less costs to sell (“FVLCS”). Impairment assessments are conducted at the level 
of CGUs, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. Each operating 
mine and development project represents a CGU for impairment testing purposes. An impairment loss is recognised for any excess of carrying 
amount of a CGU over its recoverable amount.  
The FVLCS of a CGU is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis. There is 
no active market for the Group’s CGUs. Consequently, FVLCS is derived using discounted cash flow techniques (NPV of expected future cash 
flows of a CGU), which incorporate market participant assumptions. Cost to sell is based on management’s best estimates of future selling costs 
at the time of calculating FVLCS. Costs attributable to the sale of a CGU are not considered significant. 
The expected future cash flows utilised in the NPV model are derived from estimates of projected future revenues, future cash costs of 
production and capital expenditures contained in the life of mine (“LOM”) plan for each CGU, which are updated in the fourth quarter of each 
fiscal year. The Group’s LOM plans reflect proven and probable reserves and convertible resources and are based on detailed research, analysis 
and modelling to optimise the internal rate of return for each CGU. As such, these plans consider the optimal level of investment, overall 
production levels and sequence of extraction taking into account all relevant characteristics of the ore body, including waste-to-ore tonnes, ore 
grades, haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties impacting process recoveries and capacities of available extraction, haulage and 
processing equipment.  
Projected future revenues reflect the forecasted future production levels at each CGU as detailed in the LOM plans. Included in these forecasts 
is the production of mineral resources that do not currently qualify for inclusion in proven and probable ore reserves where there is a high 
degree of confidence in their economic extraction. This is consistent with the approach that a market participant would utilise in preparing a 
forecast of expected production levels. Projected future revenues also reflect the Group’s estimate of long-term gold prices, which is determined 
based on current prices, an analysis of the expected total production costs of producers and forward pricing curves and forecasts of expected 
long-term prices prepared by research analysts. These estimates often differ from current price levels, but this methodology is consistent with 
how a market participant would assess long-term gold prices.  
The estimates of future cash costs of production and capital expenditures are derived from the LOM plans for each CGU. Costs incurred in 
currencies other than the US dollar are translated to US dollars using expected long-term exchange rates based on the relevant forward pricing 
curve for that currency. Oil prices are a significant component, both directly and indirectly, of the expected cash costs of production. Estimates 
for long-term oil prices used in the LOM plans are based on the current spot price, the forward pricing curve and long-term oil price forecasts 
prepared by analysts. 
The discount rate applied to present value is based upon the real weighted average cost of capital applicable to the CGU. The discount rate 
reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact of the remaining economic life of the CGU and the risks associated with the 
relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGU is located. These risk adjustments are based on observed equity risk premiums, 
historical country risk premiums and average credit default swap spreads for the period.

s) Impairment of non-current assets continued 
In determining FVLCS, a market multiple is applied to the NPV of each CGU. Gold companies typically trade at a market capitalisation that is 
based on a multiple of their underlying NPV. Consequently, a market participant would generally apply an NPV multiple when estimating the 
fair value of a gold property. The NPV multiples utilised in the determination of the FVLCS of a CGU consider the NPV multiples observed on 
comparable companies. These observed multiples are primarily derived from research analyst reports and take into consideration the following: 
i) estimate of underlying NPV prepared by the analyst; ii) estimate of target market capitalisation prepared by the analyst; ii i) market capitalisation 
on the date of the analyst report; and iv) market capitalisation on the date of the impairment test. The NPV multiple applied also takes into 
consideration the remaining economic life of the CGU. For CGUs with a remaining economic life of five years or less, an NPV multiple on the 
lower end of the observed multiple range is utilised. For other CGUs, the median observed NPV multiple is utilised. 
The VIU of a CGU is generally lower than its FVLCS, due primaril y to the application of a market multiple to the underlying NPV of a CGU when 
determining its FVLCS. Consequently, the recoverable amount of a CGU for impairment testing purposes is determined based on its FVLCS.  
t) Contributed surplus 
The Company did not exist until 12 January 2010, and did not become the parent company for the Group until 22 February 2010 when the 
transfer of the members of the Group pursuant to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation was completed. Contributed surplus represents the difference 
between the cumulative investment in the entities and businesses which form part of the consolidated African Barrick Gold plc Group and  
non-controlling interests. 
u) Share capital 
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as 
a deduction from the proceeds. 
v) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect 
of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
Rehabilitation costs 
The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Group normally give rise to obligations for environmental rehabilitation. Rehabilitation 
works can include facility decommissioning and dismantling; removal or treatment of waste materials; and site and land rehabilitation. The extent 
of work required and the associated costs are dependent on the requirements of relevant authorities and the Group’s environmental policies. 
Provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation programme are recognised at the time that environmental disturbance occurs. When the extent of 
disturbance increases over the life of an operation, the provision is increased accordingly. The major parts of the carrying amount of provisions 
relate to tailings pond closure/rehabilitation; demolition of buildings/mine facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care and maintenance 
of closed mines. Costs included in the provision encompass all closure and rehabilitation activity expected to occur progressively over the life of 
the operation and at the time of closure in connection with disturbances at the reporting date. Estimated costs included in the determination of 
the provision reflect the risks and probabilities of alternative estimates of cash flow s required to settle the obligation at each particular operation. 
Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and rehabilitation activities, such as waste material handling conducted as an 
integral part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. Costs arising from unforeseen circumstances, such as the 
contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are recognised as an expense and liability when the event occurs that gives rise to an obligation 
and reliable estimates of the required rehabilitation costs can be made. 
The timing of the actual rehabilitation expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating 
licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Expenditure may occur before and after closure and can continue for an 
extended period of time depending on rehabilitation requirements. The majority of the expenditure is expected to be paid over periods of up to 
30 years with some payments into perpetuity. Rehabilitation provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to 
their present value using a current, market-based estimate of the real risk-free pre-tax discount rates. The unwinding of the discount is included 
in finance expense and results in an increase in the amount of the provision. Provisions are updated each reporting period for the effect of a 
change in the discount rate and the change in estimate is added or deducted from the related asset and depreciated prospectively over the asset’s 
useful life.

change in the discount rate and the change in estimate is added or deducted from the related asset and depreciated prospectively over the asset’s 
useful life. 
 
 
Significant judgements and estimates are involved in forming expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash 
flows. Those expectations are formed based on existing environmental and regulatory requirements or, if more stringent, Group environmental 
policies which give rise to a constructive obligation. 
When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the 
cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation activities is recognised in 
property, plant and equipment and depreciated accordingly.  
It is possible that management’s estimates of provisions could change as a result of changes in regulations, the extent of rehabilitation required, 
and the means of reclamation or cost estimates. Rehabilitation provisions are adjusted as a result of changes in estimates. Those adjustments are 
accounted for as a change in the corresponding value of the related asset, except where a reduction in the provision is greater than the remaining net 
book value of the related assets, in which case the value is redu ced to nil and the remaining adjustment is recognised in the i ncome statement. In the 
case of closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Changes to the capitalised cost result in an 
adjustment to future depreciation and finance expense. On an annual basis, the Group reviews for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or 
life of operations.  
w) Employee benefits 
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan (the “Stock Option Plan”), a long-term incentive plan (the “LTIP”) and 
a legacy restricted share unit plan (the “Legacy RSU Plan”).  
Share-based payments 
Issue of Stock Options 
Stock options can be granted under either the Company LTIP or the Stock Option Plan. The Company receives services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted: 
• including any market performance conditions;  
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and 
remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and  
• excluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save). 
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about th e number of options that are expected to vest. The total expe nse is recognised 
over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, 
the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the 
impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
When the options are exercised, the Company may issue new shares or procure the transfer of existing shares to satisfy the exercise. Where 
shares are issued, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised. The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant 
date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit 
to equity.  
LTIP 
The Company has a cash-settled, Restricted Share Unit (RSU) plan for select employees. Under the terms of the RSU plan, selected employees are 
granted RSUs where each RSU has a value equal to one Ordinary Share of the Company. RSUs vest over a two-and-a-half or three-ye ar period and 
are settled in cash. Additional RSUs are credited to reflect dividends paid on Ordinary Shares of the Company during the vesting period with a 
corresponding charge to the compensation expense. A liability for RSUs is measured at fair value on the grant date and is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding charge to the compensation expense. At the grant date the fair value o f the awards is 
determined from the market value of the shares at the date of aw ard and adjusted for any market based vesting conditions attach ed to the award 
e.g. relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance. Changes in the fair value of the RSU liability, due to changes in the price of Ordinary 
Shares of the Company, are recorded each period, with a corresp onding charge to the compensation expense. Compensation expenses recognised 
for RSUs incorporate an estimate for expected forfeiture rates. The expected forfeiture is estimated based on historical forfei ture rates of the Group 
pre-IPO and expectations of future forfeiture rates. Adjustments to compensation expense are recognised in periods where the actual forfeiture rate 
differs from the expected rate.

w) Employee benefits continued 
Legacy RSU Plan 
Historically, the Barrick Group has maintained a Restricted Share Unit (“RSU”) plan for select employees who now work for the Group. This 
plan operates in an incidental manner to the Company RSU plan. These existing legacy restricted share units will continue to be administered 
and accounted for based on the movement of the fair value of the Barrick Ordinary Share for recording of liabilities and compensation expense.  
Defined contribution plan 
The Group’s Tanzanian employees are members of either the National Social Security Fund (“NSSF”) or of the Parastatal Pension Fund (PPF), 
which are defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate 
entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contribution if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all 
employees the benefits relating to the employee service in the current and prior periods. The Group and employees both contribute 10% of 
the employees’ gross salaries to the schemes. The contributions are charged to the income statement when they are due. 
Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to 
either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing 
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance 
sheet date are discounted to their present value. 
Bonus plans 
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where it is contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created 
a constructive obligation. 
Other entitlements 
The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the balance sheet date is recognised as an expense accrual. 
x) Financial instruments 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents include 
cash, and money market funds. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale. These are initially recognised 
at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, except for 
maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets, where the receivables are discounted 
and held at their net present value. 
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, other assets and cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date.  
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the 
expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. 
Derivatives 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, 
the nature of the item being hedged.

expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, 
the nature of the item being hedged. 
 
 
Embedded derivatives 
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract , with reassessment 
only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related 
to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.  
Financial liabilities 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of 
the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the 
loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 
occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-
payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities 
unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
y) Finance income and finance expense 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces 
the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the 
instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. 
Interest is recognised as a borrowing cost on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that relate directly to 
the construction of property, plant and equipment during the time that it is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use are 
capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.  
z) Taxes 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, respectively. 
Current income tax 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred income tax 
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred 
income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: 
• Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit/loss; and 
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: 
• Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neit her the accounting profit nor t axable profit or loss; and  
• In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries deferred income tax assets are recognised only to 
the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.

z) Taxes continued 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.  
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued, have been measured using 
the single best estimate of likely outcome approach. 
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Indirect tax 
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions or receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to 
or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date. If the receivable is expected to be received in more than 12 months from year end, the receivable is discounted and 
held at its present value. Amounts expected to be payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities 
in the balance sheet, as appropriate. 
aa) Royalties 
Royalty arrangements based on mineral production are in place at each operating mine. The primary type of royalty is a net smelter return 
(“NSR”) royalty. Under this type of royalty the Group pays the holder an amount calculated as the royalty percentage multiplied by the value 
of gold production at market gold prices less third-party smelting, refining and transportation costs.  
The Buzwagi mine is also subject to a net profits interest (“NPI”) arrangement and a production sharing arrangement held by separate third 
parties. The NPI is calculated as a percentage of profits realised from the Buzwagi mine after all capital, exploration and development costs and 
interest incurred in relation to the Buzwagi mine have been recouped and all operating costs relating to the Buzwagi mine have been paid. The 
production sharing arrangement commences after 2 million ounces of gold have been produced, as at 31 December 2010 375,050 ounces have 
been produced. After this level of production, US$1 per ounce produced is payable based on a gold price of US$300 per ounce and the amount 
must be increased pro rata to reflect current gold prices.  
The North Mara mine is also subject to a land royalty (land tenements (“LT”)) based on the net revenue derived from the open pit mines. 
Royalty expense is recorded when revenue from the sale of gold, copper and silver production is recognised. 
The following percentages apply: 
Bulyanhulu  3% NSR
Tulawaka  3% NSR
North Mara – Nyabirama and Nyabigena pits  3% NSR, 1% LT
North Mara – Gokona pit  3% NSR, 1.1% LT
Buzwagi  3% NSR, 30%NPI*
* The NPI is calculated as a percentage of profits realised from the Buzwagi mine after all capital, exploration and development costs and interest incurred in relation to the Buzwagi 
mine have been recouped and all operating costs relating to the Buzwagi mine have been paid. No amount is currently payable. 
bb) Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

Uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued, have been measured using 
the single best estimate of likely outcome approach. 
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Indirect tax 
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions or receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to 
or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date. If the receivable is expected to be received in more than 12 months from year end, the receivable is discounted and 
held at its present value. Amounts expected to be payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities 
in the balance sheet, as appropriate. 
aa) Royalties 
Royalty arrangements based on mineral production are in place at each operating mine. The primary type of royalty is a net smelter return 
(“NSR”) royalty. Under this type of royalty the Group pays the holder an amount calculated as the royalty percentage multiplied by the value 
of gold production at market gold prices less third-party smelting, refining and transportation costs.  
The Buzwagi mine is also subject to a net profits interest (“NPI”) arrangement and a production sharing arrangement held by separate third 
parties. The NPI is calculated as a percentage of profits realised from the Buzwagi mine after all capital, exploration and development costs and 
interest incurred in relation to the Buzwagi mine have been recouped and all operating costs relating to the Buzwagi mine have been paid. The 
production sharing arrangement commences after 2 million ounces of gold have been produced, as at 31 December 2010 375,050 ounces have 
been produced. After this level of production, US$1 per ounce produced is payable based on a gold price of US$300 per ounce and the amount 
must be increased pro rata to reflect current gold prices.  
The North Mara mine is also subject to a land royalty (land tenements (“LT”)) based on the net revenue derived from the open pit mines. 
Royalty expense is recorded when revenue from the sale of gold, copper and silver production is recognised. 
The following percentages apply: 
Bulyanhulu  3% NSR
Tulawaka  3% NSR
North Mara – Nyabirama and Nyabigena pits  3% NSR, 1% LT
North Mara – Gokona pit  3% NSR, 1.1% LT
Buzwagi  3% NSR, 30%NPI*
* The NPI is calculated as a percentage of profits realised from the Buzwagi mine after all capital, exploration and development costs and interest incurred in relation to the Buzwagi 
mine have been recouped and all operating costs relating to the Buzwagi mine have been paid. No amount is currently payable. 
bb) Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
 
 
 
3. SEGMENT REPORTING 
The Group has only one primary product produced in a single geographic location, being gold produced in Tanzania. In addition the Group 
produces copper and silver as a co-product. Reportable operating segments are based on the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (“CODM”) to evaluate segment performance, decide how to allocate resources and make other operating decisions. After 
applying the aggregation criteria and quantitative thresholds contained in IFRS 8, the Group’s reportable operating segments were determined 
to be: North Mara gold mine; Tulawaka gold mine; Bulyanhulu gold mine; Buzwagi gold mine; and a separate Corporate and Exploration 
segment, which primarily consists of costs related to corporate administration and exploration and evaluation activities (“Other”).  
Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, inventories and receivables. Capital expenditures comprise additions to 
property, plant and equipment. Segment liabilities are not reported since they are not considered by the CODM as material to segment 
performance. The Group has also included segment cash operating costs.  
Segment information for the reportable operating segments of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 is set 
out below.

as follows: US$3.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: US$1.2 million).  
2 Revenue from the sale of co-products, such as copper and silver, contained in concentrates is recognised in revenue. As detailed in Note 2a), per the Prospectus co-product revenue 
was treated as a by-product and credited to cost of sales. Management’s decision to make this change was a result of co-product revenue becoming increasingly significant to the 
Group, increasing 202% year-on-year primarily as a result of Buzwagi commencing its production of copper, but also due to an increases in copper prices, copper sales have been 
reclassified to revenue where they are disclosed as a co-product.

1 The 2009 reconciliation includes an amount of US$36.9 million relating to an increase in the amount of unrecognised tax benefits carried forward. The adjustment reflects 
uncertainty regarding recoverability of certain tax losses, and gives rise to an increased deferred tax charge. The Group anticipates that the amount of unrecognised tax benefits 
may change within 12 months of the reporting date through a potential settlement with tax authorities, which may result in an adjustment to available tax losses. 
The tax rate in Tanzania is 30% and in South Africa 28% for both years presented.  
Tax periods remain open to review by the Tanzanian Revenue Authority (“TRA”) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date 
of the filing of the corporate tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties 
and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. Because a number of tax periods remain open to review by tax 
authorities, there is a risk that transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities may be challenged by them in the future, 
and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. The 2009 reconciliation includes an amount of 
US$36.9 million relating to an increase in the amount of unrecognised tax benefits carried forward. The adjustment reflects uncertainty 
regarding recoverability of certain tax losses, and gives rise to an increased deferred tax charge. The Group anticipates that the amount of 
unrecognised tax benefits may change within 12 months of the reporting date through a potential settlement with tax authorities, which may 
result in an adjustment to available tax losses. With the exception of the adjustment made in 2009 in respect of unrecognised tax benefits, the 
Group has made no further provision in respect of such tax assessments (refer to Note 31).

12. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing profit for the period attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period. 
For the purpose of calculating EPS, the share capital for the Company in the period prior to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation on 22 February 2010 is 
calculated as if this reorganisation was completed as at 1 January 2009. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. The Company has dilutive potential Ordinary Shares in the form of stock options. The weighted average 
number of shares is adjusted for the number of shares granted assuming the exercise of stock options. 
At 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009, earnings per share have been calculated as follows:

1 Assets under construction represents (a) sustaining capital expenditures incurred constructing tangible fixed assets related to operating mines and advance deposits made towards the 
purchase of tangible fixed assets; and (b) expansionary expenditure allocated to a project on a business combination or asset acquisition, and the subsequent costs incurred to develop 
the mine. Once these assets are ready for their intended use, the balance is transferred to plant and equipment, and/or mineral properties and mine development costs. 
Property, plant and equipment includes assets relating to the design and construction costs of power transmission lines and related 
infrastructure. At completion ownership was transferred to TANESCO in exchange for amortised repayment in the form of reduced e lectricity 
supply charges. No future lease payment obligations are payable under these finance leases. The following amounts were included in property, 
plant and equipment where the Group is a lessee under a finance lease:

2009 
Tax losses  195,693 179,968 
Total  195,693 179,968 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items due to uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, or there being 
uncertainty regarding future taxable income against which these assets can be utilised. 
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:

Uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued by the TRA, have been 
measured using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach resulting in the recognition of substantially all the related deferred tax assets 
and liabilities. Alternative acceptable measurement policies (e.g. on a weighted average expected outcome basis) could result in a change to 
deferred tax assets and liabilities being recognised, and the deferred tax charge in the income statement.

US$15.3 million (2009: US$16.4 million). 
2 Prepayment made to the villagers in respect of acquisition of the rights over the use of leasehold land. 
3 The non-current portion of the indirect tax receivables has been discounted to its current value using an effective interest rate of 5.7% (2009: 7.19%). This resulted in a discounting 
charge of US$6.8 million (2009: US$6.9 million) to the income statement, refer Note 8. 
4 Assets relating to restrictive share unit liabilities of US$7.5 million have been reclassified and offset against the liability. This is different to the Prospectus where the asset was shown 
separately as part of non-current assets. As this amount has an immaterial impact on the opening position, no opening balance sheet is presented. 
22. BUSINESS COMBINATION 
On 27 April 2010, the Company, through BUK Holdco Ltd, one of its immediate subsidiaries, purchased 100% of the issued share capital of 
Tusker Gold Ltd (“Tusker”) by way of a takeover offer for an aggregate net consideration of approximately US$74 million. Tusker is an 
Australian based exploration company with a focus on gold. Tusker was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange but was delisted from the 
Exchange as part of the acquisition. All of Tusker’s assets are located in Tanzania and consist of a significant gold resource base and additional 
exploration ground. 
Details of the purchase consideration, the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows: 
(in thousands of United States dollars)  2010 
– Purchase consideration  74,232 
– Foreign gain on cash settlement recognised in other charges  (3,109)

Net cash outflow on acquisition   63,109 
The goodwill arose after the application of IAS 12 “Income taxes” and is attributable principally to expanding growth opportunities in 
Tanzania. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets, 
goodwill and deferred tax liability is provisional pending receipt of the final valuations for those assets.

The goodwill arose after the application of IAS 12 “Income taxes” and is attributable principally to expanding growth opportunities in 
Tanzania. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets, 
goodwill and deferred tax liability is provisional pending receipt of the final valuations for those assets. 
 
 
Included in payables is the fair value of a contingent liability of US$3.5 million. This relates to a US$4.6 million payment required to be made 
to the vendor on commencement of commercial production at Nyanzaga. The assessed possibility that Nyanzaga has the potential to reach 
commercial production within four years is 75%. 
Acquisition costs incurred relating to the Tusker acquisition amounted to US$0.4 million and were all expensed as incurred. 
Cancellation of options  
A total of 12,450,000 stock options were held by Tusker directors and employees at the time of the acquisition. The holders of all options 
irrevocably agreed to cancel their options in exchange for a consideration of US$8.1 million, which formed part of the consideration.  
On 31 December 2009, Tusker announced that it had appointed Argonaut Securities Ltd to provide assistance with any future capital raisings. 
Based on the terms of the arrangement, Argonaut will be remunerated for its services by Tusker agreeing to issue Argonaut with two million 
options with an exercise price of US30 cents, two million options with an exercise price of US50 cents and a further four million options with 
an exercise price of US80 cents. The Argonaut agreement was cancelled in exchange for payment of an amount of US$1.6 million.  
Expenses  
The acquired business contributed expenses of US$765,822 to the Group for the period from 30 April 2010 to 31 December 2010. If the acquisition 
had occurred on 1 January 2010, consolidated loss for the year ended 31 December 2010 would have been US$2.7 million. These amounts have 
been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies.

Incorporation of Company and Pre-IPO Reorganisation  
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 12 January 2010 as a private limited company with a share capital of 
one Ordinary Share of £1.  
On 19 February 2010 the Company entered into a share exchange agreement pursuant to which it acquired the entire issued share capital of 
BUK Holdco Ltd, an intermediate holding company of members of the Group, from members of Barrick Gold Corporation’s group in return 
for issuing 943,464 Ordinary Shares of £1 each at a premium of £999 per share.  
On 22 February 2010 the Company entered into a share exchange agreement pursuant to which it acquired the entire issued share capital of 
1816962 Ontario Inc from BGC, an intermediate holding company of members of the Group, in return for issuing 375,000 Ordinary Shares of 
£1 each at a premium of £999 per share.  
The Company subsequently entered into a reduction of capital, eliminating share premium of US$1,989,138 to create distributable reserves, 
and restructured its share capital so as to reduce the nominal value of each of its Ordinary Shares to 10 pence. Following the share capital 
restructuring the Company made a bonus issue of shares to its then existing shareholders in preparation for the IPO, resulting in a total of 
303,246,950 Ordinary Shares being in issue prior to the IPO.  
Re-registration of the Company as a public company  
On 12 March 2010, the Company re-registered as a public limited company.  
Issuance of shares on IPO  
On 24 March 2010, the Company successfully completed its IPO. A total number of 101,082,317 shares with a par value of 10 pence each were 
issued at a price of 575 pence per share for a total of £581,223,322 (US$886,365,567) net of underwriter fees. On 15 April 2010 the Company 
issued a further 5,756,232 Ordinary Shares at a price of 575 pence per share for a total of £33,098,334 (US$52,275,508) pursuant to the exercise 
of the over-allotment option granted in connection with the IPO. Total costs related to the issuance of new shares taken against share premium 
amounted to US$53.9 million.

24. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
Stock options 
Stock options are granted to Executive Directors and to selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is determined by the 
Compensation committee before the grant of an option provided that this price cannot be less than the average of the middle-market quotation 
of such shares (as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List) for the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of 
grant. All options outstanding at the end of the year expire in 2017. None of the options granted were exercisable at 31 December 2010. The 
vesting period of the options is four years, with an exercise period of three years. 
Movements in the number of options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are reflected in pence as follows:

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade 
payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade 
payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Terms and conditions of the above payables liabilities: 
• Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on 30-day of statement terms. 
• Accruals and other payables are non-interest bearing and have an average term of 30–60 days.

24. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
Stock options 
Stock options are granted to Executive Directors and to selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is determined by the 
Compensation committee before the grant of an option provided that this price cannot be less than the average of the middle-market quotation 
of such shares (as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List) for the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of 
grant. All options outstanding at the end of the year expire in 2017. None of the options granted were exercisable at 31 December 2010. The 
vesting period of the options is four years, with an exercise period of three years. 
Movements in the number of options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are reflected in pence as follows:

Revolving credit facility 
On 24 November 2010, the Group concluded negotiations with a syndicate of commercial banks, led by Citibank, for the provision of a revolving 
credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million. The facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the 
Group and to fund potential acquisitions. All provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial 
and customary terms for such finance arrangements. The term of the facility is 24 months and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis 
points. At 31 December 2010, none of the funds were drawn under the facility while a commitment fee of 1.4% was payable. The shares of all 
significant subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the loan. 
28. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
During 2010 the Group entered into zero cost collars to manage copper price fluctuations in the price of copper. The Group does not use such 
derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
These transactions are economic hedges, and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment for the positions. Changes in the fair value of these 
copper options are recorded as a component of other income/expense in the income statement. At 31 December 2010, the Group had 21,826 
thousand pounds of collar contracts outstanding containing purchased put and call options with an average strike price of US$3.25 per pound 
and US$4.77 per pound respectively. The Group did not have any derivative financial instruments in 2009.

procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit committee. 
 
 
a) Market risk, including commodity price, foreign currency and interest rate risks 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its financial instruments. 
Gold price  
The market price of gold is one of the most significant factors in determining the profitability of the Group’s operations. The price of gold is 
subject to volatile price movements over short periods of time, especially in the current market environment, and is affected by numerous 
industry and macro-economic factors that are beyond the Group’s control. In 2010 the price ranged from US$1,058 to US$1,431 per ounce, 
with an average market price of US$1,225 per ounce (2009: US$972 per ounce). The Group’s policy is to sell gold at prevailing market prices. 
Copper price  
During 2010 the Group entered into zero cost collars to manage copper price fluctuations (see Note 28 for additional details). In 2010 the price 
ranged from US$2.76 to US$4.44 per pound, with an average market price of US$3.42 per pound (2009: US$3.22 per pound). 
Oil price 
Diesel fuel is refined from crude oil and is therefore subject to the same price volatility affecting crude oil prices. During 2010, oil prices traded 
between US$63 and US$92 per barrel with an average market price of US$80 per barrel. The Group currently has no oil price hedging in place 
but may consider opportunities to hedge against oil price exposure in the future. 
The table below summarises the impact of changes in the market price on gold. The impact is expressed in terms of the resulting change in the 
Group’s profit after tax for the year or, where applicable, the change in equity. The sensitivities are based on the assumption that the market 
price changes by 10% with all other variables held constant. The impact of a similar change in copper, silver and diesel prices is not material to 
the Group’s profit after tax.

Foreign currency risk 
The Group’s transactions are denominated in a number of different currencies (primarily US dollars, Shillings, and Rands). The Group has 
liabilities that are primarily denominated in US dollars. The US dollar is the Company’s (and its subsidiaries’) functional currency, as well as the 
Group’s presentation currency. Therefore, transactions in currencies other than the US dollar give rise to foreign currency translation risk. The 
Group’s primary exposure to this risk arises from direct mine operating costs and corporate administration costs that are transacted in Shillings 
and Rands, respectively. Consequently, fluctuations in the US dollar: Shilling/Rand exchange rates increase the volatility of cost of sales, 
corporate administration costs and overall net earnings, which are reported in US dollars. The vast majority of all direct mining costs and 
corporate administration costs are denominated and settled in US dollars. Consequently, the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on the 
Group’s reported direct mining and corporate administration costs is not significant.  
The exchange rates at the end of each financial year are detailed in Note 2 h). 
Under normal market conditions, the Group does not generally believe that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long-term 
benefits to shareholders. Historically, the relationship between the gold price and the value of the Shilling and Rand provide a natural hedge 
against fluctuations in the exchange rate of these currencies against the US dollar. Generally, a strengthening of the Shilling/Rand, which would 
cause an increase in reported US dollar operating costs, corresponds with an increase in the US dollar gold price, which results in an increase in 
reported US dollar revenues. This natural protection significantly reduces the need for using derivatives or other forms of synthetic hedging. 
However, the Group reviews its exposure on a regular basis and reserves the right to enter into foreign currency hedges should the 
circumstances warrant. Any such currency protection measures deemed appropriate by management are subject to approval by the Board. 
The Group does have significant financial assets denominated in a currency other than US dollar. These financial assets are as follow:

Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instruments will fluctuate due to 
changes in market interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed 
rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents. 
At present, available funds are held with financial institutions at variable rates and primarily denominated in US dollars, interest income is not 
materially affected by changes in short-term interest rates. The amount of interest expense recorded in the Group’s consolidated income 
statement is not materially impacted by changes in short-term interest rates, due to the Group’s low levels of interest-bearing debt at present. 
The revolving credit facility’s spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. Group debt levels are impacted by the amount of operating cash flow 
generated by its operating mines, as well as capital expenditure requirements related to existing operations and development projects.  
b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. For cash and 
cash equivalents and trade and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet, net of any overdraft positions. 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks, as well as trade and other receivables. The Group’s financial assets 
are with counterparties whom the Group considers have an appropriate credit rating. Location of credit risk is determined by physical location 
of the bank branch, customer or counterparty. The maximum allowable term of maturity for any individual security is 12 months. Investment 
counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa2 or better by Moody’s Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poor’s. No more than 
25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of 
America, United Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group. Investments are held mainly in United States dollars and cash and cash 
equivalents in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements. 
With respect to other receivables, the most significant debtor is the Tanzanian Revenue Authority. Throughout 2010, ABG has been actively 
involved in discussions with the Tanzanian government and the Tanzanian Revenue Authority to resolve the status of fuel excise levies and 
VAT refunds for its operations. These issues have been outstanding for some time and were further complicated by amendments made to 
certain tax laws which were passed in 2009. The amendments conflicted with certain provisions contained in the Group’s existing Mineral 
Development Agreements (“MDAs”) which guarantee the fiscal stability of its operations. The government has adopted legislation to reverse 
the amendments, which should allow for the fiscal and tax terms of our MDAs to be honoured. As at 31 December 2010, the discounted 
outstanding amounts due to the Group were approximately US$121 million. The Group is in discussions with the authorities to agree terms 
for the repayment of these amounts, which is likely to be by way of tax offsets. Further detail is included in Notes 16, 21 and 31 b). 
Group policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. Individual exposures are 
monitored with trade customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Group’s financial assets are with 
counterparties whom the Group considers have an appropriate credit rating.  
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets in Note 27. The Group does not 
hold collateral as security for any trade receivables. The Group does not grade the credit quality of receivables.

counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa2 or better by Moody’s Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poor’s. No more than 
25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of 
America, United Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group. Investments are held mainly in United States dollars and cash and cash 
equivalents in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements. 
With respect to other receivables, the most significant debtor is the Tanzanian Revenue Authority. Throughout 2010, ABG has been actively 
involved in discussions with the Tanzanian government and the Tanzanian Revenue Authority to resolve the status of fuel excise levies and 
VAT refunds for its operations. These issues have been outstanding for some time and were further complicated by amendments made to 
certain tax laws which were passed in 2009. The amendments conflicted with certain provisions contained in the Group’s existing Mineral 
Development Agreements (“MDAs”) which guarantee the fiscal stability of its operations. The government has adopted legislation to reverse 
the amendments, which should allow for the fiscal and tax terms of our MDAs to be honoured. As at 31 December 2010, the discounted 
outstanding amounts due to the Group were approximately US$121 million. The Group is in discussions with the authorities to agree terms 
for the repayment of these amounts, which is likely to be by way of tax offsets. Further detail is included in Notes 16, 21 and 31 b). 
Group policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. Individual exposures are 
monitored with trade customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Group’s financial assets are with 
counterparties whom the Group considers have an appropriate credit rating.  
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets in Note 27. The Group does not 
hold collateral as security for any trade receivables. The Group does not grade the credit quality of receivables.  
 
 
c) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss from not having access to sufficient funds to meet both expected and unexpected cash demands. The Group 
manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels are well above minimum int ernal requirements. 
Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash balances, and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of 
committed credit facilities. At the end of both 2010 and 2009 the Group was in a positive net cash position, as disclosed in Note 17. Details of 
the undrawn revolving credit facility are given in Note 27. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group receives cash proceeds from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements. The cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that capital is 
safeguarded to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating. Insignificant uncommitted 
overdraft facilities are maintained with several banking counterparties to meet the Group’s normal funding requirements. The Group’s primary 
source of liquidity is operating cash flow, and over the past two years the Group has generated an average of about US$269.6 million per year. 
The principal risk factor affecting operating cash flow is market gold prices.  
The principal uses of liquidity are sustaining capital expenditures at existing operating mines, construction activities at development projects, 
and interest payments. Sustaining capital expenditures have averaged about US$114.5 million per year over the past two years.  
The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Group’s significant financial assets into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. As the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.

Capital risk management 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio to support 
its business and provides financial flexibility in order to maximise shareholder value. In order to ensure a strong balance sheet and low gearing 
ratio, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and is approved by the Senior leadership team before 
submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.

the following commitments and/or contingencies: 
a) Legal contingencies 
As at 31 December 2010, the Group was a defendant in approximately 240 lawsuits. The plaintiffs are claiming damages and interest thereon for

of service, non-payment for services, defamation, negligence by act or omission in failing to provide a safe working environment, unpaid 
overtime and public holidays compensation.  
The total amounts claimed from lawsuits in which specific monetary damages are sought amounted to US$44 million. The Group’s Legal 
Counsel is defending the Group’s current position, and the outcome of the lawsuits cannot presently be determined. However, in the opinion of 
the Directors and Group’s Legal Counsel, no material liabilities are expected to materialise from these lawsuits. Consequently no provision has

31. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. As at 31 December 2010, the Group has 
the following commitments and/or contingencies: 
a) Legal contingencies 
As at 31 December 2010, the Group was a defendant in approximately 240 lawsuits. The plaintiffs are claiming damages and interest thereon for 
the loss caused by the Group due to one or more of the following: unlawful eviction, termination of services, wrongful termination of contracts 
of service, non-payment for services, defamation, negligence by act or omission in failing to provide a safe working environment, unpaid 
overtime and public holidays compensation.  
The total amounts claimed from lawsuits in which specific monetary damages are sought amounted to US$44 million. The Group’s Legal 
Counsel is defending the Group’s current position, and the outcome of the lawsuits cannot presently be determined. However, in the opinion of 
the Directors and Group’s Legal Counsel, no material liabilities are expected to materialise from these lawsuits. Consequently no provision has 
been set aside against the claims in the books of account. 
 
 
Included in the total amounts claimed of US$44 million is a lawsuit instituted against North Mara Gold Mine Ltd and Genkuru Village in which 
the plaintiffs claim US$29 million. The case is based on a claim resulting from alleged illegal action by East Africa Gold Mine Ltd (North Mara’s 
predecessors) entering the area where the plaintiffs allege they had claim of right. The area in question was given by Genuru Village to the mine 
to conduct mining activities and a licence to that effect was issued. Compensation to occupiers of land was handed over to the government for 
distribution. Subsequent to year end this claim was struck out by the Court of Appeal of Tanzania. 
b) Tax-related contingencies 
i. On 26 October 2009, the TRA issued a demand notice against the Group for an amount relating to withholding tax on technical services 
provided to Bulyanhulu Gold Mine Ltd. The claim amounts to US$5.4 million. Management is of the opinion that the Group complied 
with all of the withholding tax requirements, and that there will be no amount payable. Therefore no provision has been raised. 
ii. The TRA has issued a number of tax assessments to the Group relating to past taxation years from 2002 onwards. The Group believes 
that these assessments are incorrect and has filed objections to each of them. The Group is attempting to resolve these matters by 
means of discussions with the TRA. Management is of the opinion that this will not result in any material liabilities to the Group. 
c) Exploration and development agreement 
Pursuant to an agreement with the Government of the United Repu blic of Tanzania, entered into in 1996, the Group was issued a m ining licence 
for the Nyabigena, Nyabirama and Gokona concessions in the Nyamongo region, North Mara in Tanzania. The agreement requires the Group 
to pay to the Government of Tanzania annual rents of US$1,500 per annum per square kilometer for as long as the Group holds the mining 
licence. The total commitment for 2010 based on mineral licences held as at 31 December 2009 is US$0.17 million. 
d) Purchase commitments 
At 31 December 2010, the Group had purchase obligations for supplies and consumables of approximately US$64 million (2009: US$5 6 million). 
e) Capital commitments 
In addition to entering into various operational commitments in the normal course of business, the Group entered into the following 
commitments for construction activities for capital projects.

such as property damage and business interruption. The Group records losses relating to insurable events as they occur. Proceeds receivable

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
147 Independent auditors’ report to the members of  
African Barrick Gold plc 
 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of 
African Barrick Gold plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 
which comprise the Parent Company Income Statement, 
Parent Company Statement of Comprehensive Income, Parent 
Company Balance Sheet, Parent Company Statement of Changes in 
Equity, Parent Company Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 86, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2010 and of its loss and cash flows for the year 
then ended;

African Barrick Gold plc 
 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of 
African Barrick Gold plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 
which comprise the Parent Company Income Statement, 
Parent Company Statement of Comprehensive Income, Parent 
Company Balance Sheet, Parent Company Statement of Changes in 
Equity, Parent Company Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 86, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2010 and of its loss and cash flows for the year 
then ended;  
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and  
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.  
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
• the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year 
for which the parent company financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:  
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or  
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or  
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of 
African Barrick Gold plc for the year ended 31 December 2010.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
 
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION 
African Barrick Gold plc (the “Company”) was incorporated on 12 January 2010 and re-registered as a public limited company on 12 March 
2010 under the Companies Act 2006. It is registered in England and Wales with registered number 7123187. 
On 24 March 2010 the Company’s shares were admitted to the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority (“UKLA”) and to trading 
on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, hereafter referred to as the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). The address of its registered 
office is 6 St James’s Place, London SW1A 1NP, United Kingdom. 
Barrick Gold Corporation (“BGC”) currently owns approximately 73.9% of the shares of the Company and is the ultimate controlling party 
of the Group. 
In preparation for the IPO, BGC conducted a reorganisation, which was completed on 22 February 2010, whereby the companies comprising 
the African Regional Business Unit of BGC were reorganised under the Company (the “Pre-IPO Reorganisation”). As such, prior to 
22 February 2010, the Company did not control all of the entities it acquired pursuant to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation. 
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on 
10 March 2011.  
The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for the African Barrick Gold Group of companies. 
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.  
a) Basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis. As the Company was only incorporated on 12 January 
2010, no comparative information exists.  
The Company's forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Company 
should be able to operate within the level of its current financing. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in oper ational existence 
for the foreseeable future. The Company therefore adopts the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. 
The financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except when 
otherwise indicated.  
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. 
b) New and amended standards adopted by the Company 
The following new standards and amendments to standards are applicable and were adopted by the Company for the first time for the financial 
year beginning 12 January 2010. 
• IAS 36 (amendment), “Impairment of assets”, effective 1 January 2010. The amendment clarifies that the largest cash-generating unit 
(or group of units) to which goodwill should be allocated for the purposes of impairment testing is an operating segment, as defined by 
paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, “Operating segments” (that is, before the aggregation of segments with similar economic characteristics). IAS 36 
(amendment) has had no impact on the current period as no impairment was identified when testing goodwill impairment at an operating 
segment level. 
• IFRS 2 (amendments), “Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions”, effective 1 January 2010. In addition to incorporating IFRIC 
8, “Scope of IFRS 2”, and IFRIC 11, “IFRS 2, Group and treasury share transactions”, the amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 
to address the classification of Group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation. The application of the standard did not have 
a material effect on the Group.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued  
c) New and amended standards, and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 
12 January 2010 but not currently relevant to the Company (although they may affect the accounting for future 
transactions and events)  
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Company’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 12 January 2010 or later periods, but are currently not relevant to the Company. 
• IFRIC 17, “Distribution of non-cash assets to owners” (effective on or after 1 July 2009). The interpretation was published in November 2008. 
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as 
a distribution of reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when 
they are amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present 
condition and the distribution is highly probable. 
• IFRIC 18, “Transfers of assets from customers”, effective for transfer of assets received on or after 1 July 2009. This interpretation clarifies the 
requirements of IFRSs for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity 
must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services 
(such as a supply of electricity, gas or water). In some cases, the entity receives cash from a customer that must be used only to acquire or 
construct the item of property, plant, and equipment in order to connect the customer to a network or provide the customer with ongoing 
access to a supply of goods or services (or to do both). 
• IFRIC 9, “Reassessment of embedded derivatives” and IAS 39, “Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement”, effective 1 July 2009. 
This amendment to IFRIC 9 requires an entity to assess whether an embedded derivative should be separated from a host contract when the 
entity reclassifies a hybrid financial asset out of the “fair value through profit or loss” category. This assessment is to be made based on 
circumstances that existed on the later of the date the entity first became a party to the contract and the date of any contract amendments 
that significantly change the cash flows of the contract. If the entity is unable to make this assessment, the hybrid instrument must remain 
classified as at fair value through profit or loss in its entirety. 
• IFRIC 16, “Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation”, effective 1 July 2009. This amendment states that, in a hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation, qualifying hedging instruments may be held by any entity or entities within the Group, including the 
foreign operation itself, as long as the designation, documentation and effectiveness requirements of IAS 39 that relate to a net investment 
hedge are satisfied. In particular, the Company should clearly document its hedging strategy because of the possibility of different 
designations at different levels of the Company.  
• IAS 38 (amendment), “Intangible assets”, effective 1 January 2010. The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an 
intangible asset acquired in a business combination and permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has a similar 
useful economic life. 
• IAS 1 (amendment), “Presentation of financial statements”. The amendment clarifies that the potential settlement of a liability by the issue 
of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or non-current. By amending the definition of current liability, the amendment permits 
a liability to be classified as non-current (provided that the entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement by transfer of cash or other 
assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period) notwithstanding the fact that the entity could be required by the counterparty to 
settle in shares at any time. 
• IFRS 3 (revised), “Business combinations”, and consequential amendments to IAS 27 (revised), “Consolidated and separate financial 
statements”, IAS 28 “Investments in associates”, and IAS 31 “Interest in joint ventures”, are effective prospectively to business combinations 
for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with some significant changes compared 
with IFRS 3. For example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments 
classified as debt subsequently re-measured through the income statement. There is a choice on an acquisition-by acquisition basis to 
measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value 
or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-related costs are expensed.

for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with some significant changes compared 
with IFRS 3. For example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments 
classified as debt subsequently re-measured through the income statement. There is a choice on an acquisition-by acquisition basis to 
measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value 
or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-related costs are expensed. 
 
 
 
 
IAS 27 (revised) requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interest to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control 
and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost. 
Any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.  
• IFRS 5 (amendment), “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”. The amendment clarifies that IFRS 5 specifies the 
disclosures required in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations. It also clarifies 
that the general requirements of IAS 1 still apply, in particular paragraph 15 (to achieve a fair presentation) and paragraph 125 (sources of 
estimation uncertainty) of IAS 1. 
d) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 12 January 
2010 and not early adopted 
The Company’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below. 
• IFRS 9, “Financial instruments”, issued in November 2009. This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39, “Financial 
instruments: recognition and measurement”. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets. The 
standard is not applicable until 1 January 2013 but is available for early adoption. However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the 
EU. The Company is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact, however, initial indications are that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a significant 
impact on the Company’s operating results or financial position. 
• IAS 24 (revised), “Related party disclosures”, issued in November 2009. It supersedes IAS 24, “Related party disclosures”, issued in 2003. IAS 
24 (revised) is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted. However, the 
standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party and removes the 
requirement for government-related entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government and other government-related entities. 
The Company will apply the revised standard from 1 January 2011. It is not expected to have any impact on the Company or the parent 
entity’s financial statements. 
• IAS 32 (amendment), “Classification of rights issues”, issued in October 2009. The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 February 2010. Earlier application is permitted. The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a 
currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. Provided certain conditions are met, such rights issues are now classified as equity 
regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated. Previously, these issues had to be accounted for as derivative liabilities. 
The amendment applies retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8, “Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors”. The 
Company has not issued any rights issues. 
• IFRIC 19, “Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments”, effective 1 July 2010. The interpretation clarifies the accounting by an 
entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to 
extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt for equity swap). It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss, which is 
measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued. If the fair 
value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the equity instruments should be measured to reflect the fair value of the 
financial liability extinguished. The Company will apply the interpretation from 1 January 2011. It is not expected to have any impact on the 
Company or the parent entity’s financial statements. 
• IFRIC 14 (amendment) “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement”. The amendments correct an unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, 
“IAS 19, The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction”. Without the amendments, entities are 
not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments for minimum funding contributions. This was not intended when IFRIC 14 
was issued, and the amendments correct this. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011. Earlier application 
is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to the earliest comparative period presented. It is not expected to have any 
impact on the Company or the parent entity’s financial statements.

e) Significant judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Many of the amounts included in the parent company financial statements require management to make judgements and/or estimates. These 
judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant facts and 
circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the parent company financial statements. Information about such 
judgements and estimation is included in the accounting policies and/or notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are summarised below. 
Areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the parent 
company financial statements include: 
• Whether to recognise a provision for accounts receivable – Notes 2i) and 9; and 
• Recognition of deferred income tax assets, amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions, the measurement of income tax expense and 
indirect taxes – Notes 2k), and 5. 
f) Foreign currency translation 
The Company’s transactions are denominated in a number of different currencies (primarily US dollars and UK pound sterling). The Company 
has liabilities that are primarily denominated in US dollars. The US dollar is the Company’s functional currency, as well as the Company’s 
presentation currency. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar are translated at the exchange rates as at the date of transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the US dollar are translated to US dollars at year-end exchange rates. All 
differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary assets measured at historical cost in a currency other than US dollars 
are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transactions. Where non-monetary assets are measured at fair value in a 
currency other than US dollars they are translated into US dollars using the exchange rates on the date when the fair value was determined.  
The following exchange rates to the US dollar have been applied:

g) Investment in subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies in order to 
obtain benefits from their activities. Control is presumed to exist where the Company has more than one half of the voting rights unless it can 
be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control. Control does not exist where other pa rties hold veto rights over significant operating 
and financial decisions. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible as well as other contractual 
arrangements that enable the Company to exercise control are taken into account. 
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment 
exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value 
less costs to sell and the value in use. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arm’s 
length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable a mount, a provision 
is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount. 
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any 
indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable 
amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in 
subsidiary does not exceed the original carrying value. 
h) Share capital 
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as 
a deduction from the proceeds.

h) Share capital 
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as 
a deduction from the proceeds. 
 
 
i) Financial instruments 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents include 
cash, and money market funds. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale. These are initially recognised 
at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, except for 
maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets. 
Loans and receivables comprise other receivables and cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date.  
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. 
Financial liabilities 
Other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  
j) Finance income and finance expense 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Company 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate 
of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. 
k) Taxes 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, respectively. 
Current income tax 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or pa id to the taxation 
authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject 
to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax 
laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred income tax 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Indirect tax 
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions or receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to 
or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date. If the receivable is expected to be received in more than 12 months from year end, the receivable is discounted and 
held at its present value. Amounts expected to be payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities 
in the balance sheet, as appropriate. 
l) Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

Incorporation of Company and Pre-IPO Reorganisation  
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 12 January 2010 as a private limited company with a share capital of 
one Ordinary Share of £1.  
On 19 February 2010 the Company entered into a share exchange agreement pursuant to which it acquired the entire issued share capital of 
BUK Holdco Ltd from members of BGC in return for issuing 943,464 Ordinary Shares of £1 each at a premium of £999 per share.  
On 22 February 2010 the Company entered into a share exchange agreement pursuant to which it acquired the entire issued share capital of 
1816962 Ontario Inc from BGC in return for issuing 375,000 Ordinary Shares of £1 each at a premium of £999 per share.  
The Company subsequently entered into a reduction of capital, eliminating share premium of US$1,989,138 to create distributable reserves, 
and restructured its share capital so as to reduce the nominal value of each of its Ordinary Shares to 10 pence. Following the share capital 
restructuring the Company made a bonus issue of shares to its then existing shareholders in preparation for the IPO, resulting in a total of 
303,246,950 Ordinary Shares being in issue prior to the IPO.  
Re-registration of the Company as a public company  
On 12 March 2010, the Company re-registered as a public limited company.  
Issuance of shares on IPO  
On 24 March 2010 the Company successfully completed its IPO. A total number of 101,082,317 shares with a par value of 10 pence each were 
issued at a price of 575 pence per share for a total of £581,223,322 (US$886,365,567) net of underwriter fees. On 15 April 2010 the Company 
issued a further 5,756,232 Ordinary Shares at a price of 575 pence per share for a total of £33,098,334 (US$52,275,508) pursuant to the exercise 
of the over-allotment option granted in connection with the IPO. Total costs related to the issuance of new shares taken against share premium 
amounted to US$53.9 million. 
12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
Stock options are granted to Executive Directors and to selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is determined by the 
Remuneration committee before the grant of an option provided that this price cannot be less than the average of the middle-market quotation 
of such shares (as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List) for the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of 
grant. All options outstanding at the end of the year expire in 2017. None of the options granted was exercisable at 31 December 2010. The 
vesting period of the options is four years, with an exercise period of three years. 
Movements in the number of options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices in pence are as follows:

At 31 December  532 676,075
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during the current year using the Lattice valuation approach was determined as 171 
pence per option. The significant inputs into the model were weighted average share and exercise price of 532 pence at the grant date, volatility 
range of 32% to 50%, dividend yield of 0.7%, an expected option life of seven years, annual risk-free interest rate of 2.68% and suboptimal 
exercise multiple of 1.5x.

Revolving credit facility 
On 24 November 2010, African Barrick Gold plc and its wholly-owned subsidiary BarbCo One Ltd concluded negotiations with a syndicate 
of commercial banks, led by Citibank, for the provision of a revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million. The 
facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to fund potential acquisitions. All provisions contained in the 
credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary terms for such finance arrangements. The term of the 
facility is 24 months and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. The shares of all significant subsidiaries have been pledged as 
security for the loan. At 31 December 2010, none of the funds were drawn under the facility while a commitment fee of 1.4% was payable. 
16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Company has exposure to the following risks through its commercial and financial operations: 
a) credit risk; and 
b) liquidity risk. 
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes 
for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework.

Revolving credit facility 
On 24 November 2010, African Barrick Gold plc and its wholly-owned subsidiary BarbCo One Ltd concluded negotiations with a syndicate 
of commercial banks, led by Citibank, for the provision of a revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million. The 
facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to fund potential acquisitions. All provisions contained in the 
credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary terms for such finance arrangements. The term of the 
facility is 24 months and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. The shares of all significant subsidiaries have been pledged as 
security for the loan. At 31 December 2010, none of the funds were drawn under the facility while a commitment fee of 1.4% was payable. 
16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Company has exposure to the following risks through its commercial and financial operations: 
a) credit risk; and 
b) liquidity risk. 
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes 
for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework.  
The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits 
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in 
market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain 
a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. 
 
 
a) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. For cash and 
cash equivalents and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet. 
Credit risk arises from loans to two subsidiaries, receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks. The Company’s financial 
assets are with counterparties whom the Company considers have an appropriate credit rating. Location of credit risk is determined by physical 
location of the bank branch, customer or counterparty. The maximum allowable term of maturity for any individual security is 12 months. 
Investment counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa2 or better by Moody’s Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poor’s. No 
more than 25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United 
States of America, United Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group. Investments are held mainly in United States dollars and cash 
and cash equivalents in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements. 
Company policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. The Company’s exposure to 
credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties 
whom the Company considers have an appropriate credit rating.  
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets in Note 15. The Company does not 
hold collateral as security for any receivables. The Company does not grade the credit quality of receivables.  
b) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of 
a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. 
The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Company’s significant financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on 
the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. As the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage liquidity risks arising 
from settlement of current liabilities and non-current liabilities. 
Capital risk management 
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio to 
support its business and provide financial flexibility in order to maximise shareholder value. In order to ensure a strong balance sheet and low 
gearing ratio, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive committee 
before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.  
At 31 December, the gearing ratio was as follows:

Forward-looking statements
This report includes ‘forward-looking statements’ that express or imply expectations

historical facts. These statements include, without limitation, financial projections 
and estimates and their underlying assumptions, statements regarding plans,

looking statements are generally identified by the words ‘plans, ’ ‘expects, ’ ‘anticipates, ’ 
‘believes, ’ ‘intends, ’ ‘estimates’ and other similar expressions. 
All forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other 
factors. Although ABG’s management believes that the expectations reflected 
in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned 
that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks 
and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond 
the control of ABG, that could cause actual results and developments to differ 
materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking 
information and statements contained in this report. Factors that could cause or 
contribute to differences between the actual results, performance and achievements 
of ABG include, but are not limited to, political, economic and business conditions,

ABG is Tanzania’s largest gold producer and one of the five largest gold producers in 
Africa. We have four producing mines, all located in north west Tanzania, and several 
exploration projects at various stages of development. With a high-quality asset base, solid 
growth opportunities and a clear strategy, we have the objective of increasing our existing 
production to one million ounces per year by 2014. 
We aim to achieve this by:
 – driving operating efficiencies to optimise production from our existing asset base;
 – growing through near mine expansion and development of advanced-stage projects; and
 – organic greenfield growth and acquisitions in Africa.
Maintaining our licence to operate through acting responsibly in relation to our people, the 
environment and the communities in which we operate is central to achieving our objectives. 
ABG is a UK public company with its headquarters in London. W e are listed on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange under the symbol ABG. Historically and prior to our 
initial public offering (IPO), our operations comprised the Tanzanian gold mining business 
of Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick), our majority shareholder.

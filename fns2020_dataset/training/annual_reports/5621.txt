India’s need for energy
India’s need for energy continues to 
grow strongly from a low base, with 
demand for power rising at around 6% 
per year and for oil products at around 
4% to 5% per year . Per capita use of 
energy has great potential for growth, 
with approximately one third of India’s 
1.2 billion population still having no 
access to electricity and the deficit o 
generation relative to demand running 
at around 9%. Therefore, Essar Energy’s 
strategy of investing in large-scale, low 
cost energy assets with long life spans 
continues to be logical and sound. 02 Company overview

Annual Report and accounts 2013
Chairman’s statement
Introduction
Welcome to Essar Energy’s Annual 
Report for FY2013. Following a 
challenging FY2012, FY2013 has seen 
significant positive progress on a number 
of fronts, demonstrating our ability to 
construct and operate world-class assets 
across the oil and gas and power sectors. 
In our Refining and Marketing business 
in India we completed the upgrade 
programme at our flagship Vadinar 
refinery and now have a world-class 
refinery producing high value fuels for 
the international and domestic markets. 
At Stanlow in the UK, projects have 
been delivered to improve GRMs by a 
sustainable US$2.2/bbl. Stanlow has 
increased its target for sustainable margin 
enhancements to $4/bbl, and is therefore 
now positioned to deliver GRMs of US$6/
bbl above IEA European benchmark 
margins by the end of FY2015. In our 
Exploration and Production business we 
have secured the final approvals to allow 
us to accelerate the development of our 
Raniganj coal bed methane (CBM) project 
in West Bengal, a project which is key to 
us becoming a leader in the development 
of unconventional gas resources in India. 
In Power, we have delivered 2,310 MW of 
new coal-fired power generating capacity, 
more than doubling our capacity from just 
one year ago to a total of 3,910 MW.
Delivery of these projects means that 
we have seen a significant improvement 
in our operating performance which 
is starting to feed through to our 
financial results. 
“The past year has seen 
significant positive progress, 
clearly demonstrating our 
ability to construct and operate 
world-class assets across the 
oil and gas and power sectors.”
Prashant Ruia 
Chairman 05
Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Despite more positive results, we, and 
our industry as a whole, continue to face 
a number of challenges due to slow 
progress with regulatory approvals in 
India. However, we are starting to see 
more positive progress on a number 
of fronts with the Government of India 
seeking to reduce the fiscal deficit 
and move commodity prices, including 
energy prices, to more commercial 
levels. We are very supportive of these 
measures and look forward to more 
positive progress in the months ahead. 
Strategy
We remain firmly of the view that India will 
continue to experience high growth rates 
for many years to come as the economy 
progresses with its industrialisation and 
urbanisation. Central to delivering this 
growth is the need for energy; whether 
fuels for transportation or electricity for 
the increasingly urban population. If India 
moves towards its targeted GDP growth 
rate of around 9% per year, then this 
requires energy supplies to grow at 
between 6.5% to 7% each year. 
These are ambitious, but achievable 
targets, and why we remain confident that 
our strategy is the right one; to create a 
world-class, low-cost, integrated energy 
company focused on India and positioned 
to capitalise on India’s growing energy 
demand. We have not changed this 
strategy for the last three years, and have 
no plans to do so, but given our current 
position in the investment cycle, we are 
looking to consolidate our position over the 
next three years before we embark on the 
next phase of growth.
In this respect, our short to medium-term 
priorities will be to complete our current 
capital expenditure (‘capex’) programme, 
which is already completed in our Refining 
businesses and mostly completed in 
Power; to optimise the performance of 
our assets – to ensure that they deliver the 
cash flow and earnings that were originally 
envisaged at the time of the original 
investment decision; and then focus on 
our balance sheet, to reduce interest 
costs, extend our repayment profile to 
better match the life of our assets and 
reduce our overall net debt. Underlying all 
of these efforts will be our continued desire 
to be a good corporate citizen for all of our 
stakeholders. With this clear focus over the 
next three years we will put ourselves in a 
much stronger position both operationally 
and financially and will be ready to embark 
on our next phase of growth.
Board governance
Following the appointment of Steve 
Lucas in March 2012, the Board now 
has a good mix with five Independent 
Directors and three Non-Independent 
Directors. However, we continue to 
review the market to strengthen further 
the experience, independence and 
diversity of our Board members.
In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and to ensure a continuous 
improvement in our corporate governance 
profile, we undertook our first externally 
facilitated Board evaluation this year, the 
results of which are outlined in the 
Corporate Governance Report. I am 
pleased to report that this independent 
evaluation confirmed that the Board and 
its Committees operate effectively and 
each Director demonstrates commitment 
to their role.
GUVNL transmission line to Salaya power plant.
India will continue to experience high growth 
rates for many years to come as the economy 
progresses with its industrialisation and 
urbanisation. Central to delivering this growth 
is the need for energy.
People
The quality of our assets and strong 
operating performance is a testament to 
the skills, dedication and commitment of 
our people. Where necessary, we have 
brought in new people to strengthen our 
leadership teams across the businesses 
and this is starting to deliver improved 
operating and financial performance. This 
year we have completed over US$4 billion 
of capital projects and they have all been 
seamlessly moved into operation. Even 
where we have faced disruptions, teams 
across the businesses have worked 
together to find solutions to ensure that 
we can continue to deliver supplies to our 
customers. For all of this, I would like to 
thank each of our employees for their 
efforts throughout the year.
They have been assisted in this 
endeavour through the excellent 
leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, 
Naresh Nayyar, and his Senior 
Management team.

Annual Report and accounts 2013
Chief Executive Officer’s  
review
Growth projects
FY2013 saw the completion of several 
major projects and with this, significant 
growth in capacity. Our Vadinar refinery 
upgrade increased capacity by 15% to 
20 million metric tonnes per annum 
(mmtpa) and a complexity of 1 1 .8, and 
our power capacity increased by 1 44% 
with completion of the 1 ,200 MW Salaya I 
coal-fired power plant, the 5 10 MW Vadinar 
P2 coal-fired power plant and the first 600 
MW unit at our Mahan I coal-fired power 
plant. With the completion of these 
projects, the majority of our capex 
programme is complete which 
significantly reduces construction 
risks within the Company.
The new Vadinar refinery expansion 
units were ramped up to full capacity and 
complexity within six months of completion, 
which is a credit to the operating team at 
Vadinar . This asset has been operating at 
full capacity for the last six months so our 
focus has moved to the optimisation of the 
individual units to enhance volumes and 
margins. This asset now stands amongst 
the best in the world in terms of scale and 
complexity and, with a total cost of just 
US$5.3 billion, is also amongst the most 
competitive from a capital perspective. 
The Vadinar refinery is the flagship asset 
in Essar Energy’s portfolio.
In Power , we more than doubled our 
capacity from 1 ,600 MW a year ago to 
3,910 MW today. Importantly, the projects 
completed this year are the first of our 
coal-fired power projects; Salaya I, which 
will primarily provide power to the local 
state utility in Gujarat; Vadinar P2, which 
will provide power and steam to the 
Vadinar refinery; and Mahan I, which will 
provide power to local utilities, Essar Steel 
and the merchant market. Despite some 
initial issues around temporary cooling 
water availability at Salaya and transmission 
at Mahan, I am pleased to report that these 
plants are all now being stabilised and will 
shortly be operating as expected. 
Operating performance
Following completion of a number of 
projects during the year we saw a 
significant uplift in production. 
In Refining, production was up by 22% 
from 1 76 million barrels (mmbbls) to 
215 mmbbls following the expansion of the 
Vadinar refinery and a full year contribution 
“FY2013 has been a year of solid 
delivery against our strategy.”
Naresh Nayyar 
Chief Executive Officer 07
Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
from the Stanlow refinery which was 
acquired in July 201 1 . More importantly, we 
saw a strong uplift in our CP GRMs from 
US$4.45/bbl to US$7 .96/bbl at Vadinar 
following the upgrade in complexity from 
6. 1 to 1 1 .8 and improved market conditions 
in Asia. At Stanlow, we saw CP GRMs 
increase from US$3.06/bbl to US$7 .38/bbl 
which includes the benefits of our margin 
enhancement as well as improved market 
conditions in Europe.
The current financial year will see us benefit 
from a full year of the upgraded complexity 
at Vadinar . Projects have been delivered  
to improve GRMs by a sustainable  
US$2.2/bbl in Stanlow. Stanlow has 
increased its target for sustainable margin 
enhancements to US$4/bbl, which will 
allow it to deliver GRMs of US$6/bbl above 
IEA European benchmark margins by the 
end of FY2015.
In Power , production across the 
portfolio was up by 26% from 7 ,907 million 
units (MU) to 10,01 7 MU as a decline in 
production across our gas-based power 
plants due to high gas prices was more 
than offset by increased production from 
our new power plant. Despite this progress, 
we continue to face challenges in our 
power operations due to regulatory delays, 
coal availability, logistics challenges and 
high gas prices. Our operating teams 
continue to innovate to overcome these 
challenges, such as the transfer of cooling 
water from our Vadinar refinery to the 
Salaya power plant to ensure sufficient 
water availability and our decision to 
convert the Bhander and Hazira power 
projects from gas to coal, but we need to 
see improvements in regulation and the 
availability of coal and gas at affordable 
prices to deliver the full potential of our 
power assets.
Despite these challenges, as our 
operations settle down and with a full year 
contribution from our new plant, we should 
again see an uplift in generation in this 
current financial year .
Improved financial results
The improved operating performance has 
fed through to a much improved financial 
performance with CP EBITDA up 1 76% on 
last year from US$485 million to US$1 ,336 
million. The IFRS loss before tax of US$163 
million was impacted by items outside of 
our control such as foreign exchange loss 
of US$256 million, which would otherwise 
have led to a profit before tax. This was still 
a major improvement on last year’s loss 
before tax of US$1 , 1 48 million which was 
impacted by the loss of the Gujarat sales 
tax case. 
With operations now stabilising, the 
focus is now firmly on optimising the 
performance of our assets and I would 
expect to see continued top line 
improvements in future periods.
Our net finance costs increased from 
last year’s US$384 million to US$691 
million due to interest on sales tax and 
increased interest from projects moving 
into operations as interest which was 
previously capitalised is now expensed 
in our profit and loss account. Looking 
forward, our focus moves to reducing the 
impact of financing costs on profits. We 
have commenced a number of initiatives 
to reduce interest costs including the 
dollarisation of our Rupee debt in Essar 
Oil, extending the repayment profile of 
our debt to better match asset lives, and 
reducing overall debt levels. We will 
provide updates on progress of these 
initiatives in future periods.
Health and safety
Health and safety remains the number 
one priority for Essar Energy. During 
the year, despite an overall good 
performance, we had Lost Time Incidents 
at our Vadinar, Stanlow, Raniganj and 
Salaya assets. Sadly, we also had a 
vehicle incident at the Vadinar refinery 
involving a contractor which led to a 
fatality. As a result, we decided to raise 
the profile of the Board’s Health, Safety 
and Environment (HSE) Committee at our 
sites and held HSE site visits at Stanlow, 
Vadinar and Salaya. This allowed the HSE 
Committee to review conditions on the 
ground and agree a number of action 
points with a view to improving 
performance. I am confident that all of 
our operations will continue to seek 
improvements in HSE performance.
We also continue to engage with 
the people around our operations to 
ensure that we are giving back to our 
communities. Our focus is on health, 
education, basic services and supporting 
the creation of sustainable micro 
businesses. During the year, through the 
Essar Foundation, we contributed 
US$719,660 to community activities and I 
would encourage you to review some of 
the case studies laid out in this Report 
and our separately published online 
Sustainability Report.
Your Company has made significant 
progress against our stated strategy 
during FY2013. Our major capex 
programme is now complete in our 
Refinery business and nearing completion 
in Power. With this, our focus has moved 
to asset optimisation to ensure that all 
assets deliver to expectations, and then to 
reducing net debt within the Company. 
While challenges remain, we are very clear 
on what we need to do to be successful 
and I am confident of delivery against 
our objectives.
I am positive that Essar Energy will continue 
to go from strength to strength.

Business outlook
The long-term outlook remains positive 
for energy demand in India. Essar 
Energy’s strategy to capitalise on India’s 
growing requirements for energy remains 
intact and unchanged.
The market for refined petroleum 
products in India is expected to remain 
strong, with demand for diesel rising at 
a rate of about 6% to 7% per year and 
gasoline 4% to 5%. Meanwhile, India’s 
per capita usage of oil products is easily 
the lowest of the BRIC economies and 
stands at less than half that of China and 
1 1% than that of the EU.
Given Asia’s high demand growth 
coupled with delays to new refining 
capacity, we believe the outlook for 
margins at Vadinar is positive given its 
superior scale and complexity. 
In the UK, the ongoing margin 
enhancement projects underway at the 
Stanlow refinery are widening the gap with 
rival refiners, leaving Stanlow increasingly 
advantaged in a tough European refining 
environment. Stanlow has built-in 
advantages from its higher complexity, its 
bias towards production of middle distillates 
and its location close to the demand 
centres of Manchester and Liverpool. 
In Power, the market fundamentals remain 
encouraging. There is a considerable 
shortage of power generation in India 
relative to demand, with peak deficits of 
around 9% of demand in FY2013. These 
shortages are expected to increase over 
the next three to five years as supply 
continues to lag demand. 
Many power companies in India are 
experiencing ongoing difficulties in 
obtaining the necessary consents and 
regulatory clearances to build generation 
projects and to source adequate 
economic supplies of coal. Therefore, 
over time a clear advantage will exist for 
those such as Essar Energy who already 
have assets in place with access to 
economic coal through captive mines.
Given the importance of electricity to 
achieving India’s targeted economic 
growth, there remains a clear need for 
the Indian Government to ensure a more 
transparent and efficient regulatory 
framework covering project consents 
and clearances. In particular, the low 
availability of domestic Indian coal is a 
problem that needs attention. 
The recent steps taken by the 
Government of India to reduce the 
heavy subsidy of retail diesel prices are 
encouraging. This will not only alleviate a 
major burden on state funding but will 
also encourage investment and facilitate 
much greater competition among retail 
fuel suppliers. As current subsidies are 
removed, and retail sales become 
profitable, there will be an opportunity for 
Essar Oil to expand its franchise network 
of around 1,400 retail fuel outlets.
In January 2013, a committee chaired 
by Dr C Rangarajan, Chairman of the 
Economic Advisory Council to the Prime 
Minister of India, published a report on 
the ‘Production Sharing Contract 
Mechanism in the Petroleum Industry in 
India’. This report recommended a 
change in pricing of gas produced in 
India to one based on a basket of 
international hub prices and average 
netback prices for LNG imports into 
India. The intention is to stimulate further 
investment in Indian gas production, 
which fell 9% in 201 1–12 according to 
India’s annual economic survey in 2013. If 
the pricing proposal is implemented, we 
believe this would significantly enhance 
the appetite of investors to become 
involved in the Indian upstream gas 
sector, thus delivering greater growth. A 
change in the gas pricing structure would 
be potentially positive for Essar Energy’s 
CBM block at Raniganj in West Bengal, 
and for future prospects at its four other 
CBM blocks in India.
Essar Energy’s long-term strategy is to 
continue to grow the Company and 
capitalise on India’s long-term need for 
energy. However, given our current 
position in the investment cycle we are 
looking to consolidate our current 
position before we embark on the next 
phase of growth. In this respect, our 
short to medium-term priorities will be to 
complete our current capital expenditure 
programme, optimise the performance of 
our assets to ensure they deliver the cash 
flow and earnings as originally envisaged, 
and to focus on our balance sheet to 
reduce interest costs, extend repayment 
profiles and reduce net debt. 
Economic outlook 
India’s potential for long-term economic 
growth is clear and, with a general 
election due in 2014, the Government 
has started to implement some of the 
structural changes which will be 
necessary if that potential is to be fulfilled. 
The need for change was illustrated by a 
GDP growth rate of just 4.8% in the 
fourth quarter of FY2013, marginally up 
from 4.7% in the third quarter, and just 
5% for the year as a whole, compared 
with 9.3% in FY201 1. 
The Indian Ministry of Finance, alongside 
other external economic forecasters, is 
predicting a modest recovery in FY2014, 
with GDP growth rising to above 6%. The 
Reserve Bank of India’s quarterly survey of 
professional forecasters in May 2013 
showed expectations for real GDP growth 
in FY2014 at 6.0% down from 6.5% in 
their previous survey in January 2013. 
As stated in India’s annual Economic 
Survey, published at the end of February, 
the Government needs to pursue reforms 
to stimulate more corporate and 
infrastructure investment and to continue 
to reduce the subsidy burden, particularly 
in petroleum products, through better 
targeting towards those in real need.
This is critical if India’s fiscal deficit, which 
rose to 5.7% of GDP in FY2012 and 
stood at 4.9% in FY2013 (or c.US$90 
billion), is to be brought down to a new 
target level of 4.8% of GDP for FY2014 
and 3% in FY2017 .
However, the rate of inflation has fallen 
more recently, with the wholesale price 
index running 5.96% higher in March 
than a year earlier, against a 6.84% rise in 
February. The consumer price index has 
been running at a much higher rate, 
10.39% in March against a year earlier, 
but this was also down on February’s 
10.91%. This slowing inflation allowed the 
Reserve Bank of India to cut its repo 
lending rate by a quarter point to 7 .25%  
in May 2013, the third such reduction 
since January.
Over the 12 month period, the Rupee 
remained relatively weak against the US 
dollar, starting the period at Rs.51. 16, 
falling as low as Rs.57 .33 and closing 
the period down 6.3% at Rs.54.39. This 
followed a decline during the previous 
15 month period to 31 March 2012, when 
it weakened from Rs.45.39 to Rs.51. 16 
against the dollar. The Rupee has 
recently traded at around Rs.59.

Our strategy
Within this, our priorities over the next three years are 
as follows:
01 Complete the current capex programme
We are approaching the end of a major capital investment 
programme. We have completed our investments in our 
Refining businesses and are approaching the final stages 
of our investments in Power and Exploration and Production. 
As a result, construction risks are significantly reduced and 
our capital expenditure will fall over the next three years.
02 Optimise the performance of our operating assets 
As Essar Energy comes to the end of its major capital 
expenditure programme our focus moves to business 
optimisation. Business optimisation looks to improve all 
aspects of the business: to maximise throughput, lower costs, 
improve margins and provide more operating and financial 
flexibility. The delivery of these programmes will ensure that the 
business is robust in bottom of the cycle conditions and able to 
maximise cash flow and earnings at all other times.
03 Focus on cash generation and net debt reduction
With the optimisation of our operating assets we will produce 
the cash flows which will allow us to reduce net debt and 
increase earnings. We will seek to refinance debt, where 
possible, to reduce interest costs, eliminate currency 
mismatches and extend the maturity of our debt profile 
to bring it more in line with the life of our assets. 
04 Be a good corporate citizen 
We will achieve the above while continuing to act as a good 
corporate citizen with respect to the health and safety of our 
employees and the communities in which we operate. Our aim 
is to be recognised in India as a leader in the areas of health, 
safety and the environment. 
Refining and  
Marketing – India 
Essar Energy’s strategy remains clear; to 
create a world-class, low-cost integrated 
energy company, positioned to capitalise 
on India’s rapidly growing energy demand.

` ` We have expedited our drilling 
process at Raniganj, our first CBM 
block under development. We had 
drilled 143 wells as at the end of 
March 2013 and received approvals to 
drill up to 650 wells over the life of the 
field. Currently we are producing 
100,000 standard cubic metres per 
day (scmd) of gas, up from 25,000 
scmd last year.
` ` The Raniganj CBM block covers a 
wide area near to Durgapur in West 
Bengal, and sustainable engagement 
with the local communities across this 
region has been a key element of the 
business strategy. Activities have 
included healthcare, entrepreneurship 
and education.
` ` Given the widespread nature of CBM 
drilling and gas gathering activity at 
Raniganj, a sustainable approach to 
managing any environmental impact 
is of great importance. There has 
been a strong focus, in particular, on 
managing the large volume of water 
extracted from wells to allow it to be 
used for CBM processes. 
` ` Across the portfolio, we continue to 
evaluate ways of managing risk by 
bringing in strategic partners where 
appropriate. In February 2013, we sold

to the Gujarat authorities seeking 
relief under our power purchase 
agreement with the Gujarat state 
power utility at our Salaya I power 
project for a change in law in 
Indonesia which has impacted the 
cost of coal to the plant. If successful,

At the same time, annual production 
increased to 19.77 mmtpa/140.3 
mmbbls, from 17 . 1 mmtpa/125 mmbbls in 
the 15 month period to March 2012. We 
expect throughput from now to run at 
around 20 mmtpa, or 143 mmbbls 
per year.
Vadinar is now a state-of-the-art refinery, 
accounting for around 10% of India’s total 
refining capacity. It is well placed to 
capitalise on rising demand in India and 
internationally for the high value fuels it is 
capable of producing, particularly middle 
distillates – gasoil and jet fuel – where 
there is the greatest domestic and 
international growth in demand. 59% of 
Vadinar’s production consisted of middle 
distillate products during FY2013, against 
43% in FY2012. Of the middle distillates, 
around 80% was gasoil.
At the same time, the higher complexity 
means Vadinar can process a much 
greater proportion of lower cost, ultra-
heavy crudes. During FY2013, the 
proportion of ultra-heavy crudes 
processed increased to about 61% 
of the total from 19% in FY2012.
Vadinar is advantaged in the long-term 
by the low cost of construction, with total 
capital costs totalling c.US$5.3 billion, 
or c.US$13,000 per bbl of throughput, 
making it amongst the lowest cost 
refineries globally. 
A further significant advantage is being 
gained through the replacement of power 
and steam production from gas and 
refinery fuels to coal. This was achieved 
through the commissioning of the Vadinar 
P2 power project in December 2012, 
giving the Vadinar refinery a significant 
cost advantage given current low coal 
prices compared to gas or oil. At current 
prices, this is adding over US$1/bbl to 
refinery margins.
R&M India delivered CP EBITDA of 
US$823.8 million for FY2013, compared 
with CP EBITDA of US$234.2 million in 
FY2012. The increase was driven 
primarily by higher CP GRMs and 
increased production.
Case study 
Vadinar refinery benefiting from  
the newly commissioned coal-fired  
power plant 
In December 2012, Essar Power 
completed the commissioning of its 
Vadinar Phase 2 power plant, which 
is a captive 510 MW station, situated 
adjacent to the refinery and capable 
of providing all of the refinery’s 
power and steam requirements.  
By delivering power and steam 
using coal as the generation fuel, 
rather than much more expensive 
gas or fuel oil, Essar Power has 
been able to lift gross refinery 
margins by more than US$1/bbl, 
which is a great competitive 
advantage.  17
Essar Energy plc

Our expectation is that GRMs at Vadinar 
will run at a level of approximately 
US$7-8/bbl above the International 
Energy Agency’s (IEA) Singapore 
benchmark, including the benefit from 
coal-fired power and steam generation. 
Of Vadinar’s sales, around 69% by value 
was sold in the Indian domestic market 
during the year, where our principal 
customers, comprising 61 % of sales, are 
the public sector oil marketing companies, 
and around 31 % was sold for export. 
Our Indian fuel retail business, consisting 
of 1,400 operational franchise retail sites, 
with another 195 under construction, is 
beginning to benefit from the incremental 
steps announced by the Indian 
Government in January 2013 to reduce 
diesel subsidies. This involves monthly 
permissible increases by state fuel 
retailers of up to Rs.0.50 per month until 
the retail pump subsidy, currently around 
Rs.4.87 per litre, is eliminated. Subsidies 
for bulk sales of diesel were removed 
completely. This follows on from the 
deregulation in June 2010 of petrol 
prices, which has benefited R&M India, 
with retail sales of gasoline rising by 6% 
in FY2013 compared with the previous 
12 months.
Sales tax 
On 17 January 2012, the Honourable 
Supreme Court of India determined 
that R&M India could no longer enjoy 
a deferred sales tax benefit which was 
originally granted to R&M India by the 
Gujarat Government to incentivise the 
construction of the Vadinar refinery in 
the state of Gujarat. Following this 
judgment, R&M India became liable 
to pay back to the Government of 
Gujarat the amount of deferred sales tax 
collected aggregating c.US$1, 134 million 
(Rs.61.69 billion). 
Of the total principal sum owing, of 
approximately US$1, 134 million (Rs.61.69 
billion), R&M India repaid c.US$185 million 
(Rs. 10.04 billion) in July 2012 as directed 
by the Honourable Supreme Court. 
The Honourable Supreme Court on 
13 September 2012 directed R&M India 
to repay the remaining c.US$950 million 
(Rs.51.65 billion) sales tax balance owed 
in eight quarterly instalments along with 
interest at the rate of 10% pa on the 
outstanding amount due with repayments 
beginning in January 2013. 
R&M India has made two repayments 
which were due on 2 January 2013 and 2 
April 2013. The remaining principal balance 
is c.US$712 million (Rs.38.7 4 billion).
CDR exit and debt dollarisation
In March 2013, R&M India completed the 
process for exiting the CDR mechanism 
which was implemented in December 
2004 to help cover the construction of its 
Vadinar refinery in Gujarat. The CDR loan 
facility was replaced with a new debt 
facility of about c.US$1.65 billion (Rs.91.00 
billion) on revised commercial terms from a 
similar group of lenders. A US$83 million 
gain has been recognised in net finance 
costs on the exit of the CDR loan facility. 
The CDR exit now allows Essar Oil to 
refinance its expensive Rupee debt with 
lower cost US dollar loans to lower interest 
costs and improve cash flows and 
profitability. Essar Oil has already 
refinanced Rs.26. 1 1 billion of Rupee loans 
into equivalent foreign currency debt of  
c.US$481 million through the use of 
external commercial borrowings and by 
swapping Rupee loans into US dollars.

Divisional performance indicators
Stanlow, the second largest refinery in 
the UK, was purchased by Essar Energy 
in July 201 1 for US$350 million.
Significant progress was made during 
FY2013 with a series of projects designed 
to improve gross refinery margins and 
increase profitability. Projects have been 
delivered to improve GRMs by a 
sustainable US$2.2/bbl compared with 
the level when Essar acquired Stanlow in 
August 201 1. Stanlow has now increased 
its target for sustainable margin 
enhancements from U$3/bbl to U$4/bbl 
above the level at acquisition, which when 
completed will mean Stanlow is delivering 
GRMs of US$6/bbl above IEA North West 
European benchmark margins by the end 
of FY2015.
The projects delivered include optimisation 
of the crude slate to lower crude purchase 
costs, including the introduction of over 15 
lower cost crudes, including some heavy 
and ultra heavy, and a sharp reduction in 
dependence on North Sea crudes, from 
over 90% in 201 1 to around one third 
recently. Other initiatives include 
introducing natural gas to the refinery to 
replace fuel oil in our burners which lowers 
costs, improves efficiency and improves 
environmental performance; and closure 
of our lubricants production units which 
has allowed for further optimisation of our 
crude slate. Stanlow will continue to seek 
ways to optimise the performance of the 
refinery to deliver cost and margin benefits 
and ensure that Stanlow moves to the top 
of the catalytic cracking refinery fraternity 
in Europe.

Stanlow has improved margins at a 
time when the European refining sector 
generally remains under pressure through 
a surplus of gasoline products and a 
shortfall of the higher value middle 
distillates, particularly diesel and jet fuel.
During FY2013, R&M UK achieved CP 
GRMs averaging US$7 .38/bbl, up 141% 
compared with US$3.06/bbl achieved 
during the first eight months of Essar 
Energy’s ownership in FY2012. This 
reflected a general improvement in 
market margins and a FY2013 average 
uplift of US$2.2/bbl due to the margin 
enhancement programme. Throughput 
was 9.9 million tonnes of crude, or 7 4.72 
million barrels, which is in line with 
expectations. 
Throughput in FY2014 is expected to 
be around 10–15% lower than the normal 
throughput of around 75 million barrels 
per year, due to a major maintenance 
turnaround to be completed during 
the year. 
R&M UK achieved a CP EBITDA of 
US$317 .2 million for FY2013, compared 
with a CP EBITDA of US$12.8 million in 
the first eight months of ownership in 
FY2012. This increase was due to a full 
year of operations, delivery of our margin 
enhancement initiatives and improved 
industry margins offset by the impact of 
a fire in a convection bank of a furnace at 
one of our secondary processing units in 
January 2013.
Case study 
Stanlow crudes diversification and 
lubricants unit closure 
An important element of the drive by 
Essar Oil UK to sustainably improve 
GRMs at Stanlow has been a 
diversification of the range of crude 
oils processed to very significantly 
reduce reliance on higher cost UK 
North Sea variants. Compared with 
the time of acquisition, more than 15 
new opportunity crudes have been 
introduced to the Stanlow refinery, 
including certain ultra-heavy crudes 
with an API below 25, and the move 
to halt production of engine oil 
lubricants in March 2013 has 
allowed this process to be 
accelerated. Lubricants production 
represented around 2% of the 
refinery’s total product output, but 
dictated 25% of the crude intake 
because of the specific types 
required for that product. By 
stopping the production of 
lubricants, the Stanlow refinery has 
removed a restriction on crude 
selection and now has complete 
freedom to optimise its choices. By 
March 2013, only around a quarter 
of the crude slate was coming from 
the North Sea against over 90% in 
2011. New crudes are now being 
sourced from places such as north 
and west Africa, offshore Canada 
and residue from Russian crudes. 
The termination of lubricants 
production required agreement 
from customers and involved a 
lengthy set of negotiations by 
Stanlow management.  21

Case study 
Stanlow inventory monetisation
Essar Oil UK has been working to 
improve efficiency across all areas, 
not just operationally but also in 
financial terms. As part of this, the 
Company completed an agreement 
in July 2012 with Barclays Bank PLC 
under which Barclays now holds the 
inventories of crude oil and 
petroleum products at Stanlow and 
will supply crude to the refinery in line 
with its requirements on a daily 
basis. This transaction allowed Essar 
Oil UK to repay its previous US$1.5 
billion working capital revolving 
credit facility, and achieve a 
substantial reduction in costs 
together with greater operational 
flexibility. The customer relationships 
and product sale processes remain 
with Essar Oil UK, which also retains 
full flexibility to choose the crudes 
for processing at the refinery. The 
arrangement with Barclays is for an 
initial three year period and 
continues to work well.

2013, with 75 in production. 
` ` On track to reach targeted peak production of  
c.3 million standard cubic metres per day 
(mmscmd) from Raniganj.
` ` Completed the sale of a 50% share in offshore 
gas exploration block 1 14 in Vietnam to ENI 
International B.V. in February 2013.
Essar Energy’s Exploration and 
Production business has 15 oil and gas 
blocks in India and internationally. Its 
current focus is on unconventional gas in 
India where it has a portfolio of five CBM 
gas blocks with a total of 10 trillion cubic 
feet (tcf) of reserves and prospective 
resources, making it the largest CBM 
player in the country.
The business took a considerable step 
forward in February 2013 when the first 
of its CBM blocks being developed, the 
Raniganj block in West Bengal, was 
granted Phase III environmental clearance 
by the Indian Government. This will allow 
the full field to be developed. As at 31 
March 2013, 143 wells had been drilled, 
of which around 75 were in production. 
In order to reach the targeted peak 
production of c.3 million standard cubic 
metres per day (mmscmd) of gas, the 
immediate intention is to increase the 
number of wells to around 350. The 
remainder will be drilled over the lifetime 
of the field in order to maintain production. 
Raniganj is currently producing around 
100,000 scmd of gas.
The Indian Government of India is in 
the process of amending the current gas 
sales pricing regime for indigenous gas 
in India. A report was completed in 
January 2013 recommending that 
prices be increased in line with a basket 
of international hub prices to incentivise 
investment in domestic Indian resources. 
If implemented, this could have a significant 
positive impact on Essar Energy’s coal 
bed methane business.
In the interim, Essar is continuing to 
sell gas from Raniganj to a number of 
industrial customers in small quantities 
through pipelines and cascades. 
The experience obtained from the 
development of our Raniganj block will 
be used to support the development of 
our other, CBM blocks where we have, 
in total, 10 tcf of prospective resources. 
Work continues on these blocks to 
obtain environmental approvals and the 
Petroleum Exploration Licences (PELs) 
required to allow us to complete the 
minimum work programmes.
Across our conventional oil and gas 
blocks, Essar Energy continues to 
evaluate ways of managing risk by 
bringing in strategic partners where 
appropriate. During the year we 
completed the sale of a 50% share in 
our offshore gas exploration block 1 14 
in Vietnam to ENI International B.V. 
There was no gain or loss arising on 
this transaction.
Essar Energy has a 
total of 10 tcf of coal bed 
methane reserves and 
prospective resources 
in India, making it the 
largest coal bed methane 
player in the country.
Essar Energy’s Exploration and 
Production business has 15 oil 
and gas blocks in India and 
overseas. It is currently focused 
on unconventional gas in India.

During FY2013, the Company more 
than doubled its generation capacity by 
completing 2,310 MW of new coal-fired 
power generation, taking the total 
generation capacity to 3,910 MW (including 
600 MW unit 1 of Mahan which was 
synchronised during the year) up 1 44% 
compared with 1 ,600 MW at the start of 
the financial year . This led to increased 
generation of 10,01 7 MU, up 27% on the 
7 ,907 MU generated in 15 months FY201 2 
as increased generation from our new 
coal-fired plant more than offset lower 
generation at our gas-fired plant as higher 
gas prices impacted demand.
Overall Operational EBITDA from the Essar 
Power business was US$224.7 million for 
FY2013, compared to US$266.3 million 
FY201 2, a 5% increase when adjusted 
for the 15 months in FY201 2.
In October 2012, the Essar Power 
business was assigned a credit rating 
of A+ by ratings agency Credit Analysis 
and Research Ltd (CARE) of Mumbai, 
in respect of a proposed Rs.50 billion 
(c.US$909 million) bond issue to

In May 2013 it has successfully raised 
Rs.6.29 billion (c.US$1 14 million) of bonds 
and had received sanction letters for the 
full Rs.50 billion (c.US$909 million). The 
proceeds from these bonds will be used 
primarily to make repayments on existing 
loan facilities within the power business, 
including those for our new coal fired

Power
shutdown in November 2012. However, 
plant load factors at Hazira and Bhander 
remained low due to high gas prices.
As a result, generation for FY2013 from 
Power’s captive portfolio was 5,869 MU, 
down 6% on a comparative 1 2 month 
basis. Generation for the 15 month period 
ended March 201 2 was 7 ,794 MU. 
Ongoing high gas prices, with little 
prospect of this situation changing for the 
foreseeable future, has led to a review of 
our current gas fired generation portfolio. 
The result is that we have agreed with our 
customers to convert the Hazira I (5 15 MW) 
and Bhander (500 MW) power stations to 
coal fired boilers based on imported coal. 
Any additional costs associated with this 
conversion will be compensated by an 
adjustment to current tariff levels. Any 
conversion will be subject to the receipt of 
all necessary approvals. The existing gas 
turbines will be sold or relocated to regions 
where there is ample supply of economic 
natural gas.
Due primarily to an increase in project 
scope at Hazira II and Paradip, costs have 
increased to US$308 million and US$165 
million, respectively from US$261 million 
and US$1 24 million. These increased 
costs have been offset by an increase in 
the tariffs charged to customers to ensure 
that the project economics remain intact.
Imported coal project: 
Salaya I – 1,200 MW
Unit 1 of 600 MW was fully commissioned 
in April 201 2 and unit 2, also of 600 MW, 
was commissioned in June 201 2. 
Plant load factors at the coal-fired Salaya I 
plant improved during the year, averaging 
44% but standing at 65% in Q4 FY2013. 
This uplift was due to improved water 
supply from January as a temporary 
solution was put in place to bring 
desalinated water from the Vadinar 
refinery to Salaya. The water from the 
Vadinar refinery is supplementing water 
being procured from the nearby Narmada 
River. This temporary solution is required 
pending the receipt of regulatory 
approvals from the Indian Government to 
construct a dedicated permanent sea 
water pipeline and coal import jetty and 
conveyor belt to the power plant. 
T echnical plant availability has averaged 
86% since commissioning and 96% in 
Q4 FY2013.
Longer term, the coal for Salaya I will come 
from the Aries coal mine in Indonesia. This 
mine is wholly owned by Essar Energy and 
was acquired in April 2010. Final ‘Pinjam 
Pakai’ forest clearance was received in 
June 201 2 and first coal is expected by Q4 
FY201 4. In the interim, alternative supplies 
of coal continue to be imported via other 
nearby ports. 
Essar Energy, together with other Indian 
power companies, continues to seek 
relief under Power Purchase Agreements 
to mitigate the impact of a change in 
Indonesian coal pricing laws in 201 1 which 
has added to the cost of coal imported 
from Indonesia. Being an industry-wide 
issue, other power companies in India 
have made representations to their 
respective local utilities and electricity 
regulators for increases in tariffs. Essar 
Power filed a tariff revision plea with 
GUVNL, the Gujarat State utility that 
purchases the majority of the power from 
Salaya I, in April 2013. The Group believes 
an increase in tariff will help it achieve an 
acceptable long-term rate of return on its 
investment in Salaya I. If an increased tariff 
is not secured, there may be a risk to the 
long-term realisation of this investment 
under IFRS. However, management 
view the Salaya I power plant and the 
Aries mine as a combined asset for 
performance evaluation and internal 
business reviews and believe strongly 
that when viewed on a combined basis, 
there is significant value in the project.
Domestic coal projects: 
Mahan I – 1,200 MW
The synchronisation of the 600 MW unit 1 
at Mahan I in the second half of FY2013, 
together with the grant of stage 1 forest 
clearance by the Government of India for 
the nearby Mahan coal block, represented 
two positive steps forward for the project 
following a number of frustrating delays. 
Pending the commencement of coal 
mining at the Mahan coal block, five 
kilometres from the power project, coal is 
being sourced from Coal India’s e-auction 
process. The use of imported coal is also 
being considered. In March 2013, Essar 
Essar Energy divides its power generation 
portfolio into different groupings. The 
captive, or Return on Equity (ROE) plants 
are in one division, and the other , non-
captive, plants, are grouped according 
to their fuel sources, which are either 
international or domestic coal. 
Captive power projects
Power has six captive power projects 
operational, with a further two due to 
complete in FY201 4. These captive 
projects deliver more secure revenues and 
Operational EBITDA as the majority of 
payments are based on availability, rather 
than on power generated. Fuel price and 
delivery risk lies with the power purchaser .
Operational, total 2,110 MW: 
Hazira (5 1 5 MW , gas-fired) and Bhander 
(500 MW , gas-fired) are primarily captive to 
the Essar Steel plant at Hazira, with the 
Hazira 5 1 5 MW plant also supplying the 
Gujarat state electricity utility GUVNL. 
Meanwhile, Vadinar (1 20 MW , refinery 
residue, multi-fuel), Vadinar P1 (380 MW , 
gas-fired) and Vadinar P2 (5 10 MW , 
coal-fired) are captive to the Essar Oil 
refinery at Vadinar . The other , Algoma (85 
MW , gas-fired), is captive to the Essar Steel 
plant at Algoma, Canada.
Under construction, total 390 MW:

Power executed a bi-lateral contract with 
the Power Company of Karnataka Ltd. to 
supply 210 MW of firm power for a two 
year period from August 2013 at a fixed 
tariff of Rs.4.3/unit and in April 2013, Essar 
Power executed a bilateral contract with 
Essar Steel to supply 300 MW of firm 
power for a nine month period, from 
July 2013 at a fixed tariff of Rs.3.89/unit 
(July 2013) and Rs.3.75/unit (August 2013 
to March 2014). Essar Power is seeking 
to sign similar contracts with 
other companies. 
However , in Q4 FY2013 the Mahan plant 
did not generate due to ongoing work to 
allow commissioning and stabilisation on 
coal. The 600 MW unit 1 was 
commissioned in April 2013.
Operation of the 600 MW Unit 2 at Mahan I 
will be subject to signing suitable bilateral 
contracts and coal availability.
The Mahan coal block was originally 
allocated to Essar in 2006. Delays in 
granting coal mine clearances have held 
up the development of a number of coal 
blocks and power projects in India. 
However, on 30 October 2012, we 
received Stage 1 forest clearance for the 
Mahan coal block. The Stage 2 clearance 
is progressing well and is expected in the 
next few months and, once secured, we 
estimate it will take 9 to 12 months to 
produce first coal and it will then take 
between two to three years to ramp up 
to the full capacity of 8.5 mmtpa. 
In addition to e-auction and imported coal, 
Essar Energy has applied for medium-
term allocations of coal under Coal India’s 
tapering coal linkage system. Receipt of a 
tapering coal linkage allocation will 
improve the economics of Mahan I. 
Tori I-1,200 MW, and Tori II- 600 MW
As at the end of March 2013, the 
construction programmes for Tori I 
(1,200MW, comprising two units of 
600MW each) and Tori II (600MW) 
were respectively 42% complete and 
17% complete. 
Essar Energy’s six operational captive 
power projects’ revenues are based 
on availability, rather than on power 
generated, while fuel price and 
delivery risk lies with the customer.
Case study 
Salaya workaround for cooling water
Among Essar Energy’s most valuable 
assets is its ability to innovate and its 
flexibility of approach. This has been 
clearly demonstrated at its Salaya I 
power project, where there have been 
long delays in progressing the 
environmental clearances required to 
complete the dedicated coal import 
terminal and sea water pipeline for the 
power station’s cooling system. In 
order to get enough cooling water to 
the site, Essar Energy’s engineers 
came up with an innovative temporary 
solution. First, they re-routed 
desalinated water from the nearby 
Vadinar refinery to the Salaya power 
plant by adding an additional pipeline, 
instead of routing it back to the sea. 
Second, they switched the intake 
seawater pipeline to the refinery with 
its larger return pipeline and added 
new pumping capacity to increase 
water volumes to 8,700 cubic metres 
an hour. This has allowed Salaya I to 
operate at load factors of around 65% 
during Q4 of FY2013 and will reliably 
supply around 50% of Salaya’s water 
needs until the dedicated facilities are 
completed.
Essar Energy is continuing to progress 
forest and environmental clearances for the 
two nearby coal blocks, Chakla and Ashok 
Karkata, which will supply fuel to the T ori 
plant and environmental approvals for T ori I, 
unit 2 and T ori II. Completion of the T ori 
projects is dependent on timely receipt of 
these approvals.
As announced in February 201 2, due to 
regulatory delays in the Indian power 
sector , and to ensure efficient deployment 
of capital, Essar Energy has decided to 
progress the construction of three of its 
later stage power projects at Salaya II, 
Salaya III and Navabharat I, totalling 2,970 
MW only against certain milestones. The 
total investment cost of the three projects 
is estimated to be c.US$3. 1 billion. Essar Energy plc

Sustainability
Achievements
` ` Essar Energy has signed up to the United Nations 
Global Compact principles, thus setting out a 
clear framework for all our businesses to follow.
` ` Expanded activities in communities around our 
sites, with a clear focus on education, healthcare 
and encouraging entrepreneurship.
Essar Energy believes that to 
create a successful long-term 
business, a strong focus on 
sustainability is vital, with a 
particular emphasis on the 
communities around our 
operating sites.
Essar Energy is building and operating oil 
and gas, power and exploration and 
production assets which will have lifespans 
of several decades. Therefore, it is critical 
that these assets can operate sustainably 
for a very long period, taking into account 
the needs of all stakeholders, particularly 
the people and communities in the 
neighbouring areas. 
One of the key elements of the Company’s 
strategy is therefore a strong commitment 
to being a good corporate citizen.
Indeed, to demonstrate this commitment 
to sustainability, Essar Energy became a 
signatory to the United Nations Global 
Compact principles on 2 April 2013, 
requiring us to follow a clearly defined way 
of operating across all our businesses, with 
a focus on environment, labour , anti-
corruption and human rights. We believe 
this is the best way for us to create value 
in a sustainable, long-term way.
Despite global and national challenges 
being faced by the Energy sector , we were 
able to make considerable progress in our 
economic, environmental and social 
performance last year . This section of the 
Annual Report gives a brief overview of 
Essar Energy’s sustainability performance

Case study 
Towards achieving excellence in 
energy conservation
Our sites are committed to conserving 
energy to deliver benefits such as lower 
fuel consumption, better profitability, 
environment protection, and a lower 
carbon footprint.
Our power plants at Hazira together 
implemented 23 energy saving projects 
ranging from equipment modifications 
and optimisation to technology 
upgrade resulting in an estimated 
saving of over 12 million units of 
electricity, or 3,204 million tonnes of oil 
equivalent, which equates to a saving 
of over Rs.94 million (US$1.7 million). 
The emissions reduction as a result is 
estimated to be 12,800 tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent. 
Comparing the results for the months 
where the generation was similar, we 
see a downward trend of auxiliary 
consumption.
One energy conservation initiative 
involved the energy team at the CBM 
project at Raniganj, who found a much 
more efficient way of running the large 
number of pumps required to push 
gas around the network on site. This 
resulted in an increase in power 
efficiency of nearly 10%. An estimated 
reduction of 79.56 metric tonnes of 
carbon dioxide was achieved with this 
initiative during the few months of 
FY2013 post-installation.
Amongst various energy initiatives 
implemented at the Vadinar refinery, 
one was to recover desalinated 
condensate heat to be then used to 
heat demineralised water and reduce 
cooling tower heat load. Here, 2.9 
gigacalories per hour of energy were 
saved. The project cost US$1,800, but 
savings amounted to around 
US$182,000 pa.

For the second 
successive year, Essar 
Oil was ranked the 
highest scorer in the 
Energy sector by the 
Carbon Disclosure 
Project, India.
Our people
Our employees are our biggest assets 
without whom we cannot achieve our 
business objectives. Our priorities last year 
included employee retention, succession 
planning and nurturing and growing internal 
talent. Various employee engagement 
initiatives, coupled with an enhanced focus 
on individual training needs in alignment 
with the business objectives, helped us 
to meet our objectives.
We continued to focus on effective 
management of people performances 
through a clear linkage with business 
results and motivation through appropriate 
rewards. The ‘Short-term Incentive Plan’ 
which was introduced in FY201 1 for the 
middle management of Essar Energy India 
employees was paid out at the end of 
FY2013 to consistent performers.
Health and safety
Managing the health and safety of the 
people who work for us, both directly and 
indirectly, continued to be our top priority 
last year . The focus at most of our sites was 
to enhance safety culture, contractor safety 
management, risk assessment and training. 
Although our overall safety performance 
was good and various sites won external 
recognition for their safety efforts, there 
were also key learnings from the incidents 
that occurred at our sites which we will use 
to further improve our safety processes.
Unfortunately, a road accident outside the 
process plant at the Vadinar refinery led to 
a contractor fatality in June 2012. Following 
the recommendations of the investigating 
team, the entire refinery was inspected 
and areas with any potential for similar 
accidents were identified and action taken 
to prevent future incidents.
There is a strong focus on helping stimulate 
entrepreneurship, including among women. 31

Case study 
Vadinar: – Shishu Mangalam Project 
combats malnourishment 
The World Bank estimates that India is 
ranked 2
nd
 in the world of the number 
of children suffering from malnutrition. 
The prevalence of underweight 
children in India is among the highest 
in the world, with severe 
consequences for mobility, mortality, 
productivity and economic growth.
Gujarat has a particularly high 
proportion of children in this category, 
with 44.7% of children underweight, 
22.3% of the population is 
undernourished and 6. 1% of children 
who die under the age of five do so 
from hunger. 
The Essar Foundation, in collaboration 
with the District Panchayat, Jamnagar, 
started the Shishu Mangalam Project 
during June 2012 to December 2012 
in Khambhaliya, Jamnagar. This area 
has the highest percentage in India of 
malnutrition (38%) among children 
under the age of five years. The 
project strategy was to leverage the 
existing Integrated Child Development 
Services (ICDS) structure and focus 
exclusively on raising the health and 
nutritional level of malnourished 
children below six years old and 
reducing the number of highly 
malnourished children.
A physical assessment was 
conducted to identify and grade 
the nutritional status of children. Health 
check-ups of children in yellow zones 
were carried out by medical officers 
of the primary health centre and 
those in red zones were carried out 
by paediatricians. Medical causes 
were identified and basic treatment, 
as well as referral, was ensured. 
Additionally, a high protein nutrition 
supplement was provided along with 
nutrition education. 
A third party assessment showed 
significant improvement in the 
nutritional status of children. 32 Business review

Raniganj: sight restored
Healthcare is often the most neglected 
issue in rural communities, a situation 
worsened by high levels of poverty 
and illiteracy. Paira Khatoon, pictured 
centre, an eight year old girl in Class III 
at Labnapara Free Primary School, 
who had previously been a regular 
attendee at the school, began 
struggling with her studies and 
attendance due to an eye infection 
which had been ignored by her 
parents, who assumed it was a minor 
problem. However, during one of the 
regular child health check-up camps 
conducted by Essar in government 
primary schools to cover those left out 
during similar checks in villages, the 
doctor diagnosed the girl with a severe 
eye infection. Her right eye was 
swollen, making it impossible to see, 
and was also very painful. Her parents 
were called immediately, medicine was 
prescribed, and her teachers were 
requested to ensure she was checked 
regularly by the mobile medical van 
doctor. As a result, Paira made a full 
recovery. Essar is continuing with the 
check-up camps for school children to 
ensure any similar health issues are 
addressed in a holistic way. 
Product responsibility
As an ISO 9001 certified organisation, we 
deploy stringent measures to ensure the 
quality of our products. The quality control 
assessment starts from the raw material 
stage when crude oil is unloaded through 
crude and product process streams and 
right through to ship loading. 
Our refinery at Vadinar has a fully equipped 
laboratory to certify the refinery’s range of 
products, for example LPG, kerosene, 
aviation turbine fuel/jet fuel, gasoline, 
diesel, furnace oil, bitumen, petcoke and 
vacuum gasoil. The facilities have been 
upgraded and new infrastructure built to 
house additional equipment with the 
completion of the refinery expansion. 
We also have a dedicated jet fuel testing 
laboratory approved by the Directorate 
General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance. 
The laboratory has been designed to cater 
to the jet fuel demands complying with 
BIS and DEF STAN 91. In addition, the 
laboratory has a true boiling point unit to 
predict the crude’s characteristics before it 
is processed. 
As a part of the reliability and competency 
assessment of our laboratory, the refinery 
has been participating in the International 
Proficiency T esting Programmes 
conducted by the ASTM standards body 
for various products and the gasoline and 
diesel fuel engine correlation scheme 
conducted by The Energy Institute (EI) in 
the UK. This participation has ensured our 
confidence in certifying the products 
before releasing to our customers.

Stanlow: entrepreneurship – helping 
small businesses with space to grow
ENTEP Properties is a joint venture 
between Cheshire West and Chester 
County Council and Essar Oil UK which 
aims to provide affordable industrial 
units for small businesses operating in 
the area close to the Stanlow Refinery. 
Since being established in 1983, it has 
helped numerous small businesses 
to prosper.
Gareth Williams, from Ellesmere Port, 
started his own kitchen and bathroom 
business in September 2010 after 
working for other companies for over 
15 years. Setting up as a sole trader, he 
has since employed another full time 
member of staff and has further plans 
to take on more people. 
He explained: “I learned the trade 
working for other people, but had a 
clear idea of the level of service I 
thought we should be providing to 
customers and so I was determined to 
give it a go myself. My wife was really 
important in giving me the confidence 
and backing to go out there and get it 
done. I started on my own, literally 
working out of the van for 12 months 
before moving to the Canal Bridge 
Enterprise Centre. 
“Our first few jobs gave us the capital to 
make it work and for a new business, 
we have done it without taking on debt 
from the banks. The flexibility of the 
leases available through ENTEP and 
the low rents for the units were ideal for 
me setting up on my own. 
We will soon be opening our own 
showroom above the workshop and 
have developed a website to help us 
reach a much wider customer base.”
During the year 
there was a strong 
focus in the areas of 
education, health and 
community care.
On the marketing front in India, we 
continued to develop strategic alliances 
with alternative fuel and non-fuel retail 
products to offer a more congenial and 
mutually beneficial business environment 
to our franchisees. Currently, Essar Oil has 
existing tie-ups with around 23 brands 
across segments like lubricants, agro 
products, banking and financial services, 
and food and beverage companies.
Community
The community engagement projects 
at Essar Energy’s India locations are 
undertaken through the Essar 
Foundation, which is a registered 
not-for-profit organisation under the 
Indian Trust Act, 1882. The engagement 
model is designed to deliver maximum 
value to the community in line with the 
Essar Foundation’s philosophy.
The Essar Foundation at the beginning 
of each year draws up a plan of activities 
in consultation with the sites, local 
government authorities and the 
community to ensure that the projects 
undertaken during the year have 
maximum impact on the community.
Our mission towards socio-economic 
improvement of neighbourhood 
communities is an investment for the 
future and follows an equally dedicated 
and in-depth execution approach which 
is as follows:
` ` Assessment of social structure and 
understanding the socio-economic 
and political dynamics
` ` Identification and implementation of 
projects in line with business goals 
and government programmes
` ` Third party assessment to evaluate 
the positive impact of our community 
projects.

whilst protecting our reputation and shareholder value.
related management controls. The risk 
register is formally reviewed by the Board 
on a half-yearly basis to monitor principal 
risks and the strategies deployed to 
mitigate them. Ongoing monitoring and 
management of risks takes place on a 
monthly basis at business review 
meetings where the Chief Executive 
Officer of Essar Energy discusses key 
developments and new risks arising 
within the underlying business divisions. 
Similarly, the key developments in risks 
impacting the Company at a corporate 
level are discussed at each Board 
meeting. The Audit Committee is also 
charged with monitoring effective 
implementation of controls across the 
business divisions that specifically 
impact financial risks.
Further details of the procedures 
undertaken by the Board of Essar Energy 
and its Committees are set out in the 
‘Governance Framework’ on pages 56 
to 64. 
As in any business, there may be 
unforeseen issues which could impact 
the Company’s ability to achieve its 
objectives in the future. However, we 
believe the Group’s risk management 
process makes this less likely. The key 
risks set out below are those which we 
believe have the greatest potential to 
impact our ability to achieve the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
Our approach to risk management
The overall responsibility for risk 
management, and determination of 
appetite to undertake activities subject 
to risk and uncertainty, resides with the 
Board of Essar Energy. However, given 
the nature of our business, the Boards 
of our divisions and key management 
personnel across the Company play an 
important part in managing and 
monitoring risks. 
The Company has established formal 
policies to promote an environment of 
good governance and robust risk 
management. The Board has established 
a risk register that identifies strategic risks 
together with financial, operational and 
compliance risks. The register includes 
a description of the nature, extent and 
implication of the risks together with the 
Group-wide risks
Funding requirements for future operations and growth
Description/impact
The Group operates in a capital intensive industry and has 
significant financing requirements. This requires continued 
access to commercial banking facilities, capital markets and 
maintenance of short-term working capital funding. Within the
power sector environment, at the current time fund raising 
remains challenging. The Company requires funding to cover 
the cost of overruns on certain power projects and ensure 
sufficient liquidity within the Power business.
Mitigation
` ` Historically, the Group has successfully rolled over facilities 
in line with market practice and retains good banking 
relationships.
` ` During the year the Group has successfully signed a variety 
of facilities which are outlined in the Financial review liquidity 
section on page 47 . 
` ` Essar Oil UK’s new arrangements with Barclays Bank 
allowed Essar Oil UK to repay its existing working capital 
revolving credit facility, to reduce its costs by reducing its 
crude oil inventory holdings and also permit greater 
operational flexibility. 
` ` Within Essar Power, efforts are underway to secure a facility 
for development of the Aries coal mine in Indonesia.
` ` Essar Power has secured a credit rating to raise up to 
US$909 million (Rs.50 billion) of bond finance in the domestic 
Indian markets. The proceeds of the bonds, to be raised in a 
number of tranches, will be used to prepay existing credit 
facilities on the Mahan and Salaya projects until the project 
cash flows can be fully stabilised.
` ` As set out in the capital and liquidity section on page 47 , the 
Group is also working on long-term funding arrangements 
to further strengthen liquidity and reduce interest cost. 35

Compliance with regulation and obtaining licences and permits 
Description/impact
All of the Group’ s operations are extensively regulated and 
the delivery of our strategy is dependent on obtaining the 
appropriate permits, approvals and licences to complete and 
operate our expansion projects. 
The failure to obtain or comply with the terms of such permits 
and approvals would prevent the Group from achieving its 
targets and could ultimately lead to the impairment of assets.
Mitigation
` ` The Group closely monitors compliance with regulatory 
requirements across its business, and heads of each 
business division and operations confirm compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations on a quarterly basis.
` ` The need for permits, approvals and licences for expansion 
projects is assessed prior to undertaking any works or 
investments. The ability to obtain the necessary regulatory 
approvals to successfully deliver our strategic goals on time 
is largely out of the control of our Senior Management. 
However, Essar Energy continues to have a successful 
working relationship with national, state and local authorities 
and expects to obtain all necessary approvals.
` ` To further strengthen the framework for regulatory 
compliance, the Oil and Gas and Power businesses have 
recently embarked upon the implementation of compliance 
systems which would enable key stakeholders to jointly 
review the status of key compliance requirements and 
clearances required for timely project execution. The critical 
activities and action plans including matters requiring 
management attention and decision making are reviewed 
at Project Review Meetings (PRMs).
Failure to conduct business with integrity and honesty
Description/impact
Some of the countries in which the Group operates have a 
reputation for corruption and, given that many of our contracts 
involve large sums of money, we are at risk of being accused 
of bribery and other unethical behaviour. The first and most 
important way of avoiding this risk is to ensure that people, 
both inside and outside the Group, know that Essar Energy 
does not engage in, and will not tolerate, bribery, corruption 
or unethical behaviour. 
The Company has in place a strict anti-corruption policy which 
has been rolled out across all areas of operations including the 
key decision making personnel at various sites.
Mitigation
` ` In addition, we carry out regular training of managers and 
sales people who deal in ‘at-risk’ jurisdictions and, from time to 
time, we conduct independent reviews of contract files. We 
model our compliance regime around the requirements of the 
UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Our ability to complete major projects on time and within budget
Description/impact
The Group is reliant on the completion of major projects to 
maintain its projected growth levels. In particular, there is a need 
to ensure projects are managed on time, including the delivery 
by contractors and suppliers, and within budget using efficient 
technologies to achieve the required specifications.
If projects are not executed on time and to budget, the planned 
growth and profitability of the Group will not be achieved. 
Obtaining finance for major projects is a significant challenge 
for the Group.
Mitigation
` ` Progress on all major projects is monitored on a monthly 
basis by the relevant project managers at the PRMs. Critical 
issues are also discussed at business review meetings.
` ` The Group has contracted the management and 
construction of major projects to specialist expert project 
management and EPC contractors who are related parties. 
The risk of overruns is further mitigated through entering 
turnkey contracts with these contractors and suppliers. 
` ` As the Group has successfully completed projects such

Principal risks and uncertainties
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
Description/impact
The price of feedstock, natural gas, and imported coal needed 
to run the Group’ s power operations and crude oil required for 
the production of refined petroleum products are generally 
denominated in, or tied to, the US dollar.
The Group’ s presentational currency is the US dollar while some 
of its subsidiaries have currencies other than the US dollar as their 
functional currency . Therefore, it faces translation risk to the extent
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of its subsidiaries are 
denominated in currencies other than the US dollar . Depreciation 
in the Indian Rupee against the US dollar has resulted in an 
increase in project costs of ongoing power projects.
Mitigation
` ` Each business division enters into forward foreign exchange 
contracts to cover foreign currency payments and receipts, 
as well as to manage foreign exchange risks associated 
with anticipated sales, purchase and borrowings in 
foreign currencies.
` ` The businesses monitor the level of exposure to foreign 
exchange rate fluctuations and makes recommendations 
in respect of future hedging. 
` ` As outlined in the Operating review, Essar Oil has sought, 
where possible, to dollarise its Rupee debt to reduce currency 
exposures but which will also have the effect of reducing its 
interest costs and extending repayment terms.
` ` In addition, the Group has taken forward cover of US$2,601.0 
million (2012: US$1,038.9 million) to hedge currency risk against 
movement in INR/US dollar . 
Credit risk
Description/impact
Due to the nature of the Group and its business, the Group is 
exposed to significant receivable credit risk through third party 
and related party transactions.
Mitigation
` ` All receivables, including dues from related parties, 
are monitored closely to ensure appropriate provisioning 
if required.
` ` The Group seeks to negotiate with the counterparty in 
consultation with its legal advisers and, despite the age of 
some of these receivables, does not consider these to be 
irrecoverable and over the FY2013 there has not been a 
significant change in credit quality of these debtors.
Challenging business environment
Description/impact
Within the Company’ s Oil business, product refining margins 
are under severe pressure and exposed to market volatility. 
Availability of fuel for power plants is challenging the Group’ s 
ability to operate its power plants profitably.
Mitigation
` ` Improve operating efficiencies aimed at margin 
enhancements (e.g. diversifying the crude basket and 
cross functional integration of businesses).
` ` Constantly evaluate the macro economic scenario through 
sensitivity analysis and realign the strategy to meet business 
priorities (e.g. decision to defer certain power projects until 
certain milestones are achieved).
` ` Secure alternative channels for fuel supplies.  37

Reliance on Essar Global Fund and affiliated Essar companies as major suppliers and customers 
and managing conflicts of interest
Description/impact
The Power business, in particular, is dependent on other Essar 
Group companies as major suppliers and customers. The loss of 
this relationship could have a significant impact on the Group’ s 
continued success. In addition, as the controlling shareholder, 
Essar Global Fund may have conflicting interests with the 
Company. 
Mitigation
` ` The Group has a close working relationship with Essar. 
There are also long-term contractual arrangements with 
other Essar companies to ensure the Company’s interests 
remain protected. The Group has robust processes for 
entering into transactions with affiliated companies on an 
arm’s length basis.
` ` Further information on the related party contracts as at 
31 March 2013 is outlined on pages 124 to 128 and the 
Relationship Agreement with Essar Global Fund is outlined 
on page 139.
Commercial and reputational damage as a result of a Health, Safety or Environmental incident 
or conflicts with local communities
Description/impact
The Group is at risk of commercial and reputational damage as 
a result of a health, safety or environmental incident given the 
nature of its operations. Further, relationships built with local 
communities in locations where the Company operates need 
to be maintained to avoid any operational disruptions.
The loss of confidence that any incident might create could have 
an adverse effect on the overall valuation of the Group and its 
ability to work effectively with local and national authorities.
Mitigation
` ` The Group has a formal HSE policy with related HSE 
management systems in place. These are communicated to 
the relevant businesses and employees with training 
provided on a regular basis. 
` ` Regular reviews are carried out of compliance with the HSE 
policy and related HSE management systems as well as 
adherence to regulatory requirements. The HSE Committee 
reports directly to the Board, which ultimately monitors the 
effectiveness of various policies and systems. 
` ` The results of safety and other inspections of the Company’s 
power plants and refineries are frequently reviewed by the 
Group’s senior management to assess the actions taken to 
close the gaps. 
` ` T ools are in place to monitor emissions from plants and 
refineries. Medical expertise and support is available at 
all locations.
` ` The Group works closely with local communities to maintain 
relationships and to ensure that concerns are heard and acted 
upon on a timely basis.  38 Business review

Principal risks and uncertainties
Oil and Gas business risks
Inability to achieve the planned GRMs 
Description/impact
The Oil and Gas business is dependent on the margin between 
crude oil prices and refined petroleum product prices to maintain 
profitability. Operating efficiency and access to crude oil of the 
required quantity, quality and price has a significant impact on 
the Company’ s performance. 
Whilst refined product normally tracks changes in feedstock 
prices, there is normally a lag which could seriously impact 
short-term working capital and profitability. 
Mitigation
` ` The Oil and Gas business uses long-term contracts as 
well as open international markets to source crude oil at 
competitive prices. Management prepares four month rolling 
plans on a weekly basis to identify any changes in risk profile 
and take appropriate action on a timely basis. 
` ` Essar Oil and Essar Oil UK each have a risk management 
committee which meets weekly to take decisions on 
commodity hedging.
Breach of sanctions on Iranian crude
Description/impact
Before the refinery expansion and upgrade, the Group has met 
c.33% of its overall crude requirements from Iranian suppliers. 
Recent tightening of sanctions on Iranian crude could impact 
continuity of crude supplies and consequently the achievement 
of planned GRMs.
Mitigation
` ` The Group has re-evaluated its crude procurement strategy 
in light of recent narrowing of international sanctions on 
imports of Iranian crude. 
` ` The refinery upgrade in complexity has led to an increase in 
the sourcing of ultra-heavy crudes from Latin America, thereby 
significantly reducing the refinery’s reliance on Iranian crude. 
Failure to maintain the repayment schedule of the sales tax liability 
Description/impact
As outlined previously, the Company’ s subsidiary Essar Oil 
became liable to pay back to the Government of Gujarat the 
amount of tax aggregating c.US$1,171 million. T o date, Essar Oil 
has repaid approximately US$190 million. On 13 September 
2012, Essar Oil was ordered to repay the remaining c.US$980 
million sales tax balance owed in eight quarterly instalments, 
along with interest, beginning on 2 January 2013. Essar Oil was 
also directed to pay interest from 17 January 2012 at the rate of 
10% pa on the outstanding amount due.
Essar Oil has secured a loan facility from Indian lenders of 
approximately US$949 million which can be drawn on as 
required to meet the sales tax liability.
Mitigation
` ` As at the date of publication of the FY2013 Annual Report, 
Essar Oil had paid two out of the eight quarterly instalments 
as aforesaid. The remaining six instalments will also be paid 
as and when they fall due, in line with the agreed repayment 
schedule.
` ` The Board monitors this situation in order to ensure that this 
issue is carefully managed and that the Group’s overall debt 
position is carefully monitored and that all financial covenants 
are maintained.  39

Power business risks
Coal availability and logistical challenges associated with coal transportation
Description/impact
The Group’ s Power business is significantly increasing its 
coal-fired generation capacity. Delays to the start of mining 
activities within the allocated coal blocks due to regulatory 
clearances in both India and overseas has resulted in the Group 
having to seek alternative coal sourcing arrangements with a 
potential impact on profitability.
Changes in regulatory requirements relating to coal access / 
pricing (e.g. Indonesia) have resulted in higher overall fuel costs.
The recent investigation in the Supreme Court of the allocation of 
coal blocks whilst not directly affecting the Group could have an 
impact in the long-term. 
Mitigation
` ` Essar Power continually works to secure approvals and 
clearances for the development of its coal blocks. 
` ` Essar Power has also developed road infrastructure to 
overcome the logistical challenges associated with 
transportation of coal procured through e-auction 
and imports.
` ` Further, Essar Power has set up a coal trading desk to 
manage both domestic and imported coal procurement 
across projects. The Group is proactively taking steps to seek 
enhancements in tariffs under PPAs.
` ` Essar Power continually ensures compliance with the 
conditions contained within individual licenses and is mindful 
of the importance of complying with national and local 
legislation and standards.
` ` The Group maintains an open and proactive relationship with 
the Indian Government and its various agencies.
Reliance on a few major customers
Description/impact
The Power business supplies to a small number of large 
customers under PPAs. In particular, there is a significant 
relationship with GUVNL in respect of the provision of power. 
The Company has in the past experienced payment difficulties 
for services provided to GUVNL, which if continued could have 
a significant impact on the Company’ s results. There is also an 
ongoing litigation case with GUVNL, which may result in 
financial losses. 
Mitigation
` ` The litigation with GUVNL continues to be ongoing at the date 
of this report. To date, the court rulings have been largely in 
favour of the Company and the Board consider the need for 
appropriate provisions at financial reporting period end.
` ` The Group has tight monitoring controls over receipt of 
overdue amounts from customers and litigation is 
undertaken where necessary. 
Inability to achieve tariff increases
Description/impact
The Group’ s power plants derive their revenue from the Group 
captive model, selling power to captive consumers and partly 
selling on short-term, medium-term, or long-term sale basis 
and would, for this purpose, enter into PPAs with counterparties 
such as captive consumers, power trading companies and 
state utilities. 
Contracts with customers may impose restrictions on the 
Company’ s ability to, amongst other things, increase prices 
at short notice and undertake expansion initiatives with 
other customers.
This could affect the revenue in the short to medium-term.
Mitigation
` ` Review contracts periodically to obtain best possible tariffs. 
` ` Flexibility to sell to captive consumers or in the open market. 
` ` Benchmarking captive consumer prices to state utility prices 
to benefit from any price increases. 40 Business review

Revenues – Group
Essar Energy increased revenue by US$5.3 billion in the 12 month period ended March 2013, compared to the 15 month period 
ended March 2012. Of this amount, US$3.9 billion reflected the revenue increase due to the inclusion of revenue from the Stanlow 
refinery for a full 12 months and US$1.3 billion was the increase in revenue from Vadinar refinery due to higher volumes despite 
15 months in FY2012 versus 12 months in FY2013.
Revenues – Refining and Marketing – India
R&M India revenues increased by US$1,323.0 million from US$15,245.0 million in the 15 month period to March 2012 to 
US$16,568.0 million in the 12 months to March 2013 (after eliminating inter-segmental revenues for the current period of US$51.4 
million (FY2012: nil)). This was primarily as a result of an increase in the quantity of the refinery products sold partially offset by lower 
product prices. In more detail: 
` ` US$2,464 million increase due to an increase in the quantity of refinery products sold by 2,765 KT. During FY2013, 18,878 KT 
of refinery products were sold against 16, 1 13 KT in FY2012 due to completion of Vadinar refinery expansion and optimisation 
projects in early FY2013.
` ` US$737 million decrease due to a decrease in the average selling price by US$39/MT. The average selling price of refinery 
products during FY2013 was US$852/MT against US$891/MT during FY2012.
` ` No Sales Tax Incentive Income in FY2013 compared to US$339 million in FY2012 towards sales tax deferral income.
Revenues – Refining and Marketing – UK
Stanlow refinery has contributed revenues of US$10.2 billion in the 12 months ended 31 March 2013 as compared to revenues 
of US$6.3 billion in the first eight months of ownership to 31 March 2012.  41

Revenues – Power
Power revenues increased in the 12 month period ended 31 March 2013 by US$92. 1 million to US$448.6 million from US$356.5 
million in the 15 month period ended 31 March 2012 (after eliminating inter-segmental revenues for the current period of US$44.4 
million (2012: US$60.4 million)). The increase in revenue is mainly due to the commissioning of Salaya I in FY2013, which contributed 
US$184 million, offset by Rupee depreciation of US$53 million and lower revenue from Hazira I due to lower PLF , compared to the 
15 month period ended 31 March 2012.

3 Algoma, PLF computation method has been revised and previous period figure has been restated.
4 Salaya I 12 months ended March 2013 include Unit II trial run generation of 31.1 MU.
5 Vadinar P2 and Salaya I commissioned in 2012-13, hence previous year availability and PLF not applicable.
6 Availability and PLF for Salaya I and Vadinar P2 considered from commissioning date.
7 Mahan 600 MW Unit 1 trial run generation in FY2013.
 
Operationally, with the exception of Salaya I which was commissioned during the period, all plants performed well in the 12 months 
ended 31 March 2013, with the key measure of plant availability between 97% and 100%, with the exception of Algoma which had 
an availability of 91% due to a shutdown in November 2012. Despite high gas prices and low gas availability impacting generation 
from our captive plant, generation from Salaya I and Vadinar P2 meant that overall generation from Essar Power’s portfolio in the 
12 month period was higher at 10,017 MU. This compares with 7 ,907 MU generated in the 15 months to 31 March 2012. 
Operational EBITDA
Operational EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, sales tax benefit, exceptional items 
and any non-operational items. Non-operational items represent other losses, as shown in Note 7 to the consolidated financial 
statements. This represents a change in definition of Operational EBITDA; in prior periods only some elements of other gains and 
losses were excluded from Operational EBITDA. For the sake of simplicity and clarity all such items are now excluded. The 
comparative figures have been restated accordingly. 42 Business review

The Group’s Operational EBITDA increased by US$381.3 million, or 56%, in the 12 months ended 31 March 2013 compared to  
15 months ended 31 March 2012. 
Operational EBITDA – Power 
Power’s Operational EBITDA in the 12 months ended 31 March 2013 was lower by US$41.6 million at US$224.7 million compared 
to the US$266.3 million in the 15 months ended 31 March 2012. On a 12-month comparative basis, this represented an increase of 
5%. Operational EBITDA was higher mainly due to commissioning of Vadinar P2 and a marginal contribution from Salaya I. This was 
partially offset by lower Operational EBITDA from Hazira I due to lower generation for GUVNL compared to the period ended 
31 March 2012 and depreciation of the Rupee.
Operational EBITDA – Refining and Marketing – India
R&M India Operational EBITDA increased by US$222.3 million to US$688.6 million during the 12 month period ended 31 March 
2013 in comparison to US$466.3 million in the 15 months ended 31 March 2012. Operational EBITDA is higher primarily due to 
increased GRM, including hedging gain/(loss), of US$192.3 million due to increase in margins and volumes.
Operational EBITDA – Refining and Marketing – UK 
R&M UK Operational EBITDA was US$185.0 million in FY2013. This result was a significant improvement over the first eight months 
of ownership primarily driven by improved margins in the European region and increased volumes. The results also benefited by 
US$93 million as a result of the margin enhancement programme.

Finance income recognised in the income statement 187.0 138.0 
Net finance costs (690.5) (383.9)
The total finance cost has increased by US$261.9 million primarily due to the commissioning of power projects, expansion of the 
Vadinar refinery, bridge loan for the Stanlow refinery acquisition, the write off of the unamortised cost of the working capital loan of 
Stanlow refinery and interest payable on the sales tax liability as per the Honourable Supreme Court Order offset by a US$83 million 
gain recognised on the exit of the CDR loan facility.
Net finance costs increased due to the increased interest cost of loans mentioned above, a reduction in borrowing costs capitalised 
due to the commissioning of projects, offset by an increase in interest income from the short-term deployment of surplus funds. 
Taxation 
The Group’s FY2013 effective tax rate was (7 .2)% compared with an FY2012 rate of 33.4%. The tax charge of US$1 1.8 million in 
FY2013 (FY2012: tax credit of US$383.4 million) comprises current tax income of US$15.8 million (FY2012: current tax charges of 
US$38. 1 million) and deferred tax expenses of US$27 .6 million (FY2012: deferred tax income of US$421.5 million). The current tax 
generally represents Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) payable in India. There is a current tax credit as a result of the reversal of MAT 
liability in respect of previous periods for Essar Oil Limited, India. 
The majority of profits derived from operations in India are subject to MAT. MAT is charged on book profits in India at a rate of 20.01%, 
but is available as a credit against corporate income tax in the following ten years. A deferred tax credit generally represents an asset 
created on tax losses or timing differences which are carried forward and are available to be offset against future taxable profits. 
The effective tax rate of the Group is negative since there is a tax charge even in the case of losses. This is primarily on account 
of certain losses, deferred tax assets that have not been recognised in the absence of reasonable certainty.
Other losses, net
Other losses principally relate to foreign exchange losses due to the depreciation of the Rupee against the US dollar 
of US$255.9 million (15 months to 31 March 2012: US$315.2 million).  44 Business review

1. Assets under construction include mining properties and exploration and evaluation assets. 
Property, plant and equipment have increased by 3.4% against March 2012. The increases by segment, including assets under 
construction after impact of exchange difference, are as follows:
` ` Refining and Marketing – India – US$220.5 million
` ` Refining and Marketing – UK – US$68.5 million
` ` Exploration and Production – US$204.6 million
` ` Power – US$292.9 million
The operational assets in R&M India decreased mainly due to deprecation charged during the period. Assets under construction 
have increased mainly due to expansion related activities and advances for a new township under construction. 
In the Power segment, operational assets increased mainly due to the commissioning of Vadinar P2 unit 1 and Salaya I with the 
transfer of the related assets from assets under construction to operational, offset by exchange rate variations. 
The 6% depreciation of the Rupee from March 2012 caused a reduction in property, plant and equipment of US$265.9 million, 
US$13.2 million and US$286.5 million in the Power, Exploration and Production and Refinery and Marketing – India segments 
respectively.
Other non-current assets
Other non-current assets have increased by US$96.3 million over March 2012, primarily as a result of US$159 million of receivables 
towards sales tax assignment being shown as non-current following final determination of the sales tax matter, whereas in the prior 
period such amounts were shown as current, which is partly offset by decrease in deferred tax assets created on business losses. 
Current assets
Current assets have decreased by US$44.7 million to US$6,487 .8 million from 31 March 2012, driven by the following key activities 
during the year: 
` ` Reduction in inventory held at R&M UK of US$448 million due to an agreement to buy crude oil on a real time basis from 
Barclays Bank, as a result of an inventory monetisation agreement signed in July 2012. 
` ` US$445 million net increase in inventory at R&M India due to increased capacity.
` ` A decrease in cash and cash equivalents mainly due to a US$150 million repayment to lenders as a result of refinancing the 
US$450 million loan at Essar Energy plc.
` ` Reduction in other receivables of US$159 million in relation to assigned liabilities in respect of sales tax now presented as 
non-current following the final determination of the sales tax matter.
A decrease in trade receivables by US$98 million in R&M UK and an increase in trade receivables by US$44 million in R&M India 
due to usual collection cycle of various customers. 46 Business review

Annual Report and accounts 2013
Financial review
Current liabilities 
Current liabilities have increased by US$2,681.8 million, to US$10,285.3 million from 31 March 2012, primarily due to the following:
` ` Reclassification of US$2,362.6 million of long-term debt to short-term. The Group has a number of power projects, some of 
which have recently been commissioned and others are under development. Consistent with a number of companies operating 
in the power sector in India, the Group has been impacted by project delays particularly in relation to regulatory approvals 
(including mine approvals) and other factors outside the Group’s controls. As a result, there were some instances of late 
payments of interest and principle, some breaches of financial and non-financial covenants for which waiver letters subsequent 
to 31 March 2013 but prior to the approval of the annual report have been received and all breaches as at the balance sheet date 
have subsequently been cured. IFRS makes it necessary to reclassify this debt as short-term as at 31 March 2013, but the Group 
expects this will be reclassified back to long-term going forward.
` ` US$356 million decrease due to sales tax liability presented as non-current following the order of the Supreme Court confirming 
the payment of the liability in eight equal instalments from 2 January 2013.
` ` Increase in crude creditors by US$95 million and advances from customers of US$258 million in R&M India.
` ` A decrease of US$484 million in payables in R&M UK due to the impact of the inventory monetisation arrangement whereby 
R&M UK trade payables for crude represent only 3-5 days compared to 30 days previously and payment of the deferred 
consideration of US$175 million plus interest to Shell.
` ` Net increase in short-term borrowings by US$764 million mainly due to increase in working capital loans and bills of exchange in 
R&M India.
` ` US$387 million reclassification (other than mentioned above) of non-current borrowings to current due to repayment within one 
year in R&M India.
` ` Essar Energy plc repaid US$217 million of the bridge loan.
` ` Increase in acceptances and creditors in the Power business by US$170 million due to Salaya 1 and VPCL phase 2 operational 
and construction at Mahan power plant.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities have decreased by US$1,928.0 million, representing a 31.3% decrease, from US$6, 157 .6 million at 31 March 
2012 primarily due to the following:
` ` Reclassification of non-current liabilities to current liabilities by US$2,362.6 million due to certain non-compliance of covenants.
` ` Increase of US$356 million due to the sales tax liability now being payable in eight quarterly instalment from 2 January 2013. 
` ` Increase in long-term borrowing (net of amounts transferred to current) including project buyer’s credit of US$1 12 million.

Essar Energy’s cash from operating activities decreased by US$1,262.6 million from US$1, 1 16.3 million. This was mainly due to 
reduction in trade payables, an increase in trade and other receivables and an increase in inventories. 
Net cash used in investing activities has decreased by US$2,310.3 million from US$3,321.4 million at 31 March 2012. The decrease is 
mainly due to a lower level of capital expenditure as projects are completed and acquisition of Stanlow refinery last year.
At 31 March 2013 there was net cash, cash equivalents and bank deposits of US$1 76.5 million (31 March 2012: US$436.6 million).
Capital and liquidity
Essar Energy had underlying gross debt of US$6,917 million, net debt (underlying) of US$6,7 41 million and gearing of 67% as of 
31 March 2013. At 31 March 2012, Essar Energy had gross debt of US$6,710 million, net debt (underlying) of US$6,273 million and 
gearing of 63%. The gross and net debt increased largely as a result of the Company’s continued capital expenditure programme in 
the Power and R&M India businesses. It is anticipated that the Group’s debt will continue to increase as projects are funded with 
peak debt forecast to occur in FY2014. 
On 1 July 201 1, Essar Energy entered into a US$450 million secured and guaranteed term loan. Essar Energy utilised this loan to 
enable Essar Oil UK Limited to finance the Stanlow acquisition and may also utilise the loan, amongst other things, for general 
corporate purposes. This loan was refinanced on 14 May 2012 with a new US$300 million three year secured loan facility and 
US$150 million of internal cash resources. Separately, Essar Energy also signed on the same date a US$250 million 3.5 year 
subordinated unsecured loan facility with Essar Global Limited for general corporate purposes. 
In July 2012, Essar Energy announced that R&M India has secured a new seven year credit facility with its Indian banks of up to  
c.US$949 million (Rs.50 billion) to meet the deferred sales tax liability owed to the Gujarat government and for general corporate 
purposes. 
In July 2012, Essar Energy paid the second and final instalment of the consideration due to Shell for the purchase of the Stanlow 
refinery, which was completed on 31 July 201 1. This second instalment was for US$175 million plus interest, giving a total of 
US$183.3 million, and the first instalment, which was paid on completion, was for US$175 million. 48 Business review
Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
In July 2012, R&M UK concluded crude oil and product inventory arrangements under which legal title for the inventories of crude oil 
and petroleum products at Stanlow is transferred to a counterparty who will supply crude to the refinery in line with its requirements. 
The new arrangements have allowed R&M UK to repay its previous working capital revolving credit facility. In addition, they allow 
R&M UK to reduce its costs while retaining operational flexibility. 
In September 2012, Essar Energy secured a US$150 million 4.5 year credit facility with Axis Bank with the ability, subject to 
successful syndication, to increase the facility size to US$450 million. Of the amount raised, US$67 million was utilised to repay a 
proportion of the US$300 million three year secured loan facility with the balance being available for general corporate purposes. 
In March 2013, R&M India completed the process for exiting the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) mechanism which was 
implemented in December 2004 to help cover the construction of its Vadinar refinery in Gujarat. The CDR loan facility was replaced 
with a new debt facility of about c.US$1.65 billion (Rs.91.00 billion) on commercial terms from a similar group of lenders. 
The CDR exit now allows R&M India to refinance its expensive Rupee debt with lower cost US dollar loans to lower interest costs 
and improve cash flows and profitability (see below). 
Essar Energy and its subsidiaries, continue to explore ways to reduce interest costs and extend debt repayment profiles to improve 
the cash flow position of the Group. In this respect, the Group is currently engaged with a variety of lenders and financial institutions. 
Plans include:
` ` Dollarisation of R&M India’s debt
 In order to reduce interest costs, reduce currency risk and extend repayment maturities to better match the Vadinar refinery’s 
asset life, R&M India is looking to refinance the majority of its Rupee loans to US dollars.
 R&M India has already refinanced Rs.26. 1 1 billion of Rupee loans into equivalent foreign currency debt of c.US$481 million 
through the use of external commercial borrowings and by swapping Rupee loans into US dollars, and is looking to refinance 
further Rs.86.85 billion into equivalent foreign currency debt of c.US$1.6 billion.
 R&M India is also in active discussions with other lenders for an export securitisation transaction for around US$900 million. 
In addition, R&M India, continues to undertake currency swaps with Indian banks to reduce interest costs.
` ` Issue of Indian rated Bonds in Power business
 In October 2012, Power was assigned a credit rating of A+ by ratings agency Credit Analysis and Research Ltd (CARE), of 
Mumbai, in respect of a proposed Rs.50 billion (c.US$909 million) bond issue to be raised in a number of tranches. 
 In May 2013, the Power business successfully raised Rs.6.29 billion (c.US$1 14 million) of bonds and had received sanction letters 
for the full Rs.50 billion (c.US$909 million).
 The Power business is progressing well with the relevant financial institutions to complete this transaction. 
 The proceeds from these bonds will be used primarily to make repayments on existing loan facilities within the power business, 
including those for our new coal fired power projects, and for general corporate purposes and will allow our power business to 
benefit from longer debt maturity profiles and lower interest rates compared to our existing debt facilities.
` ` Refinancing of Essar Energy debt
 Essar Energy is seeking to refinance existing bank facilities with new larger and longer maturity facilities.
 In addition to the current ongoing syndication of the Axis Bank facility to US$450 million mentioned above, Essar Energy has also 
signed a memorandum of understanding with the China Development Bank and PetroChina which contemplates a corporate 
loan facility of up to US$1 billion with a tenor of seven to ten years. The parties are currently undertaking due diligence in respect 
of this transaction. 
 The proceeds of the transaction will be utilised for the repayment of Essar Energy’s current bank debt and for general corporate 
purposes.
` ` Free float requirements
 Essar Energy also plans to increase its free float to a minimum of 25% to maintain its inclusion in the FTSE UK Index Series. 
To achieve this, Essar Energy’s Board has approved the issuance of new shares at a time to be determined between now and 
March 2014.
Essar Energy will continue to update the market as it progresses with these initiatives.

Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Going Concern 
The Group monitors and manages closely its liquidity risk. In assessing the Group’s going concern status, the Directors have taken 
account of the financial position of the Group, anticipated future trading performance, its bank and other facilities, its capital 
investment plans, forecast of gross refining margins and the likelihood of any material adverse legal judgments.
The Group has prepared detailed annual business plans and forecasts covering the period to 30 June 2014. These business plans 
and forecasts were used as the basis for assessing the Group’s cash headroom and compliance with banking covenants. The 
Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group is 
dependent on the availability of existing loan facilities together with new facilities and arrangements which are being negotiated but 
have not yet been committed.
As further set out in the capital and liquidity section of the Financial review, the Group is progressing well in establishing loan facilities, 
including refinancing facilities and other arrangements with a variety of lenders and financial institutions to ensure that the Group has 
adequate liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due and to improve the Group’s liquidity position significantly. In addition, whilst 
breaches of certain covenants in some debt facilities have occurred both during the financial year to 31 March 2013 and 
subsequently, no loans have been recalled and the Group has continued to cure such breaches and obtain waivers from the 
financial institutions.
The facilities under discussion far exceed the Group’s current financing needs. Further, in respect of several of these facilities, which 
would meet the Group’s forecast needs, the Group has secured written confirmation from the proposed lenders that such lender is 
confident that the relevant facility will be made available. However until these facilities are committed, there is a risk that they may not 
ultimately be available. 
The Directors have examined all available evidence and have concluded that in light of the supportive nature of the relationships 
held with the lenders and financial institutions, the assurances received from the lenders and the current stage of negotiations, the 
Directors are satisfied that adequate financial resources will continue to be made available to the Group and Company so as to 
enable it to continue to trade on a going concern basis. As a result, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Group and Company’s financial statements. 50 Governance

Governance framework
“As Company Secretary, 
I manage the provision 
of timely, accurate and 
considered information to the 
Board and ensure the Board 
maintains its awareness of 
the ever-changing corporate 
governance environment.”
Frances McCaw 
Company Secretary
23 June 2013
The Board is responsible for setting the strategic direction 
of Essar Energy and for ensuring the necessary financial and 
human resources are in place to achieve its goals. In February 
and September each year the Senior Management team 
presents the proposed strategy to the Board. This provides an 
opportunity for the Board to critically review the strategy with 
management. The budget discussion, also in February, is 
essential for ensuring that the right resources are in place to 
deliver the agreed strategy and the annual business plan. In 
addition, the Board regularly reviews the framework for the 
Company’s finance, banking and authority guidelines. 
As Company Secretary, I manage the provision of timely, 
accurate and considered information to the Board and 
ensure the Board maintains its awareness of the ever-changing 
corporate governance environment. These last few years have 
been challenging in corporate governance terms with the 
numerous reviews and consultations aimed at examining and 
improving remuneration disclosures, corporate governance 
arrangements and, of course, the issue of Board diversity. 
The Board recognises the importance of diversity and that it 
is a much wider issue than gender. The Board agrees that its 
members should collectively possess the broad range of skills, 
expertise and industry knowledge, and business and other 
experience necessary for the effective oversight of the Group’s 
business. The Board also believes in the value and importance 
of diversity throughout the Group, but does not consider it 
appropriate or in the interests of the Company or its 
shareholders to set prescriptive, quantitative diversity targets. 57

The balance and independence of the Board
Governance of the Company
The Company complies with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’) published by the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) in June 2010 which applies to all premium 
listed companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. The 
Code can be found on the FRC’s website. The Board intends 
to report against the revised Code published in September 
2012 in its 2014 Annual Report.
During the 12 months ended 31 March 2013, the Company 
has complied with the Code in all respects, save that in respect 
of Code Provision A.3. 1. Prashant Ruia did not meet the 
independence criteria set out in the Code on his appointment 
as Chairman due to his involvement with Essar Group. The 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive 
Officer considered Prashant Ruia to be best placed to take over 
the role of Chairman when Ravi Ruia stepped down in 201 1, due 
to the depth and breadth of his knowledge of the Company and 
its strategy, business activities and operations.
The Board is the decision making body for all matters 
material to the Company’s finances, strategy and reputation. 
It is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the 
Company and has ultimate responsibility for the management, 
direction and performance of the Group and its businesses. 
The Board is required to exercise objective judgement on all 
corporate matters and is accountable to shareholders for the 
proper conduct of the business.  58 Governance

How the Board operates
Philip Aiken is the Senior Independent Director and is available 
to address shareholders’ concerns that have not been resolved 
through the normal channels of communication with the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or 
in cases when such communications would be inappropriate.
There is a clear division between the roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer and a written statement of their 
responsibilities has been approved by the Board. The 
Chairman is responsible for the operation, leadership and 
governance of the Board and for ensuring its effectiveness and 
setting its agenda. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible 
for guiding the implementation of Board strategy and policy 
with respect to the Group’s business, with the assistance of the 
Senior Management team.
The Board holds at least four scheduled Board meetings a 
year and in addition meets on an ad hoc basis in response 
to business needs. Generally, the meetings of the Board and 
Board Committees are held at the Essar Energy Head Office in 
Mauritius. During the period, there were four scheduled Board 
meetings (two of which were held over two days) and two ad 
hoc meetings. A table of attendance of members of the Board 
and Board Committees at meetings held during the period is 
set out below.
In addition to the four scheduled meetings of the Board during 
the year, two further meetings were held which focused solely 
on a review of the Company’s strategy.

Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
The Directors receive appropriate briefing papers on 
substantive items, which are, in general, circulated at least a 
week before the relevant Board meeting to give the Directors 
adequate time to prepare for the meeting and to enable any 
Director who is unable to attend the meeting to have an 
opportunity to review the matters to be discussed and, if 
necessary, to provide comments to the Chairman in advance 
of the meeting. The Directors also receive monthly updates on 
key matters relating to the business operations, project 
updates, financial information, legal and corporate governance, 
tax and investor relations. The Directors also receive other ad 
hoc updates between Board meetings. All Directors have the 
right to have their concerns about the running of the Company, 
or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, recorded in 
the minutes.
During the period, the Non-Executive Directors have met 
without the Executive Director being present.
All new Directors receive a comprehensive induction upon 
appointment to the Board. Programmes of continuing 
professional development are arranged, as required, taking into 
account the individual qualifications and experience of the 
Director. The Chairman is responsible for ensuring induction and 
training programmes are provided and the Company Secretary 
is tasked with organising and reviewing such programmes each 
year. Individual Directors, with the support of the Company 
Secretary, are also expected to take responsibility for identifying 
their own training needs and to ensure that they are adequately 
informed about the Group and their responsibilities as a Director. 
All of the Directors have received a comprehensive briefing on 
their duties and responsibilities as Directors of a UK, listed 
company by the Company or its advisors. Further briefings and 
updates on key regulation, industry practices and other matters 
relating to the business were provided at Board meetings during 
the period to ensure that the Directors were kept informed of 
relevant developments. A number of the Directors attended site 
visits during the period including Vadinar and Raniganj in India 
and Stanlow in the UK.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring compliance with Board procedures. Both appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary are a matter for the 
Board as a whole. All Directors also have access to other 
members of the Senior Management team and to the Group’s 
professional advisors whom they can consult at the Company’s 
expense should they consider this necessary in order to better 
discharge their responsibilities. 
In compliance with the Code, all of the Directors offer 
themselves for annual re-election by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
Performance evaluation
In line with its stated intent in last year’s Annual Report, a 
full Board evaluation facilitated by an independent external 
consultant, Armstrong Bonham Carter, was undertaken in late 
2012/early 2013. The process was carefully structured but 
pragmatic, tailored to bring about a genuine debate of issues 
that are relevant, aiming to assist in identifying any potential for 
improvement in the Company’s processes. It entailed the 
completion of detailed questionnaires on the performance of the 
Board, its Committees and its Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors by each Director and was followed by one-to-one 
interviews between the external consultant and each Director 
and the preparation by the external consultant of a composite 
written report. The Non-Executive Directors met as part of the 
performance review without the Chairman to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance. The SID subsequently discussed the 
outcome of the review with the Chairman. The results of the 
performance evaluation report were presented and discussed at 
the February 2013 Board meeting. The evaluation concluded 
that the Board and its Committees continue to operate 
effectively and each Director is contributing effectively and 
demonstrates commitment to his role, however there were 
certain areas identified for improvement in relation to a greater 
focus by the Board on risk oversight and strategy and the need 
for the Board to consider greater diversity in its number. The 
Board has taken steps during the year to address the areas 
identified for improvement by receiving more detailed, regular 
reports from the Audit Committee on the Group’s key risks, in 
advance of the Board’s annual review of internal control and risk 
management, and a greater focus on monitoring the strategic 
issues and the challenges facing the Indian energy market. The 
other performance evaluation outcomes and action plan items 
are set out in detail below:
Observations Action to be taken
Build on and improve oversight 
of the main risks affecting the 
Group
Provision of additional materials 
as necessary to the Board and 
increased discussion at Board 
meetings.
Improve the meeting process, 
including the papers to the 
Board
Senior Management team to 
review the processes in place 
for the preparation of Board 
papers and Board agendas 
reviewed to ensure sufficient 
time is given for Board 
discussion.
Improve the visibility of 
the Board to the Group’s 
employees
Increase the number of ad hoc 
site visits by Board members.
Improve the longer term target 
setting and monitoring of the 
Group’s financial performance 
and strategy
The Board to agree longer term 
financial targets.
Improve performance 
measurement indicators
Senior Management team to 
review the provision of financial 
and non-financial performance 
indicators.
The management of conflicts of interest
Directors are required to demonstrate unquestioned honesty 
and integrity, a willingness to question, challenge and critique, 
and a desire to understand and commit to the highest 
standards of governance. Each Director must ensure that no 
decision or action is taken that places his interests in front of 
the interests of the business. Decisions of the Board are made 
collectively by means of open and constructive debate where 
each Board member is free to question or challenge the 
opinions of others.
The Company operates a process whereby each Board 
member is required to disclose any actual or potential conflicts 
of interest and each of the Directors are aware of the need 
to notify the Company of any potential conflicts of interest. 
Directors’ declarations of interests form a standard item on 
the agenda for each Board meeting. Potential conflicts are 
considered and, if appropriate, approved and noted with 
any conflicted Director not voting on the matter. Given their 
involvement with Essar Group, both the Chairman and Ravi 
Ruia on a number of occasions excluded themselves from

Governance framework continued
The Senior Management team and the Board review monthly 
management reports on the financial results and key operating 
statistics, together with a brief written explanation of significant 
variances or operational matters. The management reports are 
presented by the respective accountable individuals in each 
business who provide further explanations as required. 
The individual businesses monitor the progress of the expansion 
projects through regular project management review meetings 
to review progress and escalate issues to the Chief Executive 
Officer, with any major issues reported to the Board.
Non-financial controls 
Emphasis is placed on the quality and abilities of the Group’s 
employees, with structured evaluation processes and access 
to a variety of online, internally and externally provided learning 
and development tools. This is provided through a shared 
service agreement with the Essar Group Human Resources 
function that was agreed as part of the listing process and 
enables the seamless transition of employee development. 
The President of Human Resources in the Essar Group is 
invited to attend Remuneration Committee meetings.
The acquisition of any business requires a rigorous analysis of 
the financial implications of the acquisition and key performance 
figures. A sensitivity analysis takes place of the key assumptions 
made in the analysis with formal presentations to the Board.
The Board are provided with regular updates on any significant 
legal actions involving Group companies, which provides a 
background to the case and its current status within the 
appropriate legal system.
Senior Management team 
The Senior Management team monitors implementation of 
the Company’s strategy, progress against agreed plans and 
operational matters to ensure the Board’s strategic directions 
are implemented. The Senior Management team comprises 
the Chief Executives of the business groups, the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Director of Investor Relations and 
Communications.
Monitoring and review activities 
A number of processes are in place for monitoring the system of 
internal control and reporting any significant control failings or 
weaknesses together with details of corrective action, and the 
Directors of each business division are required to certify on an 
annual basis the operation of their control systems and to 
highlight any weaknesses.
The internal audit function reports directly to the Audit 
Committee and has prepared a risk-based audit plan agreed 
with the Audit Committee and undertaken a number of audits 
based on that plan. The Group has also formed a management 
audit committee within each significant business area of 
operation that meets on a quarterly basis. These meetings, 
chaired by the Chief Executive Officers of the respective 
businesses, review the results of internal audit reports and follow 
up actions to assess the overall robustness of the control 
environment. At these meetings functional/departmental heads 
are also invited to provide clarifications and explanations on the 
audit findings and action plans. The meetings also provide an 
opportunity for the internal audit team to report on their activities 
directly to management to ensure actions are taking place and 
highlight any remedial actions necessary. Additionally, the Head 
of Internal Audit also meets separately with the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee at least once every quarter either in person or 
through a teleconference.
Internal control 
The Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer consider that any controls and procedures, 
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the 
desired control objectives. The Group’s management is 
required to apply judgement in evaluating the risks facing the 
Group in achieving its objectives, in determining the risks that 
are considered acceptable to bear, in assessing the likelihood 
of the risks concerned materialising, in identifying the 
Company’s ability to reduce the incidence and impact on the 
business of risks that do materialise and in ensuring the costs 
of operating particular controls are proportionate to the benefit. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management and has delegated to the 
Audit Committee its responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness 
of these controls. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group maintains a register of key controls and procedures 
which is reviewed and updated annually. As part of its risk-based 
internal audit plan, the Group Internal Audit function continually 
assesses the control environment to provide assurance on the 
design and operating effectiveness of the controls. 
Control structure 
The Board sets the policy on internal control that is 
implemented by management. This is achieved through a 
clearly defined operating structure with lines of responsibility 
and delegated authority. 
The policy set by the Board is formally documented in the 
Group Governance and Administration Manual (the ‘Manual’) 
which clearly defines the limits of delegated authority and 
provides a framework for management to deal with areas of 
significant business risk.
The Manual confirms a code of conduct that applies to 
all areas of the business and covers a requirement for all 
employees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in 
the territories in which the Group operates. At operational level 
this code of conduct is covered through the detailed human 
resource policies that are available on the Group’s intranet.
The Board also approves individual policies covering areas that 
are identified as key for the Board to monitor. For example, a 
policy on the process for entering into and reporting related 
party transactions has been approved and circulated 
throughout the Group with individual briefings to the key 
individuals responsible for managing the process. 
These policies and procedures are reviewed and, where 
necessary, updated by the Board on a regular basis.
Financial controls 
The Group’s operating procedures include appropriate 
systems for reporting information to the Directors. These 
procedures are business dependent but all significant 
operational businesses use SAP general ledger systems 
with automated controls and reconciliation processes.
Budgets are prepared by the management of the respective 
business groups and subject to review by the Chief Executive 
Officer and then the Directors. The approved budgets are then 
used as the basis for controlling expenditure, with approval levels 
varying based on whether an item is within or exceeds budget. 63

To create enterprise-wide awareness and improve 
understanding of the anti-corruption policies and procedures 
across all levels of employment, the Group utilises various 
channels of information and communication technologies, 
including an online competency evaluation tool on awareness, 
face-to-face training sessions such as leadership programmes, 
train the trainers programmes, awareness programmes, 
e-news alerts and road-shows. In addition, the Group ensures 
that all third parties are engaged following proper due diligence 
and that all contracts signed by the Group incorporate 
appropriate anti-corruption clauses, according to the relevant 
risk, in order to safeguard the interests of the Group.
 
Compliance reporting systems have also been implemented to 
regularly monitor and track compliance with these policies and 
procedures at all levels of the Group. The Group undertakes 
continuous review of its policies and procedures and continues 
to improve these to ensure that they are adequate and meet 
the requirements of applicable anti-corruption and bribery laws. 
The Company’s internal audit programme also monitors 
implementation of the policies, procedures and systems in 
relation to anti-corruption and bribery to ensure that strategies 
are effectively implemented across the Group.
Review of effectiveness
In reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls the Board has, through the Management Audit 
Committees at each of the main operating subsidiaries and the 
Audit Committee, taken account of the matters summarised 
above. Where significant failings or weaknesses are identified, 
the Audit Committee ensures that these are appropriately dealt 
with by executive management, who report back to the Audit 
Committee as appropriate. The Board considers that these 
matters provide the key building blocks for an assessment of 
the control environment and that the measures that have been 
implemented are appropriate to the Group. The Board is 
committed to building on these measures through the 
execution of the internal audit programme and the continued 
review by the various Management Audit Committees and 
Audit Committee.
Internal audit is an independent review and support function 
whose primary role is to provide an objective evaluation of 
operations, information and control systems that the Company 
has put in place, primarily to the Audit Committee but also as a 
service to management. It provides analysis, recommendations, 
counsel, and information concerning the activities examined and 
provides assurance as well as guidance on the development of 
effective and efficient controls with respect to process integrity, 
accuracy in reporting and compliance with policies and 
regulation. As part of this service to management the Head 
of Internal Audit meets quarterly with the management of each 
of the respective business groups, as well as the Senior 
Management of the Company, as part of a management audit 
committee to appraise Senior Management about important 
audit issues and the steps taken by management to address 
control gaps. 
Within each business area, detailed risk registers are maintained 
which provide information regarding the various risks within the 
business. Within each business area, there is a designated Risk 
Officer who works closely with the Head of Internal Audit to 
compile the half yearly and annual risk update report that is 
presented and reviewed by the Audit Committee. Material 
changes are reported to the Audit Committee. Significant risks 
and their mitigating actions along with any remedial actions are 
monitored by the Senior Management and subsequently 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board. 
Reports from the external auditor, Deloitte LLP , on certain 
internal controls and relevant financial reporting matters, are 
presented to the Audit Committee and management. 
A whistleblowing hotline provides arrangements by which staff 
may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or other matters. Staff may raise 
concerns in either English or the local language using a hotline 
phone number or by sending an email or letter to addresses 
especially created for the purpose. Regular updates on the 
whistleblowing hotline are provided to the Audit Committee by 
respective Management Audit Committees. The Company’s 
whistleblowing policy is available on the Company’s website.
Anti-corruption and bribery 
Essar Energy is committed to ensuring that its strategy, 
business and operations are built around a culture of ethical 
business practice at all levels within the Company. Since the 
UK Bribery Act 2010 came into force, the Company has carried 
out comprehensive risk assessment and developed and 
strengthened its policies and systems/procedures relating to 
anti-corruption and bribery in line with the UK Bribery Act. 
Our anti-corruption policy is fundamental to this.
 
The Group has implemented extensive measures to ensure 
that the Group, all its subsidiaries, branches, divisions and 
controlled affiliated companies and all of its employees comply 
with the Company’s anti-corruption policies and procedures. 
All employees of the Company, including Senior Management, 
are subject to ongoing communications and training to build 
awareness of its anti-corruption and bribery policies and 
procedures. The policies and procedures contain requirements 
in relation to i) the conduct of employees; ii) arrangements 
pertaining to political contributions, charitable donations, gifts, 
hospitality, entertainment and sponsored travel and retaining 
third parties; and iii) prohibition of facilitation payments.

Auditors
The Audit Committee oversees the relationship with the 
external auditor, Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’). Auditor objectivity 
and independence is safeguarded through a variety of 
mechanisms. To ensure the auditor’s independence, the 
Committee annually reviews the Company’s relationship with 
Deloitte. The Company has various policies in place which aim 
to safeguard the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor. This includes policies in respect of the potential 
employment of former auditors, the types of non-audit services 
which the external auditors may and may not provide to the 
Group, and the approval process in respect of permitted 
non-audit services. In addition to the approval process for 
specific non-audit services, the Audit Committee monitors the 
total level of non-audit services to ensure that neither the 
objectivity nor independence of the auditor is at risk. Following 
the review in 2012, the Company concluded that it continues 
to have an objective and professional relationship with Deloitte 
and that there are sufficient controls and processes in place 
to ensure the required level of independence. In addition, the 
auditor is required to review and confirm its independence 
to the Committee on a regular basis. When considering the 
reappointment of the Company’s external auditor before 
making a recommendation to the Board to be put to 
shareholders, the Committee reviews and monitors the 
external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit process. Accordingly, the 
Committee recommends the reappointment of Deloitte at 
the forthcoming AGM.
Non-audit fee work conducted by Deloitte over the past 
year for assurance services (27%) and taxation services (1%) 
amounted to 28% of the total fees including audit fees. The 
Committee considers that the level and nature of non-audit 
work does not compromise the independence of the 
external auditors.
Fees payable to Deloitte in respect of audit and assurance 
services of US$3,023,000 (2012: US$4,301,000) in respect of 
the financial year 2012 were approved by the Audit Committee.
The Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will be held on Friday 30 August 2013. 
Separate resolutions on substantially separate issues will be 
put to the AGM and proxy forms will allow shareholders to vote 
for, against or withhold a vote on a resolution. Details of the 
proxy votes counted will be announced at the meeting and on 
the Company’s website after the meeting. The Chairman of the 
Board and the Chairmen of each of the Board Committees will 
be available to answer questions put forward to them by 
shareholders of the Company. The 2013 Annual Report and 
the Notice of the AGM will be sent to shareholders at least 
20 working days prior to the date of the meeting.

Relations with investors
The Company is committed to the promotion of investor 
confidence by ensuring that trade in its securities takes place 
in an efficient, competitive and informed market. The Board is 
keenly aware of the importance of forthright communication 
as key to building shareholder value and of the importance of 
developing a dialogue with shareholders to ensure that the 
Board keeps abreast of and understands the views and 
opinions of shareholders.
It has achieved this during the period in a number of ways 
including:
` ` ensuring that all material information on the Company is 
broadly disseminated to investors, analysts and the media 
and that this information is available on the Company’s 
website at www.essarenergy.com. Distribution of 
information is via the UK’s regulatory news service, via email 
to the Company’s extensive contact database and through 
an email alert system on the Company’s website;
` ` the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Director of Investor Relations and Communications regularly 
meet institutional shareholders, potential investors and 
analysts either individually or as part of Group meetings;
` ` holding presentations or conference calls with investors and 
analysts at the time of announcements of quarterly Interim 
Management Statements and financial results or other 
major news. Historical web-casts of half and full year 
financial results announcements are held on the Company’s 
website for a minimum of 12 months;
` ` regularly providing investor relations update reports 
describing investor and analyst opinions to the Board;
` ` arranging site visits for investors and analysts in order to 
provide more detailed knowledge of the Essar Energy 
Group. During the 12 months ended 31 March 2013, one 
site visit was organised in India for investors and analysts 
which included presentations by the business teams, copies 
of which are available on the Company’s website; and
` ` ensuring that relevant and up-to-date information on the 
Company and its operations, together with press releases 
and financial results and Annual Reports are available on the 
Company’s website.
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 which allow the Company’s website to 
be used as the primary means of communicating with those 
shareholders who have not specifically requested hard copy 
documentation. The Shareholder information section of this 
Report on page 144 contains further details on electronic 
communications with shareholders. 
The Board regards the Company’s AGM as a valuable 
opportunity to communicate with the Company’s investors and 
to address shareholders’ questions. In addition, the Directors 
generally make themselves available before and after the formal 
meeting to talk informally to shareholders. 
The Company’s Director of Investor Relations and 
Communications, Mark Lidiard, is based in the London office

Summary of key decisions in the year
The Committee continually reviews the senior executive 
remuneration policy to ensure it drives and enhances 
performance in a fair and responsible manner and rewards 
contributions to the continuing success of the Group.
Following a review of the policy at the end of the 2012–13 
financial year, the Committee’s most recent conclusions are 
as follows:
The Committee acknowledges the fact that variable pay as 
a proportion of total compensation for the Chief Executive 
Officer is relatively low when compared to the FTSE 250. 
Fixed compensation (base salary and pension) for the Chief 
Executive Officer represents approximately 70% of total 
compensation and variable pay of approximately 30% (for 
achieving target performance). The Committee will be taking 
steps to increase the bias toward performance-related pay, 
without increasing total remuneration to above market levels, 
as and when the opportunity arises.
The Committee has also reviewed the provision of long-term 
incentives. Whilst it has decided not to change the current share 
option plan it will keep this under review on an ongoing basis. 
The Committee believes that the remuneration policy continues 
to incentivise the delivery of strong yet sustainable financial 
results and the creation of shareholder value.
I hope that you will find this report clear and informative and 
I welcome any feedback you may have.
Subhas Lallah
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
At the beginning of 2012, the UK Government’s Department for 
Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) announced a series of 
executive remuneration reforms for consultation. The principal 
drivers were ‘pay for performance, not failure’, improving 
transparency (in particular the link between remuneration and 
the Company’s strategy) and an increased ability for 
shareholders to hold companies to account in respect of 
executive pay. 
In response to the UK Government’s proposed new legislation 
regarding the reporting of Directors’ remuneration, the 
Remuneration Committee has agreed to adopt a number of 
these changes early (the new legislation will not apply to the 
Company until next year). This report has therefore been 
divided into the following two sections:
Remuneration policy report: which includes a forward-
looking report detailing our current remuneration policy and 
that proposed for 2013 onwards; and
Implementation report: which sets out what has been paid 
and awarded/vested in the year under review.
We will be seeking your support for each part of the report by 
way of a single advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM on 
30 August 2013.
Performance and reward
The APLI payment for the Chief Executive Officer (expressed 
as a percentage of base salary earned during the year) is 
shown below reflecting the outcomes against the various 
performance elements described above:
EBITDA 6%
Profit before tax 6%
Gross refining margin 5%
Other strategic objectives 83%
Total 100%
Maximum bonus* 45%
Actual bonus 35.8%
*  Maximum bonus opportunity for element. 
‘Other strategic objectives’ for the Chief Executive Officer 
included actions to improve the Group’s funding base, 
completing major capital projects, ramping up and stabilising 
these projects and continuing to operate sustainably and 
optimise all of our operations, risk management and 
succession management. 
None of the APLI earned for FY2013 has been deferred into 
shares/options. 
The APLI amounts are shown in the table on page 71.

Introduction
This report is made by the Board on the recommendation of 
the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’). The first part 
of the report sets out the remuneration policy, while the second 
part details the remuneration and share plan interests of the 
Directors for the year ended 31 March 2013. The Directors 
confirm that this Report has been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and reflects the provisions of 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 
30 August 2013 asking them to approve this report.
Remuneration policy summary
The Company’s policy is to ensure that the Board and key 
management personnel are fairly rewarded with regard to 
responsibilities undertaken, taking into account appropriate 
market practice.
Corporate and individual performance is taken into account 
in setting the pay level for the Chief Executive Officer, and is 
reviewed on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate.
In determining executive remuneration, the Committee takes 
into account pay and employment conditions in place across 
the wider workforce of the Group.
Total rewards guiding principles:
The pay framework is designed to support the Company’s 
strategy and to be:
` ` simple and understandable;
` ` transparent and easily communicated;
` ` competitive with the relevant external market;
` ` attractive to participants; and
` ` strategically and culturally aligned.
Pay for performance
There is a clear link between Company performance and the 
pay that can be earned by the Chief Executive Officer:
` ` Plans allow for differentiation based on performance.
` ` Plans are linked to overall Group performance.
The expected performance measures are communicated at the 
beginning of the performance period and are linked to both the 
Company’s annual business plan and the longer-term strategic 
objectives of the Group. The measures are also evaluated by the 
Committee at the end of the period.
Annual bonus measures include profits and cost management 
targets as well as broader measures of performance to 
support the Company’s culture including compliance and 
stakeholder relations.
Long-term incentives can only be exercised if earnings grow 
above the three year target and only have value if the share 
price rises above the exercise price.
Proportion of total pay that is fixed/variable
The Committee aims to maintain an appropriate balance 
between fixed and performance-related remuneration and 
between elements linked to financial performance and 
long-term shareholder value creation. However it is conscious 
that the current balance of remuneration differs from the 
market norm when compared to the FTSE 250 and will be 
taking steps to address this as the opportunity arises. Fixed 
compensation (base salary and pension) for the Chief 
Executive Officer currently represents approximately 70% of 
total compensation and variable pay of approximately 30% 
(for achieving target performance). 67

Remuneration report continued
The Committee is satisfied that the combination of an EPS and 
share price hurdle (intrinsic in the market value option structure) 
provides an appropriate balance between: (i) incentivising and 
rewarding strong financial performance; and (ii) providing a 
strong and direct alignment with the interests of shareholders 
by rewarding share price growth. 
Pension
The Group does not offer a defined benefit pension 
scheme and instead offers the Chief Executive Officer a cash 
supplement in lieu of pension equivalent to 10% of base salary.
Executive Director’s service contract 
The Group’s policy is that Executive Directors should be 
employed on a rolling term, with a notice period not exceeding 
six months and that in the event of early termination, they 
should be treated fairly but paid no more than is necessary. 
It is the Company’s policy that there should be no element of 
reward for failure.
The following table shows details of the service contract for the 
Chief Executive Officer (the only Executive Director serving 
since IPO):
Director
Date of current 
service contract
Notice 
period
Naresh Nayyar 6 April 2010 Six months
The Company has the ability to terminate the agreement by the 
payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice equal to the salary and 
other contractual benefits, excluding bonus, payable for any 
unexpired portion of the notice period.
The amount of annual bonus payable upon termination of 
employment in any circumstances, other than for change in 
control, is at the discretion of the Committee and is capped at 
the maximum target level.
How are shareholders’ views taken into account?
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received 
at the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder 
representative bodies more generally. This feedback, plus any 
additional feedback received during any meetings from time 
to time, is then considered as part of the Company’s annual 
review of remuneration policy. In the event that any changes 
are being proposed to remuneration policy in the future an 
investor consultation would be organised.
Outside appointments
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept appropriate 
outside commercial Non-Executive Director appointments 
provided the aggregate commitment is compatible with their 
duties as Executive Directors. Such Executive Directors may 
retain fees paid for these services, which will be subject to 
approval by the Board. No Non-Executive Directorships were 
held by the Chief Executive Officer during the year.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors terms of 
appointment
The Group’s policy is to appoint Non-Executive Directors to the 
Board with a breadth of skills and experience that is relevant to 
the Group’s business. Appointments are made by the Board 
upon the recommendations and advice of the Nominations 
and Governance Committee. It is the Board’s policy for 
Non-Executive Directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects 
the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and is 
sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge 
and experience. 
The key components of the remuneration policy are set out in 
further detail below.
Detailed remuneration policy
Base salary and benefits
Base salary is determined annually by reference to an 
individual’s skills and experience, the context of the relevant 
market, individual performance, scope, size and complexity of 
role and pay and employment conditions across the wider 
workforce. The Committee reviews periodically base salary 
levels within similarly sized listed companies although the 
Committee is careful not to place excessive reliance on the use 
of external comparator analysis. The Chief Executive Officer’s 
current base salary level is presented below:
From 1 April 
2012
From 1 April 
2013
Naresh Nayyar Chief Executive Officer £846,813
No 
change
Benefits relate to health insurance for individuals and family 
through InterGlobal Ltd.
Annual Incentives
The Committee operated an Annual Performance Linked 
Incentive (APLI) scheme during 2012–13. The on-target level 
was set at 33.3% of salary and the maximum payment was set 
at 45% of base salary. Performance targets were based on a 
range of financial and non-financial, corporate and individual 
performance, including asset operating performance, business 
financial performance, health and safety performance and the 
skills needed to run such a complex organisation including 
execution of a major capital expenditure programme across 
the Company’s Refining and Marketing and Power businesses. 
Details of actual amounts paid to the Chief Executive Officer for 
the year ended 31 March 2013 can be found on page 71.
In accordance with Mauritius law, the Chief Executive Officer is 
also entitled to a discretionary bonus equivalent to one month’s 
base salary each year payable by Essar Energy Services 
(Mauritius) Limited.
The APLI for 2013-14 will be similar in design to 2012-13 and 
the maximum potential will remain at 45% of base salary. 
Specific targets for 2013-14 have not been disclosed as they 
are considered to be commercially sensitive, although the 
Committee is satisfied that they are appropriately demanding.
Long-term incentives
The Essar Energy Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) is the 
Group’s primary long-term incentive arrangement. The key 
terms of the ESOP are as follows:
` ` The ESOP has a normal maximum annual limit of 100% 
of base salary, with a 300% of base salary annual limit 
in exceptional circumstances (such as recruitment 
or retention);
` ` Awards are normally granted in June each year and the 
normal grant policy is based on the participant balanced 
scorecard score for the previous financial year which 
determines the level at which the award is granted; and
` ` Awards are subject to an earnings per share (EPS) 
condition. For 2013 awards, 30% of an award vests for 
EPS growth of 5% pa with full vesting of an award for EPS 
growth of 10% pa. A sliding scale operates between these 
points and no vesting takes place for EPS growth less than 
5% pa. 69

Please note that the prior year comparatives for the 201 1–12 financial year cover a 15-month period, and therefore elements of

Directors’ report
Principal activities
Essar Energy plc is a holding company. The principal activities of the Group of which it is the parent are those of an India-focused 
energy company with assets across the power and oil and gas industries. The Group comprises four operating divisions:
` ` Refining and Marketing India
` ` Refining and Marketing UK
` ` Exploration and Production
` ` Power Generation and Transmission
Business review
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to set out in this Report a fair review of the business of the Group during the year 
ended 31 March 2013 including an analysis of the position of the Group at the end of the financial year and a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group (known as the business review). The business review set out on pages 8 to 27 
provides a comprehensive review of the development and performance of Essar Energy’s operations for the year ended 31 March 
2013 and the likely future developments and expected results of those operations. The information set out in the business review is 
incorporated by reference into this report and is deemed to form part of this Directors’ report.
A list of the main subsidiary undertakings and the joint ventures and their principal activities are given in Note 30 on page 128. 
Pages 2 to 76 inclusive (together with the sections of the Annual Report incorporated by reference) consist of a Directors’ report that 
has been drawn up and presented in accordance with and in reliance upon applicable English company law and the liabilities of the 
Directors in connection with that report shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions provided by such law.
Other information to be disclosed in the Directors’ report is given in this section. 
Directors 
The names and biographies of each Director at the date of this Report appear on pages 52 to 53. 
The Directors may from time-to-time appoint one or more Director(s). Any such Director shall hold office only until the next AGM and 
shall then offer themselves for election by the Company’s shareholders. The Company’s Articles of Association, require the Directors 
to retire and offer themselves for election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. Notwithstanding that the Articles of 
Association provide that one third of the Directors (or the number nearest to one third) are to retire by rotation at each AGM and offer 
themselves for re-election by the shareholders, all of the Directors seek re-election on an annual basis at each AGM, in compliance 
with the Code.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company maintains Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance which gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought against 
its Directors. In addition, qualifying third party indemnity provisions (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) were in 
force during the course of the year ended 31 March 2013 for the benefit of the then Directors and, at the date of this Report, are in 
force for the benefit of the Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) in connection 
with their duties, powers or office.
Dividends
No final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 has been declared. 
Relationship agreement
Prior to listing in May 2010, Essar Energy was a wholly owned subsidiary of Essar Global Limited (now known as Essar Global 
Fund Limited (‘Essar Global Fund’)). On 30 April 2010, Essar Energy and Essar Global Fund entered into a Relationship Agreement 
to regulate the ongoing relationship between the Company and Essar Global Fund. The principal purpose of the Relationship 
Agreement is to ensure that the Group is capable of carrying on its business independently of Essar Global Fund and its associates 
(for the purpose of this summary, as defined in the Relationship Agreement) and that transactions and relationships are at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms (other than certain de minimis transactions).
The Relationship Agreement will continue for so long as the ordinary shares are listed on the premium listing segment of the 
Official List and traded on the London Stock Exchange and Essar Global Fund, together with its associates, has an aggregate 
interest at least of 30% in the issued shares of Essar Energy. The key terms of the Relationship Agreement are set out in Appendix 
2 of this Report on page 139. The Directors believe that the terms of the Relationship Agreement enable the Company to carry on 
its business independently from the Essar Global Fund and its associates. 73

1  Essar Global Fund, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is the ultimate parent company of Essar Energy. Essar Global Fund has beneficial interests in 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares (76.72%) of the 
Company. Essar Global Fund is owned in equal proportion (i.e. 50% each) by two Cayman companies, Kettle River Holdings Limited (‘KR’) and Copper Canyon Holdings Limited (‘CC’). The shares of 
KR and CC are owned entirely by two independent discretionary trusts respectively, (together referred to hereinafter as the ‘Trusts’). The beneficiaries of the Trusts include among others, companies 
whose 100% shareholders are Mr Prashant Ruia and Mr Ravikant Ruia. Essar Global Fund also acquired an economic interest in up to a further 16,973,961 Ordinary Shares of the Company on 18 
January 2011 pursuant to an equity swap transaction as part of the convertible bond arrangements. As part of the equity swap transaction, Essar Global Fund has the option to settle the swap by 
acquiring these further 16,973,961 shares (and therefore the beneficial interest in such shares).
There have been no changes to the Directors’ interests between 31 March 2013 to a date not more than one month prior to the date 
of the notice convening the AGM.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital are set out in Note 23 to the financial statements. The issued share capital of the Company as at 
31 March 2013 was 1,303,437 ,293 ordinary shares of 5 pence each. The Company’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The rights and obligations attached to these shares are governed by English law and the Company’s Articles of Association.
The Company also has a Sponsored Level 1 American Depository Receipts (ADR) programme. Each ADR represents two of the 
Company’s ordinary shares and is traded on the US over-the-counter market under the symbol ‘ERERY’ . This ADR programme has 
no impact on the overall share capital of the Company.
Repurchase of shares
At the 2012 AGM, shareholders renewed the Company’s authority to make market purchases of up to 130,343,729 ordinary shares 
representing 10% of the issued share capital of the Company. This authority subsisted at 31 March 2013.
During the year ended 31 March 2013 and from that date up to the date of publication of this Annual Report, the Company did not 
make any purchases of its own shares or propose to purchase its own shares (either through the market or by an offer made to all 
shareholders or otherwise), nor did the Company acquire any of its own shares other than by purchase. Since the Company’s IPO, no 
shares have been repurchased nor has the Company entered into any options to purchase its own shares or entered into any contracts 
to make such purchases (including transactions made through the market or by an offer made to all shareholders or otherwise).
At the 2013 AGM the Board will again seek shareholders’ approval to renew the annual authority for the Company to make purchases 
of its own shares through the market.
Voting rights
Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. On a show of 
hands every shareholder present in person or by proxy (or being a corporation present by a duly authorised representative) shall have 
one vote, and on a poll every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy or (in the case of a corporate member) by a duly 
authorised representative shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting may appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote instead of him. If a 
member appoints more than one proxy he must specify the number of shares which each proxy is entitled to exercise rights over. 
A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act 2006, whenever the share capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, the rights 
attaching to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the 
issued shares of the class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the shareholders. 
Transfer of shares
As at 31 March 2013, there are no restrictions on the transfer of the ordinary shares other than as set out in the Articles of Association 
and certain restrictions that may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (formerly the Financial Services Authority) whereby certain Directors, officers and employees of the 
Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the ordinary shares. 74 Governance

Annual Report and accounts 2013
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Essential contracts 
Essar Oil Limited has entered into long-term refined petroleum product off-take agreements, which together accounted for 39% of the 
Group’s net sales, with the following Indian national oil companies: a four year agreement with Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited 
effective from April 2012, a four year agreement with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited effective from January 2008 
(extendable by one year) which is currently being finalised, and a three year agreement with Indian Oil Corporation Limited effective 
from November 201 1. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company is not guaranteed any binding minimum off-take quantity 
from the Indian national oil companies, however, due to the pricing terms for sales to the Indian national oil companies, the Company 
is able to generate higher margins on sales to these customers than on export sales and the Company considers these 
arrangements are essential to the business of the Group within the meaning of section 417(5)(c) of the Companies Act 2006.
Amendments to the Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles of Association of the Company may be made by special resolution of the shareholders. 
The Company’s Articles of Association are available on the Company’s website www.essarenergy.com. 
Significant agreements 
The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of 
the Company. These are as set out below: 
Convertible bond issue
On 18 January 201 1, Essar Energy launched an offering of US$500 million 4.25% guaranteed senior unsecured convertible bonds 
due 2016. The bonds were successfully priced with a coupon of 4.25% payable semi-annually in arrears and a conversion price set at 
a premium of 30% to the reference price of US$8.5277 (c.£5.37) per share. The offering size was subsequently increased to US$550 
million due to the exercise of an over-allotment option of US$50 million. The convertible bonds were issued on 1 February 201 1. 
Pursuant to the final terms attaching to the bonds, the bondholders have the right to require the Group to redeem the bonds at a 
price equal to the principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or if there is a change of 
control of the Company in which any person or persons, acting together (other than Essar Group or any person(s) controlled by or 
acting together with Essar Group) acquires or becomes entitled to control more than 50% of the voting rights of the Company.
Essar Global Fund, the majority shareholder of Essar Energy, did not participate in the convertible bond transaction, but it did enter 
into an equity swap transaction with Standard Chartered Bank whereby Essar Global Fund acquired an additional economic interest 
in 16,973,961 of Essar Energy’s ordinary shares. The swap will last for the life of the convertible bonds and may be settled by Essar 
Global Fund receiving cash or, at Essar Global Fund’s option, shares. The result of the equity swap transaction is to increase Essar 
Global Fund’s economic interest in Essar Energy to 78.02% from 76.72%.
Relationship Agreement
The Relationship Agreement between Essar Global (now Essar Global Fund) and the Company (described in detail on page 139) will 
terminate should Essar Global Fund, together with its associates (as defined in the Relationship Agreement), cease to have an 
aggregate interest in 30% or more of the issued share capital of the Company. 
US$300 million secured term loan facility
On 1 July 201 1, the Company entered into a US$450 million secured bridge loan facility due December 2012. The Company utilised 
this loan to enable Essar Oil UK to finance the acquisition of the Stanlow refinery and, amongst other things, for general corporate 
purposes. On 15 May 2012, the Company refinanced this loan with a new US$300 million three-year secured loan facility and 
US$150 million of internal cash resources. The new facility is being provided by a consortium of banks who were the lenders under 
the original US$450 million bridge loan. Pursuant to the terms of the new facility, each lender has the right to terminate its respective 
participation in the facility should Essar Global Fund cease to have the power to direct the management and policies of the Company, 
or cease to own (legally and beneficially) directly or indirectly more than 50% of the total issued share capital of the Company.
Up to US$450 million facility
In September 2012, the Company secured a US$150 million 4.5-year credit facility with Axis Bank with the ability, subject to successful 
syndication, to increase the facility size to US$450 million. Pursuant to the terms of this facility, it will be an event of default, giving Axis 
Bank the right to require immediate repayment of the facility, if Essar Global Fund ceases to (a) have the power, subject to the terms of 
the Relationship Agreement, to appoint or remove all, or the majority of the Directors of the Company, to give directions with respect to 
the operating and financial policies of the Company with which the Directors or other equivalent officers of the Company are obliged to 
comply and to direct the management and policies of the Company; and (b) be the legal and beneficial owner of more than 50% of the 
total issued share capital of the Company.
Employees
The average number of employees in the Group during the period is given in Note 5 to the Group financial statements on page 97. 
Group companies operate within a framework of HR policies, practices and regulations appropriate to their market sector and 
country of operation. Policies and procedures for recruitment, training and career development promote equality of opportunity 
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, race, religion or other beliefs and ethnic or national origin. The 
aim is to encourage a culture in which all employees have the opportunity to develop fully according to their individual abilities and the 
needs of the Group. The Group remains committed to the fair treatment of people with disabilities regarding applications, training, 
promotion and career development.  76 Governance

Directors’ report continued
Employee involvement and feedback is actively encouraged. A variety of ways are used to consult and inform employees including a 
Group-wide bulletin, email, intranet and local briefings. These are designed to facilitate dialogue while enabling the development of a 
common awareness among employees of what affects business performance.
Further information relating to employees of the Group is contained in the Sustainability Report on our website www.essarenergy.com. 
Creditor payment policy 
The Group’s policy follows the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills’ Prompt Payment Code, copies of which can be obtained 
from the Prompt Payment Code website at www.promptpaymentcode.org.uk. It is the Group’s payment policy, in respect of all 
suppliers, to settle agreed outstanding accounts in accordance with terms and conditions agreed with suppliers when placing orders 
and suppliers are made aware of these payment conditions. The Group’s trade creditors as a proportion of amounts invoiced by 
suppliers during the financial year represented 38 days at 31 March 2013 (31 March 2012 – 58 days). This is an arithmetical 
calculation based on the Companies Act regulations and does not necessarily reflect our practice, nor the experience of any 
individual creditor. 
Subsequent events 
See Note 32 to the financial statements for full details of subsequent events.
Market value of land and buildings
Land is carried at cost within the financial statements. It is not practical to estimate the market value of land at each balance 
sheet date. 
Political and charitable donations 
The Group has made no political donations in the 12 months ended 31 March 2013 (2012: nil). During the year, through the Essar 
Foundation, Essar Energy contributed US$719,660 to community activities. 
Further information in respect of the Group’s community initiatives are set out in the Sustainability Report on pages 28 to 33.
Financial instruments
Details of the Company’s use of financial instruments, together with objectives and policies on financial risk including information 
on the Company’s exposures to foreign currency, credit, commodity, price, liquidity and interest rate risks can be found in Notes 
24 and 25 to the financial statements.
Going concern
Disclosures in respect of going concern are provided in the Financial review on page 49.
Audit information
Each of the Directors at the date of the approval of this Report confirms that:
` ` so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
` ` the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of such information.
The confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Auditor
The Company’s auditor, Deloitte LLP , has indicated its willingness to continue in office and resolutions seeking to reappoint them as 
the Company’s auditors and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will be held at 1 1.00 am on Friday 30 August 2013 at Linklaters, One Silk Street, London EC2Y 8HQ. Details of 
the meeting and the resolutions to be proposed are set out in a separate Notice of Meeting which accompanies this Annual Report.

Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
` ` the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
` ` the management report (entitled ‘Business Review’), which is 
incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
For and on behalf of the Board
Naresh Nayyar
Chief Executive Officer
23 June 2013
The Directors are listed on pages 52 and 53 of this Annual Report.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the Company 
financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU. Under 
Company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
Directors:
` ` properly select and apply accounting policies;
` ` present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
` ` provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
` ` make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and to enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities 
statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
` ` the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 
March 2013 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
` ` the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union;
` ` the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
` ` the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
` ` the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
` ` the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
` ` adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
` ` the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
` ` certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
` ` we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
` ` the Directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ 
report and Financial review sections, in relation to going 
concern; 
` ` the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; 
and
` ` certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on Directors’ remuneration.

Other reserves
As part of the reorganisation of the Group prior to IPO in 2010, Essar Global Fund Limited gifted its interest of US$1,436.3 million in 
the Power and Oil & Gas businesses to the Company. The gift of this interest was transferred to other reserves. These reserves

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. Presentation of financial statements
1.1 Corporate information
Essar Energy plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom (‘UK’) under the Companies 
Act. The address of the registered office is 2nd Floor, Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London, W1J 6ER and its head office 
is 10, Frère Félix Valois Street, Port Louis, Mauritius.
The Company was incorporated in the UK on 18 December 2009 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Essar Global Fund Limited 
(‘EGFL ’ or ‘Parent Company’) (formerly known as Essar Global Limited).
The consolidated financial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates.
The Indian Income Tax Act requires Indian companies to file their annual financial statements and returns based on the year 
ended 31 March. All Indian companies within the Group prepare their accounts on this basis. To ensure that all accounting 
periods are aligned within the Group, the Company decided to also move its year end from 31 December to 31 March, effective 
from 31 March 2012. Accordingly, comparative figures are for 15 months ended 31 March 2012 and hence not comparable.
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 30.
1.2 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with article 4 of the EU IAS regulations. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of 
available-for-sale assets and financial assets and liabilities.
EGFL remains the ultimate Parent Company of the Group and its controlling party.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Business Review. The Business Review also includes a summary of the Group’s financial position, its cash flows and 
borrowing facilities.
1.3 Going concern
The Group monitors and manages closely its liquidity risk. In assessing the Group’s going concern status, the Directors have taken 
account of the financial position of the Group, anticipated future trading performance, its bank and other facilities, its capital 
investment plans, forecast of gross refining margins and the likelihood of any material adverse legal judgements.
The Group has prepared detailed annual business plans and forecasts covering the period to 30 June 2014. These business plans 
and forecasts were used as the basis for assessing the Group’s cash headroom and compliance with banking covenants. The 
Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group is 
dependent on the availability of existing loan facilities together with new facilities and arrangements which are being negotiated but 
have not yet been committed.
As further set out in the capital and liquidity section of the financial review, the Group is progressing well in establishing loan 
facilities, including refinancing facilities and other arrangements with a variety of lenders and financial institutions to ensure that 
the Group has adequate liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due and to improve the Group’s liquidity position significantly. In 
addition, whilst breaches of certain covenants in some debt facilities have occurred both during the financial year to 31 March 
2013 and subsequently, no loans have been recalled and the Group has continued to cure such breaches and obtain waivers from 
the financial institutions.
The facilities under discussion far exceed the Group’s current financing needs. Further, in respect of several of these facilities, 
which would meet the Group’s forecast needs, the Group has secured written confirmation from the proposed lenders that such 
lender is confident that the relevant facility will be made available. However, until these facilities are committed, there is a risk that 
they may not ultimately be available.
The Directors have examined all available evidence and have concluded that in light of the supportive nature of the relationships 
held with the lenders and financial institutions, the assurances received from the lenders and the current stage of negotiations, the 
Directors are satisfied that adequate financial resources will continue to be made available to the Group and Company so as to 
enable it to continue to trade on a going concern basis. As a result, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Group and Company’s financial statements.
1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group, none of which 
had a material impact on the current or prior year reported results and the financial position:
` ` Amendment to IFRS 1 Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters;
` ` IAS 24 (2009) Related Party Disclosures;
` ` Amendment to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues;
` ` Amendments to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement;
` ` IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments;
` ` IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers; and
` ` Improvements to IFRSs 2010. 84 Financial statements

1.5 Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
` ` IFRS 1 (amended) Amendments to Government Loans;
` ` IFRS 7 (amended) Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities;
` ` IFRS 9  Financial Instruments;
` ` IFRS 9 (amended) Mandatory Effective Date of IFRS 9 and Transition Disclosures;
` ` IFRS 10  Consolidated Financial Statements;
` ` IFRS 1 1  Joint Arrangements;
` ` IFRS 12  Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities;
` ` IFRS 10, 1 1 & 12 Transition Guidance; 
 (amended) 
` ` IFRS 13  Fair Value Measurement;
` ` IAS 1 (amended) Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income;
` ` IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits;
` ` IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements;
` ` IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures;
` ` IAS 32 (amended) Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities;
` ` IAS 36 (amended) Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets; and
` ` IFRIC 20  Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group in future periods, except as follows:
` ` IFRS 7 (amended) will increase the disclosure requirements where netting arrangements are in place for financial assets and 
financial liabilities;
` ` IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments;
` ` IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of interests the Group has in other entities; and
` ` IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of fair value for certain assets and liabilities as well as the associated disclosures.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
2. Accounting policies and estimates
2.1 Significant accounting policies
2.1.1 Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses from third parties are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate value of the identifiable assets, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments 
issued by the Group on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus cost directly 
attributable to the acquisition, except for a business combination under common control which is described below. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business 
Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition, except for non-current assets that are classified as held 
for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets held for sale and discontinued operations which are recognised at fair 
value less costs to sell.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-acquisition financial 
statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair 
values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
purchase consideration over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. If, however, the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of acquisition, 
the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill that is recognised as an asset and 
is initially measured at cost, is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss 
and is not subsequently reversed. Internally generated goodwill is not recognised.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholder’s proportion of 
the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised and subsequently also includes the non-controlling 
shareholder’s proportion of changes in equity since the date of combination.
The Group follows the entity concept method of accounting for changes in ownership interest in subsidiaries. In the event of a 
purchase of a minority shareholder’s interest where the Group holds the majority of shares of a subsidiary, any excess over the 
Group’s share of net assets is recorded in retained earnings.

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
2.1.2 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and 
is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, 
or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal.
2.1.3 Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of petroleum products is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of trade 
discounts, volume rebates, value added tax, sales taxes and duties. A sale is recognised when economic benefits associated with 
the sale are expected to flow to the Group and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed and it can 
be reliably measured. This is usually when title and insurance risk has passed to the customer.
Revenue from power supply is accounted for on the basis of billings to consumers or unbilled supply of power. Generally all 
consumers are billed on the basis of recording of consumption of electricity by installed meters. Sales of electricity are accounted 
for based on relevant tariff rates approved under the contract with the customer.
Revenue associated with sales tax deferral was recognised in accordance with the Group’s policy for accounting for government 
grants set out in 2.1.4.
2.1.4 Sales tax incentives
The Group received the benefit of certain sales tax incentives under the Capital Investment Incentive Premier/Prestigious Units 
Scheme 1995–2000 (the ‘Sale Tax Incentive Scheme’). The benefits under the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme were recognised when 
it was reasonable to expect that the benefit will be received and that all related conditions will be met. The benefit of a sales tax 
deferral with no associated interest outflow was recognised as a liability in accordance with the imputation rule under IAS 20 
Accounting for Government grants and disclosure of Government Assistance. This deferred liability was measured in accordance 
with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The benefit of the effective market rate of interest (or no interest) 
was measured as the difference between initial carrying value of the financial liability as determined in accordance with IAS 39 and 
the sales tax collected.
The Group’s eligibility to participate in the Scheme was challenged by the State Government of Gujarat (see Note 8a) and on 
17 January 2012 the Honourable Supreme Court of India set aside the previous judgement of the High Court of Gujarat and ruled 
that the Group could not participate in the scheme. The Group continued to apply the accounting policy in respect of the sales 
tax benefit up to 31 December 201 1 as the revenue was earned. The loss of the benefit as a result of the Honourable Supreme 
Court judgement on 17 January 2012 was a change in estimate of revenue earned up to 31 December 201 1. The entire amount 
previously recognised to 31 December 201 1 was adjusted in the period to 31 March 2012 against each individual line item through 
which the relevant benefit or associated costs were recognised.
2.1.5 Foreign currency transactions and translation
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into functional 
currency at the exchange rates at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are 
translated into functional currency at exchange rates at the reporting date and exchange differences are recognised in profit 
or loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as 
at the dates of the initial transactions.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars. For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement 
items of those entities for which the US dollar is not the functional currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of 
exchange during the year. The related balance sheets are translated at the rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
arising on translation are reported in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 86 Financial statements

2.1.6 Derivative financial instruments
In order to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate risk, the Group enters into forward, option 
and swap contracts. The Group also enters into financial instruments to acquire non-controlling stakes of its subsidiaries to 
increase its stake. Additionally the Group provides warrants over stakes held in certain subsidiaries. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it 
is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
The Group’s derivative arrangements have not previously been designated hedges under the definition of IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Consequently, all fair value measurements in respect of derivative financial 
instruments were taken to the income statement.
During the year, the Group has designated some of its new derivative arrangements used to manage commodity price risk as 
cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised 
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in 
the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised 
hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
at that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss.
2.1.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The initial cost of an 
asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the 
initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs if the recognition criteria are met.
The cost of mining properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, 
are capitalised as property, plant and equipment in the period in which such costs are incurred.
Costs directly related to construction, including costs and revenues arising from testing, specific financing costs and foreign 
exchange losses, are capitalised up to the point where the property, plant and equipment become operational. Property, plant 
and equipment become operational once all testing and trial runs are complete and it is ready for use in the manner management 
intended. Income from the sale of products as a result of testing and trial runs of a new asset are part of the directly attributable 
cost of assets and therefore deducted from the cost of the asset. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate 
amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. The capitalised value of a finance lease is also 
included within property, plant and equipment. Likewise, when a major inspection or major maintenance is undertaken, its cost is 
recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other 
repairs and maintenance costs are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction is carried at cost, less accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is 
not depreciated.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 87
Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each 
financial year end.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment other than freehold land and properties under construction is calculated to write off 
the cost of the asset to its residual value using the straight line method or the written down value method or on a unit of production 
basis as appropriate, over its expected useful life. Depreciation begins when the assets become ready for use.
Depreciation is calculated over the estimated useful lives of assets and on the basis of depreciation methods are as follows:
Asset Depreciation method Expected useful life (years)
Buildings Straight line 40
Plant and equipment
– Refinery – India Straight line 20–40
– Refinery – UK Straight line 15–20
– Power plant Straight line 11–30
– Related assets Straight line 10–25
Producing properties Unit of production basis
Mining properties Unit of production basis
Office equipment and fixtures Straight line 3–20
Motor vehicles Written down value 9–11
Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term and estimated useful life.
2.1.8 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, including producing properties and leases, intangible asset (excluding 
goodwill) and investments in joint controlled entities are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the asset’s carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying value of 
the asset or the cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but such that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
2.1.9 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the costs of those 
assets during the construction phase on an effective interest basis, until such time as the assets are ready for their intended use or 
sale which, in the case of producing or mining properties, is when saleable material begins to be extracted from such properties. 
Where surplus funds are available for a short-term out of money borrowed specifically to finance a qualified asset, the income 
generated from such short-term investments is deducted from capitalised borrowing costs.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
2.1.10 Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception 
date of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement 
conveys a right to use the asset.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the 
leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the 
finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which 
case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s policy on borrowing costs (see above). 88 Financial statements
Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no 
reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Payments made under operating leases, where the lessors effectively retain substantially all the risk and benefits of ownership of 
the lease property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease 
incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease. Property, plant and 
equipment used by the Group under operating leases are not recognised in the Group’s balance sheet.
2.1.11 Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or 
loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following specified categories: at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (‘FVTPL ’), cash 
and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and Available-for-sale (‘AFS’) financial assets. The classification is dependent on the 
nature and purpose of the financial assets acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. Further details on the Group’s financial assets and fair value measurement are disclosed in Note 25.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading or designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial 
assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if:
i) acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term;
ii) they are a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual 
pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
iii) they are derivatives unless these are designated as effective hedging instruments.
A financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
i) such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise;
ii) the financial asset forms part of a Group of financial assets or financial liabilities, or both, which is managed and its performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
iii) it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included 
in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item in the income statement. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 25.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less 
any allowance for impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables 
when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process.
AFS financial investments
Listed shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being AFS and are stated at fair value. The 
Group invests in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but classified as AFS financial investments and stated at 
fair value (because the Directors consider that fair value can be reliably measured). Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated reserves with the exception of impairment losses, interest 
calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are recognised 
directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive the dividend is established. 
The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at 
the spot rate at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in profit or loss are determined 
based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
For financial assets carried at amortised cost the Group assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for assets that 
are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. Objective evidence of impairment 
could include:
i) significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty;
ii) default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
iii) it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that 
have not yet been incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original 
effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the 
loss is recognised in the income statement.
For AFS financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment 
or a Group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as AFS, objective evidence for impairment would include a significant or prolonged 
decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss (measured as 
the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously 
recognised in the income statement) is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the income statement; increases in their fair value after 
impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
2.1.12 Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities at initial recognition. The Group’s other 
financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables and finance lease payables. All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, include directly attributable transaction costs.
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities at FVTPL include those held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near 
term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the income statement.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on 
an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of 
allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount 
on initial recognition. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the amortisation process.
Financial guarantee contracts
The Group provides certain guarantees in respect of the indebtedness of subsidiary undertakings, claims under contract and 
other arrangements in the ordinary course of business. The Group evaluates each arrangement to determine whether it is an 
insurance or a financial guarantee contract. Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values and, if 
not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of the obligation under the contract and the 
amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation over period of guarantee is provided.
Once the arrangements are designated as insurance contracts, these are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the obligations 
under guarantee become probable.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
2.1.13 Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources, that can reliably be estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. If the effect 
of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present 
value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement as a finance cost. 
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. 90 Financial statements
Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount 
of the obligation cannot be measured reliably. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group.
2.1.14 Inventories
Inventories (other than crude oil extracted by the Exploration and Production segment) are valued at lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Crude oil extracted and in saleable condition is valued at net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the following bases:
a) Raw materials and consumables are determined at weighted average cost except crude oil for the refinery which is measured 
at first-in first-out basis.
b) Finished products and work in progress are determined at direct material cost, labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal or allocated capacity.
c) Inventories held for trading purposes are determined at weighted average cost.
Net realisable value is determined by reference to estimated prices existing at the balance sheet date for inventories less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
2.1.15 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication 
that an intangible asset may be impaired. The asset’s useful lives and methods of amortisation are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at each financial year end.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.
Finite lived intangible assets which are subject to amortisation are amortised over their useful lives as mentioned below:
Intangible asset Expected useful life (years)
Software 3–5
Power sales contract 20
2.1.16 Joint controlled entities
A joint controlled entity is an entity in which the Group shares joint control over the strategic, financial and operating decisions with 
one or more ventures under a contractual arrangement.
Investment in joint controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is 
classified as held for sale, which is recognised at fair value less costs to sell. In accordance with the equity method, investments 
in joint controlled entities are measured at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of joint controlled 
entities, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Goodwill arising from the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised of the joint controlled entities is included in the carrying amount of the investment and 
is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The income statement reflects share of results of operations of the joint controlled entities. Where there has been a change 
recognised directly in equity of the joint controlled entities, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the 
statement of changes in equity. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint controlled entities 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant joint controlled entities.
2.1.17 Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for oil and gas resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the 
assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.
Exploration and evaluation activity includes:
a) researching and analysing historical exploration data;
b) gathering exploration data through geological and geophysical studies;
c) exploratory and appraisal drilling;
d) evaluating and testing discoveries;
e) determining transportation and infrastructure requirements; and
f) conducting market and finance studies.

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued 
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are charged to the profit and loss account. 
Licence costs paid in connection with a right to explore an existing exploration area are capitalised. Exploration and evaluation 
expenditure (including amortisation of capitalised licence costs) is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred except in the 
following circumstances:
a) the exploration and evaluation activity is related to an established discovery for which commercially recoverable reserves have 
already been established; or
b) at the balance sheet date, exploration and evaluation activity has not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment 
of the existence of commercially recoverable reserves.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure considered to be tangible is recorded as a component of property, plant 
and equipment at cost less impairment losses, if any. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is monitored for 
indicators of impairment. Where a potential impairment is indicated, an impairment test of the capitalised exploration and 
evaluation expenditure is performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the Group or pool of operating assets 
(representing a cash-generating unit) to which the exploration is attributed. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is not 
expected to be recovered it is charged to the profit and loss account. Exploration areas at which reserves have been discovered 
but that require major capital expenditure before production can begin are continually evaluated to ensure that commercial 
quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that additional exploration or evaluation work is underway or planned.
2.1.18 Development expenditure
When commercially recoverable reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, the capitalised exploration and 
evaluation expenditure is transferred to assets under construction after impairment is assessed and any resulting impairment loss 
is recognised. Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and 
the drilling of development wells are capitalised as assets under construction.
On completion of a development, all capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure together with the subsequent development 
expenditure transferred to producing properties are depreciated using unit of production method. This is carried out with reference 
to quantities, with depletion computed on the basis of the ratio that oil and gas production bears to balance proved and probable 
reserves at commencement of the year.
2.1.19 Tax
Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided on taxable income at amounts expected to be paid or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
In India, the current tax payable by a company is charged to the income statement in the applicable period at the corporate tax 
rate computed under the normal provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act or the minimum alternate tax (‘MAT’), whichever is higher. 
Excess paid under MAT can be carried forward for up to 10 years as a credit against corporate income tax in the future. Where 
the MAT credit satisfies the relevant criteria under IAS 12 Income Taxes, it is recognised as a deferred tax asset.
Deferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
i) where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and
ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint controlled entities, 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax credits carried forward and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset will be 
realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to 
the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the income statement, except when they relate to items 
credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the initial 
accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating 
goodwill or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities over the cost of the business combination. 92 Financial statements
Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
2. Accounting policies and estimates continued 
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current 
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
tax authority.
2.1.20 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks with original maturity of less than 
90 days and short-term highly liquid investments, that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of 
changes in the principal amount. Bank overdrafts, which are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the operations, are 
included in cash and cash equivalents.
2.1.21 Retirement benefits
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for its employees as well as post-employment benefit 
plans. For defined contribution schemes the amount charged as expense is the contributions paid or payable when employees 
have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
For defined benefit pension and post-employment benefit plans, full actuarial valuations are carried out every year end using the 
projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognised in profit and loss account.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The employee benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
reduced by the fair value of the related plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the reductions in future 
contributions to the plan.
Detailed disclosures are not provided within the financial statements as amounts associated with such schemes are not 
considered to be significant.
2.1.22 Share-based payments
The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair value 
at grant date. They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that will 
eventually vest. Charges are reversed if it appears that non-market performance will not be met. Options are valued using the 
Black-Scholes model.
2.2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the course of applying the policies set out in section 2. 1 above, management have made estimations and assumptions that 
impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Several of these estimates and 
judgements are related to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. These estimates and judgements 
are evaluated at each reporting date and are based on historical experience, internal controls, advice from external experts and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting 
accounting estimates may vary from the actual results. The Group believes that in addition to assumptions related to going 
concern discussed in Note 1.3, the assumptions, judgements and estimations that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are the following areas:
2.2.1 Credit risk on receivables
As at 31 March 2013, various receivables including amounts from related parties were past due. Subsequent to year end the 
majority of the related party receivables which were then due were received or appropriate support has been obtained to be 
confident that they will be received shortly. However, some third party receivables remain overdue and a judgement has to be 
made about the appropriate level of provision. Further, all receivables including dues from related parties will continue to be 
monitored closely to ensure appropriate provisioning, if required. See notes 24 and 29.
2.2.2 Contingencies and commitments
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group. Potential 
liabilities that have a low probability of crystallising or are very difficult to quantify reliably, are treated as contingent liabilities. Such 
liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance 
regarding the final outcome of these legal proceedings, but the Group does not expect them to have a materially adverse impact 
on its financial position or profitability. For further details, refer to Note 28.
2.2.3 Depreciable lives
The Group’s relevant non-current assets are depreciable over their estimated useful lives as set out in section 2. 1 above. Such lives 
are dependent upon an assessment of both the technical lives of the assets and also their likely economic lives based on factors 
including commodity prices, alternative sources of supply, relative efficiency and operating costs. Accordingly depreciable lives are 
reviewed annually using the best information available to management.

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued 
2.2.4 Impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Other non-current assets are tested for impairment when conditions suggest that there 
is a risk of impairment. Where impairment testing is carried out, management uses the best information available to them to 
assess the likely cash flows available to the relevant asset. Key assumptions are inherently uncertain and include commodity 
prices, anticipated production costs, likely asset lives, the timing of granting of licences and permits and the relevant discount 
rates, coal and gas availability and logistical challenges associated with coal transportation.
During the year, the Group commenced commercial sales from its 1200 MW Power Plant at Salaya, Gujarat under a Power 
Purchase Agreement (the ‘PPA’) with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (‘GUVNL ’) for 1000 MW capacity based on a substantially 
fixed tariff for 25 years. The carrying value of the plant at 31 March 2013 was US$927 .0 million (2012: US$1,004.0 million). The coal 
for Salaya will be sourced from the wholly owned Aries coal mine in Indonesia in the longer term once the mine is operating, which 
is expected in one year, with alternative supplies of coal sourced in the interim period. An increase in coal prices and a change in 
the Indonesian laws impacting coal export prices have triggered an impairment review in the period.
A number of key assumptions have been made in the impairment review including the discount rate, the economic life of the asset, 
the assumed plant load factor, the merchant electricity price and other cost inputs including the cost of coal. It is assumed that the 
plant will continue to operate beyond the PPA term on a merchant basis, for a period of up to 35 years with higher returns arising 
from forecast coal and power price assumptions, over this period of time. A change in one or more of these assumptions in a 
subsequent period may result in a material difference to the estimated value in use increasing the risk of impairment.
As a result of the unforeseen increase in coal prices, the Group has filed a tariff revision plea with GUVNL, seeking an increase in 
the tariff. In view of recent pronouncements by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission in the case of other industry power 
producers impacted under similar circumstances, management is confident of obtaining a revision in the tariff in the near term to 
compensate for the cost increase.
Management has therefore concluded that no impairment currently needs to be recognised with respect to the carrying value of 
the plant. In view of the inherent uncertainty in the underlying assumptions mentioned above about future events, including the 
ability to achieve a tariff increase, the position will be monitored closely in the future to assess changes in the estimated value in 
use of the plant.
2.2.5 Tax
The Group is subject to tax, principally within India. The amount of tax payable in respect of any period is dependent upon the 
interpretation of the relevant tax rules. Whilst an assessment must be made of the deferred tax position of each entity within the 
Group, these matters are inherently uncertain until the position of each entity is agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
2.2.6 Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2.1.17 . In making a 
decision about whether to continue to capitalise exploration and evaluation expenditures, it is necessary to make judgements 
about the satisfaction of, if (a) proved reserves are booked or (b) (i) if they have found commercially producible quantities of 
reserves and (ii) if they are subject to further exploration or appraisal activity in that either drilling of additional exploratory wells is 
underway or firmly planned for the near future or other activities are being undertaken to sufficiently progress the assessing of 
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If there is a change in one of these judgements in a subsequent 
period, then the related capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures would be expensed in that period resulting in a charge 
to income.
2.2.7 Revenue
A sale is usually recognised when title and insurance risk has passed to the customer, typically when they receive delivery of 
the product. However, due to the differing factors in individual arrangements, each non-standard transaction is assessed by 
management to conclude on the appropriate timing to recognise revenue. This may be subsequent to legal title passing.
2.2.8 Recognition of inventory
The timing of when the Company recognises inventory on its balance sheet contains a degree of judgement as the majority of 
crude oil in Oil UK is supplied by a just-in-time supplier which holds significant levels of inventory on site at the refinery in tanks that 
it leases from the Group. Management performs a detailed review of these just-in-time arrangements at inception, encompassing 
both legal and substantive aspects, and concluded that the inventory should be recorded on the Group’s balance sheet at the 
point at which it is drawn down from the tanks into the refinery. Management monitor any changes to the legal and substantive 
aspects of the arrangement to ensure that this recognition point continues to be appropriate going forward. 94 Financial statements

3. Segment information
Information reported to the Board for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of performance is primarily determined 
by the nature of the different activities that the Group engages in, rather than the geographical location of these operations. This is 
reflected by the Group’s organisational structure and internal financial reporting systems. The profitability of the segments is 
reviewed based on profit or loss after tax and is based on IFRS. The Group has the following reportable operating segments:
i) R&M India (Refinery and Marketing – India and others): The Group owns a petroleum refinery on the west coast of India, 
together with a 50% interest in a petroleum refinery in Kenya, and oil retailing stations on franchise across India. Its main 
products are high speed diesel, motor spirit, fuel oil and superior kerosene oil. The activities of Refining and Marketing 
include the refining of crude oil and trading, marketing and transportation of finished products and by-products.
ii) R&M UK (Refinery and Marketing – UK): On 31 July 201 1 the Group acquired the Stanlow refinery in the United Kingdom as 
discussed further in Note 26. Its main products are high speed diesel, motor spirit, fuel oil and superior kerosene oil. The 
activities of Refining and Marketing include the refining of crude oil and trading, marketing and transportation of finished 
products and by-products.
iii) Exploration and Production: The Group has a diverse portfolio of 15 blocks for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
in India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Nigeria and Vietnam.
iv) Power: The Group operates gas and liquid fuel-based power plants in India and Canada together with a number of mining assets.
v) Corporate: This comprises Essar Energy plc and its subsidiary companies that provide services to the Group as a whole.
Sales between the segments are made at contractually agreed prices. The segment revenues and segment results include 
transaction between business segments. All inter and intra transactions including all profit or loss made within these segments are 
eliminated on Group consolidation.

The sales tax benefit in the period to March 2012 relates to the benefit previously recognised on eligible domestic sales within the 
State of Gujarat from the Vadinar refinery. Under the incentive scheme, sales tax collected from customers within Gujarat was 
deferred for payment to the State of Gujarat by up to 17 years. This deferral gave rise to time value benefit as the difference 
between the cash received and the net present value of the liability to the State. The benefit was earned as the eligible domestic 
sales were made within the State of Gujarat as the benefit did not compensate the Group for any particular costs or expenses, 
and the Group expected all other conditions related to the benefit to be met in full. The benefit was included within revenue as it 
was derived directly from sales made to customers. The Group continued to apply the accounting policy in respect of the sales 
tax benefit up to 31 December 201 1 as the revenue was earned. The loss of the benefit as a result of the Honourable Supreme 
Court judgement on 17 January 2012 was a change in estimate of revenue earned up to 31 December 201 1 (see Note 8a).

1 Other includes interest on sales tax liability of US$97.2 million from 17 January 2012 to 31 March 2013 as per order of the Honourable Supreme Court dated 13 September 2012.
Borrowing costs capitalised during the year relate to interest ranging from 0.66% to 14.50% (2012: 1.4% to 16.0%) incurred on 
specific borrowings undertaken to finance construction of assets and exchange differences arising from foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.
During the year the Group has completed the process for exiting the Corporate Debt Restructuring (‘CDR’) loan facility set up in 
December 2004 to help cover the construction of its Vadinar refinery in Gujarat. The Master Restructuring Agreement (‘MRA’) loan 
facility has been replaced with a new debt facility of US$1,084.8 million on commercial terms from a similar group of lenders (refer 
Note 19). There is a gain of US$83.7 million arising on extinguishment of old debt.
As sales tax was collected from customers, a corresponding liability to the State of Gujarat was recognised at its net present value. 
Accordingly, the discount on the liability unwound over time resulting in the finance costs shown above. The Group continued to apply 
the accounting policy in respect of this liability up to 31 December 201 1. As a result of the Honourable Supreme Court judgement on 
17 January 2012 there was a change in estimate of the liability up to 31 December 201 1 (see Note 8a).
In a related transaction, the Group had deposited amounts based on the net present value of its future sales tax payments with a 
related party. The interest accruing on these deposits of 13.0% (2012: 9.0%) per annum is included in finance income above.

resulted in foreign exchange losses (2012: Depreciation in INR from Rs.44.81/USD to Rs.51. 16/USD). Foreign exchange losses of 
US$255.9 million (2012: US$316.9 million) arises largely from operational payments to creditors and receipts from customers in 
US dollars where the settlement date rate was different from the transaction date or closing period rate.

8. Exceptional items
8a. Adjustment for loss of sales tax benefit
The eligibility of the Group’s subsidiary Essar Oil Limited (‘EOL ’) to participate in the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) 
was being challenged by the Government of Gujarat in the Honourable Supreme Court of India, following a judgement by the High 
Court of Gujarat which confirmed that EOL was eligible to participate in the Scheme. The case was heard at the end of 201 1 and, 
on 17 January 2012, the Honourable Supreme Court of India set aside the previous judgement of the High Court of Gujarat and 
ruled that the Group could not participate in the Scheme.
The Group continued to apply the accounting policy in respect of the sales tax benefit up to 31 December 201 1 as the revenue 
was earned. The loss of the benefit as a result of the Honourable Supreme Court judgement on 17 January 2012 was a change in 
estimate of revenue earned up to 31 December 201 1. This required that the entire amount previously recognised to 31 December 
201 1 was adjusted in the period ended 31 March 2012 against each individual line item through which the relevant benefit or 
associated costs are recognised.
This adjustment affected four line items within the income statement. Adjustments have been made to:
` ` Revenue – since the difference between the cash received and the net present value of the liability to the State of Gujarat 
was originally recognised in revenue in the period in which the associated eligible domestic sales were made to customers;
` ` General and administration expenses – since as part of the conditions for the Scheme monies were set aside for payment to a 
welfare scheme that were originally recognised within general and administration costs;
` ` Finance costs – since the unwinding of discount on the liability to the State of Gujarat was previously recorded within finance 
costs; and
` ` Taxation – since a deferred tax asset based on the India Corporate tax rate has been recognised on the consequential losses 
to be set off against future profits.
Subsequent to the judgement, the Government of Gujarat on 24 January 2012 demanded that the Group repay the entire 
liability including interest at 18% from the original due date immediately. The Group filed a special leave petition before the 
Honourable Supreme Court seeking directions on repaying the sales tax in instalments and for remission of interest. The Group 
paid US$183.7 million against the sales tax liability in July 2012 as directed by the Honourable Supreme Court. On 13 September 
2012, the Honourable Supreme Court directed the Group to repay the balance sales tax liability of US$948.7 million with interest 
from 17 January 2012 at 10% in eight equal quarterly instalments starting from 2 January 2013. The balance of the sales tax 
liability including interest accrued as at 31 March 2013 is US$850.4 million.

8b. Interest arising on lapse of prepayment option
Under the terms of the Master Restructuring Loan Agreement (‘MRA’) the Group had an option to repay a facility at advantageous 
terms, with lenders’ approval, before 24 April 2012 and thereby avoid various interest charges. As Essar Oil was at an advanced 
stage of the exiting the MRA, it did not seek to exercise the prepayment option, which therefore lapsed in April 2012. As a 
consequence, the Group had recognised what was previously considered to be contingent liability, arising from interest which 
became payable on these facilities, together with a reassessment of the carrying value of these facilities based on the discounted 
estimated future cash flows. This had resulted in an additional interest charge of US$321.5 million, less an associated tax credit of 
US$104.3 million. The share of non-controlling interest was US$28.0 million in interest charge after tax.
The Group exited the Corporate Debt Restructuring Scheme resulting in termination of Master Restructuring Agreement dated 
17 December 2004 (‘the MRA’) and entered into a Common Loan Agreement dated 25 March 2013 (the ‘CLA’) with the lenders for 
the loan facilities which were previously governed by the MRA (refer Note 6). 100 Financial statements

The applicable corporate tax rate is the standard effective corporate income tax rate in India. The maximum tax rate applicable in 
India is 32.45% with effect from 1 April 2012. With effect from 1 April 2013, the maximum tax rate has been increased to 33.99% 
if income is greater than US$1.8 million (INR 100 million). Indian companies may be taxed under Minimum Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) 
provisions if the MAT tax is higher than corporate income tax. MAT is charged on book profits at a rate of 20.0%. With effect from 
1 April 2013, the maximum MAT has been increased to 20.96% if income is greater than US$1.8 million (INR 100 million). Tax paid 
under MAT, which is in excess of corporate income tax, can be carried forward for up to 10 years as a credit against corporate 
income tax in the future.
The applicable tax rate in UK is 24%. The UK tax rate decreased from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013.

These unrecognised deferred tax assets comprise of:
a) Unutilised tax losses amounting to US$24.8 million (2012: US$0.6 million), out of which US$0.6 million (2012: US$0.6 million) 
will expire on 31 March 2014 and US$24.2 million (2012: nil) will expire on 31 March 2021; and
b) Unutilised depreciation allowances under Indian tax laws amounting to US$1 1.8 million (2012: nil), over an indefinite period.

10. Tax continued
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of US$32.8 million (2012: US$19.2 million) in respect of credits for MAT.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in case of certain losses and credits mentioned above on the grounds that it is not 
probable that suitable taxable profit will arise before the tax losses and credits expire. The recoverability of the unrecognised 
deferred tax asset will be reviewed at future balance sheet dates.
The deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries or joint 
controlled entities have not been recognised as:
i) the Group has determined that undistributed profit of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, but rather 
tax-free returns of capital may be made if necessary; and
ii) the Group’s joint controlled entities cannot distribute their profits without consent of all joint controlled entities partners. 
The Group does not foresee giving such consent in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries and joint controlled entities, for which deferred tax liabilities 
have not been recognised, as explained above, amount to US$222.4 million (2012: US$213.0 million).
11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit after tax for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Shares representing: Shares
Share capital at 31 March 2012 and 2013 1,303,437,293
The options issued in accordance with the ESOP scheme in 2010, 201 1 and 2012 are antidilutive in nature.
The impact of the convertible bonds is antidilutive because the interest that would be added back to basic EPS is greater than the 
relative adjustment to the weighted average number of ordinary shares.

In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (including goodwill) is 
compared with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell and value in use. In the absence of any information about the fair value of a cash-generating unit, the recoverable amount is 
deemed to be the value in use. The Group calculates the recoverable amount as the value in use using a discounted cash flow 
model. The future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the cash-generating unit and are discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate. The discount rate is derived from the applicable business segment weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted 
where applicable to take into account any specific risks relating to the country where the cash-generating unit is located. 106 Financial statements

Petroleum Refinery
The three-year business plans are used together with long-term market expectations to estimate gross refining margins and other 
cash flows, which are approved on an annual basis by management, and are the primary source of information for the determination 
of value in use based on a pre-tax discount rate of 13.7% p.a. (2012: 1 1.5% p.a.) and growth rate of 3.0% (2012: 3.0%). The three-year 
business plans contain forecasts for refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products, revenues, costs and 
capital expenditure. As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various economic assumptions including current financial and 
operational performance of the plant including the expanded unit, such as oil prices, refining margins, refined product margins and 
cost inflation rates, are set by management. The estimated recoverable amount for the refinery unit exceeds its carrying amount by 
US$3,823.9 million (2012: US$12,01 1.0 million). The reduction in the headroom compared to previous year is due to changes in the 
Gross Refining Margin (‘GRM’) assumptions compared to previous year as a result of a change in oil prices over the last year and 
revision to the crude and product slate of the refinery subsequent to the completion of the refinery expansion and optimisation. 
Further, the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections has increased compared to the previous period due to change in the 
debt-equity ratio and the increase in interest rates due to CDR exit.
Gross Refining Margin (‘GRM’) is the difference between revenue from refined petroleum products and related cost of crude oil 
used for their production. GRM is calculated based on market information and past experience of management. Prices of the 
petroleum products and crude are exposed to movement in crude prices on the Nymex, International Petroleum Exchange and 
Dubai Mercantile Exchange. If GRM falls by 23% (2012: 52%) compared to what is considered for impairment testing, Petroleum 
Refinery’s recoverable amount would be equal to its carrying amount.
The Discount rate is estimated based on the weighted average cost of the capital of Essar Oil Limited (‘EOL ’). If the discount rate 
increases by 60% (2012: 155%) above what is considered for impairment testing, Petroleum Refinery’s recoverable amount would 
be equal to its carrying amount.
The Directors do not consider these outcomes to be reasonably likely.
Essar Power Plant
The Group uses the long-term power sale agreements for estimating the cash flows, which are approved, based on signed 
contracts in place and are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use based on a discount factor of 
10.25% p.a. (2012: 10. 14% p.a.). These contain forecasts for plant load factor, generation in Megawatts (‘MW’), fixed and variable 
revenue, operating costs and sustaining capital expenditure. The cash flow projections are based on these forecasts which are 
approved by management. The estimated recoverable amount for the power plants significantly exceeds its carrying amount in all 
cases and no impairment is necessary at the end of periods presented. The estimated recoverable amount for the power plant 
exceeds its carrying amount by US$221.3 million (2012: US$382.5 million).
The discount rate is estimated based on the weighted average cost of the capital of Essar Power Limited (‘EPOL ’). If the discount 
rate increases by 1 1 1.5% (2012: 138%) above what is considered for impairment testing, the power plant’s recoverable amount 
would be equal to its carrying amount. The Directors do not consider this outcome to be reasonably likely.
Bhander Power Plant
The Group uses the long-term power sale agreements for estimating the cash flows, which are approved, based on signed 
contracts in place and are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use based on a discount factor of 
10.63% p.a. (2012: 10.44% p.a). These contain forecasts for plant load factor, generation in Megawatts (‘MW’), fixed and variable 
revenue, operating costs and sustaining capital expenditure. The cash flow projections are based on these forecasts which are 
approved by management. The estimated recoverable amount for the power plant significantly exceeds its carrying amount in all 
cases and no impairment is necessary at the end of periods presented. The estimated recoverable amount for the power plant 
exceeds its carrying amount by US$133.5 million (2012: US$651.2 million). The reduction in the headroom compared to previous 
year is due to expected increase in gas prices.
The discount rate is estimated based on the weighted average cost of the capital of Bhander Power Limited (‘BPOL ’). If the 
discount rate increases by 137 .5% (2012: 293. 1%) above what is considered for impairment testing, the power plant’s recoverable 
amount would be equal to its carrying amount. The Directors do not consider this outcome to be reasonably likely.

Banks and financial institutions
The Group has borrowings under various loan agreements with a number of banks and financial institutions. These lenders 
provide the Group with term loans, revolving facilities and letters of credit facilities.
Borrowings from banks and financial institutions of nil (2012: US$1,684.9 million) are subject to a Master Restructuring Agreement 
entered into by EOL with the lenders on 17 December 2004 (the ‘MRA’), prior to its acquisition by the Group. During the year, the 
Company exited the Corporate Debt Restructuring Scheme of US$1,084.8 million resulting in termination of the MRA and entered 
into the Common Loan Agreement (‘CLA’) dated 25 March 2013 with the lenders for the loan facilities which were previously 
governed by the MRA.
Borrowings from banks and financial institutions are generally secured pari passu with other lenders of the borrowing company 
with a first charge on property, plant and equipment, followed by charges over current assets and pledges of certain equity shares 
in subsidiaries held by the Group. Working capital loans are secured by a first charge on the current assets and a second charge 
on property, plant and equipment.
Interest rates on Indian Rupee borrowings range from 10.25% to 15.5% per annum (2012: 10.25% to 16.0%) while the interest rate 
on borrowings in other currencies ranges from 0.7% to 9. 1% per annum (2012: 1.4% to 9. 1%).
The Group has undrawn committed facilities as at 31 March 2013 of US$1,362.3 million (2012: US$5,287 .7 million) with maturities 
ranging from one to two years. Out of the total, US$608.0 million is subject to receiving certain regulatory clearances.
Details of the maturity and interest profile of the Group’s borrowings are included in Note 24.
Covenant non-compliance – Power
The Group has a number of power projects, some of which have recently been commissioned and others are under development. 
Consistent with a number of companies operating in the power sector in India, the Group has been impacted by project delays 
particularly in relation to regulatory approvals (including mine approvals) and other factors outside the Group’s control. As a result, 
there have been instances of late payments of interest and principal and some breaches of financial and non-financial covenants 
within the respective project loan agreements resulting in events of default.
Whilst the Group’s lenders had not called any loans or issued any default notices in relation to the project loans as at 31 March 2013, 
or until the date of approval of the financial statements, the Group, prior to 31 March 2013, commenced discussions with the relevant 
lenders to obtain either relaxations or waivers from the respective financial or non-financial covenants of the project loan agreements. 110 Financial statements
Essar Energy plc
Annual Report and accounts 2013
19. Borrowings continued 
Subsequent to 31 March 2013 but prior to the approval of the Annual Report, all breaches as at the balance sheet date have been 
cured but in accordance with IFRS these loans, amounting to US$2,362.6 million, have been classified as current liabilities in these 
financial statements, as the Group did not have an unconditional right at 31 March 2013 to defer settlement beyond 12 months. 
Going forward, the Directors are expecting to obtain further relaxation or refinance the respective loan agreements as set out in 
the financial review (capital and liquidity section) of the Annual Report, such that the long-term financing of the projects is secured 
and the resulting loans will be classified as long-term.
Optionally convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares
Optionally convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares (‘OCCRPS’) of a nominal value INR 3,500 million (US$68.2 million) 
were issued in 2009 by Essar Power Limited (‘EPOL ’), a subsidiary of the Group. The OCCRPS carry interest rate of 0. 1 % and 8.0% 
per annum for the first two years and subsequent five years, respectively. The OCCRPS are convertible into equity shares at the 
option of the investor in the event of a covenant default or an IPO of Essar Power Limited. The conversion price will be determined 
based on the equity valuation of the subsidiary at the time of conversion. If there is no Qualified offering of Essar Power Limited, until 
the final redemption date, then the preference shares will be redeemed at 14.5% to 20.5% interest p.a. at the end of the original term 
based on valuation of EPOL. The Group has accounted the OCCRPS at amortised cost with effective interest rate of 20.8%.
EPOL has also issued a warrant to the OCCRPS holder for a consideration of INR 100, which entitles the holder to subscribe to 
the equivalent of US$15.0 million of equity shares in EPOL at any time before an IPO of EPOL at an exercise price based on a 
predetermined valuation of EPOL. The OCCRPS continues to be held as long-term borrowings. Refer to Note 22 for further 
information on the valuation of the warrant provided to the OCCRPS holder.
Working capital loans
The Group has a number of working capital loans which are used in the ordinary course of business which are subject to interest 
rates ranging from 0.59% to 14.0% per annum (2012: 1.4% to 15.50%) and are short-term in nature.
Bills of exchange
Bills of exchange are accepted by banks towards payment of customer invoices and typically carry an interest rate ranging from 
1.8% to 10.75% per annum (2012: 10.0% to 1 1.0%) and are settled in a period ranging from 7 to 21 days.
Loans from related parties
The Group has entered into loan agreements with related parties. The loans carry interest of 10.25% per annum (2012: 9.5% to 
1 1.0%) on the outstanding loan balance (for further details, refer to Note 29).

Rehabilitation and resettlement
An obligation to incur rehabilitation and resettlement costs arises in land acquisition for project purposes. These costs are in some 
cases governed by the policies of State Governments while allowing the industrialist to set up projects in rural parts of India. These 
are in the nature of subsistence cost to the land owners who are relocated from their land. This provision is expected to be utilised 
over 46 years.
Onerous contacts
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting 
from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. 
This provision is expected to be utilised over nine years. 112 Financial statements

The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using inputs available from market participants. Where such prices are 
not available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for 
non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured 
using market available forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from market available interest rates matching maturities of 
the contracts. Commodity swaps are measured using a forward curve based on futures or forward prices available from market 
participants and yield curves derived from interest rates available from market participants for matching maturities of the contracts. 
Commodity options are measured using the same data as the commodity swaps, but also uses a volatility surface derived from 
option volatilities available from market participants. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows 
estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from interest rates available from market participants. 
Warrants provided to the holder of the OCCRPS were valued through use of a binomial model by reference to forecast 
performance of the underlying assets.
Cash flow hedges
The Group enters into commodity price contracts for hedging highly probable forecast transactions and accounts for them as 
cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged 
transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the income statement.
The net cash flow hedging reserve recognised in equity is US$14.9 million after a deferred tax charge of US$6.7 million. During the 
year the amount of non-qualifying hedge transferred to income statement is US$1.9 million.
The principal amount in respect of interest rate swaps held at 31 March 2013 was US$125.8 million (2012: US$97 .7 million) carrying 
an interest rate range of 3.0% to 5.5%.

24. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and overdrafts, debentures, finance leases and 
trade payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various 
financial assets such as trade receivables, cash, and short-term deposits which arise directly from its operations.
The Group is subject to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates due to nature of its operations. The Group 
enters into derivative transactions, primarily in the nature of commodity options and swap contracts and forward currency 
contracts. The purpose is to manage commodity price risk and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, commodity 
price risk and credit risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are 
summarised below:
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations 
with floating interest rates. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed, floating rate debts and interest 
rate derivatives.
The following table provides a breakdown of the Group’s fixed and floating rate borrowings:

31 March 
2012 
$ million
Fixed rate borrowings 4,099.8 5,441.7
Floating rate borrowings 4,633.1 2,204.8
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, being a 0.5% increase or 
decrease in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax due to the impact on floating 
rate borrowings.

The impact of a 50 bps increase in interest rates on profit before tax will be as disclosed above with the exception that gains would 
be converted to losses.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has significant investments and operations in India. Accordingly, its financial state of affairs can be affected significantly 
by movements in the INR/US dollar exchange rates.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an operating unit in 
currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. 114 Financial statements

The Group’s exposure to foreign currency arises in part where a Group company holds financial assets and liabilities denominated 
in a currency different from the functional currency of that entity with US dollar being the major non-functional currency of the 
Group’s main operating subsidiaries. Set out below is the impact of a 10% movement in the US dollar on profit before tax arising 
as a result of the revaluation of the Group’s foreign currency financial assets and liabilities:

Effect of 10% strengthening of US dollars against INR on profit before tax: (260.3) (241.9)
The Group enters into foreign currency swaps, options and forward contracts are used to mitigate the risk arising from fluctuations 
in foreign exchange rates to cover foreign currency payments and receipts. The Group also enters into forward foreign exchange 
contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales and purchase transactions.
The Group has taken forward cover of US$1,534.9 million (2012: US$1,038.9 million) to hedge against currency risk against 
movement in INR/US dollar. The Group has also taken sell forward cover of US$224.3 million and currency swaps of US$378.7 million 
in INR/US dollar.
The impact of a 10% weakening of the US dollar on profit before tax will be the same as disclosed above except that losses would 
be converted to gains.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. The Group is also exposed to credit risk from trade 
receivables, dues from related parties, term deposits, liquid investments and other financial instruments.
The Group trades with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Cash, liquid investments and term deposits are held and 
derivatives are dealt with in banks either international or domestic with high credit ratings reflecting the needs of the Group to 
operate in territories where international credit ratings are limited by the credit rating of the relevant territory. It is the Group’s policy 
that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances 
are monitored on an ongoing basis. For transactions that do not occur in the country of the relevant operating unit, the Group 
does not offer credit terms without the approval of the appropriate authority.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful 
accounts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. Trade receivables disclosed 
above include amounts (see below for aged analysis) which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has 
not recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
amounts are still considered recoverable. No allowance for doubtful debts has been made in the accounts as at 31 March 2013 
and 31 March 2012. None of those trade debtors past due or impaired have had their terms renegotiated. The maximum exposure

to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of debtors presented in the financial statement. The Group does 
not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over balances with third parties nor does it have a legal right of offset against 
any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.
The Group has assigned certain amounts in respect of its sales tax obligations to a related party which has been guaranteed by a 
counterparty as described in Note 29.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables is as follows:

1–5 years 161.7 59.5
5 years plus – 18.3
Total 442.3 284.5
The aged receivables include US$190.6 million (2012: US$169.9 million) in respect of amounts billed for supply of power to 
GUVNL. Payments on ordinary ongoing billings are received from GUVNL regularly and are offset against amounts due. Overdue 
amounts which are five years or greater are in relation to amounts due for construction activities performed which the Group have 
been successful in securing award of payment through arbitration proceedings. The awards have since been challenged by the 
counterparties. The amounts have not been provided for on the basis of the arbitration award in favour of the Group.
Liquidity risk
Group companies monitor their risk of shortage of funds using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider the maturity 
of their financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.
The Group’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective and reliable 
manner and to manage its capital structure in line with its two internal debt protection ratios. A balance between continuity of 
funding and flexibility is maintained through the use of bank loans, debentures, preference shares and finance leases. The Group 
expects to pay 54.2% (2012: 55.2%) of its total liabilities within the next one year. The maturity profile of the Group’s financial 
liabilities on a gross basis is given in the table below:

24. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
The majority of the Group’s derivative financial instruments mature within 12 months of each reporting end. The undiscounted 
cash flows in respect of derivative financial instruments are US$1,987 .3 million (2012: US$1,700.7 million). Note where the amount 
payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates as 
illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.
Commodity price risk
The prices of refined petroleum products and crude oil are linked to the international prices. The Group’s revenues, costs and 
inventories are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the international markets. From 
time to time, the Group uses commodity derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecast 
crude oil purchases and refined product sales. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes 
in their fair value are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
The Group operates a risk management desk that uses hedging instruments to seek to reduce the impact of market volatility 
in crude oil and product prices on the Group’s profitability. To this end, the Group’s risk management desk uses a range of 
conventional oil price-related financial and commodity derivative instruments such as futures, swaps and options that are available 
in the commodity derivative markets. The derivative instruments used for hedging purposes typically do not expose the Group to 
market risk because the change in their market value is usually offset by an equal and opposite change in the market value of 
the underlying asset, liability or transaction being hedged. The Group’s open positions in commodity derivative instruments are 
monitored and managed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with its stated risk management policy which has been approved 
by the management.
Set out below is the impact of 10% increase or decrease in base crude and petroleum product prices on profit before tax as a 
result of change in value of the Group’s commodity derivative instruments:

their production.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives while managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide adequate 
returns for its shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group’s policy is generally to optimise borrowings at an 
operating company level within an acceptable level of debt. Equity funding for existing operations or new acquisitions is raised 
centrally, first from excess cash and then from new borrowings while retaining on an acceptable level of debt for the consolidated 
Group. The Group’s policy is to borrow using a mixture of long-term and short-term debts from both local and international 
financial markets as well as multi-lateral organisations together with cash generated to meet anticipated funding requirements.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is calculated as underlying net debt divided by total capital plus underlying 
net debt. The Group measures its underlying net debt as total debt (excluding short-term working capital facilities but not long-
term facilities disclosed as currently due or other short-term facilities treated as part of the capital of the Group) reduced by cash 
and cash equivalents and bank deposits (excluding cash balances or bank deposits identified for specific uses or not available to 
the Group for general purposes). Total equity includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the Group as well as non-
controlling interest.

The current gearing ratio of 67 .2% (2012: 63.2%) reflects the current stage of our business cycle where individual projects are 
financed using relatively high levels of debt, but with long debt amortisation periods of up to 10 years. This is normal for large 
infrastructure projects in the power and oil and gas sectors and is appropriate for the current circumstances of the Group, but is 
expected to reduce over time as projects mature. As these projects enter operations, gearing levels are expected to reduce over 
time and loans are repaid and/or refinanced on more attractive terms. The Directors consider funding requirement on a case-by-
case basis with a focus on the type of project and its stage development.

Financial guarantee contracts 0.9 1.8
Total 12,550.8 11,471.9
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are estimated at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a 
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Other than fair value of derivatives set out in 
Note 22, the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
a) Cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and other current liabilities approximate 
their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities or nature of these instruments.
b) The fair value of loans from banks and other financial indebtedness as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated 
by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities. The 
discounting rate ranges from 7 .5% to 14.75%.
The Group financial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are derivatives (Note 22). 
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7 , being those 
derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. price) or indirectly 
(i.e. derived from prices). There were no transfers between categories throughout the periods presented. The carrying value of all 
other financial assets and liabilities closely approximate their fair value except for borrowings (Note 19) where fair values are 
estimated to be US$8,714.0 million (2012: US$7 ,290.4 million).
26. Business combinations
15 months ended 31 March 2012 – Acquisition of Stanlow Refinery
On 31 July 201 1, Essar Energy plc through its subsidiary Essar Oil UK Limited purchased the Stanlow Refinery from Shell UK 
Limited (‘Shell’) for a total consideration of $1, 174.0 million including inventory.
The Stanlow Refinery, located on the south side of the Mersey estuary near Ellesmere Port, began commercial operations in 1952, 
building upon a pre-existing blending and distribution terminal.
It has a Nelson Complexity of 8.2 and accounts for around 15% of production from UK refineries. The Stanlow Refinery produces 
approximately 3.5 billion litres of petrol a year, which is one sixth of the UK total, plus it produces around 1.5 billion litres of 
kerosene per year, used for aircraft fuel.
Name of operations acquired Principal activity Date of acquisition Percentage acquired Cost of acquisition
Stanlow Refinery – now Essar Oil UK Ltd. Refining of hydrocarbon product 31 July 2011 100% US$1,174.0 million
As part of the acquisition, Essar Energy acquired, among other things, all the fixed assets, the transfer of most of the land at the 
Stanlow Refinery site (including the former Burmah refinery site) and the assignment of a number of lease agreements (including 
the Tranmere crude terminal lease, the White Oil Docks lease and the Carrington lease), agreements to operate certain chemical 
assets, the road gantry and the distribution terminal, the commercial bulk fuels marketing business and the local marine marketing 
business as well as the transfer of staff at the Stanlow Refinery.

26. Business combinations continued 
The Group accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the purchase method. The Group recognised a bargain 
purchase gain in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) on the Stanlow Refinery transaction on the basis that the 
fair value of net assets acquired was greater than the total consideration paid to Shell plc by US$43.9 million.
The Directors believe that the Group acquired the Stanlow Refinery at a competitive price when compared with other recent 
refinery transactions. The acquired refinery in the past has delivered margins above the International Energy Association Brent 
NWE cracking margins.
The Stanlow Refinery is geographically very well positioned. It provides Essar Energy access to a UK energy route between 
London and Manchester as well as access into the north-west and central parts of the UK. The Stanlow Refinery has significant 
distribution capabilities supported by extensive pipeline logistics, inland and coastal waterways, roads and rail. The Stanlow 
Refinery is ideally placed to process North Sea and West/North African crudes.
The acquisition is aligned with Essar Energy’s strategy to provide options for the export of products from the Company’s high 
value refinery at Vadinar, in Gujarat state, India. This bargain purchase was recognised in the Group income statement within other 
gains and losses as at 31 December 201 1. The gain was non-taxable.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of this business combination as at the date of acquisition were:

Total cost of acquisition 1,174.0
Note a: As part of the acquisition, in order to obtain industrial approval, the Group was required to maintain the defined benefit 
scheme for Shell employees transferring across as part of the acquisition and match the benefit which was currently being 
provided for those existing employees. The Group has an obligation to the scheme in respect of benefits for future service at the 
rates agreed, but because this arises on future service only, it was not provided upon acquisition. Shell provided the Group with a 
cash payment of US$61.5 million covering the discounted amount of the future cash flow obligation associated with the defined 
benefit scheme over a 10-year period. In addition a payment of US$1.4 million was also made in respect of untaken leave. These 
payments were recognised as a reduction in the purchase consideration. 120 Financial statements

Claim by customer 106.8 113.5
Others 14.7 19.3
Total 464.2 668.3
Contingent liabilities relate predominantly to actual or potential litigation of the Group for which amounts are reasonably assessable 
but the liability is not probable and therefore the Group has not provided for such amounts in these consolidated financial statements. 
The amounts relate to a number of actions against the Group. Key contingent liabilities have been discussed below:
Interest on sales tax benefit
As discussed in Note 8a, the Government of Gujarat had claimed interest on the sales tax amounting to US$396.0 million 
(Rs.20.25 billion) as at 31 March 2012. Based on legal advice obtained by the Group, the Directors did not consider it likely that 
material interest was payable on the outstanding sales tax liability. However as a claim had been made against the Group by the 
Government of Gujarat, this was disclosed as a contingent liability in the financial year ending 31 March 2012.
On 13 September 2012, the Honourable Supreme Court of India directed EOL to pay interest at 10% with effect from 17 January 
2012 only and remit the sales tax liability of US$980.2 million including interest in eight equal quarterly instalments starting from 
2 January 2013. The interest on sales tax liability appearing as contingent on 31 March 2012 is no longer contingent in nature as it 
has been provided for, to the extent payable.
Claim by customer
GUVNL, an entity controlled by the State of Gujarat, has in its claim against the Group alleged that EPOL (a subsidiary of the 
Group) diverted electricity generated by its Hazira power plant to Essar Steel, a related party, in violation of its power purchase 
agreement (PPA) with the GUVNL between 1996 and 2006. The Apellate Tribunal’s judgement in this matter was in favour of the 
Group. GUVNL has however filed an appeal before the Honourable Supreme Court of India against the order of the Apellate 
Tribunal. The case is pending to be heard in the Supreme Court. The amount of GUVNL ’s revised claim is US$106.8 million based 
on Gujarat Electric Regulatory Commission (GERC) order. However the Group remains confident of its position as noted below.
On 29 January 2010, EPOL filed a petition before the GERC against GUVNL claiming certain payments due to it under the PPA. 
EPOL has made a claim for an aggregate amount of US$72.4 million (31 March 2012: US$77 .0 million) comprising delayed 
payment charges, depreciation, foreign exchange variation, interest on debentures, bill discounting charges, interest on working 
capital and alleged wrongful deduction of rebates by GUVNL. On 13 February 2013, the Group has filed amended applications for 
an updated amount of US$140.7 million. The matter is pending before the GERC. The amount of receivables from GUVNL at 
31 March 2013 is US$193. 1 million.
In respect of the outstanding claims, the Group does not expect to incur costs or loss in excess of amounts provided in defending 
its position and recovering its dues.
Disputed sales tax and VAT
The Company has been assessed for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009 under the Gujarat VAT Act & CST Act. The Dy. 
Commissioner of Commercial Tax, Petroleum Cell -1 has imposed an additional liability of US$121.3 million (including interest and 
penalty) under VAT & CST for Assessment of 2008–09 on an erroneous interpretation of exemption Notification for sale of kerosene 
sold through the Public Distribution System (‘PDS’) and Liquified Petroleum Gas (for domestic use) to Public Sector Undertaking 
(‘PSUs’) Companies. Based on legal opinion the Company has filed first appeals before the learned Joint Commissioner of 
Commercial tax against the assessment orders so passed against it under the respective Acts and accordingly this has been 
disclosed as contingent liability for financial year ending 31 March 2013.
Disputed income tax
Not included in the table above is a claim arising from a draft assessment received by EPOL regarding the compulsory convertible 
preference shares (‘CCPS’) issued, during FY08–09, to the holding company Essar Power Holding Limited. Essar applied the net 
asset value and profit earning capacity valuation methodologies to this transaction. The transfer pricing officer has challenged the 
methodology on the basis that the discounted cash flow method is more appropriate. While presently no demand has been 
raised, and the matter is before the Dispute Resolution authority, the tax implication of the change in the valuation method by the 
transfer pricing officer is approximately US$137 .7 million (excluding penalty and interest). Management consider the risk of 
successful challenge by the tax authorities to be remote based on the strength of their technical arguments. 122 Financial statements

Not included in the table above are a number of other claims in connection with the Group. However, management believes that

28c. Corporate guarantees
The Group has provided a number of guarantees in respect of companies outside of the Group to third party lenders that were 
entered into prior to IPO and amount to US$23. 1 million (2012: US$31.5 million). Any potential losses incurred in the future by the 
Group in respect of these guarantees are indemnified by EGFL.
The majority of guarantees provided have been treated as insurance contracts in line with the Group’s accounting policies.
29. Related parties
The Group, as discussed in Note 1, is part of the wider group of companies controlled by EGFL. The Group enters into a number 
of transactions with EGFL and its subsidiaries (together ‘EGFL Group’) and other related parties (together ‘related parties’). The 
Group shares many functions and services that are performed by various related parties for which costs are allocated across the 
relevant benefiting entities which have benefited. The costs have been historically allocated on a basis which the related parties 
believe is a reasonable reflection of the utilisation of each service provided or the benefit received by each related party. The 
allocated costs, while reasonable, may not necessarily be indicative of the costs that would have been incurred by the Company 
if it had performed these functions or received these services as a standalone entity.
The Company and EGFL entered into a Relationship Agreement, the principal purpose of which was to ensure that following 
listing, the Group was capable of carrying on its business independently of EGFL and its associates.
Balances and transactions between entities within the Group, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation 
and are not disclosed in this note.
The related parties in respect of whom transactions and balances have been mentioned above have been identified based on the 
definition of related parties provided in IAS24 as well as the requirements of the UK Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.

required by the Companies Act 2006 and prepared in accordance with IFRS (as endorsed by the EU) and the relevant Group 
accounting policies as set out in Note 1 and Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.
Change in accounting year
The Indian Income Tax Act requires Indian companies to file their annual accounts and returns based on the year ended 31 March. 
All Indian companies within the Group prepare their accounts on this basis. To ensure that all accounting periods are aligned 
within the Group, the Company decided to also move its year end from 31 December to 31 March, effective from 31 March 2012. 
Accordingly, comparative figures are for 15 months ended 31 March 2012 and hence not comparable.
Investment
Investments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries held at cost less provision for impairment.
The Directors have taken the exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate 
income statement for the parent company. The loss after tax for the period of the Company amounted to US$91.7 million (2012: 
US$75. 1 million). The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Investments in subsidiaries

The Group issued 4.25% US$550.0 million guaranteed convertible bonds in 201 1. The bonds are convertible into fully paid 
ordinary shares of Essar Energy plc. The bondholders have the option to convert at any time from 14 March 201 1 to 24 January 
2016. The loan notes are convertible at US$1 1.0861 per share at a fixed exchange rate of 1GBP:US$1.5955.
If the notes have not been converted they can be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time on or after 15 March 2014 
subject to certain conditions or, if not converted or previously redeemed, will be redeemed at par on 1 February 2016. The interest 
charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 9.5% to the liability component. The net proceeds of the 
convertible issues have been split between the liability element and equity and accounted US$107 .0 million in equity as convertible 
bond reserves, less subsequent transfers, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity,

Appendix 1
Definition and comparability of CP GRM
GRM is calculated as actual sales net of crude costs derived from the accounts. Inventory gains and losses, hedging gains and 
losses and sales tax benefit for the period also form part of the GRM. Based on this method of calculation, Essar Energy’s 
reported GRMs are not directly comparable to the performance of other refiners, other refining benchmarks and industry reports 
due to following reasons: 
` ` In India, domestic products are sold between oil companies on an agreed formula which is market driven known as Refinery 
Transfer Price, (RTP) except for solids like Petcoke and Sulphur which are sold directly to customers at company determined 
rates. RTP for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) and Kerosene are based on the average market price 
of the previous month, while for other products including Gasoil and Gasoline it is based on the average market price of the 
previous fortnight. As a result, the actual revenues may not match the prevailing product prices for the period. 
` ` The Company adopts first in, first out (FIFO) methodology for crude inventory valuation. As a consequence the cost of crude 
consumed can be crude purchased in earlier periods which may not reflect current prevailing crude prices. For crudes with a 
long voyage time these differences can be more significant. This effect is low at Stanlow Refinery where crude oil is bought just 
in time.
` ` Sales quantity does not directly match actual production during the period as there may be inventory movement compared to a 
previous period. 
` ` Commodity derivative instruments are used to act as an economic hedge against the price risk of forecast crude oil purchases, 
future refined product sales and future product crack margins. The Company has adopted hedge accounting during the year 
because of which the fair value gains or losses on the commodity derivative instruments are recorded in other comprehensive 
income. Fair value gain or loss on other derivative instruments not covered under hedge accounting are recorded in the income 
statement. 
` ` The following adjustments are made to the GRM to provide a CP GRM that reflects underlying operational performance and 
better communicates industry comparable performance of the refinery. These adjustments are as follows: 
` – Actual production quantities are taken as the sales quantities during the period. This eliminates the effect of inventory gains 
and losses in the CP GRM. For Vadinar these sales quantities as determined above are bifurcated into export and domestic 
sales based on the quality of the products being sold in domestic and export market. The domestic quantity is further 
bifurcated into different segments in the ratio of actual sales for the period. 
` – The cost of crude is taken at the current prices of crude grades actually consumed, The cost of crude also includes other 
expenses directly attributable to crude procurement. 
` – In India, to calculate the revenue from the sales quantity the domestic sales price is valued based on the applicable RTP of 
the same period rather than any other period. Export prices are based on actual realised export prices, as they do not have 
timing differences. Revenue is adjusted for premiums or discounts achieved by the Company. For domestic sales custom 
duty recovery is built up in RTP itself whilst Duty Benefit for exports is added separately. 
` – In the UK, as there is no equivalent RTP , both domestic and export revenues are based on average prices for the month 
inclusive of applicable premiums and discounts.
` – The impact of hedging gains or losses is excluded.  139

the Group’s strategy, operations, financial performance or 
condition, outlook, growth opportunities or circumstances in 
the countries, sectors or markets in which the Group operates. 
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve uncertainty 
because they depend on future circumstances, and relate to 
events, not all of which are within the Group’s control or can be 
predicted by the Group. Although the Group believes that the 
expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are 
reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations 
will prove to be correct. Actual results could differ materially 
from those set out in the forward-looking statements. For a 
detailed analysis of the factors that may affect our business, 
financial performance or results of operations, we urge you to 
look at the principal risks and uncertainties included in this 
Annual Report and accounts. No part of these results 
constitutes, or shall be taken to constitute, an invitation or 
inducement to invest in the Group or any other entity, and 
must not be relied upon in any way in connection with any 
investment decision. The Group undertakes no obligation to 
update any forward-looking statements. www.EssarEnergy.com

  We are encouraged by the recovery 
in our end markets and the greater 
visibility of future revenue afforded  
by the increased order book.  
The Group has a range of  
substantial growth opportunities  
and the balance sheet strength to 
enable us to exploit them.
  Gordon	P age
Chairman
I am pleased to report a solid financial performance for Hamworthy,  
achieved against a backdrop of a lower order book at the start of the year.  
We have maintained our commitment to product development and once  
again remained strongly cash generative. 
Higher levels of new project activity in our core markets coupled with success 
in increasing our penetration of key market sectors has delivered a significant 
increase in order intake during the year with the closing order book 82% ahead 
of prior year end.
Reflecting market conditions, underlying operating profit was 30% lower at 
£13.8 million (2010: £19.7 million) with underlying basic earnings per share 26% 
lower at 24.1p (2010: 32.6p). Statutory earnings per share decreased 31% to 
23.2p per share (2010: 33.4p).
We have continued to invest in expanding our product portfolio with 
expenditure on research and development increasing by 23% to £4.8 million 
(2010: £3.9 million). This investment in developing new technologies, particularly 
in environmentally responsible products, is a core element of the Group’s strategy 
and will provide a platform for future growth.
Once again the Group has achieved strong net cash flows with positive operating 
cash flow of £19.7 million (2010: £27.0 million) leading to a closing net funds 
balance of £83.9 million (2010: £72.3 million). This provides substantial support 
for both organic development and strategic acquisitions.

Company overview
5 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011
We remain committed to recruiting, retaining and developing 
the best people and our breadth of talented employees will 
play a critical role in the Group’s future success.
Order intake was nearly three times that of the prior year at 
£290.5 million (2010: £99.0 million) driven by a recovery 
in our core markets and success in growing the Group’s 
position in key target market sectors. In particular the Group 
significantly improved its position in the upstream oil & gas 
market and continues the successful development of its 
Aftersales service and support business. The closing order 
book for the year was £258.1 million (2010: £142.1 million).
The Group has maintained its focus on improving 
operational efficiency with gains made in both 
manufacturing and supply chain and this has provided 
some protection to operating margins, despite the reduced 
revenue whilst enabling the Group to increase its investment 
in research and development.
We are encouraged by the recovery in our end markets 
and the greater visibility of future revenue afforded by the 
increased order book. The Group has a range of substantial 
growth opportunities and the balance sheet strength to 
enable us to exploit these both organically and by added 
value acquisitions. We will continue to pursue operational 
excellence and expect this to deliver improvement in our net 
margin as the Group returns to growth.
These results and our improved outlook are reflected in the 
Board’s commitment to a progressive dividend policy and 
your directors are recommending a final dividend of 6.73p 
which, if approved, would represent a 10% increase in the 
total dividend declared in respect of the year to 10.09p 
per share (2010: 9.17p). Subject to shareholders’ approval 
the final dividend will be paid on 21 July 2011 to all 
shareholders on the register on 17 June 2011. 
On behalf of the Board I thank all of our employees 
for their contributions to another year of significant 
achievement. We remain committed to recruiting, 
retaining and developing the best people and our breadth 
of talented employees will play a critical role in the Group’s 
future success.
We have made good progress during the year and the 
Group is now in a strong position to deliver growth as 
our core markets recover. As a result your Board expects 
a near-term improvement in the Group’s performance and 
looks to the future with significantly increased confidence.

Operational highlights
The Group has made good progress through the year in maintaining  
a strong position in our core market sectors as they recover, and in  
growing market share in a number of the key markets targeted as part  
of our growth strategy. 
 A record order intake enabled the 
Group to rebuild the order book at 
year end to £258.1 million, 81.7% 
higher than at the previous year end.
  Joe	Oatley
Chief Executive
Chief Executive’s review
As a result, order intake improved significantly to £290.5 million, up 193% on 
2010 (2010: £99.0 million). Particularly strong order intake performances were 
achieved by our Oil & Gas Systems business with a near ten-fold increase on 2010 
and our Pump Systems business that reported order intake up 172% on 2010. 
This strong order intake enabled the Group to rebuild the order book at year end 
to £258.1 million, 81.7% higher than at the previous year end (31 March 2010: 
£142.1 million).
Revenue was impacted by the market weakness in the prior year that led to a 
reduced order book as the Group entered the year. As a result, revenue decreased by 
15.3% to £181.6 million (2010: £214.3 million) with all divisions seeing a reduction 
in activity compared to the prior year. The performance of the Group improved as we 
progressed through the year and as a result of the strong order intake, revenue in the 
second half of the year was 18.5% higher than in the first half.
Group underlying operating margin reduced to 7.6% (2010: 9.2%) with this 
reduction largely driven by the strategic decision to maintain our technical and 
operational capability in our Oil & Gas Systems business, despite very low levels 
of revenue in the first half of the year, coupled with a significant increase in research 
and development investment across the Group. Within the Oil & Gas Systems 
business, the second half underlying operating margin improved to 6.3% as 
revenue increased. The Pump Systems business continued to perform strongly with 
underlying operating margin close to the high level achieved in the previous year.
The performance of individual businesses is reviewed in the divisional review on 
pages 20 to 27. Aftersales activities across the Group continued to perform well 
with order intake increasing by 23.1% to £45.3 million (2010: £36.8 million) and 
revenue increasing by 9.9% to £41.0 million (2010: £37.3 million). The Aftersales 
business is run as a matrix organisation and the constituent parts of the Aftersales 
revenue are included in the divisional revenues.

The Group’s operations in Suzhou, China moved into a 
new 15,000m
2
 manufacturing facility in January 2011 
to replace our existing smaller plant in the same region. 
This new facility currently carries out the assembly and test 
of the Group’s waste treatment and inert gas products and 
it is planned that it will also provide the capacity for the 
assembly of many of the Group’s new products. The facility 
supplies both to the local market in China and to the wider 
global market.
Strategy
Hamworthy continues to follow a robust and clear strategy 
with four key elements:
• expand the business into adjacent markets with 
long-term growth characteristics;
• invest in research and development to achieve and 
sustain leadership positions in key target markets;
• improve margins through operational excellence; and
• expand the technology base and market positions of the 
Group through strategic acquisitions.
We have made good progress during the year in growing 
the business in markets adjacent to the marine newbuild 
market that has been at the historical core of the Group. 
In particular the Group has significantly improved its 
position in the upstream oil & gas market, winning a 
breakthrough order for deepwell cargo pumps for a series 
of eight newbuild FPSOs to be deployed in Brazil and 
successfully commercialising the acquired VIEC oil/water 
upstream separation technology, winning orders for this 
product for oil production platforms in the North Sea, 
Brazil and the Middle East.
We continue to focus on developing our Aftersales business 
and have established Hamworthy Services as a global brand 
giving our customers consistently high levels of support 
wherever they are in the world. The Group has secured 
a number of long-term support agreements with key 
customers and expanded its service offerings to include 
products such as control system upgrades and operator 
training in addition to our more traditional spares and 
service capabilities. The Aftersales business achieved record 
levels of orders and sales in 2011.
Whilst growing in adjacent markets, Hamworthy aims to 
maintain its strong market positions within the marine 
newbuild market and we target the expansion of our market 
share in marine newbuild sectors that have long-term 
growth prospects. The Group achieved particular success 
in establishing a strong position in the small gas carrier 
market: following two small initial contracts won in the 
prior year, the Oil & Gas Systems business was successful in 
winning two significant contracts to provide cargo handling 
systems for small gas carriers, one series of which will be 
constructed in China and the other series of vessels in Brazil. 
These two contracts were of an aggregate value in excess of 
£70 million and securing them establishes Hamworthy as a 
leading player in this sector.
Once again the Group has increased research and 
development investment both to improve the ongoing 
competitiveness of our existing products and also to 
ensure that we are well placed to exploit new market 
opportunities as they arise. Total Group internally-funded 
research and development grew by 23.0% to £4.8 million 
with the most significant investments being made in 
expanding our range of products for the upstream oil & 
gas market and developing solutions for the emerging 
environmentally-driven markets of exhaust gas cleaning and 
ballast water treatment. Both of these markets are expected 
to provide significant medium-term opportunities for the 
Group and some early success has already been achieved 
with the exhaust gas cleaning product, securing a four 
shipset commercial order and a contract for a system to be 
fitted to a container vessel as part of a trial supported by the 
US Environmental Protection Agency.
Business review Chief Executive’s review
A balanced business in 
long-term growth markets 
We aim to achieve a balance of earnings across 
specialist sectors within the oil & gas, marine 
and service markets, targeting investment  
in areas with long-term growth prospects.
Leadership through 
market-led innovation 
We seek to be leaders in our chosen sectors 
and invest in new technology development  
to both strengthen our existing market  
positions and develop solutions to  
meet new opportunities.
Strategic acquisitions
We are targeting strategic acquisitions 
 to extend both the technology base and 
market positions of our existing businesses.
Operational excellence  
and a flexible cost base
We will achieve sustained margin  
improvement through a focus on operational 
efficiency and effectiveness. We outsource lower 
added-value parts of the manufacturing chain, 
maintaining a flexible cost base and minimising 
invested capital.

Chief Executive’s review (continued)
Strategy	(continued)
We continue to focus on improving cost efficiency though our drive for operational 
excellence. Good progress was made in both reducing procurement costs and 
increasing manufacturing efficiency which mitigated the effect on Group underlying 
operating margin of the lower level of revenue and the increased investment in 
research and development. These cost efficiency improvements have also enabled 
the Group to offset the effects of increasing raw material costs and instances of our 
competitors pricing more aggressively as they attempt to rebuild their order books.
As part of the establishment of the new manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, the 
Group has implemented a new management and operating methodology based on 
the latest techniques for lean manufacturing. This is now being used as the blueprint 
to be rolled out across the other main manufacturing sites across the Group. During 
the year we completed the transfer of the order processing and contract management 
for our marine inert gas systems products from Norway to our facility in China.
The Group’s acquisition strategy is based on targeting specific businesses that 
will complement our organic development by expanding our technology base 
and strengthening our market positions in key target markets. The focus during 
the last year has been on increasing the pipeline of acquisition opportunities we 
are pursuing and this increased portfolio of acquisition prospects gives the Group 
confidence that it will be able to successfully complete a number of strategic 
transactions in the near future.
Health, 	 safety 	and 	environmental
Hamworthy continues to invest in its group-wide commitment to improving its 
safety culture. Both lost-time accidents and near-misses, where a potentially unsafe 
event occurred but no injury was sustained, are recorded and investigated. During 
the year a process was implemented that enabled and encouraged the sharing of 
lessons learned from both of these types of incident in order to prevent recurrences. 
Despite this focus it is disappointing to report an 11% increase in the number of 
lost-time accidents compared to the prior year, although the severity of accidents 
has reduced, with the total number of days lost during the year due to accidents 
falling by 18% to 70. These accidents have all been investigated in detail both 
in order to prevent recurrence and also to ensure that there was no common 
underlying cause. Hamworthy will continue in its efforts to eliminate injuries across 
the Group by continually seeking safer workplaces, processes and behaviour.
The Group is mindful of the environmental impact that its activities may have 
on the communities in which it operates and strives to minimise the effect of 
this. All of Hamworthy’s principal sites are accredited under the ISO 14001 
environmental standard. Furthermore, many of its products have a direct 
environmental benefit and they are often designed to ensure that its customers 
can meet relevant environmental legislation.
Employees
Last year was a difficult year for many of our employees within the Group 
given the reduced headcount across its operations. The workforce is now being 
increased in some parts of the Group in order to meet the recent growth in our 
order book commitments, in some cases re-employing those affected by previous 
layoffs. This is a testament to the professional and sensitive way the headcount 
reduction was handled.
The Group remains committed to the development of its people and we continue 
to invest in our group-wide Leadership Development Programme that provides a 
foundation for the development of our leaders and managers of the future.
Hamworthy’s core values (page 30) play an important role in the way our 
employees behave and in the way performance is measured. We measure our 
management not only on quantitative results but also on commitment to these 
core values. We believe that behaving in line with our core values is an important 
element of achieving long-term sustained performance. Business review

Business review Chief Executive’s review
Markets
2010 witnessed a recovery in several of the Group’s markets, 
although the pattern of demand was uneven, with some 
segments of the new shipbuilding market showing only 
slight improvement in the rate of new vessel contracting 
from the lows seen in 2009.
The offshore market has rebounded strongly, in particular 
for FPSOs, with 23 newbuild and conversion projects 
reported during 2010. Of these, eight newbuild FPSOs 
are destined for the development of Brazil’s pre-salt finds 
in the Campos basin. Deepwater offshore investment 
continues to be supported by high oil prices and the 
need to replace falling production from existing fields. 
This market remains a key area of focus for Hamworthy’s 
business development efforts.
Within the shipbuilding market, contracting activity for small 
gas carriers recovered strongly, with a more modest increase 
for larger gas carriers as ship owners took advantage of 
falling newbuild prices at major yards. The volume of new 
contracting of tankers, although substantially ahead of 
the lows seen in 2009, nevertheless remained relatively 
subdued, in particular for smaller product and chemical 
carriers. Demand for larger oil tankers is being supported 
by China where new vessels are being contracted primarily 
for domestic owners. Hamworthy is well positioned in this 
market with a strong reference list and a long-established 
sales and manufacturing presence.
Demand for the Group’s LNG regasification systems has 
increased substantially during the year, in particular from 
Asia where natural gas is increasingly being seen as an 
attractive fuel for power generation.
The field population of Hamworthy equipment continues to 
grow and we have seen strong demand for our Aftersales 
products and services, in particular from the offshore market.
Outlook
Order intake for original equipment has recovered strongly, 
strengthening the order book at the year end and providing 
improved visibility of future revenues. In addition, our 
Aftersales business continues to perform well. As a result the 
Board now believes its previous expectations for the financial 
year ending 31 March 2012 will be significantly exceeded.
The improvement in our end markets, in particular upstream 
oil & gas, and those related to LNG and LPG is encouraging. 
As our business returns to growth we will continue to tightly 
manage our cost base and this, combined with our drive for 
operational excellence, will help us achieve our medium-term 
goal of sustainable double digit group operating margin.
We see a broad range of medium and long-term organic 
growth opportunities for the Group, both within our existing 
markets, driven in particular by increasing investment in 
deepwater offshore oil production and continued growth in 
demand for LNG, and in emerging markets largely driven by 
tightening environmental regulations in the marine and oil 
& gas markets. We are investing in developing solutions to 
meet new environmental regulations, in particular those for 
ballast water treatment and reducing emissions from ships’ 
engines and boilers. In this latter market it is encouraging 
to have received early orders for Hamworthy’s exhaust gas 
cleaning system. 
We have grown the portfolio of strategic acquisition 
prospects under consideration and the Group has 
substantial balance sheet strength to support both 
our organic and acquisition growth strategies.
As a result of the above the Board now looks forward  
with significantly increased confidence.

that enable vessels to meet their legislative obligations. Fitting our 
exhaust gas cleaning systems allows ship owners and operators to 
comply with the new rules and avoid using high-cost, low-sulphur 
fuel. We are leaders in this market with our systems having been 
proven during thousands of hours of operation at sea. We secured

Basis	of	reporting
The Group financial statements in this report have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted for use in the 
EU, together with the associated International Financial Reporting Interpretation 
Council (IFRIC) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to entities reporting under IFRS.
Accounting 	policies
The Group has reviewed its accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 
and determined that they are appropriate for the Group and have been 
consistently applied.
Underlying 	earnings
Underlying profit is used by the Board to measure and monitor the underlying 
performance of the Group. Set out at the top of page 17 is a reconciliation of 
profit calculated for statutory disclosure and the underlying measure. The measure 
used in the prior year has been amended to include intangible asset amortisation 
which is now considered sufficiently material in 2011 to require adjustment.
Results 	overview
The Group started the year with an historically low order book reflecting the fall 
in order intake in the prior year. Actions taken to mitigate the effects of lower 
activity enabled the Group to report a solid financial performance, maintaining its 
commitment to product development and continuing to generate healthy cash flows. 
As anticipated, revenue fell 15.3% to £181.6 million (2010: £214.3 million). 
Underlying operating profit was 29.9% lower at £13.8 million (2010: £19.7 million), 
with net underlying operating margin decreasing to 7.6% (2010: 9.2%).

17 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011
The Group generated 67% (2010: 75%) of its underlying 
operating profits before unallocated corporate expenses in 
reporting currencies other than sterling, the most significant 
being euro, Danish kroner, Norwegian kroner, Singapore 
dollar and Chinese renminbi. The weighted average rate 
for these currencies, impacted mostly by movement in 
the Singapore dollar, strengthened by 7.3% compared to 
the prior year which had the effect of increasing sterling 
consolidated revenue by £4.1 million and underlying 
operating profits by £0.9 million.
Expenditure on research and development rose 23.0% from 
£3.9 million in the prior year to £4.8 million with a particular 
focus on enhancing the technologies, and bringing to market 
systems for the ballast water and ships’ exhaust sulphur 
emissions markets. The Group received its first commercial 
order for this latter technology during the year. 
The Group capitalises research and development expenditure 
where required to do so under IAS 38. One of the criteria 
for capitalisation set out in that accounting standard is the 
demonstration of the technical feasibility of completing 
the intangible asset. The directors consider that meeting 
the criteria can only be demonstrated when the developed 
product is fully tested and, where required, regulatory body 
approvals are received. It is likely therefore that research 
and development projects will have the majority of their 
budgeted costs expended by the time that criteria is met.
Underlying profit before taxation as calculated above 
fell 27.6% to £14.6 million (2010: £20.2 million). 
The prolonged low level of global interest rates resulted 
in continuing low net interest income of £0.7 million 
(2010: £0.4 million) despite a rise in net cash balances.
The Group’s undelivered order book rose from 
£142.1 million to £258.1 million.
Acquisitions
The Group acquired the business and assets of Krystallon 
Limited on 29 September 2009 and the whole of the issued 
share capital of Greenship BV on 9 March 2009. During 
the year the directors have revised the amount of deferred 
consideration expected to be paid on these transactions 
and, in the case of Krystallon Limited, amended the fair 
value of intangible assets acquired and resulting goodwill. 
Details of the financial effects of these changes are set out 
in note 34 to the financial statements.
T axation
The tax charge of £3.6 million (2010: £5.6 million) 
represents an effective rate of 25.2% (2010: 27.0%). 
The Group generates taxable profits in a number of 
jurisdictions where the rate of corporation tax is lower 
than the UK. The most notable differences are in China and 
Singapore. The net effect of these lower foreign tax rates is 
equivalent to 6.7% of the profit before taxation. Note 12 to 
the financial statements provides details of the tax charge.
Earnings 	 per 	share
Basic underlying earnings per share fell from 32.6p per share 
to 24.1p per share. On a statutory basis, basic earnings per 
share fell to 23.2p per share (2010: 33.4p). Note 14 to the 
financial statements provides details of these calculations 
and those of the measures of diluted earnings per share for 
the period.
Dividend
The Board are recommending a final ordinary dividend of  
6.73p per share. If approved by shareholders this would 
result in a total dividend declared in respect of the year of 
10.09p per share when added to the interim dividend of 
3.36p per share paid in December 2010.

Financing,	cash 	flow 	and	treasury
The Group has maintained its focus on managing working 
capital and the generation of free cash flow. The Group’s 
strategy of maintaining a low fixed cost base reduces the 
need for investment in capital assets. Total investment in 
tangible fixed assets in the year to 31 March 2011 was higher 
than normal at £5.3 million (2010: £2.6 million) as the Group 
completed construction of its enlarged assembly facility in 
Suzhou, China. The conversion of Group profits to cash 
flow is a key financial performance indicator, as discussed 
within the KPI commentary on page 29. This is monitored 
over a rolling three year period to best accommodate the 
Group’s combination of regular cash flows in businesses with 
smaller equipment supply and greater volatility within those 
businesses with larger contracts.
A summary of cash flows and the change in net funds is set 
out above. Operating cash flow amounted to £19.7 million 
(2010: £27.0 million) which is a conversion rate of 142% of 
underlying operating profit. The conversion rate over a three 
year average is 104%. The net funds position at the year 
end was £83.9 million (2010: £72.3 million). Further detail 
relating to the cash flows and movements in net funds of 
the Group is given in the consolidated cash flow statement 
on page 50 and in notes 29 and 30 to the financial 
statements.
All businesses are responsible for the management of 
local cash and working capital requirements. The principal 
operating companies participate in a cash pooling 
arrangement under which surplus cash is transferred to a 
central treasury function which manages the most efficient 
use of funds across the Group. This central management 
balances the requirements of liquidity, return on investment 
and security. The Group has historically hedged part of 
the interest rate exposure on its term debt. At 31 March 
2011 that exposure relates to a term loan held in the 
Group’s German subsidiary with an outstanding balance of 
£0.6 million and on which the interest rate exposure is fully 
hedged to a fixed rate of 3.35%.
The Group’s businesses are global and each can contract 
in several currencies. The Group’s policy is to hedge all 
currency transaction exposures at the time of entering 
into the contractual commitment back to the relevant 
contracting business’ local currency. The significant majority 
of this hedging is operated through the central treasury 
function with all principal businesses required to reconcile 
their currency exposures and related hedges and report 
them to the treasury function as part of their financial 
reporting routines.

Business review
19 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011
The Group intends that its hedging procedures qualify 
for hedge reserve accounting as far as is practical to 
do so. This will result in any gain or loss volatility of 
hedge derivatives initially being recorded in a separate 
component of equity and not through the consolidated 
income statement. Where hedging products do not so 
qualify, the gains or losses relating to movements in 
fair values of the derivative product are recorded in the 
consolidated income statement. This occurred during the 
financial year ended 31 March 2010 and the effect was 
adjusted in arriving at underlying profit before tax and 
underlying earnings per share as shown in the statement 
of comprehensive income and detailed in note 14 to the 
financial statements.
The Group’s primary banking and finance facility is provided 
by Barclays Bank plc. This comprises a £60 million facility 
for bonds, guarantees and indemnities committed to 
30 June 2012 and capable of being increased to £80 million 
subject to the bank’s approval. The facility’s principal 
financial covenants cover the level of borrowings to earnings 
and the ratio of earnings and cash flows to debt service and 
finance costs. No covenants have been breached during the 
year. Barclays Bank also provide the majority of the Group’s 
foreign exchange hedging through an uncommitted facility 
dated 25 March 2009. In addition the Group has further 
foreign exchange and treasury facilities held centrally with 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc and held by its subsidiaries with 
local banks. The Group has not breached any covenant 
within its banking facilities during the year.
Going 	concern
The Group has available to it considerable financial resources 
including its own net funds which were £83.9 million 
at 31 March 2011 and its committed banking facilities. 
The Group’s banking covenants have all been met 
comfortably during the past year and the expectation 
is that this will continue.
The order book at 31 March 2011 was significantly 
higher than the prior year end at £258.1 million 
(2010: £142.1 million) and represented 142% of revenue 
in the financial year. The Group’s businesses have 
relationships and costs bases in diverse geographic areas.
Whilst the recent volatility in financial markets has created 
general uncertainty in respect of the economic outlook, 
the longer-term nature of the Group’s business, taken 
together with its forward order book, provide a satisfactory 
level of confidence to the Board in trading during the 
year ahead. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources and business demand drivers to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
No material uncertainties related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Company 
to continue as a going concern have been identified by the 
directors. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
Risks
The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties 
which could have a material impact on its long-term 
performance. The directors have identified those which 
they regard as being the principal risks. Those of a financial 
nature are set out below with strategic and operational risks 
being set out on page 28.
Exposure to multi‑currency markets
The Group operates globally with contracts taken in various 
currencies and the majority of its earnings being generated 
outside the UK. Changes in global currency rates can result 
in changes to expected earnings, cash flows and movements 
in net asset values if unhedged and affect the competitive 
position of the operating businesses. 
The Group’s policy is to fully hedge transactional currency 
exposure back to the reporting currency of the operating 
unit where practicable. Operating subsidiaries report 
these exposures as they arise and arrange hedging cover 
through the Group’s central treasury function. Competitively 
the Group has cost bases in various currencies which 
limits exposure to any one particular currency relative to 
competitors.
Counterparty failure
The Group contracts globally with both customers and 
suppliers whose performance and financial viability could 
have a material impact on the Group’s earnings. The failure 
of a key supplier or customer to meet its obligations to 
the Group could result in exposure to financial liabilities or 
impairment of the value of assets. The Group’s businesses 
regularly assess customer credit risk and payment terms are 
set accordingly including the use of bank instruments and 
credit insurance. Supplier performance is similarly monitored 
and, where possible, diversity of supply is integrated into 
product design.

Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011 20
The Pump Systems business designs and 
manufactures a broad range of in-line 
and long-shaft centrifugal pumps, selling 
primarily to the marine and offshore oil & 
gas markets. 
Hamworthy has market-leading positions 
in a number of segments within these 
markets including cargo pumps for 
liquefied gas carriers and engine room 
pumps for the offshore market. 
The business has two principal facilities 
based in Denmark and Singapore.
Highlights

carrier market
• Tanker market remains subdued
• Strong margins maintained
• R&D investment continued to expand range of offshore products Business review Divisional review – Pump Systems 
Business review
21 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011
Order intake was 172% above 2010 at £83.2 million 
(2010: £30.6 million) driven by a strong performance 
from the offshore oil & gas sector and a recovery in 
the gas carrier market.
The offshore market, in particular the FPSO segment, saw increased contracting 
activity through the year and the business was successful in securing several 
significant projects wins in this sector. Most noteworthy was the award of a 
contract to supply deepwell cargo pump systems for eight FPSOs to be built 
in Brazil by the shipyard Engevix Construcões Oceânicas. At approximately 
£30 million in value this is the largest pump contract ever secured by the Group 
and represents a significant breakthrough in this strategically important market.
The business was also successful in securing contracts for a number of other 
offshore vessels, securing and delivering an order for a complete firewater pump 
package for the FPSO market. The business delivered this system along with the 
cargo pump room system and seawater lift pumps to the Papa Terra FPSO which 
will be owned and operated by BW Offshore for Petrobras in Brazil. In line with 
the Group’s strategy to expand into adjacent markets, the business secured a 
contract to supply two fire water pump systems to the downstream oil & gas 
market for a BP refinery in Australia.
New contracting in the tanker market continued to be subdued, in particular 
for the smaller product and chemical carriers where there is excess capacity and 
freight rates have been low. Contracting of newbuild large crude oil carriers was 
also sporadic with the majority of activity being in China driven by demand from 
domestic owners. Despite this, the business has been successful in securing an 
order to provide cargo pump room systems for four VLCCs to be constructed at 
CSSC Guangzhou Long Xue Shipyard in China for the Chinese owner CSC Nanjing 
Tanker Co. Ltd.
Revenue fell by 24.6% to £58.0 million (2010: £76.9 million) as the effects of 
the low levels of new project contracting in 2009 across all key market segments 
fed through into revenue. Revenue for deepwell pumps and engine room pumps 
for the offshore market all declined significantly compared to the prior year due 
to reduced demand. The business was successful in gaining market share in the 
supply of pump room systems to the large tanker market and this mitigated 
somewhat the effect of the market weakness in this segment. Aftersales activity 
continued to be buoyant and remains an important element of the business.
Underlying operating margin remained strong at 16.0% (2010: 16.1%) as the 
business continued to benefit from generating an increasing proportion of its 
revenue from higher margin offshore and Aftersales segments and a continued 
focus on efficiency improvement and cost control. Raw material costs have shown 
considerable inflation throughout the year and in order to maintain margins, 
addressing this will be a key challenge for the business.
The expansion of the manufacturing plant in Singapore was completed on 
schedule and on budget in September 2010. This created an additional 2,500m
2
 
of manufacturing space to accommodate the increased activity for the offshore 
sector and also to provide improved finished goods handling facilities.
The business has continued its investment in research and development with 
a strong focus on providing new products to widen the scope of the offshore 
product offering. Larger deep well pumps for sea water lift applications and a 
range of API-610 compliant deep well pumps for offshore cargo and process 
applications have been developed and released to production. The first of a new 
range of large in-line pumps has also been completed with lower manufactured 
cost, improved serviceability and a better suitability for firewater applications.

• Awarded two further LNG regasification contracts
• Further contract awards for LNG fuel gas systems
• Revenue down due to previous year’s low order intake
The Oil & Gas Systems division provides 
a range of technologies to the mid and 
upstream oil & gas markets. The business 
has a leading position in the larger LPG 
and LNG carrier segment for reliquefaction 
systems that are used to capture boil-off 
gas and return it to the cargo tanks during 
a vessel’s journey. The business also has a 
leading position in the growing market for 
floating regasification systems that allow 
operators to regasify LNG cargoes in a 
more cost-effective manner than traditional 
land-based receiving terminals. 
The business’ oil product range enables 
offshore production facilities to increase 
yields from diminishing oil fields, safely 
store and offload cargo as well as recover 
gas that is otherwise wasted. The business’ 
operations are based in Norway.

Business review Divisional review – Oil & Gas Systems 
Order intake rebounded strongly to £152.3 million 
(2010: £14.5 million) as new contracting activity 
recovered and the division increased its penetration 
in key market sectors.
Following its entry into the small gas carrier segment in 2010, when Hamworthy 
was successful in securing its first cargo handling system order for a small fully 
pressurised LPG carrier, the business significantly grew its market share of contracts 
awarded for cargo handling systems in this market. In July 2010 Hamworthy was 
awarded a contract worth approximately £50 million by Brazilian shipyard Estaleiro 
Promar S.A. to provide ship design and supply cargo handling systems to eight LPG 
carriers destined for operation by Transpetro, a subsidiary of Petrobras. This success 
in Brazil was followed by a significant advance in the Chinese market with the award 
of a contract to supply the cargo handling systems for six LEG carriers to be built by 
Sinopacific Offshore and Engineering Co. at their yard in Nantong.
The business saw an increase in bidding and new contracting activity in the market 
for LNG regasification systems, in particular in the south-east Asian region, and was 
successful in securing two significant contracts for these systems, one in Indonesia 
and one in Malaysia, both of which are scheduled for delivery in financial year 2012.
The business continues to be successful in winning contracts to provide LNG 
fuelling systems to the emerging market for LNG powered ships. Gas powered 
vessels enable ship owners and operators to meet tightening emissions regulations 
in environmentally sensitive waters such as the Baltic Sea as an alternative to using 
high-cost, low-sulphur marine diesel or fitting emissions abatement technology. 
Hamworthy won orders for five such systems during the year.
The oil separation part of the business, acquired in September 2009, made good 
commercial progress during the year. Approval of the VIEC enhanced separation 
technology was received from BP , ENI, Statoil, OSX in Brazil and in the Middle East 
where the business secured a first contract for a feasibility study from the Kuwait 
Oil Company to evaluate the effectiveness of the VIEC product in the heavy oil 
fields in North Kuwait.
Revenue fell 11.5% to £51.0 million (2010: £57.6 million) as the low order intake 
of the prior year flowed through to lower activity levels. Activity in the first half 
of the year was particularly low. Nevertheless, the business continued to invest in 
both its technology and market position through this period in order to maintain 
core capability in anticipation of a recovery in its key markets. Following the strong 
order intake during the year, the second half of the year saw a marked increase in 
activity levels with revenue more than double that of the first half of the year and 
a robust return to profitability. 
The business successfully completed the project to provide a small-scale land 
based LNG liquefaction plant in Finland and handed this over to the customer in 
July 2010. Hamworthy’s LNG regasification technology has now been operating 
successfully for almost a year on board Golar LNG’s 138,000m
3
 FSRU Golar Winter 
in Guanabara Bay, Brazil and the business completed commissioning for the three 
other regasification systems during the year. The division also completed deliveries 
of cargo handling systems to a series of large and medium sized gas carriers at 
Hyundai Heavy Industries in Korea.
As a result of the loss made in the first half, the underlying operating margin 
for the full year decreased to 1.3% (2010: 4.3%). The margin in the second half 
of the year improved to 6.3%. The business continues to focus on improving 
its margins through product refinement, excellence in project execution and 
increased use of its engineering centre in Poland.
The business continued to invest in the development of products and systems for 
the wider LNG market and a development program for LNG fuel gas systems for 
LNG carriers as well as other merchant vessels was initiated. Product development 
of the low water VIEC separator was completed last year and a pilot plant has 
now been delivered to the Waimea field in Brazil, along with the complementary 
iPhase oil/water interface indicator. A new laboratory was established in the 
business’ main office in Norway facilitating funded research studies for oil field 
operators and testing of oil before VIEC deliveries. Business review

Order intake was slightly lower than prior year at 
£35.2 million (2010: £36.8 million). Whilst the market 
for new cruise shipbuilding showed signs of recovery 
in the latter part of the previous financial year, ordering 
of new vessels remains below the peak levels seen in 
recent years. 
Hamworthy was successful in winning wastewater treatment and fresh water 
generation systems for new vessels for AIDA Cruise Lines and Princess Cruise Lines. 
Whilst order intake for advanced wastewater treatment systems for the retrofit 
market has been subdued, enquiry levels remain high from this sector as ship 
owners consider future itineraries in more environmentally sensitive waters.
Order intake for conventional wastewater treatment plant was reduced compared 
to the levels seen in 2010 when demand had been boosted by the introduction of 
strict International Maritime Organization (IMO) wastewater discharge standards 
from 1 January 2010.
The high pressure compressor business witnessed strong demand for its range of 
products from the seismic survey market where they are used for offshore oil and 
gas exploration and other seabed survey work.
Revenue fell by 4.3% to £50.8 million (2010: £53.1 million), with lower demand 
for advanced wastewater treatment systems from the cruise market and for 
steam condensers from the small-scale power station market being partly offset 
by higher volumes of conventional wastewater treatment systems and a robust 
performance from the Aftersales component of the business.
During the year the business delivered eight advanced wastewater treatment 
plants to the cruise market including its largest ever plant to German shipyard 
Meyer Werft for a leading North American cruise ship operator. The business also 
delivered advanced wastewater treatment systems to the Royal Navy’s CVF aircraft 
carriers and an offshore accommodation vessel.
Underlying operating margin decreased slightly to 11.5% (2010: 12.2%) as the 
business significantly increased investment in research and development, primarily 
focused on developing solutions for the ballast water treatment market.
Following thorough testing of the ballast water treatment technology arising 
from the acquisition of Greenship BV, it was determined that the system would 
need a significant redesign in order to ensure its effectiveness across the full 
range of vessel operating conditions. Supported by the Dutch Administration and 
key customers, the business embarked upon a fast-track product development 
programme and successfully developed and built two new prototypes during the 
year, commencing land-based testing of those prototypes during March 2011. 
The test programme will continue through the first half of the financial year 2012 
with the intent to release a product to the market towards the end of this year. 
In parallel with this land-based test activity, Hamworthy is providing prototype 
units to two vessels to undertake shipboard trials as part of the required IMO test 
protocol. The emerging market for ballast water treatment systems represents a 
very significant opportunity for the business as the regulations set by IMO, once 
ratified, will require commercial ship owners to fit such systems on both new and 
existing vessels. It is estimated that there are around 40,000 vessels in the global 
fleet that will be affected by the new legislation.
In addition to the ballast water treatment systems, the business has invested 
in the development of its advanced wastewater treatment both for the cruise 
market and for applications in other vessels such as ferries and offshore platforms. 
Working closely with Princess Cruises, the business has successfully developed a 
new configuration for the treatment of grey water that will allow the system to be 
future-proofed against the most stringent standards for Alaska and the Baltic Sea. Business review

Business review Divisional review – Inert Gas Systems 
Order intake was 15.9% above 2010 at £19.8 million 
(2010: £17.1 million) as a recovery in the offshore 
market and first orders for the new exhaust gas 
cleaning product offset a decline in demand for inert 
gas systems from the marine sector.
The offshore market remains a key focus for the business and the increased 
market activity witnessed at the end of 2009 continued into 2010 with the 
business securing the contract to supply the inert gas generator systems to the 
ENI Norge/Statoil owned Goliat FPSO to be located in the Barents Sea and letters 
of intent for systems on two other newbuild FPSOs.
Order intake was particularly strong for the division’s Aftersales products 
and services, continuing to build on the strong growth of the previous year. 
The business continues to expand its portfolio of Aftersales offerings including 
operator training, control system upgrades and long-term service agreements 
alongside the more traditional spares and service offerings.
Following the completion of the development of a commercial system for exhaust 
gas cleaning the business secured a breakthrough order for the supply of such 
systems for four newbuild roll-on roll-off ferries to be built at Daewoo Shipbuilding 
and Marine for the Italian based operator Ignazio Messina & Co. S.p.A.
Exhaust gas cleaning is a means of enabling ship owners and operators to meet 
new environmental legislation that limits the emissions of sulphur oxides from 
ships’ boilers and engines when the vessels are operating in environmentally 
sensitive waters. To date EU ports, the Baltic Sea, North Sea and the English 
Channel are all affected by legislation limiting emissions of sulphur oxide with 
North American coastal waters also affected from 2012. This emerging market 
represents a significant opportunity for the business as the legislation will require 
both newbuild and existing vessels sailing within controlled waters to comply.
In addition to the commercial order for four shipsets, the business was successful 
in securing a paid contract for a demonstration unit installed on a container vessel 
as a trial supported by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Revenue was 18.1% below the prior year at £21.8 million (2010: £26.7 million) as 
the low order intake in 2010, in particular in the offshore sector, flowed through 
into lower activity levels.
The business achieved a number of successful deliveries into the marine tanker 
market during the period including the first of an eight shipset series for a new 
design of nitrogen generation system being fitted to a series of chemical carriers 
being built in Korea for the Middle Eastern owner UACC.
Underlying operating margin fell to 3.3% (2010: 4.3%) as the benefits of the 
transfer of contract management and order processing functions from Norway to 
China only partly offset the effects of lower revenue and the ongoing investment 
in research and development. Investment was predominantly focused on further 
development and refinement of the exhaust gas cleaning system to ensure that 
Hamworthy maximises its share of this market as it emerges.
  Business review
Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011 28
The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties 
which could have a material impact on its long-term 
development and performance. The directors have identified 
the following as being the principal strategic and operational 
risks. In addition those risks of a financial nature are set out 
in the financial review on page 19. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
Contract	or	 product	failure
The Group’s businesses contract for the supply of complex, 
highly technical and in many cases individually high value 
systems. Contracts may be long term in nature and involve 
multi-currency transactions. The delivered systems can be 
mission critical to the end user. Failure of a Group business 
in the delivery of its contractual commitments or subsequent 
failure of the product could expose the Group to unforeseen 
losses. The Group’s design, engineering and supply chain 
processes are designed to meet high quality and reliability 
standards. The businesses invest in the training of project 
personnel and conduct regular reviews of contract costs 
and progress.
Competition
The Group’s businesses compete with large well-established 
global companies, local companies and low-cost equipment 
and service providers. They do so on the basis of technical 
expertise, price, timeliness of delivery, previous experience 
and reputation for quality and reliability. To remain 
competitive the Group invests in its product development, 
manufacturing capabilities, sourcing and supply chain 
management and market access. The Group’s strategic 
objective is to hold leading market positions in its targeted 
market segments.
Market 	trends
53% of the Group’s revenue in the year to 31 March 2011 
came from the new shipbuilding market (2010: 50%). 
In aggregate this market is highly cyclical and this can 
result in volatility in consolidated earnings and cash flows. 
The Group’s strategy is to target a balance of niche markets 
both within specialist ship types and outside the new 
shipbuilding cycle. Increasingly the Group is targeting the 
offshore, aftersales and retrofit markets. The share of the 
Group’s order intake from the new shipbuilding market 
was 45% during the year (2010: 34%).
Uncertainty	 on 	timing 	 of	order 	 placements
Several of the Group’s businesses supply equipment and 
services into large bespoke projects, the exact timing of 
order placement for which can be difficult to accurately 
predict. This can result in volatility in cash flows and demand 
on resources. The Group aims to maintain a low fixed cost 
base flexible enough to accommodate this volatility. It has 
taken certain actions during the last financial year to reduce 
costs in businesses most exposed to demand volatility whilst 
maintaining core capabilities.
Acquisitions
Hamworthy continues to seek acquisition opportunities 
as part of its growth strategy. There is a risk that such 
acquisitions do not realise their expected benefits. 
Acquisition targets are assessed against the business’ 
development objectives and are subject to due diligence 
processes. The Group’s senior management have developed 
a robust integration, planning and management process 
that is applied to all acquired businesses. The directors 
expect those businesses acquired recently to deliver the 
benefits originally projected for them. 
Ethics
Shortcomings in the standard by which the Group conducts 
business could lead to reputational damage, breach 
of contract or laws and financial penalty. The Group is 
committed to the highest standards of business ethics 
and has developed a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
to ensure it carries out business fairly, honestly and 
transparently. Further details are provided in the corporate 
social responsibility report on pages 30 to 33.
IT 	security
The Group’s businesses rely extensively on access to 
electronic data, communication in electronic form and IT 
systems to manage business processes. Corruption or loss of 
this data or system access could have a detrimental effect on 
operational effectiveness and a business’ ability to comply 
with its supply obligations. The Group has a global policy on 
the back up of all business critical data, system access and 
integrity and adherence is monitored via internal auditing. Business review
29 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011
The Group’s management teams use various performance 
measures to help run and assess the performance of their

The Group aims to deliver long-term growth 
in shareholder value through the aggregated 
effect of its core strategies and underlying 
earnings per share is a key indicator of 
this. It is also used as a key measure in 
determining vesting of awards under the 
Group’s long-term incentive plans. Underlying 
earnings per share is calculated as underlying 
earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 
divided by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year.
The Group aims to maintain a low fixed 
cost base, minimising the level of fixed and 
working capital required to support the 
business operations. The Group’s larger 
contracting businesses have volatile cash 
flows and this measure of the ratio of free 
cash per share to underlying earnings per 
share is therefore calculated over a rolling 
three year period.
Revenue visibility from the forward order 
book is both an indicator of future potential 
and allows the Group’s businesses to make 
better informed planning decisions. This 
ratio is calculated as total forward order 
book expressed as a multiple of the previous 
year’s revenue.
Developing innovative solutions to meet 
customer needs is critical to maintaining 
market leadership in the Group’s targeted 
market segments and achieving growth in 
emerging markets. The Group is therefore 
committed to ensuring that sufficient 
investment is made in research and 
development to achieve these aims.
One of the Group’s key strategic objectives 
is to increase business operating margins 
through improved operational efficiency. 
Operating margins are calculated as operating 
profits expressed as a percentage of revenue.
The Group is committed to continuous 
improvement of its safety performance 
and includes the accident rate as one of 
its key performance indicators. Accident 
rate is defined as the number of reportable 
accidents which result in an absence 
of greater than three days per 100,000 
employees. The Group does not have the 
historic comparative data prior to 2008. Business review

Our 	people
The Group values communication with its employees, 
involving them in the wider Group and keeping them 
informed on matters affecting them as employees and 
on the various factors affecting the performance of the 
Group. Hamworthy has developed an intranet that regularly 
disseminates a significant amount of employee related 
information and is accessible at all our locations for those 
who do not have personal access.
Employee feedback is encouraged on a range of issues, 
developing a culture of openness and honesty. As a 
matter of principle Hamworthy seeks to provide an 
environment which allows individuals to develop to 
the best of their abilities.
Ethics	and 	business 	conduct
The Board is committed to ensuring the highest standards 
of ethical practice and behaviour across the Group. In 2009 
Hamworthy issued a new Code of Ethics and Business 
conduct with which all employees are required to comply. 
The Group’s code can be viewed on our website at  
www.hamworthy.com in the About us section under Ethics.
The fundamental principles of the code are that all 
employees in the Group will carry out their business 
fairly, honestly and transparently, and ensure their actions 
do not result in the unreasonable or unfair enrichment 
of an individual or corporation, do not unfairly or 
unreasonably influence an individual or corporation and 
are open and transparent within the normal bounds of 
corporate confidentiality. This code reflects the requirements 
of the UK Bribery Act 2010. The Group has appointed a 
Bribery Act Compliance Officer and during 2011 will develop 
its control processes further in light of the Ministry of Justice 
Guidance to the Act.

Whistleblowing
The Company operates a whistleblowing policy which is 
publicised both internally and externally via its website.  
This provides the necessary access for, and protection of, 
employees wishing to bring matters they suspect as  
being malpractice or impropriety to the attention of  
the relevant person. 
Equality
The Group’s employment policies include a commitment 
to equal opportunities regardless of sex, age, race or 
ethnic origin. 
Disabled	 people
It is the policy of the Group to give full and fair 
consideration to applications made by disabled persons 
taking into consideration the respective aptitudes and 
abilities of the applicants concerned. In the event of a 
member of staff becoming disabled every effort is made  
to ensure their continued employment within the Group  
and to provide specialised training where appropriate.
T raining
The Group is committed to employee training and retraining 
and this year has spent £0.4 million (2010: £0.5 million) 
in this respect. This is in addition to the cost of on-the-job 
training which, whilst substantial, is impractical to quantify. 
The Group has a leadership and talent development 
programme aimed at continually improving the strength 
in depth of the Group’s management capabilities.
Health 	and 	 safety
The health and safety of Hamworthy employees is of the 
highest priority. The Group’s safety programme is led by 
a member of the Group executive committee and the 
executive committee reviews the safety performance of 
each business every month. It has implemented a consistent 
reporting system both for accidents and for ‘near misses’ 
where a potentially unsafe situation arose but no  
accident occurred.
Safety performance is one of the Group’s key performance 
indicators as set out on page 29. All of the Group’s principal 
business sites have achieved accreditation under OHSAS 
18001 health and safety standard.
Hamworthy encourages employees to maintain a healthy 
lifestyle and provides opportunities to pursue that. Several 
of the Group’s businesses support cycle-to-work initiatives, 
charity corporate sports events, sporting social clubs and 
occupational health programmes. 
Maintaining 	a	healthy

63 of Hamworthy’s employees in Singapore supported the 
seventh annual JP Morgan Corporate Challenge, along with 
nearly 12,000 others. As well as investing in a healthier 
lifestyle Hamworthy’s employees also helped to raise  
money for the nominated charities.

Suppliers
It is the Group’s policy to agree terms with its suppliers 
that are appropriate for the markets in which they operate 
and to abide by such terms where suppliers have also 
met their obligations. Creditor days as at 31 March 2011 
were 47 days (2010: 40 days). The Group seeks to engage 
with its major suppliers and attempts to understand and, 
if appropriate, encourage their approach to environmentally 
friendly and ethical sourcing of materials.
For new suppliers the Group undertakes a Supplier Audit 
Survey which ensures they can prove their standards 
are in line with the Group’s. Where non-conformance is 
discovered, Hamworthy works with suppliers to identify 
corrective actions.
The Group has made progress in its approach to strategic 
purchasing with the expansion of dedicated procurement 
personnel and adoption of group-wide standards of 
performance and monitoring.
Shareholders
The Company meets with institutional shareholders  
and analysts as appropriate and uses its website to 
communicate with existing and prospective shareholders. 
Hamworthy plc welcomes feedback from investors about  
its published reports and website. Please address your 
feedback to our investor relations team by email to

Our 	environmental	 impact
Hamworthy is very conscious of the environmental impact 
that its activities may have on the communities in which it 
operates and constantly strives to minimise the effect of this.
All the Group’s principal sites are accredited under the 
ISO 14001 environmental standard.
Many of our products have a direct environmental benefit 
and they are often designed to ensure that our customers 
can meet relevant environmental legislation. The Group has 
added to its portfolio of such products during the last year 
with the development of ballast water systems, helping to 
protect the world’s oceans, and ships’ exhaust emission 
cleaning, reducing the levels of sulphur emitted to the 
atmosphere from ships’ engines. 
Hamworthy is a constituent of The FTSE Environmental 
Opportunities Index Series. The Index measures the 
performance of global companies that have significant 
involvement in environmental business activities, including 
renewable and alternative energy, energy efficiency, 
water-technology and waste and pollution control. Forming 
part of the overall FTSE Environmental Markets Index

Business review Corporate social responsibility
Our	 communities
The Group seeks to contribute to the communities in which 
it operates both directly and through the encouragement of 
participation by employees. The single largest social impact 
is the wealth created within communities both economical 
and in development of skill sets and knowledge.
The Group contributes directly to charities with donations 
totalling £3,650 (2010: £5,150) during the year. In addition, 
employees give time to social causes which is often provided 
during Company working periods. Hamworthy formalised 
this process earlier in the year when it launched an employee 
volunteer scheme aimed at supporting local charities and 
good causes. 
The scheme, Hamworthy Helping Hands, enables employees 
to get hands-on involvement in causes supported by the 
Group, proving a more rewarding and personal experience. 
Employee time contributed during the year is estimated 
at £20,300 (2010: £20,000) with employees participating 
in activities such as educational support, social benefit 
projects and charity management. The Group also donated 
redundant ITC equipment to HOPE. HOPE provides 
vulnerable individuals with the right tools to stay off the 
streets and into independent living, employment or further 
education. The equipment donated will be used by residents 
to search for jobs, write CVs and improve computer skills 
ready for their re-introduction into the workplace.
The Group made no political donations during the year.
The Group’s Charity Policy specifies the nature of those 
causes that the Group will support as being for the 
benefit of sick, disabled or underprivileged persons or for 
special educational causes particularly involving children 
and with links to the communities in which Hamworthy 
businesses operate.

Directors’ remuneration report
Governance
Governance	
AIM companies are not required to prepare a formal remuneration report in accordance with Part 15 the Companies Act 2006 or the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority. However, in line with best practice the Company has prepared this report in order to enable a better 
understanding of directors’ remuneration. The information included in this report is unaudited unless otherwise stated.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive directors and its members are James Wilding (Chairman), 
Gordon Page and Alan Frost. The committee also consults with the Chief Executive. It meets at least twice each year and has delegated 
responsibility for making recommendations to the Board regarding the remuneration and other benefits of the executive directors and senior 
executives. The full terms of reference of the committee are available on the Company’s website or on request from the Company Secretary. 
The committee has access to external remuneration data and professional advice. Following the full review of the Group’s executive 
remuneration structure in 2007, a further general review was undertaken in 2009, in both instances with assistance from Kepler Associates. 
Kepler Associates do not undertake any other work for the Group. During year ended 31 March 2010 the committee also reviewed the 
Group’s long-term incentive plans and concluded that it would continue to retain the existing structure. 
Remuneration policy 
The Board’s policy is to recruit, motivate and retain senior executives of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive but responsible 
salary and benefit packages. A significant proportion of executive remuneration is performance related, both short term and long term. 
This includes participation in share incentive schemes which are closely aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The remuneration packages for executive directors comprise the following main elements:
• basic annual salary;
• annual bonus payments in respect of the performance of the individual and the Group calculated as a percentage of salary;
• share-based long-term incentives via participation in the Company’s Share Option Plan and Share Matching Plan;
• retirement benefits under the Company’s defined contribution pension scheme; and
• other benefits.
The Board’s intention is to combine appropriate levels of fixed pay with incentive schemes that provide executives with the ability to earn 
above median levels for true out-performance and which encourage executive co-investment in the Company’s shares.
Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed by the committee annually to take effect on 1 April. In setting basic salaries the committee assesses individual 
responsibilities, experience and performance and considers external market data. 
As noted in last year’s annual report, the most recent review performed by the committee’s independent advisers, Kepler Associates, 
indicated that Mr Oatley’s salary was materially below those of CEOs of similar companies based on a review of pay at companies operating 
in the same business sectors as Hamworthy and of similar size to Hamworthy. Given the significant gap, the committee decided to increase 
Mr Oatley’s basic salary in stages over the two-year period commencing 1 April 2010. Mr Oatley elected to postpone the first stage of this 
increase, and therefore its effect is not reflected in the directors’ emoluments table on page 38.
Annual bonus payments
Executive directors participate in the annual cash bonus scheme under which bonuses of between 0% and 100% of basic salary are payable. 
Bonuses are awarded following consideration of the performance of the Group, achievement of profit and cash targets and the individual’s 
contribution to that performance. The principles of this scheme also apply to annual bonuses payable to the Group’s senior executives. 
Where an executive has specific responsibility for a division or subsidiary in the Group the performance of that business unit is considered 
along with the Group performance. Notwithstanding Mr Oatley’s election to postpone receipt of an increase in basic salary as noted above, 
Mr Oatley’s bonus in respect of the year to 31 March 2011 has been calculated using the basic salary established by the committee and 
which would otherwise have been paid for that year.
Long-term incentives
The Company operates long-term incentives for executive directors and senior executive managers in the form of the Share Option Plan and 
a complementary co-investment Share Matching Plan. These Plans aim to encourage participants to contribute to the performance of the 
Company and to participate in the Company’s success along with other shareholders. 
It is intention of the Board to grant share options to reward performance and align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. 
Share options are granted at the discretion of the committee. 
Exercise of options is subject to the committee’s performance criteria set at the time of the original award. For awards made since 31 March 2007 
vesting has been conditional on an equally weighted measure of earnings per share growth and total shareholder return (“TSR”). 
The minimum performance for any vesting is an earnings per share growth of CPI plus 5% and a TSR equal to the average of the UK 
Industrial Engineering and Oil & Gas indices over a three-year period. The percentage vesting rises from 25% to 100% in proportion to 
increases in these two performance measures up to earnings per share growth of CPI plus 20% and TSR of 115% of the above indices. 
Details of options held by the executive directors under the Plan given in the tables on page 39.
The Share Matching Plan is designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of the Company’s shares. Participation is by the invitation 
of the committee to executive directors and senior executive managers at the time of an award made under the Share Option Plan. Awards 
of matching shares are made to participants on the basis of one matching share for each share already owned or for every two vested but 
unexercised share options held. Vesting of awards are subject to retention of the participant’s initial qualifying holding over a three-year 
period and the meeting of performance criteria over that period. The percentage of awards vesting at the end of the three years is calculated 
by reference to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. The percentage rises proportionally from 25% for earnings per 
share growth of CPI plus 5% to 100% for earnings per share growth of CPI plus 20%. 
Details of options and awards held by executive directors under the two Plans are given in the tables on page 39. Governance

Directors’ remuneration report (continued)
Retirement and other benefits
The executive directors are members of the Hamworthy Pension Scheme, a UK-defined contribution scheme. The Scheme provides for 
pension benefits payable on retirement and for a lump sum benefit payable to dependants in the event of death in service. 
The executive directors receive private healthcare insurance and allowances in lieu of company cars and fuel.
Service contracts
Service agreements for executive directors are for no fixed term and are terminable on twelve months’ notice from the Company or six 
months’ notice from the director. There are no provisions for compensation in the event of early termination. Should such an occasion arise, 
the Company will have due regard to all relevant circumstances including the obligation of the departing director to mitigate any loss which 
may be suffered.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, nor do they participate in any share option plan, long-term incentive plan or 
pension scheme. Gordon Page, Alan Frost and James Wilding have each been appointed under letters of engagement which commenced on 
21 July 2004 and which can be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice. Fees payable under the terms of their appointments 
are shown in the table below. 
External appointments
It is the Company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold external appointments and to receive payment therefrom provided such 
appointments are agreed by the Board in advance. During the year no executive director was a director of another public company.

Corporate governance
The Company is listed on AIM. Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”) that was issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 2010, the Board has nevertheless resolved to do so having regard to the 
size and specific requirements of the Company. Accordingly it does not seek to comply with provisions E.1.1 and E.1.2 which deal with 
communication between major shareholders and non-executive directors including the Chairman.
The Board
The Company has appointed non-executive directors to bring an independent view to the Board and to provide a balance to the executive 
directors. The Board of directors comprises two executive directors and three non-executive directors, one of whom is the Chairman, 
Gordon Page, and another is the senior independent director, Alan Frost.
The Board is actively pursuing a succession strategy which will result in the replacement of each of the existing non-executive directors as 
they retire progressively over the period to July 2014.
The Board considers that each of the non-executive directors is independent within the meaning of the Code.
The Chairman meets with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present at least once each year.
The Board meets every two months and in advance of each regular meeting, receives a board pack with the information necessary for it to 
discharge its duties. These packs include financial data, reporting on health and safety, controls and risk assessments and detailed individual 
reports from each executive director. The Board has responsibility for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets, 
major items of expenditure, acquisitions and the directors’ report and annual and interim financial statements.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and are able to take professional advice at the 
Company’s expense.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against directors as well as against material loss or claims 
against the Group and reviews the adequacy of cover regularly. The Company has also entered an agreement with each of its directors 
whereby the director is indemnified against certain liabilities to third parties which might be incurred in the course of carrying out his duties 
as a director. These arrangements constitute a qualifying third-party indemnity provision for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006.
There is a formal schedule of matters, decisions on which are reserved to the Board. There is also a schedule of the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Both schedules are reviewed by the Board at least annually.
Early in 2011, the Board undertook a further triennial formal external assessment of its performance and effectiveness using the services of 
an outside consultant (Edis-Bates Associates). Full results of this review will be made available after the date of this report.
Board committees
The Board has established three committees: audit, remuneration and nominations. Each has written terms of delegated responsibilities and 
each is chaired by a different non-executive director. The Company Secretary is secretary to each committee. A copy of each committee’s 
terms of reference can be found at the Company’s website www.hamworthy.com. 
Audit committee
The audit committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost and James Wilding and is chaired by Alan Frost. It meets at least three times a year 
with attendance from the external auditors and internal personnel as required. The committee is responsible for: 
• ensuring that the appropriate financial reporting procedures are properly maintained and reported on;
• meeting the auditors and reviewing their reports relating to the Group’s accounts and internal control systems;
• reviewing and monitoring the independence of the external auditor and the objectives and effectiveness of the audit process;
• receiving and reviewing all internal operational review reports; and
• reviewing arrangements by which staff may in confidence raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 
otherwise and receiving and dealing with matters reported under the Group’s whistleblowing policy. 
The Group’s internal audit function has written terms of reference, reports independently to the audit committee and has direct access to 
the Chief Executive. It has responsibility for a programme of reviews to cover all businesses in the Group on a rolling basis and with agreed 
scope of work. In addition, the head office finance team, led by the Group Finance Director, undertakes a programme of operational reviews 
at the Group’s businesses which includes internal control implementation. Both the internal audit and operational review programmes are 
integrated with the risk assessment process.
The external auditors have carried out non-audit services to the Group during the year. The committee has considered the effect of this work 
on the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. Having regard to the scale and nature of these services, the committee has 
concluded that the auditors’ objectivity and independence are not impaired.
The committee has considered the likelihood of a withdrawal of the auditors from the market and noted that there are no contractual 
obligations to restrict the choice of external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the committee reviewed:
• the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity;
• the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and any variation therefrom;
• the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
• the content of the external auditors’ reporting on internal control.
Following the above, the committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be re-appointed as auditors. 41 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011

Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost and James Wilding and is chaired by James Wilding. It meets at least 
twice a year and is responsible for reviewing the performance of the executive directors and other senior executives and for determining 
appropriate levels of remuneration. The Chief Executive is invited to participate in the committee’s deliberations on all matters except 
consideration of his own compensation. The committee’s report is set out on pages 37 to 39.
Nominations committee
The nominations committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost, James Wilding and Joe Oatley and is chaired by Gordon Page. 
The committee reviews the size, structure and composition of the Board and makes recommendations on changes, as appropriate. 
It also gives consideration to succession planning in the light of developments in the business.

Internal control and risk management
The Group operates a system of internal control which is developed and reviewed in accordance with the guidance published by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The internal control system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. It can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board operates a formal process of risk assessment and reporting. Each major business unit carries out formal risk assessments annually 
and regularly updates these during the year. The assessments are carried out using, where appropriate, a standard categorisation of risk. 
Reports on the assessments and mitigation actions of all significant risks are provided to the Board.
The Group operates an internal audit function, details of which are provided in the audit committee section of this report.
The Board recognises that an essential part of its responsibility is the effective safeguarding of assets, the proper recognition of liabilities and 
the accurate reporting of results. The Group has a comprehensive system for regular reporting to the Board. This includes an annual planning 
and budgeting system with budgets approved by the Board. The financial reporting system compares against budget and prior year and 
reconsiders its financial year forecast all on a monthly basis.
The Board has established a formal policy of authorisation setting out matters which require its express approval and certain authorities 
delegated to the executive directors.
The Group operates in a multi-currency environment and is exposed to a number of foreign currency risks. The Board has set a policy for the 
management and reporting of those risks and this is set out in more detail in the financial review on pages 18 and 19 and in note 31 to the 
financial statements.
The Company has established a policy and share dealing code relating to dealing in the Company’s shares by directors, employees and 
connected persons.
There is a group-wide Code of Ethics and Business Conduct to which all employees are required to adhere. Monitoring of compliance is included 
within the internal audit programme. This code reflects the requirements of the UK Bribery Act 2010. The Group has appointed a Bribery Act 
Compliance Officer and during 2011 will develop its control processes further in light of the Ministry of Justice Guidance to the Act.
The Company’s policy with regard to whistleblowing and health and safety is included in the corporate social responsibility report on 
pages 30 to 33. The Board of directors’ consideration of the adequacy of the Group’s resources to enable it to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future is set out on page 19. Governance

Business review
This business review has been prepared to provide additional information to shareholders to assist in understanding the Group’s strategies 
and the potential for those strategies to succeed. The Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5, the Chief Executive’s review on pages 6 to 9, 
the financial review on pages 16 to 19 and the divisional reviews on pages 20 to 27 all contain further information related to this business 
review and are to be incorporated into this directors’ report by reference.
This business review contains forward-looking statements which have been made by the directors in good faith based on information 
available to them up to the time of their approval of this report and must be treated with caution due to the uncertainties including 
economic, business and other risk factors inherent in any such forward-looking information.

The Company paid an interim dividend during the financial year of 3.36p per share (2010: 3.20p per share).
Directors
The names of the current directors, together with brief biographical details, are shown on pages 34 and 35. All directors served throughout 
the year and to the date of signing the financial statements.
The Board has determined that, regardless of when individual directors were last re-elected, henceforth all directors will resign and offer 
themselves for re-election at the AGM. Accordingly, each director resigns and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election. The Board 
recommends the re-election of each director.
None of the directors had a material interest in any contract of significance to which the Company, or its subsidiaries, was a party during the 
financial year. There were no contractual relationships between the non-executive directors and companies with which they are connected 
and the Hamworthy plc Group.
Other than the interests of directors disclosed in the directors’ remuneration report, the Company had been notified at 1 June 2011 of the 
following substantial interests in the Company’s issued ordinary share capital: 43 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011

Directors’ remuneration
Details of the remuneration of directors and their interests in the share capital of the Company are provided in the directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 37 to 39. The Company has made qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its directors which remain in 
force at the date of this report.
Financial instruments
The Group holds and utilises financial instruments in the management of its operations. It is the policy of the Group that no trading in 
financial instruments shall be undertaken. The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments relate to interest rates, liquidity risk and 
foreign exchange risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are set out in note 31 to the 
financial statements.
Research and development
During the year the Group expensed to the consolidated income statement, net of amounts capitalised to and amortised from intangible 
assets, £4,788,000 (2010: £3,894,000) in respect of research and development on marine and offshore products and systems.
Corporate responsibility
Details of the Group’s policies on employment, environmental, health and safety, ethics, creditor payments, political donations and charitable 
payments are contained in the corporate responsibility report on pages 30 to 33.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors are required by the IAS Regulation 
to prepare the Group financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The Group financial statements are also required 
by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International 
Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements”. In virtually all circumstances, 
a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. However, directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent company financial statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. Governance
Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011 44
Directors’ report (continued)
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Disclosure of information to the auditors
In the case of each of the persons who are directors of the Company at the date when this report is approved:
(a) so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
(b) each of the directors has taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information (as defined) and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
This information is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company will take place at the Hytes Suite, Harbour Heights Hotel, Haven Road, Poole BH13 7LW 
on 14 July 2011 at 2.00pm. Full details of the resolutions to be put to the meeting are given in the notice of the AGM to be found on pages 
90 and 91 of this annual report.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the 
year are shown in note 26 to the financial statements. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions either on the size of a holding 
or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.
Details of employee share schemes are also set out in note 26 to the financial statements. No person has any special rights of control over 
the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies 
Acts and related legislation and observance of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Articles of Association may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders. 
An ordinary resolution will be put to the shareholders at the AGM to renew the directors’ authority to issue and allot ordinary shares. 
The nominal value of ordinary shares to which this authority will be limited is £729,482.
A special resolution will also be put to the shareholders at the AGM which renews the authority of the directors to allot ordinary shares 
without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This authority is limited to 5% of the issued 
share capital.
The Companies Act 2006 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by the members in 
general meeting. A special resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM to authorise the Company to purchase up to 5% of the issued 
share capital at a maximum price 5% above the average middle market quotation according to the London Stock Exchange for the five days 
preceding any purchase.
In all cases the above resolutions will expire at the earlier of the next AGM in 2012 or 15 months after the date of the resolutions.
Auditors
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.

Independent auditors’ report 
to	 the	 shareholders	 of	 Hamworthy	 plc
Accounts	
We have audited the Group financial statements of Hamworthy Plc for the year ended 31 March 2011which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated 
balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable  
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2011.

Notes
The maintenance and integrity of the Hamworthy plc website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does 
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to 
the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. Accounts

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2011
Accounts	
1. General information
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Hamworthy plc, a public limited company registered and domiciled 
in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries (the “Group”). The address of the registered office is Fleets Corner, Poole, Dorset BH17 0JT. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out on page 57.
2.  Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted.
Standards affecting the financial statements
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009) – the main impact is the 
requirement that all acquisition-related costs are to be expensed and will therefore no longer form part 
of the cost of the investment. In addition, changes to contingent consideration after initial recognition 
at fair value may potentially be recognised through the income statement rather than as an adjustment 
to goodwill
IAS 27 (revised 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009)
Standards and interpretations not affecting the reported results nor the financial position
Amendment to IFRS 2  Share-based Payments – Group cash-settled share-based payments. The amendments clarify the accounting 
for share-based payment transactions among group entities – effective for periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2010
Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items (effective for periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009). The amendments provide clarification on two aspects of hedge 
accounting: identifying inflation as a hedged risk or portion, and hedging with options
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners – effective from 1 July 2009
The following amendments were made as part of Improvements to IFRS (2010). 
Amendment to IFRS 7  Financial Instruments: Disclosures regarding reclassifications of financial assets 
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations would be effective for the current year but are not considered relevant to the 
Group’s operations:
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – Classification of rights issues
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
Accounting standards not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following relevant Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU):
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement (effective for periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013) – replacement of IFRS 7 and IAS 39
Amendment to IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures 
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement – effective from 1 January 2011
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments – effective from 1 July 2010
The adoption of IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the classification, measurement and disclosure of Financial Instruments and is 
effective from 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted. 
With the exception of IFRS 9 the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will 
have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. Accounts

3.  Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations 
adopted by the European Union (EU) and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of derivative contracts and 
retirement benefit obligations which are held at fair value. A summary of the more important Group accounting policies, which have been 
applied consistently across the Group, is set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements represent a consolidation of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings as at the balance sheet date and for the 
year then ended. Subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from, or up to, 
the date upon which control passed, being the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. This is considered to be the effective date of acquisition or disposal, as appropriate. 
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within 
equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the Company shareholders’ equity.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those 
used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over fair values of the 
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided  
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, and excluding inter-company sales
Sales of goods and services are recognised when goods are delivered or services rendered and title has passed. For bill and hold 
arrangements, revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, typically on formal 
acceptance. Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction contracts 
(see below).
Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage  
of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is measured using a matrix of indicators applicable to the contract 
including costs incurred, man hours expended, deliveries made and engineering work completed. Variations in contract work, claims and 
incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. Where the outcome of a construction contract 
cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be 
recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract costs 
will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Operating segments
For reporting purposes the results of the Group are allocated between four reporting product groups. These operate in specific product and 
market areas and are described in note 6. The Group accounting policies are applied consistently across the four divisions. Head office costs 
are shown separately.
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentational currency of the parent company is UK pounds sterling. Group companies use their local currency as 
their functional currency. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, with any gains or losses being included in net profit or loss 
for the period. 
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are 
dealt with through the Group’s reserves, until such time as the subsidiary is sold whereupon the cumulative exchange differences relating 
to the net investment in that foreign subsidiary are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal in the income statement. However, 
cumulative exchange differences arising prior to 1 April 2005 remain in equity as permitted by IFRS 1. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see below for details 
of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments). 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities. Accounts

Derivative financial instruments
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies, approved by the Board of directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives. 
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
any gains or losses on re-measurement are immediately recognised in the income statement. Where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge 
accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss will initially be recorded in a separate component of equity (“Hedging Reserve”).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged 
and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing 
is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that 
is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. The associated cumulative gain or loss is 
removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects 
the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs at which point it is recycled to the income statement. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Derivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally forward foreign exchange transactions and interest rate swaps.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains 
or losses reported in the income statement.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Allowances for irrecoverable amounts are made when there is evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the amount due. 
The impairment recorded is the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the estimated future cash flows. Any impairment 
required is recorded in the income statement in administrative expenses. 
Trade payables
Trade payables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation in respect of a past event and it is probable that 
settlement will be required of an amount that can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the Group’s liability. The estimate is discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which 
they are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the item including the costs of acquiring or constructing the asset and costs incurred subsequently to 
add to, or enhance, the asset. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets other than land and assets under construction, at rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life at 
the following annual rates:
Freehold land Nil 
Freehold buildings 2% – 5% 
Leasehold buildings 2% – 10% or over the life of the lease if different 
Plant, machinery and equipment 20% – 33% 
Assets under construction Nil
Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted where necessary.  Accounts

3.  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 2005 has been 
retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK 
GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or where there are indications that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
on a pro-rata basis.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS has been eliminated through reserves on transition. 
Research and development expenditure – internally generated
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are written off as incurred unless it can be demonstrated that the following conditions for capitalisation, in accordance 
with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), are met: 
• the development costs are separately identifiable;
• the development costs can be measured reliably;
• management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and commercial viability of the project; and
• it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits.
Any subsequent costs are capitalised as intangible assets until the intangible asset is readily available for production, and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful lives. 
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group, other than goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised over the asset’s estimated useful life on a straight-line basis as follows:
Software three to five years 
Development costs three years 
Customer contracts one to three years 
Customer relationships life of the customer relationship – typically ten years 
Technology-based assets life of the product – typically ten years
Impairment of fixed tangible assets and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
to determine the extent of any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. Value in use is calculated using cash flow projections for the asset (or group of assets where cash flows are not identifiable for specific 
assets) discounted at the Group’s cost of capital.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the income statement, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before finance income or finance expense.
Retirement benefit costs
The Company provides pension arrangements to the majority of full time UK employees through a money purchase (defined contribution) 
scheme, and similar schemes exist across other countries in which the Group operates, except Norway and Germany. Contributions and 
pension costs are based on pensionable salary and are charged as an expense as they fall due. The Group has no further payment obligations 
once the contributions have been paid.
Employees in Norway and Germany participate in funded defined benefit pension plans. The cost of benefits accruing during the year 
in respect of current and past service is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method and is charged against operating profit. 
The expected return on the scheme’s assets and the change in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities arising from the passage of 
time are included in other finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The balance sheet includes the surplus/deficit in the scheme, taking assets at their year end market values and liabilities at their actuarially 
calculated values discounted at year end AA corporate bond interest rates.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the 
Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. Accounts

Accounts	 Notes	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs 
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the 
FIFO method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Taxation including deferred tax
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in equity in which case it is recognised in equity.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. In principle deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets or liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.  
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
Share-based payment
The Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans through two share option schemes. The fair value of options awarded 
is calculated at the time of grant and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an 
estimate of the number of options that will actually vest. The Group has adopted a Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options. 
The Group has also introduced a complimentary co-investment share matching plan, details of which are given in note 26. The fair value of 
these matching shares are calculated at the date of award based upon the market value of the issued shares and are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number of options that will actually vest.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the same period in which they are fully authorised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
4.  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements, and the preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Revenue and margin recognition for long-term contracts
The Group derives revenue and margin from long-term contracts, most of which are normally fixed price and which may extend for a 
significant period of time. While long-term contracts are in progress, revenue is recognised based on their expected profitability and extent of 
completion. Profit is only taken once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably, however unforeseen future events may adversely 
impact the accuracy of those estimates. Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is 
recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Further details are given in note 19.
Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes that provide benefits to a number of current and former employees. The value of the 
deficit is particularly sensitive to the market value of the scheme’s assets, and its liabilities are particularly sensitive to discount rates and 
actuarial assumptions related to mortality. Further details are given in note 28. Accounts

4.  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Current and deferred taxation
Legislation related to taxation is complex and its impact on the Group may be uncertain. In preparing the Group’s financial statements 
management estimates its taxation liability having taken appropriate professional advice. Determination of an agreed amount of taxation 
payable may take several years, and the final amounts paid may differ from the liabilities recorded in these financial statements.
The recognition of assets and liabilities related to deferred taxation also requires the exercise of management judgement, in particular the 
extent to which assets should be recognised. 
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected 
future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows. Further details are given in note 16. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2011 was £12,955,000 (2010: £17,133,000).
Provisions for contract liabilities
The Group makes provision for liabilities related to contracts, including claims made against the Group by a contracting party, in accordance 
with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. At each balance sheet date the Group recognises such liabilities at the 
directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the liability.
Fair value of derivatives
The directors use their judgement in selecting appropriate valuation techniques for financial instruments. Valuation techniques commonly 
used by market practitioners are applied.
Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. These risks 
are managed centrally by the Group’s treasury function in accordance with board-approved objectives, policies and authorities. There are 
internal review procedures to ensure local compliance.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
business review on pages 6 to 33. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review on pages 16 to 19. In addition these notes include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital and its financial risk management objectives. Details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk are set out in note 31.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with long-term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas and industries. It has significant cash balances, little external debt and a significant order book. As a consequence, the 
directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions. The principal exposures arise 
in respect of variations in the cross rates between sterling, euro, US dollar, Singapore dollar and Norwegian kroner. The Group seeks to hedge 
all its transactional currency exposures through the use of forward currency contracts. The Group does not hedge balance sheet or income 
and expenditure translation exposures arising on consolidation, or undertake trading in financial instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its term loan borrowings which are detailed in note 31. 
Approximately 60% of borrowings at 31 March 2011 are subject to interest rate swap arrangements which have the effect of fixing interest 
rates at 3.35% p.a. for the term of the loan. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s cash flows and funds are managed in a central treasury function under a cash pooling structure. The Group maintains the most 
appropriate mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders. Details of available facilities are set out in note 23.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a number of companies across the world. 
Policies are maintained to ensure that the Group makes sales to customers with appropriate credit history. Letters of credit or other 
appropriate instruments are put in place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary.
The Group is also subject to credit risk on counterparties to its liquid funds and its derivative financial instruments which it controls by only 
dealing with highly-rated counterparties. The ratings are regularly monitored. Accounts
57 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011
Accounts	 Notes	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return 
to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity structure. The capital structure of the Group consists of borrowings 
(disclosed in note 23), cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves 
and retained earnings as disclosed in note 26 and the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The Group balances its overall capital 
structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and the use of debt facilities.
Details of the Group’s policy regarding employee share ownership and the Group’s share option programme can be found in the 
remuneration report on pages 37 to 39.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market through an employee benefit trust, and these own shares are intended 
to be used for issuing shares under the Group’s Share Co-investment Incentive Plan. The timing of these purchases is at the discretion of the 
trustees. The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are 
subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.

6. Business and geographical segments
Operating segments
For management purposes, the Group is organised into four operating divisions – Pump Systems, Oil & Gas Systems, Water Systems and 
Inert Gas Systems. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows:
• the Pump Systems Division designs and manufactures a range of cargo and general duty pumps and pump systems;
• the Oil & Gas Systems Division’s principal activity is the design and supply of systems which handle the phase change of petroleum 
products and natural gas cargos between vapour and liquid;
• the Water Systems Division provides advanced, environmentally-friendly solutions for the onboard treatment of liquid waste products, 
the generation of fresh water through desalination plant and the treatment of ballast water; and
• the Inert Gas Systems Division provides products which supply oxygen-depleted air to the ship’s cargo tanks to prevent explosion during 
the transportation of oil and chemical cargos.
Segment information about these businesses is presented below. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the 
Group’s accounting policies described in note 3. Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment after the allocation of specific 
central administration costs but before investment revenue, finance costs and income tax expense and is the measure reported to the 
Group’s Chief Executive and executive board for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.

Segment assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that are employed by a division in its operating activities. Segment assets include 
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventories, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial 
instruments. Segment liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, provisions, derivative financial instruments and retirement 
benefit obligations. Unallocated assets and liabilities include cash balances, derivative financial instruments, share-based payments and 
external borrowings.

Unrealised gains or losses arise due to movements in fair value on derivative instruments used for foreign exchange hedging but deemed to 
be ineffective under IFRS hedge accounting rules. The gain in the prior year related to a specific option derivative whose structure did not 
qualify for hedge accounting but did nonetheless represent a commercially effective hedging instrument.

The directors propose the payment of a final dividend of 6.73p per share, amounting to £3,049,647 in respect of the year to 31 March 2011 
(2010: 5.97p per share amounting to £2,701,176). The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. If authorised it will be paid on 21 July 2011 to shareholders 
who are on the register of members as at 17 June 2011.
14. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary 
shares where, on options granted, exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
The measures of underlying earnings per share are calculated using earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted to eliminate the 
mark-to-market of currency derivatives as adjusted throughout these financial statements for underlying earnings. 
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:
 Year ended 31 March 2011  Year ended 31 March 2010

Values ascribed to development costs represent the directly attributable costs of internally-generated development knowledge from the point 
at which an individual project meets the requirements for capitalisation until it is available for utilisation in the business. This is invariably a 
relatively short period of time resulting in minimal costs being incurred that qualify for capitalisation. 
All of these assets are recognised at fair value to purchase or acquire and are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Fair values of 
acquired intangible fixed assets have been assessed by reference to the future estimated cash flows arising from the application of assets, 
discounted at an appropriate rate to present value, or by reference to the amount that would have been paid in an arm’s length transaction 
between knowledgeable and willing parties. Accounts

Hamworthy Technology & Products AS      2,272 2,225
       12,955 17,133
For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. 
No impairment charge was required in the year (2010: £nil) and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date was £nil (2010: £nil). 
The key assumptions used in the calculations were:
• the forecast operating cash flows for the next two years based on approved budgets and plans. These budgets and plans are based 
on past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU, taking into account the current economic climate and 
forecast assumptions around the relevant product markets;
• an estimate of the long-term effective tax rate for the CGU of 28%; and
• an estimate of the long-term growth rate for the CGU of 0%.
The resulting cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 15.3% (2010: 15.3%).
Sensitivity analysis has determined that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used will result in significant impairment 
and that there is sufficient headroom in all of the key assumptions before the carrying value becomes impaired. For instance, the discount 
rate would have to more than double to result in an impairment charge for any of the four largest CGUs that comprise nearly 75% of the 
goodwill carrying value.
On 24 November 2010 the Group acquired the remaining 21% interest in Hamworthy Baltic Design Centre Limited. Accounts

The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a number of companies across the world. 
Policies are maintained to ensure that the Group enters into sales contracts with customers that are tailored to their respective credit 
rating. Advance payments, payments on delivery, letters of credit or other appropriate instruments are used to manage and reduce credit 
risk as appropriate. The credit quality of the Group’s trade receivables is considered by management to be very good as a high proportion 
of customers are large global companies with whom the Group trades on a long-term basis. This is further evidenced by the low rates of 
impairment provided and amounts written off.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 38 days. No interest is charged on the receivables balances. The Group does not hold 
any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances nor has the legal right of offset with any amounts owed by the Group to the 
receivables counterparty.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. At the reporting date the principal financial assets were:

At 31 March 2011 the Group held committed revolving credit facilities of £60 million for documentary credits, guarantees and ancillaries 
(2010: £60 million) at Barclays Bank plc. This facility provides for the limit to rise to £80 million upon meeting certain reductions in the 
mark-to-market amounts of the Group’s extant foreign exchange hedging instruments. In addition the Group has uncommitted overdraft 
and ancillary facilities of £3.5 million (2010: £3.0 million) held with Den Danske Bank AS, a term loan of £0.63 million (2010: £0.71 million) 
with Dresdner Bank AG and overdraft and ancillary facilities totalling £10.6 million (2010: £10.7 million) with Dresdner Bank AG, 
HSH Nordbank AG and DBV-Winterthur.
All facilities with Barclays Bank plc are secured by a fixed charge over the Group’s assets under the terms of a debenture. The term loan held 
with Dresdner Bank AG is secured by a mortgage over freehold property owned by Hamworthy Serck Como GmbH. Interest is charged at 
LIBOR plus a margin but is then hedged to a fixed rate of 3.35%. The Dresdner Bank loan is being repaid by variable instalments until 2018. 
Of the Group’s borrowings £0.6 million is denominated in euros (2010: £0.7 million euro; £0.5 million Danish kroner). All other borrowings 
are denominated in sterling. Accounts

Warranties are routinely given to customers in respect of certain products. Any costs in meeting claims, for which the warranty provision 
has been established, are expected to occur within three years of the balance sheet date. Contract provisions are made where, based 
upon management’s best estimate, the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are less than the cost of meeting those contract 
obligations. The periods over which these are expected to unwind varies by contract.
Redundancy provisions of £213,000 (2010: £939,000) relate to the estimated costs of restructuring certain of the Group’s activities. 
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred in the year ended 31 March 2012. Employment provisions are local statutory employment 
provisions required in certain overseas jurisdictions payable when employees leave the Group.  Accounts

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the actual volatility of the Group’s share price since flotation in July 2004. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £447,000 and £284,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2011 and 
2010 respectively.
Matching shares
Hamworthy plc operates a complimentary co-investment share matching plan, designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of 
Hamworthy shares by relevant personnel. Participation is by invitation of the remuneration committee on grant award and is expected to be 
the executive managers of the Group. Participants are awarded matching ordinary shares in Hamworthy plc, up to a limit related to basic 
annual salary, in the ratio of:
• one for every one share already beneficially owned, and
• one for every two vested but unexercised share options held.
Further details are given in the directors’ remuneration report on page 37. The number of shares acquired by the trust during the year was 
£nil (2010: £nil). The number of shares held by the trust at 31 March 2011 was 96,125 (31 March 2010: 164,523) with total shares vesting 
in the period of 68,398 (2010: nil).

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and operating machinery. Leases are 
typically negotiated for an average period of three years in the case of plant and machinery, five years in the case of buildings and with a 
lease of land in Singapore for 30 years. 
28. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes in Norway. The most recent valuations of plan assets and the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation were carried out as at 31 March 2011 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were:

The sensitivity of the principal assumption of the discount rate used to measure the scheme liabilities is as follows:
Discount rate – decrease by 0.5% to 3.5% scheme liabilities increase by £0.98 million (63.9%) 
Discount rate – increase by 0.5% to 4.5% scheme liabilities decrease by £0.18 million (12%)
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Germany through Hamworthy Serck Como GmbH. A valuation of plan assets and the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out as at 31 March 2011 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.

31. Financial instruments
The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest risk and sensitivity
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, term loans and overdraft facilities held by subsidiaries. The Group’s 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its cash resources which are invested at variable rates. Its borrowings 
under a term loan facility are subject to an interest rate swap agreement which has the effect of fixing the interest payable at 3.35% per 
annum for the term of the loan. A 10% increase in interest rates throughout the year would have increased profit after tax by £0.1 million 
(2010: £0.1 million) with an equal but opposite effect for a fall in interest rates, all other variables remaining constant.
Liquidity risk
The Group has a strong cash flow and funds generated from operations are managed in a central treasury function under a cash pooling 
structure. The Group maintains the most appropriate mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities

Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
The currencies most important to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were those which are typically linked by monetary 
policy at fixed exchange rates to the euro as well as US dollars, sterling, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollars and Chinese renminbi. 
The Group seeks to hedge all its transactional currency exposures arising from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than 
the unit’s functional currency through the use of forward contracts. The notional value of forward exchange contracts in the Group’s main 
operating currencies at the balance sheet date were as follows:

    amount or less months two years four years more years

The Group does not hedge balance sheet translation exposures and therefore any foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these 
assets and liabilities on consolidation are taken to the Group reserves.
The Group’s operating units hold monetary assets and monetary liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the operating 
currency of the operating unit involved. These balances are retranslated at the balance sheet date. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency 
risk for these balances for its most important currencies at the balance sheet date was as follows:

Foreign currency risk and sensitivity (continued)
Sensitivity analysis
A 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies at 31 March would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit by the amounts 
shown below, assuming all other variables remained constant:
     Equity  Profit after taxation
     2011 2010 2011 2010
     £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
US dollar    (88) (98) (3) (6)
Euro    (284) (436) 15  (114)
Norwegian kroner    (2,308) (1,892) 13  (61)
Danish kroner    (672) (1,057) (164) (496)
Singapore dollar    (1,584) (1,789) (451) (476)
Chinese renminbi    (840) (860) (60) (116)
An equal but opposite effect would have been the impact of a 10% weakening of sterling.
Credit risk
Exposure to credit risk
The principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit 
ratings awarded by international credit rating agencies and these ratings are constantly monitored and are currently all rated at S&P A rating 
or above.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk on trade and other receivables is set out in note 20.
Derivatives and financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade 
debtors and trade creditors that arise from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s 
operations. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the policy of the Group that no trading in financial instruments shall 
be undertaken.
Interest rate swap
The Group’s borrowings under a term loan facility are subject to an interest rate swap agreement which has the effect of fixing the interest 
payable at 3.35% per annum for the term of the loan.
Currency derivatives
Currency derivatives are used to hedge future transactions and cash flows, and the Group’s resultant exposure to movements in foreign 
exchange rates. These are primarily in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and options, and are denominated in the currencies 
of the Group’s principal operating markets. At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange 
contracts to which the Group is committed, based upon contractual undiscounted cash flows, is as follows:
       2011 2010
       £’000 £’000
Commodity swaps      — 514
Forward foreign exchange contracts      212,641 143,494
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. The change in fair values of effective hedges amounted to a gain of £8,783,000 (2010: gain of 
£11,467,000). The Group recognised total gains of £nil (2010: £762,000) related to ineffective hedging transactions. Accounts

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments grouped into levels 1 to 3 based upon the degree to which the fair value 
is observable:
• level 1 – fair values are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2 – fair values are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
• level 3 – fair values are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

32. Ultimate parent company
The ultimate parent company of the Group is Hamworthy plc. There were no shareholders with overall control of the Company as at 
31 March 2011 or 31 March 2010. 
33. Contingent liabilities
At 31 March 2011 contingent liabilities exist in respect of bank guarantees in relation to performance bonds totalling £22,928,000 
(2010: £24,493,000) of which £3,170,000 (2010: £nil) mature more than two years from the balance sheet date. As the conditions of these 
guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability provision has been made at the 
year end.
The Group routinely enters into a range of contractual arrangements in the ordinary course of events which can give rise to claims or 
potential litigation against Group companies. It is the Group’s policy to make specific provisions at the balance sheet date for all liabilities 
including warranty costs and guarantees which, in the opinion of the directors, are expected to result in a significant loss. The directors have 
reviewed the open claims and pending litigation against the Group at the year end and concluded that no material unprovided loss is likely 
to accrue to the Group from any such unprovided claims. Accounts

34. Acquisition of subsidiaries
Krystallon
On 29 September 2009 the Group acquired the business and assets of Krystallon Limited. This business combination was included in the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010 at provisional fair values. Payment of the deferred consideration 
of £3,980,000 which had been provided in connection with the acquisition was contingent on, inter alia, the successful completion of a 
testing programme on the acquired technology. Those tests were not successfully completed in the year to 31 March 2011 and therefore 
no part of the deferred consideration will now be payable. Accordingly the directors have reviewed and amended the fair value of intangible 
assets acquired and the resulting goodwill.

Greenship BV
On 9 March 2009 the Group acquired the whole of the issued share capital of Greenship BV. At 31 March 2010 the Group recognised 
deferred contingent consideration relating to this acquisition of £4,576,000, payable on the obtaining of IMO type approval for Greenship’s 
ballast water treatment system. As at 31 March 2010 it was expected that such approval would be achieved. Since 31 March 2010 the 
Group has undertaken a rigorous testing programme and concluded that the system in its acquired design does not perform to a standard 
sufficient for it to be type approved. Accordingly the directors do not consider the deferred consideration to be payable. The financial effect 
of no longer recognising the need to pay any deferred consideration is set out in the table below.

Independent auditors’ report 
to	 the	 shareholders	 of	 Hamworthy	 plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 which comprise the parent 
company balance sheet, the parent company statement of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes 1 to 16. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2011;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2011.

Notes
The maintenance and integrity of the Hamworthy plc website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does 
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to 
the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. Parent	 company	 accounts

Accounting policies
Statement of accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the current and prior year.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets 
at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life at the 
following annual rates:
Plant, machinery and equipment 20% – 33%
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Taxation
Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at 
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences 
can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on 
a non-discounted basis.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Pension scheme arrangements
The Company provides pension arrangements to the majority of full time UK employees through a money purchase scheme, operated by 
Barnett Waddingham LLP . Contributions and pension costs are based on pensionable salary and are recorded in the period in which they fall. 
Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or at a contracted 
rate if applicable. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an 
exchange gain/loss in the profit and loss account. 
Financial instruments
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of swap agreements are recognised in the interest payable/receivable charge/credit on an accruals 
basis. The interest differential amounts due to/from the counterparty on such agreements are accrued until the settlement date and are 
recognised as an adjustment to interest expense.
Share-based payment
The Company operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans through two share option schemes. The fair value of options awarded 
is calculated at the time of grant and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an 
estimate of the number of options that will actually vest. The Group has adopted a Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options. 
The Company also participates in the Group’s complimentary co-investment share matching plan, details of which are given in note 26 to the 
Group financial statements. The fair value of these matching shares is calculated at the date of award based upon the market value of the 
issued shares and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number 
of options that will actually vest. 
Related party transactions and cash flow statement
The Company is the ultimate parent undertaking of the Hamworthy Group and is therefore included in the consolidated financial statements 
of that Group, which are publicly available. Consequently the Company has taken advantage of the exemptions from preparing a cash flow 
statement under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 (Revised 1996) – Cash Flow Statements, and the exemptions under Financial 
Reporting Standard 8 – Related Party Disclosures relating to the disclosure of transactions with other Group companies. Parent	 company	 accounts

As detailed in the Group financial statements, payment of the deferred consideration in respect of the business and assets of Krystallon 
Limited was contingent on the successful completion of a testing programme on the acquired technology. The tests were not successfully 
completed and therefore no part of the deferred consideration will now be payable. The directors have therefore reviewed and amended 
the fair value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets accordingly. Parent company accounts

Notes
1. A form of proxy is enclosed for use by shareholders and, if appropriate, must be deposited with the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars (PXS), 
The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). 
Appointment of a proxy does not preclude a shareholder from attending the AGM and voting in person.
2. A member entitled to attend speak and vote at the AGM may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the Company) to attend and 
speak at the AGM and to vote on his or her behalf whether by show of hands or on a poll. A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the 
meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed by a separate form of proxy and to exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by him or her. 
In order to be valid an appointment of proxy (together with any authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified notarially) must 
be returned by one of the following methods:
•  in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand to the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars (PXS), The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent BR3 4TU; or
•  in the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the procedures set out below; 
 and in each case must be received by the Company not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.
 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the AGM and any 
adjournment thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take 
the appropriate action on their behalf.
 In order for a proxy appointment, or instruction, made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must 
be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (“EUI”) specifications and must contain the information required for such 
instructions, as described in the CREST manual. The message regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the 
instruction given previously to the appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the 
latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the Notice of Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as 
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by 
enquiry to CREST in the manner described by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 
35(5) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note 
that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy instructions. It is therefore the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if a CREST member is a CREST 
personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) 
take(s) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that the message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
3. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, in order to be able to attend and vote at the AGM or any adjourned meeting 
(and also for the purpose of calculating how many votes a person may cast), a person must have his/her name entered on the register of members of the 
Company by 6.00pm on 12 July 2011 (or 6.00pm on the date two days before any adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on the register of members after 
this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
4. Copies of the directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on any weekday 
and will be available at the place of the AGM from at least 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the meeting.
5. Any electronic communication received by the Company, including the lodgement of an electronic proxy form, that is found to contain any virus will not 
be accepted.

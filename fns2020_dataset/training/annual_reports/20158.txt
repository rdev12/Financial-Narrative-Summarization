03 Chairman’ s statement 
A year of progress on many fronts 
3i’s business, balance sheet and board 
have all developed considerably this year. 
The results for the Company are a good 
financial performance and strong cash 
flow, an enhanced competitive position 
and opportunities to grow value for 
shareholders in the years ahead. 
In summary, a year of progress on 
many fronts. 
Our very high level of realisations 
has afforded the opportunity to return 
£500 million to our shareholders, thus 
improving our capital efficiency, without 
compromising our ability to grow. 
Each of our Buyout, Growth 
Capital and Venture Capital businesses 
has improved its competitive position 
in the year. Our strategy of developing the 
business internationally has progressed 
well and some 48% of 3i’s portfolio value 
is now outside the UK. 
A total return of £512 million for 
the 12 months to 31 March 2005 
represents a 15.9% return on opening 
shareholders’ funds, marginally better 
than both the FTSE All-Share (15.6%) 
and the FTSE 100 (15.4%) total return 
indices in the same period, and ahead of 
3i’ s share price. 
The Board is recommending a 
final ordinary dividend of 9.3p, making a 
total ordinary dividend of 14.6p, an 
increase of 4.3% from 14.0p last year. 
Looking forward, the Board intends to 
achieve the return of an additional 
£500 million to shareholders through a 
combination of special dividend and 
share repurchases. The Board therefore 
proposes to pay a special dividend 
of 40.7p per share (approximately 
£250 million) as soon as practicable after 
the Annual General Meeting on 6 July. 
The Board also proposes that the 
balance of about £250 million be 
returned to shareholders through a 
programme of on-market share 
buybacks beginning in July. Resolutions 
relating to both the special dividend 
and buyback proposals will be put to 
shareholders at an Extraordinary General 
Meeting we plan to hold immediately 
following the Annual General Meeting. 
In my interim report to you I noted 
that the appointment of Philip Yea as 
Chief Executive in July 2004 was widely 
welcomed and that Philip had made a 
number of organisational changes in the 
autumn of 2004. These changes have 
positioned the business for growth, 
enhancing the linkage between our 
business lines and geographic markets 
and ensuring that 3i continues to attract, 
retain and develop the best talent.

04 Simon Ball joined 3i in February and 
succeeded Michael Queen as Finance 
Director on 1 April 2005, the date when 
Michael formally became responsible for 
3i’s Growth Capital business. Rod Perry, 
who has done a tremendous job with our 
Venture Capital business since he 
became responsible for it in 2001, retires 
from the Board at our Annual General 
Meeting in July at the age of 60. He will 
be succeeded by Jo Taylor, who will join 
our Executive Committee in July. Rod’ s 
Human Resources responsibilities have 
been taken on by Denise Collis, who 
joined 3i and the Executive Committee 
in November. 
I was also delighted to welcome 
Sir Robert Smith and Dr Peter Mihatsch 
as non-executive Directors to the Board 
in September 2004. Sir Robert brings 
a wealth of experience from the City 
and industry and has substantial private 
equity experience. Peter brings an

As ever, the macroeconomic prospects 
are complicated by global imbalances 
and shifts in the pattern of growth. 3i is, 
however, well placed to take advantage 
of these. We are already securing access 
to growth capital opportunities 
in India and China and our Venture 
Capital business is able to exploit its 
network in the US, Asia and Europe. 
Meanwhile, the pace of restructuring in 
Europe is accelerating. 
A year of such good progress at 
3i is the result of a team effort and I 
would like to pay tribute to three groups 
of people in particular. First, our teams 
around the world, who have worked with 
skill and determination to deliver these 
results. Second, the managers of our 
portfolio companies, who are the ultimate 
drivers of 3i’s value, and third, the many 
people who work with 3i around the 
world to find, invest and grow businesses 
with us.

thus improving our capital efficiency 
05 Chief Executive’ s statement 
My role as Chief Executive is to deliver 
performance from the present business 
while building for the future. 
I am pleased to report a strong 
set of results and good progress in the 
acceleration of 3i’s development as a 
truly international private equity firm. 
Total return for the year was 15.9% on 
restated opening shareholders’ funds. 
Both Buyouts and Growth Capital 
performed well, with gross portfolio 
returns of 22% and 24% respectively, 
and Venture Capital showed an improved 
performance with a gross return for the 
year of 11%. 
Although, during the year, 
investment conditions were competitive 
for Buyouts, with increased funds flowing 
into European private equity and the 
high availability of debt, our teams 
invested £532 million, of which 
£338 million was from 3i’s own 
resources. Growth Capital had a 
slower year in terms of the amount of 
investment (£263 million) but the 
pipeline going forward is encouraging. 
Our Venture Capital business continues 
to be selective and disciplined in its 
investment approach and invested 
£143 million. 
A strong set of results and good 
progress in the acceleration 
of 3i’ s development as a truly 
international private equity firm 
Realisation proceeds were £1.3 billion 
and these were generated at good uplifts 
to carrying value. The portfolio performed 
well and health remains sound, reflecting 
both improved investment processes and 
the relatively benign economic backdrop. 
To assist understanding of our 
current business model, we have 
decided to report separately the returns 
from our SMI portfolio which, in fact, has 
been run by a dedicated team since 
2001. This team continues to make 
excellent progress in realising value from 
this part of the portfolio. 
At the time of our interims in 
November, I spoke of the opportunities 
I saw for the Group to continue to 
improve our returns but also to increase 
the level of our investment. In view of the 
opportunities within our Growth Capital 
business to invest at a larger deal size, 
which quite often involves investing in 
companies with cross-border ambitions, 
we have decided to operate this 
business line on a more integrated 
international basis. 
We are accelerating the 
development of our Asian business 
by opening an office in Shanghai 
and starting the recruitment of a high 
quality team to develop a business in 
India. We are also actively building 
relationships to access the market for 
infrastructure investment in the UK and 
the rest of Europe. These steps are the 
prelude to achieving a higher level of 
investment over the next few years 
without diluting our returns. 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
06 Our vision: 
to be the private equity firm of choice 
Over the following pages we explain how we are working to achieve this. 
In his new role as Head of Group 
Markets, Chris Rowlands has taken a 
number of important steps to improve 
the agility with which we bring our 
resources to bear in the market. 
Our central sector group of 
industrialists has been strengthened to 
support the greater emphasis being given 
to sector specialisation in the origination 
of investments. We have also taken 
specific opportunities to add to the 
quality of our existing teams by bringing 
in fresh, relevant experience from outside, 
including Managing Directors for our 
German speaking and Indian businesses 
and our Group Marketing Director. 
The creation of partnership style 
structures within each of our business 
lines has been supported in recent years 
by the introduction of carried interest 
schemes. These reward our teams for 
successful realisations. The continued 
success of our business line model within 
our international network is critically 
dependent upon the quality of our people 
and how well we deliver partnership 
models across the Group as a whole. 
Denise Collis, who joined our Executive 
Committee as Group Human Resources 
Director in November, is having a major 
impact on how we further improve our 
employment proposition and progress 
the development of our people to deliver 
a true culture of partnership across the 
Group as a whole. 
As we develop our resources in new 
markets, we anticipate a modest 
increase in our cost base but, over the 
medium term, would expect our costs 
as a proportion of our gross returns 
to decline. 
Following Michael Queen’ s move 
from Finance Director to head up our 
Growth Capital business, and the 
appointment of Simon Ball as his 
successor, the announcement in January 
that Jo Taylor would succeed Rod Perry 
in heading our Venture business has 
completed the series of changes required 
to implement our immediate plans. Rod 
has made a major contribution to the 
Group in this and other roles and I have 
asked him to continue his association 
with us by heading up an international 
advisory board for our Venture business. 
At the interims, we took the step 
of making public the gross cash to cash 
returns that we are targeting for each 
of our business lines, as well as the 
volatilities that we expect to experience 
over given time periods (page 78). At the 
mid-point of these ranges and with an 
appropriate level of leverage to our equity 
base, we would expect to achieve an 
average return on equity of 20%. 
The good returns we are 
achieving, and particularly the high 
level of realisation proceeds we have 
generated over the past two years, have 
given rise to a higher level of financial 
resources than we can profitably reinvest 
in the near term. By reference to the level 
of gearing we believe is appropriate for 
the business and, having reviewed our 
medium-term projections of cash flows, 
we have decided to take immediate 
steps to return capital to shareholders. 
Although we intend to increase the 
amounts we invest, particularly through 
accelerating investment in growth 
capital opportunities and expanding our 
business lines and geographic footprint, 
we are committed to maintaining financial 
efficiency by returning cash when it is 
surplus to our investment needs. 
Our strategic opportunities are 
clear and much change is under way to 
accelerate their delivery. At the same 
time, our teams are maintaining their 
focus on continuing to deliver high quality 
investment opportunities. Despite the 
hesitancy apparent in the financial 
markets, I intend to report further good 
progress towards our performance and 
strategic goals in the year ahead.

operating on a world-wide scale

3i’s business is conducted through an international network of teams, spread 
across Europe, the US and Asia. This global network provides market access and 
with specialised teams for each business line and sector in which 
3i in Asia 
3i in the US 
3i in Europe 
3i’s Buyout, Growth Capital and Venture Capital businesses invest 
across Europe. This market, which is second only in size to the US, 
has progressed well over the past 12 months. 3i’s strategy in Europe is 
focused on harnessing our strong regional presence and relationships 
we operate. Our critical mass provides the market access and the 
capability to deliver. 
The market in Asia continues to develop and we believe that there 
are excellent opportunities to capture growth. The biggest opportunity 
for 3i in Asia is in Growth Capital. The opportunities look particularly 
encouraging in China and India, where strong economic growth 
is complemented by highly skilled work forces, entrepreneurial 
management teams and innovation. We also invest in established 
funds to build relationships and gain access to dealflow in specific 
markets in the region. 
The US is the largest and most developed private equity and venture 
capital market in the world. To date, 3i has focused on the venture 
segment, investing in early and later stage situations where our 
international network can add value. The good relationships we have 
built with the major US technology corporates, our growing reputation 
with top tier syndicate partners and the insights gained from our 
presence in the US are critical to building and realising value from 
our venture portfolio in the US, in Europe and in Asia.

Focus Media 
In November 2004, 3i invested US$8 million 
in a US$35 million funding round in Focus 
Media, the pioneer and market leader in 
digital outdoor media advertising in China. 
Focus Media offers customers 
advertising opportunities through flat panel 
TV screens in over 15,000 prime commercial 
locations in mainland China. 
Despite keen competition from 
other private equity houses, 3i was selected 
alongside Goldman Sachs due to our local 
presence, our track record in private equity 
and our reputation in the media sector. 
3i’s significant sector expertise not 
only enabled us to recognise the high growth 
potential of this innovative medium, but also 
to add considerable value post investment. 
This has included the introduction of Eric 
Rosenkranz, former Asia Pacific president 
of Grey Global Group and an established 
industry expert, as vice chairman. 
The high growth of the business 
and its financial performance have put Focus 
Media in the position where it is now able 
to contemplate an IPO, possibly becoming 
the first media company in China to list 
on NASDAQ. 
The power of our network 
Any business operating on a world-wide scale must have the systems, 
communications and culture in place to maximise the benefit of 
its resources. In 3i’s case, this means ensuring that all of our staff 
world-wide understand our vision and strategy and have access to 
the resources of the Group as a whole. The 3i portal provides instant 
access to our knowledge base and the regular gatherings of our teams 
by business line, sector and geography all ensure that 3i uses the 
power of its network.

10 Buyouts
Westminster Health Care 
3i’s investment in Westminster Health Care 
(“WHC”), delivered a money multiple of 4 
times 3i’s original investment and an internal 
rate of return of over 80% upon the sale of 
the company to Barchester Healthcare for 
£525 million, in October 2004. 
In 2002, 3i led the £267 million 
buyout of WHC, the third largest UK high 
quality care home operator with 5,680 beds 
in 88 care homes, backing Tony Heywood 
as chief executive and introducing Nick Irens 
as chairman. 
3i was attracted by the experience 
and track record of the management team, 
the quality of WHC’s estate and its strong 
brand and reputation. 
Our in-depth understanding of the 
healthcare sector allowed us to add value by 
working in partnership with the management 
team to develop a number of successful 
specialist care operations. These initiatives, 
together with organic growth, enabled WHC 
to outperform its buyout plan from the outset, 
with profits rising by over 60% during the 
two and a half years of 3i’s ownership. 
Prior to exit, 3i positioned the 
business with key potential buyers, 
engineering a closely contested auction 
process won ultimately by Barchester 
Healthcare, creating one of the largest 
healthcare groups in the UK. 
Growth Capital 
Pets at Home 
The £230 million sale of Pets at Home to 
private equity firm Bridgepoint in July 2004, 
delivered cash proceeds to 3i of £85 million, 
including a £12.5 million dividend on exit, a 
3.5 times cash multiple on our investment. 
3i supported Pets at Home, a 
specialist retailer for pets and pet products, 
over eight years. 
When 3i first invested in 1996 to 
support organic growth and back the founder 
Anthony Preston, a 3i alumnus and proven 
entrepreneur, the company had 15 stores 
and employed 100 people. 
In 1999, 3i invested again to fund the 
acquisition of the company’s main competitor, 
PetSmart from its US parent. By 2004, Pets 
at Home had 150 out-of-town stores across 
the UK, employed 2,700 people and 
generated a turnover of £218 million in the 
year to March 2004. 
Pets at Home is a good example 
of 3i supporting organic growth, a 
transformational acquisition, adding 
considerable value through the introduction 
of a non-executive director and helping to 
manage a successful exit process. 
Financial management 
Our business lines are focused on delivering market-beating returns 
across their respective operations. We can optimise both the level of 
these returns and the consistency of their delivery through leveraging 
the Group’ s financial resources and actively managing the risk profile 
across our portfolio. By combining this with a strong focus on the size 
and shape of our cost base, we can deliver an enhanced return on 
equity to our shareholders.

behaviours across all our business lines to support the firm’s long-term development.

sales per day from the 10 million items for 
sale. This has made it one of the top five 
“e-tailers” in France. 
3i first met the management team 
in late 2002, and developed a strong 
relationship. When Babelstore sought 
additional capital in 2004 to expand 
internationally, this relationship and 3i’s 
international network made 3i a 
natural choice. 
3i is supporting the expansion of 
Babelstore’s operations in France, Italy and 
Spain as well as the development of new 
online product categories (including cars). 
3i has introduced a non-executive 
director with significant sector experience 
and is currently assisting the company in 
recruiting a chief financial officer.

3i Report and accounts 2005  Buyouts
Travelex 
In February 2005, 3i and Lloyd Dorfman 
reached conditional agreement with Apax in 
a deal to purchase Travelex in a £1 billion 
transaction. Completion of the deal is 
scheduled for the summer of 2005 and 3i is 
forecast to achieve a total money multiple of 
over 10 times its original investment. 3i will 
retain a 7% stake upon completion. 
3i backed the buyout of Travelex in 
December 1998, having been introduced to 
Lloyd Dorfman, who founded the business in 
1976, by the then Deputy Chairman of 3i. 
Under Lloyd Dorfman’s leadership, Travelex 
has become the world’s largest foreign 
exchange specialist employing around 
6,000 staff in 35 countries, carrying out 
approximately 30 million transactions a year 
and serving 17,000 corporate and financial 
institution customers. 
Following strong initial performance, 
3i worked with the company to launch a high 
yield bond in August 2000, enabling early 
repayment of £23 million of loans to 3i and 
leaving 3i with a 33% shareholding for a cost 
of £200,000. 
3i has supported T ravelex through 
several key strategic moves, using its reputation 
in the City of London and financial expertise. 
These key strategic events included 
the acquisitions of T ranspay from Barclays and 
Thomas Cook Global & Financial Services, 
a business three times the size of T ravelex.

3i invested US$15 million in August 2004 to 
support the growth of Singapore-based 
Pearl Energy, an independent exploration

3i’ s relationship with the management 
since 2000, combined with our sector 
credentials and ability to deliver an innovative, 
convertible investment structure within a 
tight timescale, secured the opportunity. 
Our experience and knowledge of the sector, 
gained from over 30 years investing in oil and 
gas, enabled us to move more quickly than 
our competitors. 
The ability of our oil and gas team, 
which has over 40 other investments in the 
sector, to add considerable value, was also 
a key reason to invest. From our network, 
we were able to introduce an independent 
non-executive director, with extensive oil and

computer and industrial electronics markets. 
Vette Corp’s strategy is to combine a 
secure, low-cost manufacturing operation in 
China with a world-class global sales team 
in order to build a large, integrated thermal 
solutions business in this highly fragmented 
market. Current suppliers of electronic 
thermal solutions are mostly small, heavily

manufacturing located outside of Asia. 
The management team saw value 
in 3i’s global network, with its presence in

introduce potential sources of financing 
and customers world-wide through 3i’s 
corporate relationships.

This review includes a description 
of 3i’s business and strategy and 
comments on 3i’s performance 
during the year in the context 
of the economic and market 
environment and other influences. 
It also discusses 3i’s financial 
position, including changes to its 
capital structure, and comments 
on the main risks inherent in 3i’s 
business and the framework used 
to manage them. 
3i’s business and strategy 
3i’s business 
The focus of 3i’ s business continues to be 
to invest in buyouts, growth capital and 
venture capital. Buyouts represent 36% 
of our portfolio by value at 31 March 2005, 
with Growth Capital at 29% and Venture 
Capital at 17%. Geographically, most of 
our investment is in businesses based 
in Europe, although 3i does have 
growing investment operations in the 
US and in Asia. 
Buyouts
This business line invests in European 
mid-market buyout transactions with a 
value up to 11 billion and targets 
between 15 and 25 transactions per 
year. These investments typically involve 
3i together with co-investment funds
managed by 3i holding the majority of the 
equity of a portfolio company. 
The vendors of businesses 
acquired through a buyout are typically 
large corporates disposing of non-core 
activities, private groups with succession 
issues or, in the case of a secondary 
buyout, other private equity investors. 
3i targets the mid-market 
because that is where we believe we 
can create the most value. There is also 
less competition for transactions in this 
market than for larger deals and price is 
less likely to be the sole or key criterion in 
“winning the deal”. The nature and size of 
businesses in this market are such that 
we are more able to add value through 
strategic, operational and management 
input; and, in this segment, the 
underlying businesses will generally have 
significant growth potential and be 
attractive acquisition targets for a number 
of strategic purchasers. We anticipate 
growing this business broadly in line with 
the European mid-market. 
Growth Capital 
3i’s Growth Capital business line targets 
investments of between 110 million and 
1100 million, across a broad range of 
sectors, business sizes and funding 
needs, investing in 20 to 30 transactions 
per year. These investments typically 
involve 3i acquiring minority stakes in 
substantial privately-owned businesses at 
key points of change. Growth capital can 
be invested to accelerate organic growth, 
to fund acquisitions or to acquire shares 
from existing shareholders to resolve a 
succession or other ownership issue. 
With such minority positions, we seek to 
ensure a high level of influence to create 
value for all shareholders. 
3i’s Growth Capital business is 
primarily focused on the European and 
Asian markets where we see excellent 
opportunities to grow investment by 
around 15% per annum. 
Success in Growth Capital is 
increasingly driven by sector-focused 
marketing and the ability to add value 
to companies expanding internationally 
through giving them access to 3i’s 
network. These factors, combined with 
3i’s traditional strength in managing 
relationships with regional businesses 
and intermediaries, give 3i significant 
competitive advantage. 
In addition, because 3i’s funding, 
unlike that of most of the private equity 
industry, is not constrained by being 
fixed-life or closed-end in nature, we are 
able to be more flexible regarding the 
investment holding period.

The main elements of our network are 
as follows: 
Business line teams 
Our specialist teams of investment 
executives in each of our Buyout, Growth 
Capital and Venture Capital business 
lines. 3i’s scale and structure also allow 
us to utilise specialist skills in a number 
of other areas, including portfolio 
management, restructuring and 
turnarounds, and exits and Initial Public 
Offerings (“IPOs”) of companies from 
3i’s portfolio. 
Sector specialisation 
Our sector teams and the relationships 
that they have around the world provide 
market access, insight to investment 
judgment and the capability to add value. 
These sector teams are drawn from our 
investment and portfolio management 
executives and 3i’s Sector Group, which 
comprises around 20 experienced senior 
industry specialists. 
Local presence 
The relationships that 3i has across the 
world with entrepreneurs, business 
leaders, corporates, universities, research 
organisations and intermediaries. 
Relationships with corporates 
Another benefit of 3i’ s scale, international 
reach and membership of the FTSE 100, 
is that we have developed valuable 
relationships with many of the leading 
corporates in each of the geographies 
and sectors in which we operate. 
Furthermore, 3i’ s ability to make effective 
business introductions across a range of 
geographies and sectors is increasingly a 
critical factor in our ability to “win deals” 
and provides 3i with a distinctive source 
of value creation. 
17 Operating and financial review (continued) 
Boards and management teams 
The “People Programmes” 3i runs for 
chairmen, chief executives, chief financial 
officers and independent directors 
provide an excellent resource for building 
and strengthening boards and 
operational management; and are also 
a strong source of both investment 
opportunities and due diligence capability. 
Sharing knowledge and relationships 
Having invested in building such a 
significant network, it is imperative that 
3i maximises its value through having 
the systems, processes and, most 
importantly, culture to enable this to 
happen. An important tool is the 3i portal. 
This web-based knowledge system 
provides everyone at 3i with instant 
access to the combined knowledge and 
relationships of the Group. 
Organisation and office network 
A number of changes to the 
management and organisation of our 
investment business were announced 
during the year. Chris Rowlands 
was appointed as Head of Group 
Markets, with responsibility for further 
developing the benefits of 3i’s geographic 
network and our sector and business 
relationships. Michael Queen was 
appointed to succeed Chris Rowlands as 
Head of Growth Capital. These changes 
took effect from 1 April 2005. In addition, 
we announced that Rod Perry would be 
retiring as Head of Venture Capital in July 
2005 and would be succeeded by Jo 
Taylor, who has run 3i’s UK Venture 
Capital team since 1999. Jonathan 
Russell continues to lead our Buyouts 
business line. 
Within each business line, a panel of 3i’ s 
most experienced investors ensures 
rigorous application of our investment 
processes. These panels also seek to 
ensure, on a case-by-case basis, that we 
assemble “the best team for the job” 
from our regional, sector and business 
line specialists. 
The investment and divestment 
approval functions for larger transactions 
are carried out by two Investment 
Committees, addressing technology and 
non-technology investments respectively. 
The membership of these Investment 
Committees is drawn from 3i’s 
Executive Committee. 
3i’s SMI initiative, which was 
established in 2001, continues to be 
successful in generating returns from 
some of the older and lower-growth 
investments. At 31 March 2005, 
£762 million of value (18% of 3i’s total 
portfolio) and 807 investments (54% by 
number of 3i’s total portfolio) were 
managed by the SMI team. It is our 
objective to continue to realise the SMI 
portfolio over the medium term. 
As noted above, we have started 
the recruitment of a team for India and 
intend to open an office in Shanghai to 
complement our team based in Hong 
Kong. During the year, we closed a 
number of our smaller offices, in Padua, 
Nantes and Vienna. At 31 March 2005, 
we had a total of 28 offices (24 across 
Europe and two each in the US 
and Asia). 
Since 31 March 2005, with a 
view to focusing our new business 
activity in the UK and Germany in fewer 
locations, we have communicated the 
decision to close our offices in central 
Birmingham, Reading and Düsseldorf. 
Following these closures, we will have 
eight offices in the UK, of which four 
(Aberdeen, Cambridge, London and 
Manchester) will focus on new business, 
with the other four (Birmingham – Trinity 
Park, Bristol, Glasgow and Leeds) being 
solely focused on portfolio management. 
Operating review 
Macroeconomic and market conditions 
Overall, the macroeconomic environment 
in the geographies where 3i operates 
remained supportive during the year, 
though conditions within the different 
regions and sectors in which our portfolio 
companies operate were variable. 
Broadly, the year was one of economic 
growth with low levels of inflation and 
interest rates, which helped to keep 
business sentiment and consumer 
confidence positive throughout. 
In currency terms, sterling strengthened 
slightly against the US dollar and 
a number of Asian currencies, and 
weakened slightly against the euro, giving 
rise to a modest negative impact on the 
competitive positions of some of our 
European and UK portfolio companies. 
Stock market indices rose over 
the year as a whole, after a relatively 
subdued first half, though technology 
indices and markets did less well, 
experiencing either flat or moderately 
negative performances. The strong 
overall increase reflects improving 
confidence in underlying economic 
growth and prospects for corporate 
earnings. Mergers and acquisitions 
(“M&A”) volumes, a key driver of activity 
in our Buyout business, remained 
relatively subdued, both in Europe and 
globally, as corporates remained cautious 
despite improved balance sheets. 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
18 The private equity markets in which 3i 
operates experienced increased levels 
of activity. Market statistics for calendar 
year 2004 show that total private equity 
investment in Europe increased by 18% 
compared with 2003, with buyout 
investment up by 15%, growth capital 
up by 61% (from a particularly low level 
in 2003) and venture capital up 
by 16%. The level of investment in 2004 
represented the second highest year 
on record after 2000 (the height of the 
“technology bubble”). 
Market statistics for the venture 
capital market in the US show that 
investment in 2004 was up 11% on 
2003; and statistics for the same period 
for Asia show overall private equity 
investment also up 11% on 2003. 
Conditions for realisations 
improved, with the return of corporate 
buyers to the market and the IPO 
window reopening to some extent. 
Market statistics for Europe show a 53% 
rise in the number of divestments in 2004 
compared with 2003. Secondary 
buyouts (sales of private equity-backed 
businesses to other private equity-
backed teams or businesses) have 
become an increasing feature of the 
market place, providing a significant 
alternative realisation route. In 2004 they 
accounted for 28% of total buyout 
investment in Europe. In addition, 2004 
saw increasing amounts of debt 
available, which led to an increase in 
refinancing activity across the industry. 
The European mid-market 
for buyouts saw increased levels of 
competition during the year, driven by 
a combination of the high availability of 
debt at aggressive prices and the large 
amounts of cash in the hands of private 
equity investors. Rising leverage ratios 
often enabled private equity buyers to 
outbid trade buyers. 
Within growth capital, the level of 
competition remained at much lower 
levels than for buyouts, with relatively few 
private equity players pursuing these 
transactions. The market itself is much 
less well-defined and understood than 
buyouts, but we have noted a growing 
acceptance in some of the less mature 
private equity markets in Europe of the 
role of external equity funding in enabling 
businesses to grow. We continue to 
believe that the use of private equity to 
facilitate cross-border expansion within 
the European market is a key driver of 
investment opportunity. 
For venture capital, 2004 saw a 
number of positives, including signs of 
increasing technology expenditure by 
corporates, greater willingness on the 
part of the stock markets to absorb 
venture-backed companies, especially 
within the biotechnology sector, and 
the return of trade buyers in greater 
numbers, particularly from the US. 
The fundraising environment in Europe 
remained slow and difficult throughout 
2004, influencing the choice of syndicate 
partners for 3i. 
56% of the amount invested 
in the year was made

Total return 
3i achieved a total return of £512 million 
for the financial year, which equates to 
15.9% on restated opening shareholders’ 
funds. This compares with returns on the 
FTSE All-Share, FTSE 100 and FTSE 
SmallCap (ex investment companies) 
total return indices of 15.6%, 15.4% and 
11.4% respectively. The components of 
the total return are shown in table 1. 
The main drivers of the total 
return were a good level of profitable 
realisations, strong levels of income 
and steady growth in the value of 
the portfolio. 
Our Buyouts and Growth Capital 
business lines delivered strong returns 
for the second successive year, and 
Venture Capital continues to demonstrate 
improved performance. Table 2 contains 
an analysis of returns by business line, 
at the gross portfolio return level 
(ie before deduction of remuneration 
and other expenses). 
We have decided this year to 
disclose separately the returns, amount 
invested and realisation proceeds of the 
SMI portfolio, in order to provide greater 
visibility on trends in our three ongoing 
business lines. In prior years, the SMI 
figures were included within those of 
the business line to which individual 
assets previously related. For ease of 
comparison, we have adjusted the 2004 
figures to show them on the same basis 
as those for 2005. 
For Buyouts, the gross return of 
22% was underpinned by a high level of 
profitable realisations and the continuing 
strong performance of the portfolio. 
The Growth Capital business line 
achieved a 24% gross return, mainly as 
a result of strong realisation profits and 
good “first-time uplifts” on a number of 
recent investments. Venture Capital made 
a gross return of 11%, reflecting a good 
level of realised profits and a number of 
valuation increases arising as a result of 
portfolio companies raising funds from 
new investors at increased values. 
Across each of the business lines, we 
have seen the portfolio’s health improving 
and the level of provisions falling. 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
20 The gross portfolio return from the 
SMI portfolio was £70 million (7%), 
which comprises £86 million of income 
receipts, realised profits of £2 million and 
a net unrealised valuation reduction 
of £18 million. 
Investment
3i invested a total of £755 million 
(£962 million including investment on 
behalf of co-investment funds), which is 
marginally lower than the prior year and 
lower than our expected run-rate over 
the cycle. This reflects two main factors. 
First, within Buyouts, as noted previously, 
competition has been intense and price 
levels high, and we have sought to 
remain selective and disciplined in our 
approach. Second, in Growth Capital, 
as we have moved to a larger average 
deal size, investment levels are less 
evenly spread. 
An analysis of the amount 
invested, by business line and 
geography, is given in table 5. Buyouts 
represented 45% of total investment, 
Growth Capital 35% and Venture Capital 
19%. Of the amount invested in Venture 
Capital, 59% was further investment into 
existing portfolio companies. 
Continental European investment 
represented 45% of the total invested, 
the US 7% and Asia 4%. The share of 
investment represented by continental 
Europe reflects our focus on the relatively 
less mature private equity markets there 
compared with those in the UK. 
3i’s ability to access and execute deals 
across Europe through our regional 
presence and ability to resource 
transactions on a pan-European basis 
has also driven investment growth.

Realisations
3i generated realisation proceeds of 
£1,302 million (2004: £923 million) during 
the financial year, reflecting a profit over 
31 March 2004 values of £260 million 
(25%), compared with £228 million (33%) 
in the prior year. The uplift over 31 March 
2004 values on realisations of equity 
investments was 40% (2004: 58%). 
The reduced uplift percentage relative to 
last year is largely due to the high level of 
realisations achieved in the earlier months 
of the year. These assets were realised 
for amounts similar to their carrying value 
at 31 March 2004 as they were then 
valued on an imminent sale basis. 
Realised profits are stated net of 
write-offs, which amounted to £37 million 
(2004: £50 million). Overall, 24% of the 
opening portfolio (by value) was realised 
during the year (2004: 18%), including 
sales and redemptions of loans and fixed 
income shares. 
Table 6 shows an analysis of 
realisation proceeds by business line 
and geography. Realisations were strong 
across all business lines, but most 
significantly within Buyouts, where 
advantage was taken of the high level of 
secondary buyout activity. Geographically, 
the UK was particularly active, generating 
69% of total proceeds. 
Although most of our realisation 
proceeds continue to come from sales of 
portfolio businesses to trade and financial 
purchasers, 12 portfolio companies 
achieved IPOs during the year on six 
different markets. The IPOs of Pinewood 
Shepperton, the film and TV studios 
business, in May 2004 and E2V 
Holdings, a supplier of switching, 
sensing and imaging components, in 
June 2004, were notable in providing 3i 
with a 100% cash realisation on IPO. 
Significant individual contributions 
to our realisation proceeds for the 
year were Yellow Brick Road, the 
telephone directories group, where we 
achieved interim realisation proceeds of 
£61 million through a merger and 
refinancing completed in April 2004; 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
22 and the sale in October 2004 of 
Westminster Health Care, the care 
homes operator, which generated 
realisation proceeds of £155 million 
at an uplift of £97 million over its 
31 March 2004 valuation. 
As noted in the market 
commentary above, sales of businesses 
to financial purchasers, through 
secondary buyouts, were a feature of 
the market during the year. Realisation 
proceeds of £182 million arose through 
such sales of portfolio businesses. In 
addition, conditions were favourable for 
refinancing businesses and we were able 
to generate realisation proceeds of over 
£100 million through refinancings, with 
the merger and refinancing of Yellow 
Brick Road being the prime example. 
Sales of quoted equity benefited 
from the general rise in equity markets 
and a more active realisation strategy by 
3i, with proceeds of £134 million and a 
profit of £28 million (26%) over 31 March 
2004 valuations. 
Unrealised value movement 
The unrealised profit on the revaluation 
of investments was £270 million (2004: 
£336 million). An analysis of the different 
components of the value movement is 
given in table 7. 
The weighted average earnings 
multiple applied to investments valued on 
an earnings basis was 12.0 at both the 
end and the start of the year. However, 
for those investments valued on an 
earnings basis at both dates, the 
weighted average earnings multiple rose 
from 11.7 to 12.3 over the year, giving 
rise to a value increase of £40 million 
(2004: £287 million). In the prior year, 
largely because of the general rise in 
equity markets, the weighted average 
earnings multiple increased from 8.1 to 
12.0 over the year. 
The aggregate attributable 
earnings of investments valued on an 
earnings basis at both the start and 
the end of the year increased by 
approximately 3%, giving rise to a 
£20 million value increase. A number of 
strongly-performing Buyouts and Growth 
Capital assets contributed significantly to 
this increase. It should be noted (by 
reference to table 7) that the value 
movement relating to first-time uplifts 
includes £74 million which is due 
to earnings growth and that the “other 
movements on unquoted investments” 
item includes a net £3 million valuation 
increase in respect of investments that 
moved between a net assets and an 
earnings basis of valuation. The net value 
movement due to earnings growth is 
therefore a £97 million increase. 
The net valuation impact arising 
on investments being valued on a 
basis other than cost for the first time 
(“first-time uplifts”) was £149 million 
(2004: £238 million). This is a reflection of 
the quality of investments made in recent 
years and also of the general increase in 
price levels over the period. 
Provisions against the carrying 
value of investments in businesses 
which may fail totalled £66 million 
(2004: £143 million), representing 1.5% 
of the opening portfolio value and a 
significant improvement over levels 
in recent periods. 
There was a net £36 million 
valuation increase (2004: £70 million 
decrease) as a result of investee 
companies raising funds from new 
investors at increased values 
(£56 million), net of value reductions 
(£20 million) relating to the application 
of 3i’s downround valuation methodology 
and fair value adjustments to our 
Venture Capital portfolio. 
Other movements on unquoted 
investments include valuation increases 
totalling £101 million on investments 
being revalued on an imminent sale 
basis. This includes £52 million in respect 
of the announced sale of Travelex, the 
foreign currency services business, which 
is due to complete in the summer. 
The quoted investments held 
at the end of the year increased in 
value by an aggregate £12 million over 
the year, largely reflecting the rise in 
equity markets. 
Carried interest and investment 
performance plans 
Market practice in the private equity 
industry is to offer investment staff the 
opportunity to participate in returns 
from successful investments through 
“carried interest” or similar arrangements. 
The charge in the year of £66 million 
(2004: £40 million) reflects both profitable 
realisations and strong value growth on a 
number of recent investments. 
Amounts payable under such 
arrangements on the successful 
realisation of investments in the year 
totalled £30 million (2004: £8 million). 
A further £36 million (2004: £32 million) 
has been accrued in respect of amounts 
that would be payable under such 
arrangements if assets were ultimately 
realised at their 31 March 2005 
carrying values. 
Income and costs 
The main elements of income and 
costs are shown in table 1 on page 20. 
Total portfolio income was 
£232 million (2004: £199 million). 
The increase when compared with the 
prior year is due mainly to the receipt of 
several large special dividends arising on 
the sale of investments, an increase in 
the level of interest income and a rise in 
deal-related fees (net of abort costs). 
Management expenses of 
£172 million (2004: £163 million) were 
6% higher than in the prior year, during a 
period in which our staff headcount fell 
slightly, from 771 at the start of the year 
to 740 at the end. The increase reflects 
the costs associated with “upskilling” 
our investment teams and the costs 
associated with changes in senior 
management.
Net interest payable decreased 
relative to last year, reflecting both the 
reduced level of net borrowings and the 
lower average rate of interest following 
the1550 million convertible bond issue 
in August 2003.

The portfolio 
The number of investments in the 
portfolio fell from 1,878 (of which SMI 
was 1,079) at the start of the year to 
1,502 (of which SMI was 807) at the end, 
reflecting the high level of realisations. 
We would expect this trend to continue 
over the medium term, as a result of our 
SMI initiative and partly also of our 
strategy of making a smaller number of 
higher value investments than in the past. 
Charts A, B and C show the 
portfolio analysed by business line, 
geography and industry sector 
respectively. At the year end, 36% of 
the portfolio was represented by 
Buyouts, 29% by Growth Capital 
investments and 17% by Venture Capital 
investments. Geographically, 52% was in 
the UK, 39% in continental Europe, 7% 
in the US and 2% in Asia. 
Although the number of 
investments in 3i’s portfolio has reduced, 
3i still has, in contrast to many others in 
the private equity industry, relatively low 
exposure to individual company risk. 
The top 10 investments represented 
15% of portfolio value at the year end 
and the top 50 investments 40%. 
Fund management activities 
Consistent with our announcement 
last July, we have ceased managing 
quoted funds and our fund management 
activities now comprise solely the 
management of private equity funds. 
These funds are primarily 
co-invested alongside 3i’s own capital 
when financing buyouts, enabling an 
investment to be made without 3i holding 
a majority interest. During the year, 
3i earned fee income of £27 million 
(2004: £31 million) from the management 
of private equity funds. In addition, 
3i receives carried interest in respect of 
third-party funds under management. 
At 31 March 2005, the invested portfolio 
managed on behalf of private equity fund 
investors was valued at £1,260 million 
(2004: £1,324 million), excluding 
undrawn commitments. The final closing 
of Eurofund IV , our latest fund targeted 
at pan-European mid-market buyouts, 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
24 took place in June 2004 with 25 
investors. We subsequently placed 
further commitments with an additional 
15 investors, taking total third party 
commitments to 11.1 billion. At 31 March 
2005, Eurofund IV was 44% committed, 
with investments in 30 companies. 
As noted above, we have 
ceased managing quoted funds and 
have closed our 3i Asset Management 
operation. Fees earned from quoted fund 
management amounted to £3 million 
(2004: £4 million) and total third party 
quoted funds under management at 
31 March 2005 were £nil (2004: 
£600 million). Net costs incurred in 
closing the 3i Asset Management 
operation were not material. 
Accounting policies and valuation 
Valuation
The valuation guidelines of the British 
Venture Capital Association were 
superseded with effect from 1 January 
2005 by “International private equity and 
venture capital valuation guidelines”, 
issued and endorsed by the BVCA, the 
European Private Equity and Venture 
Capital Association and the French 
national association, AFIC. These new 
guidelines effectively incorporate, without 
substantial change, the superseded 
guidelines of the BVCA and have not 
resulted in any changes to 3i’s valuation 
methodology. 
Changes to accounting policies 
Financial Reporting Standard 17 
“Retirement Benefits” was implemented 
in full for the first time during the year. 
Additionally, the recommendations of 
Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 
“Accounting for ESOP Trusts” were 
implemented and the presentation of 
comparatives changed accordingly. 
Introduction of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
Work to comply with the requirements 
of IFRS in the year to 31 March 2006 is 
advancing to plan. Differences have been 
identified, revised accounting policies are 
being finalised and systems changes 
have been implemented. We are

confident that 3i will be able to meet 
requirements for financial reporting during 
the year to 31 March 2006. The first 
financial statements prepared on an IFRS 
basis will be those for the six months to 
30 September 2005. Further details 
are provided on page 55. 
Financial review 
Cash flows 
The key cash flows during the year 
were the aggregate cash outflow of 
£719 million (2004: £756 million) in 
respect of investment and cash 
inflows totalling £1,287 million (2004: 
£913 million) in respect of proceeds 
received on realising investments. 
Net cash inflow for the year was 
£433 million (2004: £45 million), 
reducing net borrowings at the year end 
to £526 million (2004: £936 million). 
The level of gearing fell from 29% as 
restated at 31 March 2004 to 14% 
at 31 March 2005. 
Capital structure 
3i’s capital structure comprises a 
combination of shareholders’ funds, 
long-term borrowing, short-term 
borrowing and liquid treasury assets and 
cash. There were no significant changes 
in 3i’s capital structure during the year, 
other than the growth in shareholders’ 
funds and the strong cash inflow. 
Long-term borrowing at 
31 March 2005 is £1,623 million and is 
repayable as follows: £154 million 
between one and two years, £818 million 
between two and five years and 
£651 million after five years. In addition, 
at the year end, 3i had committed and 
undrawn borrowing facilities amounting 
to £579 million and cash and other 
liquid assets totalling £1,199 million. 
We are confident we have in place 
adequate funding for foreseeable 
investment needs. 
3i Group plc currently has 
credit ratings with Moody’s and 
Standard & Poor’s of Aa3/stable and 
A+/stable respectively. 
Proposal to return capital to shareholders 
As indicated in the Chairman’ s statement, 
it is intended that £500 million will be 
returned to shareholders through a 
combination of a special dividend and 
a programme of on-market share 
buy-backs.
The pro-forma level of gearing 
at 31 March 2005, based on flowing 
through into net borrowings the impact 
of this £500 million proposed return 
of capital and the proposed final 
dividend of £56 million, is 34%. 
This represents a more efficient level 
of balance sheet leverage for our 
shareholders, whilst maintaining the 
funding we require to achieve our 
medium-term investment plans. 
25 Operating and financial review (continued) 
Risk management 
Introduction 
3i has a comprehensive framework to 
manage the risks that are inherent in its 
business. This framework includes a risk 
committee whose purpose is to monitor 
the identification, assessment and 
management of key risks across the 
business. The main risks comprise 
economic risk, treasury and funding risk, 
investment risk and operational risk. 
Economic risk 
3i invests mainly in European companies 
and continues to develop its operations 
in the US and Asia. However, the majority 
of the portfolio by value (52%) is still in 
UK companies and there is an element 
of exposure to the UK economic cycle. 
To mitigate this, 3i has invested in 
different sectors of the UK economy with 
different economic cycles. In addition, 
an increasing proportion of assets is 
invested in continental Europe, in the US 
and in Asia, which may be subject to 
different economic cycles. 
Treasury and funding risk 
The overall funding objective continues 
to be that each category of investment 
asset is broadly matched with liabilities 
and shareholders’ funds, with 
corresponding characteristics in terms of 
risk and maturity, and that funding needs 
are met ahead of planned investment. 
This objective continued to be met during 
the year ended 31 March 2005. 
All assets and liabilities are held 
for non-trading purposes and, as a result, 
3i does not have a trading book. 3i does 
not trade in derivatives and does not 
enter into transactions of either a 
speculative nature or unrelated to 3i’s 
investment activities. Derivatives are used 
to manage the risks arising from 3i’s 
investment activities. 
The main funding risks faced by 
3i are interest rate risk and exchange rate 
risk. The level of these risks is mitigated 
by the overall funding objective and the 
Board regularly reviews and approves 
policies on the approach to each of 
these risks. 
3i is currently in the process of 
implementing a new policy for foreign 
exchange risk management. The policy is 
designed to eliminate, as far as possible, 
the exposure of assets denominated in 
foreign currencies to movements in the 
exchange rates between sterling and the 
respective currencies. Foreign currency 
borrowings and swaps will be used to 
effect the hedges. 
Day-to-day management of 
treasury activities is delegated to 
executive Directors and the Group 
Treasurer. Regular reports on 3i’s funding 
position have been considered during the 
year by the Board. Other than as noted 
above, there has been no change during 
the year or since the year end to the 
major funding risks faced by 3i, or to 3i’s 
approach to such risks. 
Investment risk 
This includes investing in companies that 
may not perform as expected, being over 
exposed to one sector of the economy 
and the portfolio valuation being partly 
based on stock market valuations. 
Investment levels are set, 
allocated and monitored by business line 
and geography. Within this framework, 
3i invests in most sectors of the 
economy. Management periodically 
reviews the portfolio, which is well 
diversified by industry sector, to ensure 
that there is no undue exposure to any 
one sector. 
3i’s investment criteria focus on 
management ability and market potential. 
Investment appraisal and due diligence 
is undertaken in a rigorous manner by 
drawing on our international network and 
experts in individual industry sectors. 
In general, proposed investments over 
£5 million are presented to 3i’s 
Investment Committee or Technology 
Investment Committee, which are 
committees of senior management 
including executive Directors. 
The valuation of a large 
proportion of 3i’s equity portfolio is based 
on stock market valuations for the 
relevant industry sector. Quoted 
investments are valued using the closing 
mid-market price at the balance sheet 
date. 39% of the unquoted portfolio is 
valued using stock market earnings 
multiples for the relevant industry sector 
discounted for non-marketability. 
Accordingly, stock market valuations 
for individual sectors are an important 
factor in determining the valuation of 
3i’s portfolio and the total return. 
There are regular reviews of 
holdings in quoted companies and 
exposure to individual sectors in order to 
monitor the level of risk and mitigate 
exposure where appropriate. In particular, 
the level of future funding of technology 
companies is kept under review. 
However, it is not possible to protect 
against the risks of a downturn in stock 
markets generally or in any specific sector. 
Accordingly, the valuation of 3i’s portfolio 
and opportunities for realisation depend 
on stock market conditions and the 
buoyancy of the wider mergers and 
acquisitions market. 
Operational risk 
This includes operational events such 
as human resources risks, legal and 
regulatory risks, IT systems problems, 
business disruption and shortcomings 
in internal controls. 
Line management at all levels is 
responsible for identifying, assessing, 
controlling and reporting operational 
risks. This is supported by a framework 
of core values, standards and controls, 
a code of business conduct and 
delegated authorities. 
The ability to recruit, develop 
and retain capable people is of 
fundamental importance to achieving 
3i’s strategic objectives. We operate 
in a competitive industry and aim to 
remunerate our staff in line with market 
practice and to provide superior 
development opportunities. 
A group-wide business continuity 
strategy is in place. This strategy has been 
assessed against a detailed business 
impact analysis and independently 
benchmarked against best practice.

27 Corporate responsibility report (continued) 
As an investor 
Investment policy 
3i has a portfolio of some 1,500 
investments in businesses in Europe, 
Asia and the US. As an investor, 
corporate governance is a priority and 
account is taken of environmental, ethical 
and social issues when making 
investment decisions. 3i believes it is 
important to invest in companies whose 
owners and managers act responsibly on 
environmental, ethical and social matters. 
3i aims to invest in companies which: 
– respect human rights; 
– comply with current environmental, 
ethical and social legislation; 
– have proposals to address defined 
future legislation; 
– seek to comply with their industry
standards and best practice. 
3i recognises that the most significant 
risks to 3i’s short-term and long-term 
value arising from environmental, ethical 
and social matters arise from its 
investment business. If a company in 
which 3i has an investment acts 
irresponsibly on corporate responsibility

responsibility policies 
and information. 
issues, this might affect the monetary 
value of that investment and, as a 
shareholder in that company, raise 
reputational issues for 3i. 
Although 3i does not have 
operational control over the companies 
in which it invests, it does have the 
opportunity to influence the behaviour of 
these businesses and encourages the 
development and adoption of good 
corporate governance. This is achieved 
through the training of investment staff 
and non-executive Directors who are 
appointed to the boards of investee 
companies and the raising of awareness 
within investee companies of social, 
environmental and ethical issues. 
3i is also active in promoting good 
governance in the private equity industry 
through the provision of tutors for 
courses run by the BVCA and the EVCA. 
3i has procedures to reduce the 
risks of 3i investing in businesses which 
operate in an environmentally, ethically or 
socially unacceptable manner. When 
reviewing businesses for potential 
investment, investment executives 
are required to consider whether any 
corporate responsibility risks arise and, 
if any risks are identified, to follow 3i’s 
corporate responsibility investment 
procedures. Depending on the nature 
of the risk identified and its seriousness, 
a condition precedent or post completion 
undertaking requiring that the situation 
be remedied may be required from the 
investee company or its management. 
Alternatively, it may be decided not to 
proceed with the investment. 
Over the year 1,500 potential 
investments were considered and 
67 new investments were completed. 
1,280 potential investments did not 
proceed for financial or commercial 
reasons (including, in some cases, 
for social, ethical or environmental 
considerations).

been made, 3i becomes aware that an 
investee company is not operating in an 
acceptable way, 3i will seek to use its 
influence to encourage improvement. 
Where that is not possible, 3i will seek 
to divest itself of the investment. 
Relationship management 
3i’s key relationships are with the 
companies in which it invests together 
with the intermediaries, advisors and 
consultants used to facilitate investment 
and portfolio management. 3i actively 
engages with these groups to 
benchmark its performance and improve 
its investment procedures and skills. 
During the year extensive market 
research and surveys of these groups 
were conducted in the UK, France and 
Germany. Formal investor relations 
surveys of institutional investors and 
investors in funds under 3i’s management 
were also undertaken on 3i’s behalf. 
As a corporate 
As an employer 
3i’ s staff are fundamental to the success 
of its business. Accordingly, one of 3i’s 
core values is to respect its staff and 
their needs. 
Employees are organised in 
small teams and an environment of 
co-operation is encouraged to ensure 
the highest standards of integrity 
and professionalism. 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
28 In accordance with 3i’ s core values, 
individual consultation with employees 
on matters affecting them, and fair and 
open communication, are a high priority. 
During the year, 3i held an all-staff 
conference. The objectives of that 
conference were: to ensure that all staff 
understood 3i’s vision, strategy and the 
challenges ahead; and to unify staff 
across business lines, geographies and 
job roles. In preparation for that 
conference, interviews were conducted 
by an independent consultant with over 
100 employees to ascertain employees’ 
satisfaction with, and concerns about, 3i. 
Following the conference, a further 
survey of all employees was conducted. 
The issues raised have been considered 
by executive management and, as and 
where appropriate, action taken. 
3i has comprehensive behaviour 
policies to help ensure that employees 
treat their colleagues and others with 
courtesy and respect. 
3i also has a whistle blowing 
policy setting out procedures for staff to 
raise in confidence matters of concern, 
for an appropriate and independent 
investigation of such matters and, 
where necessary, for follow-up action. 
Training and development 
Encouraging the continuous 
development of staff is important to 
3i and its business. 3i’s training and 
development programme includes 
courses on communications and 
presentations, working within a 
management matrix environment, 
coaching and mentoring, and Board 
management skills. In addition, 
investment staff are required to complete 
an investment training programme on 
joining 3i and all staff are encouraged 
to attend external courses on subjects 
relevant to their roles within 3i. 
During the year, in addition to these 
external courses, approximately 270 
employees attended training and 
development courses. 
It is a legal and regulatory 
requirement that all executives involved 
in making or managing investment 
transactions receive anti-money 
laundering training and refresher training 
on a rolling two year basis. All relevant 
executives have received anti-money 
laundering training accordingly. 
A programme of role-play-based 
workshops across the business and 
regular articles in 3i’s staff magazine 
are used to raise awareness of corporate 
responsibility issues, to stimulate debate 
and provide employee training. During 
the year, seventeen workshops, covering 
approximately 240 employees, were held 
in the UK, continental Europe, Asia and 
the US. Following feedback from these 
workshops, a fact sheet, explaining 3i’s 
approach to corporate responsibility 
and providing further information for 
staff was circulated. 
Training for Directors on corporate 
responsibility issues is achieved through 
a system of regular Board reporting and 
by Board presentations on relevant 
corporate responsibility issues. 
Health and safety 
3i recognises that the promotion of 
health and safety at work is an essential 
function of staff and management at all 
levels. In an endeavour to achieve high 
standards, appropriate policies and 
procedures have been put in place. 
These policies and procedures are the 
responsibility of Simon Ball, the 
Finance Director. 
The purpose of 3i’s health and 
safety policy is to enable all members 
of 3i’s staff to go about their everyday 
business at 3i’s offices in the expectation 
that they can do so safely and without 
risk to their health. 3i imposes rigorous 
standards on its staff and subcontractors 
and endeavours to ensure that the 
health, safety and welfare of its 
employees, visitors, customers, 
subcontractors’ staff and the general 
public are not compromised. 
3i’s objective is not to have any 
reportable accidents or incidents. 
During the year to 31 March 2005, 
no reportable accidents or incidents 
occurred under UK Health and Safety 
regulations and no reportable accidents 
or incidents occurred under similar 
regulations outside the UK. 
As a member of T ommy’ s

29 Corporate responsibility report (continued) 
Procurement 
3i has developed policies and procedures 
relating to the purchasing of goods and 
services for use by the business. These 
policies and procedures must be 
followed by all staff. As far as possible, 3i 
will work only with suppliers who support 
3i’s aim to source products responsibly. 
Suppliers that exploit child or “sweated 
labour”, that disregard social legislation 
and basic health and safety provision, 
that “pirate” the intellectual property of 
others or that wilfully and avoidably 
damage the environment will be avoided. 
3i aims to have a collaborative 
relationship with its suppliers and, 
wherever possible, when problems arise 
with a supplier’s performance or 
behaviour, will work with the supplier 
concerned to help them meet 3i’ s 
requirements. 
Environment 
As a financial services business 
employing approximately 740 employees 
world-wide, 3i’s direct environmental 
impact is relatively low. 3i measures its 
own energy and resource usage where 
practicable and sets targets to achieve 
improvement. The principal benchmarks 
against which 3i measures its 
performance are for: 
– CO
2
emissions; and 
– recycling of paper and other materials. 
In the year to 31 March 2005, 
3i generated CO
2
emissions of 
approximately 9,500 tonnes. Over the 
two years to 31 March 2007, 3i aims 
to reduce these emissions 
by 6%. Progress against this target will 
be reported in the accounts for the year 
to 31 March 2006. 
In the year to 31 March 2005, 
3i generated an average of 5.8 kgs of 
waste per person per week in the UK, of 
which approximately 50% was recycled. 
3i also assesses the 
environmental standards of suppliers, 
through its procurement policy and its 
purchasing choices will favour products 
showing clear environmental advantages, 
unless there are significant reasons for 
not so doing. 
Charity and community 
3i’s charitable policy aims to support: 
– causes based in the communities in
which 3i has offices; 
– charitable activities of staff. 3i matches 
donations made by UK staff under the 
Give as You Earn scheme (“GAYE”) 
and the proceeds of staff fundraising 
efforts. In the year to 31 March 2005, 
approximately 23% of 3i’s charitable 
donations were matching GAYE 
donations;
– charities relevant to its corporate 
activity, for example, 3i supports 
businessdynamics, a charity 
which aims to help young people 
understand business. 
Charitable donations made in the UK in 
the year to 31 March 2005 amounted 
to £343,986, supporting a variety of 
different charities with donations up 
to £58,000. 
How are we doing? 
Performance and measurement 
The Committee has overseen the 
formulation and implementation of 
corporate responsibility investment 
procedures, implemented appropriate 
risk management procedures and set 
strategic targets and objectives for 
corporate responsibility. 
3i’s performance is measured against 
two indices: 
– the Dow Jones Sustainability World 
Index (“DJSI”), a global index which 
tracks the financial performance of 
leading companies in terms of 
corporate sustainability; and 
– the Business in the Community (“BitC”)
Corporate Responsibility Index, which 
aims to benchmark environmental, 
ethical and social performance and 
encourage sustainable development. 
3i has again been selected as a 
constituent of the DJSI during the year 
and was placed in the top of its industry 
group on a global basis. The DJSI 
researchers commented that “3i’s 
sustainability performance is clearly 
positioned among the best in the 
industry. This is illustrated through 3i’s 
strong capabilities in embracing 
corporate sustainability from strategic 
planning and implementation 
to monitoring and reporting. In the 
economic dimension, 3i sets industry 
best practice with its outperformance 
in risk and crisis management and 
scorecards/measurement systems.”

within this Index and to maintain its 
performance in the next DJSI 
assessment.
In 2004, 3i again participated in 
the annual BitC Corporate Responsibility 
Index. 3i was included in the BitC’s 
“Top 100 Companies that Count” and 
was recognised for its outstanding 
performance in the area of corporate 
strategy (that is, how a company’s 
activities influence its values and 
principles, how these are addressed 
through risk management, the 
development of policies and 
responsibilities held at a senior level in 
the company). 3i aims to continue to 
be included within this Index and to 
maintain its performance. 
Each of 3i’s business unit and 
department heads is required to confirm 
on an annual basis that their operating 
procedures, including investment 
procedures, are consistent with 3i’s 
standards and controls and that these 
procedures are operating in practice.

performance of individual members of 
staff against agreed objectives and the

health and safety audits to ensure high 
standards are adopted on a consistent

Audit and verification 
The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the operation of 3i’s corporate 
responsibility policies and procedures. 
The identification and management of 
corporate responsibility risks is integral to 
the ongoing operational processes of 3i’s 
business units and functions. 3i’s internal 
audit function carries out periodic 
independent reviews of risks and related 
controls in this area, including compliance 
with 3i’s corporate responsibility 
investment procedures. 
The Committee may also

33 Directors’ report

is investment. It invests in a wide range of growing independent businesses. Its objective is to maximise shareholder value through growth in total return. 
Tax and investment company status The Company is an investment company as defined by section 266 of the Companies Act 1985 and carries on business 
as an investment trust. 
The Inland Revenue has approved the Company as an investment trust under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for the financial period 
ended 31 March 2004. Since that date, the Company has directed its affairs to enable it to continue to be so approved.

Act 2000 (“FSMA 2000”) and regulated by the FSA.

Where applicable, certain Group subsidiaries’ businesses outside the United Kingdom are regulated by relevant authorities.

3i Report and accounts 2005 
34 Corporate governance Throughout the year to 31 March 2005, the Company complied with the provisions of section 1 of the Combined Code on corporate 
governance published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003. 
The Company’s approach to corporate governance The Company has a policy of seeking to comply with established best practice in the field of corporate 
governance. The Board has adopted core values and Group standards which set out the behaviours expected of staff in their dealings with shareholders, 
customers, colleagues, suppliers and other stakeholders of the Company. One of the core values communicated within the Group is a belief that the highest 
standard of integrity is essential in business. 
The Board’s responsibilities and processes The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall management of the Group. It determines matters including 
financial strategy and planning and takes major business decisions. 
The Board has approved a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and its duly authorised Committees for decision. These include:
– approval of the Group’s overall strategy, annual operating budget and strategic plan; 
– approval of the Company’s interim and final accounts and changes in the Group’s accounting policies or practices; 
– changes relating to the capital structure of the Company or its status as a regulated entity; 
– major capital projects; 
– major changes in the nature of business operations; 
– investments and divestments in the ordinary course of business above certain limits set by the Board from time to time; 
– adequacy of internal control systems; 
– appointments to the Board and Executive Committee; 
– principal terms and conditions of employment of members of Executive Committee; 
– changes in employee share schemes and carried interest schemes. 
Matters delegated to management include implementation of the Board approved strategy, day-to-day operation of the business, the appointment of all 
executives below Executive Committee and the formulation and execution of risk management practices and policies. 
The Board has put in place an organisational structure. This is further described below under the heading “internal control”. 
A Group succession and contingency plan is prepared by management and reviewed periodically by the Board. The purpose of this plan is to identify suitable 
candidates for succession to key senior management positions, agree their training and development needs, and ensure the necessary human resources are in 
place for the Company to meet its objectives. 
During the year, there were six scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors and one additional ad hoc meeting of the Board. The Directors who served 
throughout the year attended all seven meetings save for Mr F G Steingraber who attended the six scheduled meetings. Since their appointment to the Board 
on 29 September 2004, Sir Robert Smith has attended the four subsequent Board meetings and Dr P Mihatsch has attended three of these meetings. 
Mr S P Ball was unable to attend the one Board meeting held since his appointment on 7 February 2005. Dr J R Forrest attended one of the two meetings held 
prior to his ceasing to be a Director on 7 July 2004. Mr B P Larcombe attended the two meetings held prior to his ceasing to be a Director on 7 July 2004. 
Mr M M Gagen attended the three meetings held prior to his ceasing to be a Director on 23 August 2004. 
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive The division of responsibilities between the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive is clearly 
defined and has been approved by the Board. 
The Chairman The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of its strategy and in the achievement of its objectives. The Chairman is responsible for 
organising the business of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda. The Chairman has no involvement in the day-to-day business of the 
Group. The Chairman facilitates the effective contribution of non-executive Directors and constructive relations between executive and non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman ensures that regular reports from the Company’s brokers are circulated to the non-executive Directors to enable non-executive Directors to remain 
aware of shareholders’ views. 
The Chief Executive Mr P E Yea was appointed Chief Executive with effect from 7 July 2004 in succession to Mr B P Larcombe. 
The Chief Executive has direct charge of the Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable to the Board for the financial and operational performance of the 
Group. The Chief Executive has formed a management committee called Executive Committee to enable him to carry out the responsibilities delegated to him 
by the Board. The Committee comprises the executive Directors, the Company Secretary, Ms D R Collis, Mr C P Rowlands, Mr J B C Russell and Mr P Waller. 
The Committee meets on a regular basis to consider operational matters and the implementation of the Group’s strategy. 
Senior Independent Director The Board has appointed Mr O H J Stocken as Senior Independent Director, to whom, in accordance with the Combined Code, 
concerns can be conveyed. 
Directors The Board currently comprises the Chairman, six other independent non-executive Directors and four executive Directors. Biographical details for 
each of the Directors are set out on pages 32 and 33. Baroness Hogg (Chairman), Mme C J M Morin-Postel, Mr R W Perry, Mr M J Queen, Mr F D Rosenkranz, 
Mr F G Steingraber and Mr O H J Stocken served throughout the period under review. Mr P E Yea served from his appointment on 7 July 2004, Dr P Mihatsch 
and Sir Robert Smith served from their appointments on 7 September 2004, and Mr S P Ball served from his appointment on 7 February 2005. Mr B P Larcombe 
and Dr J R Forrest served as Directors until 7 July 2004, and Mr M M Gagen served as a Director until 23 August 2004. 
In addition to fulfilling their legal responsibilities as Directors, non-executive Directors are expected to bring an independent judgment to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct and to help the Board provide the Company with effective leadership. Non-executive Directors are expected to 
ensure high standards of financial probity on the part of the Company and to monitor the effectiveness of the executive Directors.
The Board’s discussions, and its approval of the Group’s rolling strategic plan and annual budget, provide the non-executive Directors with the opportunity to 
challenge the Company’s management and assist in the development of strategy. The non-executive Directors receive monthly management accounts and 
regular management reports and information which enable them to scrutinise the Company’s and management’s performance against agreed objectives. 
This is further described below under the heading “internal control”. 
35 Directors’ report (continued) 
Directors’ independence All the non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, are considered by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the 
Combined Code. The Board assesses and reviews the independence of each of the non-executive Directors at least annually having regard to the potential 
relevance and materiality of a Director’s interests and relationships rather than applying rigid criteria in a mechanistic manner. The Board has considered  
Mr O H J Stocken and Mme C J M Morin-Postel’s common non-executive directorship of Pilkington plc and concluded that it did not affect their independence.  
The Board’s committees The Board is assisted by various specialised committees of the Board which report regularly to the Board. The membership of these 
committees is regularly reviewed by the Board. When considering committee membership and chairmanship, the Board aims to ensure that undue reliance is not 
placed on particular Directors. 
These committees all have clearly defined and written terms of reference. The terms of reference of the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nominations Committee provide that no one other than the particular committee chairman and members may attend a meeting unless invited 
to attend by the Committee. The terms of reference of these committees are available at www.3igroup.com. 
Audit and Compliance Committee The Audit and Compliance Committee comprises Mr O H J Stocken (Chairman), Mme C J M Morin-Postel,  
Mr F D Rosenkranz and Sir Robert Smith. Sir Robert Smith joined the Committee on 29 September 2004. During the year, Dr J R Forrest served as a member of 
the Committee until 7 July 2004. The other members of the Committee served throughout the period. 
All the members of the Committee are independent non-executive Directors. The Board is satisfied that the Committee Chairman, Mr O H J Stocken, has recent 
and relevant financial experience. 
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the internal control environment of the Group and the Group’s compliance with its regulatory requirements.  
The Committee receives regular reports from the internal and external auditors, the regulatory compliance function and Risk Committee, and monitors their 
activities and effectiveness. The Committee reviews the interim and annual accounts of the Company before their approval by the Board and reviews the scope  
of the annual audit and any audit findings. The Committee also oversees the Company’s relations with its external auditors and recommends to the Board the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of the Company’s auditors and approves the terms of their engagement and their fees. The Committee meets with the 
heads of the internal audit and compliance functions individually, and the external auditors, at least once a year in the absence of management. 
The Committee also reviews the Company’s “whistle blowing policy” to ensure that arrangements are in place for staff to raise, in confidence, matters of concern, 
for an appropriate and independent investigation of such matters and, where necessary, for follow-up action. 
During the year, there were four meetings of the Audit and Compliance Committee. The members who served throughout the year attended all four meetings save 
for Mr F D Rosenkranz who attended three meetings. Since joining the Committee on 29 September 2004, Sir Robert Smith has attended two of the three 
meetings held. Dr J R Forrest was unable to attend the one meeting held before he ceased to be a Committee member on 7 July 2004. 
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr F D Rosenkranz (Chairman), Mme C J M Morin-Postel, Sir Robert Smith,  
Mr F G Steingraber and Mr O H J Stocken. Mr F G Steingraber joined the Committee on 29 September 2004 and Sir Robert Smith joined the Committee on  
1 April 2005. During the year, Dr J R Forrest served as a member of the Committee until 7 July 2004. Dr P Mihatsch served as a Committee member from  
29 September 2004 until 31 March 2005. The other members of the Committee served throughout the period. 
All the members of the Committee are independent non-executive Directors. 
Details of the work of the Remuneration Committee are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
During the year, there were six meetings of the Remuneration Committee. The members who served throughout the year attended all six meetings, save that 
Mme C J M Morin-Postel attended five meetings. Since joining the Committee on 29 September 2004, Mr F G Steingraber has attended all four subsequent 
meetings held. Dr P Mihatsch, who served on the Committee from 29 September 2004 until 31 March 2005, attended three of the four meetings held during that 
period. Dr J R Forrest attended one of the two meetings held before he ceased to be a Committee member on 7 July 2004. 
Nominations Committee The Nominations Committee comprises Baroness Hogg (Chairman), Dr P Mihatsch, Mme C J M Morin-Postel, Mr F D Rosenkranz, 
Sir Robert Smith, Mr F G Steingraber, Mr O H J Stocken and Mr P E Yea. Mr P E Yea joined the Committee on 7 July 2004, and Dr P Mihatsch and Sir Robert 
Smith both joined the Committee on 29 September 2004. During the year, Dr J R Forrest and Mr B P Larcombe served as members of the Committee until  
7 July 2004. Mr R W Perry was co-opted to assist the Committee in the appointment of a new Chief Executive. The other members of the Committee served 
throughout the period. 
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee provide that the Chairman of the Board shall not chair the Committee when dealing with the appointment  
of the Chairman’s successor.  
The Nominations Committee and the Board regularly review the composition of the Board to ensure the balance of its membership, as between executive and 
non-executive Directors, and its profile, in terms of size and length of service and experience of individual Directors, remains appropriate. A formal, rigorous and 
transparent process for the appointment of Directors has been established with the objective of identifying the skills and experience profile required of new 
Directors and identifying suitable candidates. The procedure includes the appraisal and selection of potential candidates, including (in the case of non-executive 
Directors) whether they have sufficient time to fulfil their roles. Specialist recruitment consultants assist the Committee to identify suitable candidates for 
appointment. The Committee’s recommendations for appointment are put to the full Board for approval. 
The Company’s major shareholders are offered the opportunity to meet newly appointed non-executive Directors. 
During the year, there were four meetings of the Nominations Committee. The members who served throughout the year attended all four meetings. Since joining 
the Committee on 7 July 2004, Mr P E Yea has attended the three meetings held. Since joining the Committee on 29 September 2004, Dr P Mihatsch and  
Sir Robert Smith have each attended one of the two meetings held. Mr B P Larcombe, who attended the one meeting held prior to his ceasing to be a 
Committee member on 7 July 2004, did not attend when succession to the post of Chief Executive was discussed. Dr J R Forrest was unable to attend the one 
meeting held before he ceased to be a Committee member on 7 July 2004. Mr R W Perry attended two meetings. 
Valuations Committee The Valuations Committee comprises Baroness Hogg (Chairman), Mr S P Ball, Dr P Mihatsch, Mr O H J Stocken and Mr P E Yea.  
Mr P E Yea joined the Committee on 7 July 2004 and Mr S P Ball and Dr P Mihatsch both joined the Committee on 1 April 2005. Dr J R Forrest and  
Mr B P Larcombe served as Committee members until 7 July 2004. Mr M J Queen served as a Committee member until 11 May 2005. Sir Robert Smith  
served as a Committee member from 29 September 2004 until 31 March 2005. Baroness Hogg and Mr O H J Stocken both served throughout the period.  
3i Report and accounts 2005 
36 The Valuations Committee considers and recommends to the Board the valuations of the Group’s investments to be included in the interim and final accounts of 
the Group and changes to valuations policy. 
During the year, there were two meetings of the Valuations Committee. The members who served throughout the year attended both meetings. After joining the 
Committee on 7 July 2004, Mr P E Yea attended the one meeting held. Sir Robert Smith, who served on the Committee from 29 September 2004 until 31 March 
2005, was unable to attend the one meeting held during that period. Dr J R Forrest and Mr B P Larcombe both attended the one meeting held before they 
ceased to be Committee members on 7 July 2004. 
The Company Secretary The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on governance matters. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. The Company’s Articles of Association and the schedule of matters reserved to the Board for 
decision provide that the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the full Board. 
Information Regular reports and papers are circulated to the Directors in a timely manner in preparation for Board and Committee meetings. These papers are 
supplemented by information specifically requested by the Directors from time to time. 
Directors’ training and development The Company has developed a training policy which provides a framework within which training for Directors is planned 
with the objective of ensuring Directors understand the duties and responsibilities of being a Director of a listed company. All Directors are required to update their 
skills and maintain their familiarity with the Company and its business continually. Presentations on different aspects of the Company’s business are made regularly 
to the Board. On appointment, all non-executive Directors have discussions with the Chairman and the Chief Executive following which appropriate briefings on 
the responsibilities of Directors, the Company’s business and the Company’s procedures are arranged. The Company provides opportunities for non-executive 
Directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the Company’s business by meeting members of the senior management team who in turn arrange, as required, 
visits to investment offices and support departments. 
The Company has procedures for Directors to take independent legal or other professional advice about the performance of their duties.
Performance evaluation The Board has established a formal process, led by the Chairman, for the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
principal Committees and individual Directors with particular attention to those who are due for reappointment. A list of questions is drawn up by the Chairman 
with the assistance of an independent consultant. These questions provide a framework for the evaluation process. The Chairman conducts the annual 
performance evaluation of each of the Directors, taking into account the views of the other Directors. The Senior Independent Director conducts the annual 
performance evaluation of the Chairman, taking into account the views of all Directors. The results of the overall evaluation process are discussed with the 
independent consultant, considered by the Nominations Committee, communicated to the Board and followed up with action as appropriate.
Re-election Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, the Companies Acts and satisfactory performance evaluation, non-executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial period of three years. Before the third and sixth anniversaries of a non-executive Director’s first appointment, the Director discusses with the 
Board whether it is appropriate for a further three year term to be served. The reappointment of Directors who have served for more than nine years is subject to 
annual review. 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide for: 
a) Directors to retire at the first Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) after their appointment by the Board and for the number nearest to, but not exceeding, one-third 
of the remaining Directors to retire by rotation at each AGM; 
b) all Directors to retire at least every three years; and 
c) any Director aged 70 or over at the date of the AGM to retire. 
Subject to the Articles of Association, retiring Directors are eligible for reappointment. 
In accordance with the Articles of Association, at the AGM to be held on 6 July 2005: 
i) Mr S P Ball, Dr P Mihatsch and Sir Robert Smith, having been appointed as Directors since the AGM in 2004, will retire and, being eligible, offer themselves for 
reappointment; and 
ii) Mr R W Perry, Mr F G Steingraber and Mr O H J Stocken will retire by rotation and, being eligible, Mr F G Steingraber and Mr O H J Stocken offer themselves 
for reappointment. On 20 December 2004, the Company announced that Mr R W Perry would be retiring at the AGM on 6 July 2005. 
The Board’s recommendation for reappointment of Directors is set out in the Notice of the AGM. 
Relations with shareholders The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a purposeful relationship with all its shareholders. The Chief Executive and the
Finance Director, together with the Group Communications Director, meet with the Company’s principal institutional shareholders to discuss relevant issues as 
they arise. The Chairman maintains a dialogue with shareholders on strategy, corporate governance and Directors’ remuneration as required. During the year, at 
the invitation of the Chairman, the Company’s major shareholders met with the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Company Secretary and Finance Director to discuss 
matters of corporate governance and corporate responsibility relevant to the Company and its shareholders. 
In addition to receiving regular reports from the Company’s brokers, the brokers make presentations to the Board and have private discussions with the 
non-executive Directors. Non-executive Directors are invited to attend the Company’s presentation to analysts and offered the opportunity to meet shareholders. 
During the year, a formal survey of the perceptions of the Company’s major shareholders was carried out by independent consultants on behalf of the Company. 
The results of this survey were considered by the Board. Through involvement in the interim and full year reporting process, the Company’s results presentations 
and the Company’s Annual General Meeting, the Chairman ensures effective communication with the Company’s shareholders. 
Constructive use of the AGM The Company uses its AGM as an opportunity to communicate with its shareholders. At the Meeting, business presentations are 
made by the Chief Executive and the Finance Director. The Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit and Compliance, and Nominations Committees are available to 
answer shareholders’ questions. 
The Notice of the AGM held on 7 July 2004 was dispatched to shareholders not less than 20 working days before the Meeting. At that Meeting, details of proxy 
votes received (including the number of abstentions) were disclosed in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code. These details were 
subsequently made available on the Company’s website. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, on a poll, every member who is present in 
person or by proxy has one vote for each share held. 
37 Directors’ report (continued) 
Portfolio management and voting policy In relation to unquoted investments, the Group’s approach is to seek to add value to the businesses in which the 
Group invests through the Group’s extensive experience, resources and contacts. In relation to quoted investments, the Group’s policy is to exercise voting rights 
on matters affecting the interests of the Group. 
Employment The Group’s policy is one of equal opportunity in the selection, training, career development and promotion of employees, regardless of gender, 
ethnic origin, religion and whether disabled or otherwise. 
The Group treats applicants and employees with disabilities equally and fairly and provides facilities, equipment and training to assist disabled employees to 
do their jobs. Should an employee become disabled during their employment, efforts are made to retain them in their current employment or to explore the 
opportunities for their retraining or redeployment within the Group. The Group also provides financial support, through a Company Disability Scheme, to disabled 
employees who are unable to work. 
The Group’s principal means of keeping in touch with the views of its employees are through employee appraisals, informal consultations, team briefings, and staff 
conferences and surveys. Managers throughout the Group have a continuing responsibility to keep their staff fully informed of developments and to communicate 
financial results and other matters of interest. This is achieved by structured communication including regular meetings of employees.
The Group has clear grievance and disciplinary procedures in place, which include comprehensive procedures on discrimination and the Group’s equal 
opportunities policy. The Group also has an employee assistance programme which provides a confidential, free and independent counselling service and is 
available to all staff and their families in the UK. 
There are clearly defined staff policies for pay and working conditions. The Group’s employment policies are designed to provide a competitive reward package 
which will attract and retain high quality staff, whilst ensuring that the cost element of these rewards remains at an appropriate level. 
The Group’s remuneration policy is influenced by market conditions and practices in the countries in which it operates. All employees receive a base salary and 
are eligible for a performance related bonus and to participate in Group share schemes (except in the US) to encourage employees’ involvement in the 
performance of the Group. Investment executives may also participate in investment performance plans and carried interest schemes, which allow executives to 
share directly in the future profits on investments. Further details of these plans are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. Employees participate in local 
state or company pension schemes as appropriate to local market conditions. As at the most recent valuation date, 99% of UK employees were members of the 
3i Group Pension Plan (details of which are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report). 
Charitable and political donations Charitable donations made by the Group in the year to 31 March 2005 amounted to £343,986. Excluding the Company’s 
matching of Give As You Earn contributions by staff, charitable donations amounted to £266,274, of which approximately 41% were to causes which aim to 
relieve poverty or benefit the community, or both, approximately 14% were to charities which advance education, and approximately 7% were to medical charities. 
Further details of charitable donations are set out in the Corporate responsibility report on pages 27 to 31. 
In line with Group policy, no donations were made to political parties during the year. Under the Companies Act 1985, as amended, the Company is required to 
disclose particulars of any donation to any EU political organisation and EU political expenditure incurred during the year. During the period, 3i plc, the main 
trading company of the Group, made payments to three organisations, detailed below, which may fall within the definition of donations to EU political organisations. 
These payments (annual subscriptions to the Industry Forum of £3,084, the Enterprise Forum of £1,880 and the Federal Trust of £300) amounted to £5,264. 
Policy for paying creditors The Group’s policy is to pay creditors in accordance with the CBI Prompt Payers Code of Good Practice, copies of which can be 
obtained from the Confederation of British Industry at Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU. The Company had no trade creditors during the 
year. 3i plc had trade creditors outstanding at the year end representing on average 14 day’s purchases. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities The Directors are required by UK company law to prepare accounts which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group as at the end of the period and of the profit for the period. The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that proper accounting 
records are kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the 
Companies Act 1985. They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. Suitable accounting policies, which follow generally accepted accounting practice and are explained in the notes 
to the accounts, have been applied consistently and applicable accounting standards have been followed. In addition, reasonable and prudent judgments and 
estimates have been used in the preparation of the accounts. 
Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the “going concern” basis for preparing the accounts. 
Internal control The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and reviews its effectiveness at least annually. Such a system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
Through the regular meetings of the Board and the schedule of matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised Committees for decision, the Board aims to 
maintain full and effective control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. The Board has put in place an organisational structure 
with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. Each year, the Board considers and approves a rolling strategic plan and an annual budget. 
In addition, there are established procedures and processes for planning and controlling expenditure and the making of investments. There are also information 
and reporting systems for monitoring the Group’s businesses and their performance. 
Risk Committee is a management committee formed by the Chief Executive whose purpose is to review the business of the Group in order to ensure that 
business risk is considered, assessed and managed as an integral part of the business. There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
Group’s significant risks. This process was in place for the year ended 31 March 2005 and up to the date of this report. The process is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and complies with the internal control guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, issued by the Turnbull Committee. The process established for the 
Group includes: 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
38 Policies
– core values, Group standards and Group controls together comprising the Group’s high level principles and controls, with which all staff are expected 
to comply; 
– manuals of policies and procedures, applicable to all business units, with procedures for reporting weaknesses and for monitoring corrective action; 
– a code of business conduct, with procedures for reporting compliance therewith; 
Processes
– appointment of experienced and professional staff, both by recruitment and promotion, of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities; 
– a planning framework which incorporates a Board approved rolling strategic plan, with objectives for each business unit; 
– formal business risk reviews performed by management which evaluate the potential financial impact and likelihood of identified risks and possible new risk 
areas, set control, mitigation and monitoring procedures and review actual occurrences identifying lessons to be learnt; 
– a comprehensive system of financial reporting to the Board, based on an annual budget with monthly reports against actual results, analysis of variances, 
scrutiny of key performance indicators and regular re-forecasting; 
– regular treasury reports to the Board, which analyse the funding requirements of each class of assets, track the generation and use of capital and the volume of 
liquidity, measure the Group’s exposure to interest and exchange rate movements and record the level of compliance with the Group’s funding objectives; 
– a compliance department whose role is to integrate regulatory compliance procedures into the Group’s systems; 
–  well defined procedures governing the appraisal and approval of investments including detailed investment and divestment approval procedures incorporating 
appropriate levels of authority and regular post investment reviews; 
Verification
– an internal audit department which undertakes periodic examination of business units and processes and recommends improvements in controls to 
management;
– the external auditors who are engaged to express an opinion on the annual accounts; 
– an Audit and Compliance Committee which considers significant control matters and receives reports from the internal and external auditors and the regulatory 
compliance function on a regular basis. 
The internal control system is monitored and supported by an internal audit function which operates on an international basis and reports to management and the 
Audit and Compliance Committee on the Group’s operations. The work of the internal auditors is focused on the areas of greatest risk to the Group determined 
on the basis of the Group’s risk management process. The external auditors independently and objectively review the approach of management to reporting 
operating results and financial condition. In coordination with the internal auditors, they also review and test the system of internal financial control and the 
information contained in the Report and accounts to the extent necessary for expressing their opinion. 
Auditors’ independence and objectivity Subject to annual appointment by shareholders, auditor performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally 
reviewed every five years, the next review being scheduled for 2008. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviewed auditor performance during the year and 
concluded that Ernst & Young LLP’s appointment as the Company’s auditors should be continued. 
The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring the independence and objectivity of the Company’s auditors. It reviews the nature and extent of the 
services provided by them, the level of their fees and the element comprising non-audit fees. The Audit and Compliance Committee Chairman is notified of 
all assignments allocated to Ernst & Young over a set threshold, other than those related to due diligence within the Group’s investment process where the 
team engaged would be independent of the audit team. Safeguards have been put in place to reduce the likelihood of compromising auditor independence, 
including the following principles which are applied in respect of services provided by the auditors and other accounting firms and monitored by the Audit and 
Compliance Committee: 
– services required to be undertaken by the auditors, which include regulatory returns, formalities relating to borrowings, shareholder and other circulars. 
This work is normally allocated directly to the auditors; 
– services which it is most efficient for the auditors to provide. In this case, information relating to the service is largely derived from the Company’s audited 
financial records. This work is normally allocated to the auditors subject to consideration of any impact on their independence;
– services that could be provided by a number of firms including general consultancy work. All significant consultancy projects are normally put out to tender and 
work would be allocated to the auditors only if it did not present a potential threat to the independence of the audit team. Included in this category is due 
diligence work relating to the investment process. If this service were to be provided by the auditors, the specific team engaged would be independent of the 
audit team. 
Details of the fees paid to the auditors are disclosed in note 13 to the accounts on page 59. 
Ernst & Young LLP In accordance with section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the 
Company’s auditors will be put to members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

39 Directors’ remuneration report 
Remuneration Committee 
Composition and terms of reference The Company’s Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) comprises only independent non-executive Directors. 
Its members during the year to 31 March 2005 (the “year”) were Mr F D Rosenkranz (the Committee Chairman), Dr J R Forrest (who ceased to be a member 
on 7 July 2004), Mme C J M Morin-Postel, Mr O H J Stocken and, following their appointments to the Committee on 29 September 2004, Dr P Mihatsch and 
Mr F G Steingraber. Dr Mihatsch ceased to be a member on 31 March 2005 and Sir Robert Smith was appointed with effect from 1 April 2005. None of the 
members of the Committee sits with any executive Director on the board of any other quoted company. The Committee’s terms of reference take into account 
the provisions of the Combined Code on corporate governance and are available on the Company’s website. 
Activities during the year The Committee met six times during the year to consider remuneration policy and to determine, on behalf of the Board, the specific
remuneration packages for each of the executive Directors and the other members of the Chief Executive’s management committee (called “Executive 
Committee”). The Committee also determined the fees payable to the Chairman of the Board. In addition, the Committee considered and made recommendations 
to the Board on the Company’s framework of executive remuneration and its costs. Details of attendance at meetings by members of the Committee are set out 
in the Directors’ report. 
Assistance to the Committee Persons who materially assisted the Committee with advice on Directors’ remuneration in the year were: PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (“PwC”), an external remuneration consultant appointed by the Committee; the Chairman of the Board, Baroness Hogg; following his appointment on 7 July 
2004, the Chief Executive, Mr P E Yea; and until his retirement from the Board on 7 July 2004, the former Chief Executive, Mr B P Larcombe. Baroness Hogg, 
Mr B P Larcombe and Mr P E Yea did not advise the Committee in relation to their own remuneration. During the year, PwC provided the Group’s businesses with 
taxation, payroll and valuation advice, due diligence services, property services, and services of an employee on secondment. 
Market background The Company operates within the private equity and venture capital sector and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The majority of the 
Company’s competitors comprise either partnerships of individuals managing funds for investment on behalf of third parties or unquoted subsidiaries of larger 
banking or financial services groups. The private equity and venture capital market continues to be well funded and the ability of trained and experienced 
executives to gain substantial rewards in the industry remains. As a consequence, maintaining a remuneration structure to support the recruitment and retention 
of senior executives continues to be challenging. In addition to cash bonuses and share awards, it is market practice for investment executives in the private 
equity and venture capital market to be given the opportunity to participate in carried interest or co-investment schemes, which allow executives to share directly 
in the future profits on investments, subject normally to a variety of conditions relating to the performance of those investments. It is against this background that 
the Committee has continued to implement the policies formulated last year to enable the Company to continue to attract, retain and motivate management of 
the quality required and thereby ensure the continued vibrancy and success of the business as a whole. The Committee is also conscious of the need to align the 
interests of staff with the interests of shareholders and investors in funds managed by the Group on behalf of third parties. The way in which this is achieved is by 
allowing investment executives to participate in carried interest arrangements and by encouraging the holding of the Company’s shares by its staff. 
Performance graphs The left hand graph below compares the Company’s total shareholder return for the five financial years to 31 March 2005 with the total 
shareholder return of the FTSE All-Share Index. The Directors consider that since the Company invests in a broad range of industrial and commercial sectors, the 
FTSE All-Share Index is the most appropriate index against which to compare the Company’s performance, although as the Company is a constituent of the 
FTSE 100 Index, performance compared with that index is also relevant. 
The right hand chart below compares percentage changes in the Company’s diluted net asset value per share over each of the last five financial years (with 
dividends reinvested) against the total shareholder return of the FTSE All-Share Index over the same periods. This has been included because changes in net 
asset value per share relative to the FTSE All-Share Index are an important indicator of the long-term performance of the Company’s assets.

Directors’ remuneration policy 
No major changes in remuneration structure have been decided by the Committee over the year. However, in the light of market evidence and consultation with 
shareholders, the Committee has decided, in respect of the coming year, to reduce the proportion of share options vesting if net asset value per share with 
dividends reinvested rises by RPI plus three percentage points per annum over the three year performance period from 50% to 30%. The Committee has also 
decided to increase the target bonus for the coming year for the Director responsible for Growth Capital investment from 90% to 100% of base salary. 
Non-executive Directors The Company’s policy for the financial year ending 31 March 2006 (the “coming year”) in relation to non-executive Directors (including
the Chairman) continues to be to pay fees which are competitive with the fees paid by other FTSE 100 companies. Non-executive Directors are not eligible for 
bonuses, share options, long-term incentives, pensions or performance related remuneration. The Company does not currently expect its policy on non-executive 
Directors’ remuneration for subsequent financial years to change significantly. Non-executive Directors’ fees (other than those of the Chairman, which are 
determined by the Committee) are regularly reviewed and determined by the Board as a whole, within the limits set by the Company’s Articles of Association, 
having taken advice from PwC. During the year the basic non-executive Director’s fee was £36,000 per annum, the annual fee for Committee membership was 
£2,000 and the annual fee for Committee Chairmanship was £7,500. 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
40 Executive Directors The Company’s policy for the coming year in relation to executive Directors is to provide remuneration and other benefits sufficient to 
attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of the calibre required. The variable elements of each executive Director’s remuneration (comprising annual cash 
bonuses, deferred share bonuses and long-term incentives) are intended to form a significant component of the executive Director’s total remuneration package. 
In particular, the base salaries of the executive Directors are intended to represent less than half of the executive Directors’ potential rewards with the remainder of 
the rewards being related to individual and Company performance. 
The executive Directors’ performance related compensation is designed to encourage, where practicable, investment in, and the holding of, shares in the 
Company so as to align the interests of Directors and shareholders. The Company aims to provide pension benefits to the executive Directors which are 
competitive with other FTSE 100 companies and companies in the financial services sector. The Company will review its pension arrangements in the light of the 
Government’s proposed legislative changes and will report on the outcome of this review in the 2006 Directors’ remuneration report.
(a) Salaries The Committee is sensitive to wider issues including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when setting executive Directors’ pay 
levels and takes into account the Company’s reward strategy generally, before deciding specific packages for the executive Directors. The table below provides 
details of the percentage increases in average base salaries per annum for members of Executive Committee (including executive Directors) and other executive 
staff in the UK in the period from 31 March 2004 to 31 March 2005. 
% increase from 31 March 2004 
to 31 March 2005 
Executive Committee (including executive Directors) 2.61%
Other UK executive staff 5.63%
Chief Executive and Finance Director The Company’s policy in the coming year in relation to the remuneration packages of the Chief Executive and Finance 
Director is to pay salaries and benefits comparable to those paid by other FTSE 100 companies of similar market capitalisation including financial sector 
companies. Salary supplements are paid to Mr P E Yea and Mr S P Ball to enable them personally to make additional pension provision.
Directors responsible for investment business The Company’s policy in the coming year in relation to the remuneration packages of Directors with responsibility for 
investment business is to provide remuneration and other benefits comparable to those paid in the private equity and venture capital industry. In the coming year 
this policy will apply to Mr M J Queen who assumed responsibility for Growth Capital investment on 1 April 2005. 
To ensure the Company’s remuneration policies are competitive with arrangements in the private equity and venture capital industry, the Committee may offer 
executive Directors with responsibility for investment business the opportunity to participate in carried interest arrangements as approved by shareholders in 2004. 
(b) Annual bonuses All employees, including executive Directors, are eligible for non-pensionable discretionary annual bonuses. The Committee determines target 
bonuses for each executive Director at the beginning of each year based on appropriate market comparators. These target bonuses are achievable if both 
corporate performance targets and personal performance targets are met. In the case of Directors with responsibility for investment business, the target bonus 
also depends on the objectives of the business units for which the Director is responsible being met and, consistent with its policy, is intended to be competitive 
with arrangements in the private equity and venture capital industry. Bonuses above target level will be granted only for outstanding performance. The maximum 
bonus achievable will be twice the target bonus. Any bonuses above 1.5 times target will be in the form of shares deferred for two years and the Committee may 
decide that a higher proportion of bonus should be paid in deferred shares. 
The Committee retains discretion to make adjustments to bonus arrangements in appropriate circumstances. 
The main measures to be used for assessing corporate performance are: 
– total shareholder return and change in net asset value per share both in absolute terms and compared with the FTSE All-Share Index;
– total non market-driven return compared with budget; and 
– one to three year internal rate of return compared with performance of the private equity and venture capital industry as a whole.
The Committee will also take into account a number of more detailed indicators of performance and activity, such as the level of investment, realised profits and costs. 
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the target bonuses for the executive Directors were 90% of base salary. After reviewing the performance measures 
referred to above, the Committee awarded bonuses to executive Directors, in respect of the year, ranging from nil to 120% of their base salaries. Bonuses 
above 100% of base salary will be in the form of deferred shares, except in the case of Mr R W Perry who is to retire at the 2005 Annual General Meeting. 
The Committee has set target bonuses for the year to 31 March 2006 for the Chief Executive and Finance Director at 90% of base salary, the same as last year, 
and for the executive Director responsible for Growth Capital investment at 100% of base salary. 
(c) Long-term incentives The Committee determines the levels of long-term incentives and carried interest to be granted to executive Directors. In the coming
year long-term incentive arrangements for executive Directors are expected to consist of share options and performance share awards under The 3i Group 
Discretionary Share Plan (“the Discretionary Share Plan”). Executive Directors with responsibility for investment business will also be eligible to participate in carried 
interest arrangements as approved by shareholders in 2004. 
The Discretionary Share Plan The Company operates a shareholder approved executive share plan, which conforms with the Association of British Insurers’ 
guidelines on dilution limits. Awards under this plan are not pensionable. The level of annual awards is reviewed each year taking into account market practice, an 
assessment of individual performance and the specific circumstances facing the Company. The maximum annual level of award is six times salary if granted in 
share options or its equivalent fair value in performance shares. During the year, a performance share was calculated as having a fair value of 1.75 times the value 
of a share option. The relative fair values of these awards are kept under review by the Committee. Based on the advice of the Committee’s independent 
consultant and on the performance conditions proposed to be attached to performance shares and share options in respect of the coming year, a performance 
share has been calculated as having a fair value of 1.90 times the value of a share option. All awards are granted subject to a performance target, the 
achievement of which will normally be a condition precedent to the exercise of the awards. Careful consideration is given each year to appropriately demanding 
performance targets. 
Details of the performance targets for options granted under the Discretionary Share Plan before 1 April 2005 are set out in note 3 on page 43. The Committee 
proposes to set a performance condition for share option awards to be made with respect to the coming year that would result in 30% of options vesting if net 
asset value per share with dividends reinvested increases on average by more than RPI plus three percentage points per annum over a three year performance 
period and 100% vesting if such net asset value increases by RPI plus eight percentage points or more per annum. Between those two levels the options will vest 
on a pro rata basis. This performance condition will not be retested. 
Carried interest plans At the Company’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 7 July 2004, shareholders approved the participation of executive Directors with
responsibility for investment business in the carried interest plans established for the Group’s investment executives. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director 
are not eligible to participate in these plans. Decisions in relation to the participation of an executive Director are taken by the Committee taking into account 
market practice and the investment responsibilities of the executive Director concerned. Individual executive Directors participate in carried interest plans through 
the allocation to them of a specified percentage of Capital Working. Capital Working in a particular carried interest plan, is the target carried interest rate multiplied 
41 Directors’ remuneration report (continued) 
by the aggregate amount invested by the Company (including funds under its management) in a specific pool of investments made over a specific period 
(usually two years) by the team of investment executives responsible for those investments. The target carried interest rate to be delivered through individual 
carried interest plans may vary but in no case will exceed 15% of the relevant Capital Working. Participation in the profits made on a pool of investments through 
the allocation of carried interest is dependent on the performance of the underlying investments as a whole and the satisfaction of a performance condition which 
is determined in advance by the Committee, in line with relevant market conditions at the time of award. Awards under these plans are not pensionable. 
No awards were made to executive Directors during the year. 
The Company does not currently expect its policy on executive Directors’ remuneration for subsequent financial years to change significantly.

Notes
1 Options granted in 1994 were granted under The 3i Executive Share Option Plan (the “1984 Plan”) and were exercisable between the third and tenth 
anniversaries of the date of grant save that half of the options granted were not exercisable before the sixth anniversary. These options were exercisable only if 
the net asset value per share on the last day of the financial period ending immediately before the third anniversary of the date of grant or on the last day of any 
financial period thereafter, was equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share on the date of grant compounded by the respective annual percentage 
movement in the Retail Prices Index (“RPI”). 
2 Options granted between 1 January 1995 and 31 March 2001 were granted under The 3i Group 1994 Executive Share Option Plan (the “1994 Plan”) and are 
normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant provided that a performance condition has been met over a rolling three year 
period. This requires that the adjusted net asset value per share (after adding back dividends paid during the three year performance period) at the end of the 
three year period is equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share at the beginning of the period compounded annually over the period by the annual 
increase in the RPI plus 4%. 
3 Options granted after 31 March 2001 were granted under the Discretionary Share Plan and are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries 
of the date of grant to the extent a performance target has been met over a performance period of three years from the date of grant. For options granted 
between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2004, if the minimum threshold for vesting is not achieved in the first three years from grant, the performance period is 
extended to four and then five years from the date of grant but from the same base year. For options granted after 31 March 2004, there is no opportunity for 
the performance condition to be retested after the three year performance period. 
The performance target applicable to options granted between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2004 is set out in the table below: 
Annual percentage compound growth in net asset value per share with dividends reinvested, relative to the annual percentage change in RPI Percentage of the grant vesting 
Below RPI + 5 percentage points 0%
At least RPI + 5 percentage points 50%
At levels of performance between RPI + 5 percentage points and RPI + 10 percentage points the grant will vest pro rata 
At least RPI + 10 percentage points 100%
The performance target applicable to options granted between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 is set out in the table below: 
Annual percentage compound growth in net asset value per share with dividends reinvested, relative to the annual percentage change in RPI Percentage of the grant vesting 
Below RPI + 3 percentage points 0%
At least RPI + 3 percentage points 50%
At levels of performance between RPI + 3 percentage points and RPI + 8 percentage points the grant will vest pro rata 
At least RPI + 8 percentage points 100%
43 Directors’ remuneration report (continued) 
Notes (continued) 
4 These performance conditions are based on increases in net asset value per share so as to enable a significant proportion of executive Directors’ potential 
remuneration to be linked to an increase in the assets per share of the Company. The intention has been to approximate to the performance conditions 
attached to carried interest schemes in the private equity and venture capital market whilst retaining the essential feature of aligning executives’ interests with 
those of the Company’s shareholders. The minimum and maximum targets for options were chosen as being appropriately demanding in the prevailing market 
conditions at the time. The Committee determines whether the performance conditions have been fulfilled on the basis of calculations which are independently 
reviewed by the Company’s auditors. These performance conditions require net asset value per share at the beginning and end of the performance period to be 
calculated on a consistent basis using the same accounting policies. To the extent that accounting policies have altered over a performance period, the 
Company has the power to make appropriate adjustments to the calculations of net asset value per share to ensure that changes in accounting policies neither 
advantage nor disadvantage option holders. 
5 Options granted to Mr R W Perry in 2003 were pro-rated on grant approximately in the proportion that his prospective service from the date of grant to his 
normal retirement date at age 60 bore to the performance period of three years. 
6 For US legal and regulatory reasons, in 2001 Mr M M Gagen was granted the phantom share options (contractual rights to payments in circumstances 
designed to mirror the effect of an option to acquire shares under the Discretionary Share Plan) detailed below on the same terms and conditions as share 
options granted to other Directors in that year.

On Mr M M Gagen ceasing to be an employee on 31 August 2004, the exercise period was altered so as to expire on the earlier of six months following the 
satisfaction of the performance condition and the original expiry date. 
7 On Mr B P Larcombe ceasing to be an employee on 30 September 2004, the exercise periods of the options granted to him in 1995 to 2000 were altered in 
accordance with the rules of the 1994 Plan so as to expire on 30 September 2005 and the exercise periods of the options granted to him in 2001 to 2003 
were altered in accordance with the rules of the Discretionary Share Plan so as to expire on the earlier of six months following the satisfaction of the 
performance condition and the original expiry date. On Mr M M Gagen ceasing to be an employee on 31 August 2004 the exercise periods of the options 
granted to him in 1998 to 2000 were altered in accordance with the rules of the 1994 Plan so as to expire on 31 August 2005. 
8 The mid-market price of shares in the Company at 31 March 2005 was 671.5p and the range during the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005 was 528p to 
731p. The aggregate gains made by Directors on the exercise of share options in the year (including on exercise of awards under the Management Equity 
Investment Plan detailed on pages 46 and 47) was £318,380 (2004: £1,122,425). The amount attributable to the highest paid Director during the year was £nil 
(amount attributable to the highest paid Director (Mr B P Larcombe) in 2004: £239,729). Options under the 1984 Plan, the 1994 Plan and the Discretionary 
Share Plan have been granted with exercise prices not less than the prevailing market value. Options are granted at no cost to the option holder. No options 
held by Directors lapsed during the year. 
9 The fair value of the share options granted during the year has been calculated as being 26% of the market value at the date of grant of the shares 
under option. 
1 0As at 31 March 2005 there were approximately 2.4 million shares available under the 5% dilution limit applicable to the Discretionary Share Plan arising from the 
guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers and approximately 30 million shares available under the 10% dilution limit arising from those guidelines 
applicable to “all employee” plans. In addition, approximately 5 million unallocated shares were held in an employee trust and were available for awards under 
the Discretionary Share Plan. 
Performance Share Awards Performance share awards are awards of shares which are transferred to the participant by an employee benefit trust on terms that
the shares may, in certain circumstances, be forfeited. While the shares are subject to forfeiture they may not be sold, transferred or used as security. Awards are 
subject to a performance condition determining whether and to what extent the award will vest. Non-vested shares are forfeited. The performance condition 
provides for shares to vest based on the Company’s “percentage rank” by total shareholder return for the period of three years from grant (averaged over a 
60 day period) compared to a comparator group. The comparator group consists of the FTSE 100 Index constituents at the grant date (adjusted for mergers, 
demergers and delistings during the performance period). A company’s percentage rank is its rank in the comparator group divided by the number of companies 
in the group at the end of the performance period expressed as a percentage. If the Company’s percentage rank is less than 50% none of the shares vest. 
At a percentage rank of 50%, 35% of the shares vest and at 75% all the shares vest. Between these points shares vest pro rata. These conditions were chosen 
to align the interests of executive Directors and shareholders by linking a proportion of their remuneration to shareholder returns relative to a comparator index of 
which the Company is a constituent. The Committee will determine the extent to which these conditions have been met based on calculations prepared by the 
Committee’s remuneration consultant. The table below provides details of performance share awards held by the Directors who held office during the year.

Notes
1 Performance shares awarded to Mr R W Perry in 2003 were pro-rated on grant approximately in the proportion that his prospective service from the date of 
grant to his normal retirement date at age 60 bore to the performance period of three years. 
2 On Mr B P Larcombe ceasing to be an employee on 30 September 2004, 37,632 of the performance shares held by him were forfeited. The remaining 37,632 
performance shares remain subject to the original performance condition. 
3 The fair value of the performance shares awarded during the year has been calculated as being 46% of the market value of shares at the date of award. 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
44 Share Incentive Plan Eligible UK employees, including executive Directors, may participate in an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan intended to 
encourage employees to invest in the Company’s shares and which accordingly is not subject to a performance condition. During the year participants could 
invest up to £125 per month from their pre-tax salaries in the Company’s shares (referred to as partnership shares). For each share so acquired the Company 
granted two free additional shares (referred to as matching shares) which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed (other than by 
reason of retirement) within three years of grant. Dividends are reinvested on behalf of participants in further shares (referred to as dividend shares). Details of 
shares acquired by the executive Directors under this Plan during the year are set out in the table below.

Note Since 31 March 2005, Mr P E Yea and Mr R W Perry have each acquired a further 20 partnership shares and have been awarded a further 40 matching 
shares and Mr M J Queen has acquired a further 19 partnership shares and has been awarded a further 38 matching shares. During the year, shares were 
awarded at prices between 564.17p and 694p per share and with an average price of 625p per share. 
Pension arrangements The executive Directors are members of the 3i Group Pension Plan which is a defined benefit contributory scheme to which, at the most 
recent valuation date, 99% of UK employees belonged. For members who joined the plan before 1 September 2002, the plan provides for a pension, subject to 
Inland Revenue limits, of two thirds of final pensionable salary (limited to the Earnings Cap where this applies) on retirement (normally at age 60) after 25 years’ 
service and less for service under 25 years. For members who joined the plan on or after 1 September 2002 (which include Mr P E Yea and Mr S P Ball) 
33.3 years’ service is required to accrue a pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary (limited to the Earnings Cap where this applies). The plan also provides 
death-in-service cover of four times final pensionable salary (limited to the Earnings Cap where this applies), pensions payable in the event of ill health and 
spouses’ pensions on death. Further details of the plan are set out in note 12 to the accounts on page 58. 
Details of the pension entitlements of Directors who served during the year are provided in the table below. The final column of the table gives the difference 
between the transfer value of the Director’s pension entitlement at the start of the year and the transfer value at the end, less the contributions paid by the 
Director. The difference over the year is the result of any extra benefits earned over the year and any change in the value placed on £1 per annum of pension by 
the actuaries. The value placed on £1 per annum of pension reflects financial conditions at the time (eg the level of the stock market or returns available on 
government bonds) and the method and assumptions they use to calculate transfer values from time to time. Changes in the value placed on £1 per annum of 
pension can be positive or negative and can have much greater impact than the actual pension benefits earned.

Notes
1 In the cases of Mr B P Larcombe and Mr M M Gagen, 30 September 2004 and 31 August 2004, respectively, being the dates that they left pensionable service. 
2 The increase in accrued pension shown reflects the difference between deferred pensions on leaving, payable from age 60 except in the case of 
Mr B P Larcombe. For Mr B P Larcombe, the figure shown is the difference between the amount of immediate pension granted to him on his retirement and 
the amount of the deferred pension to which he would have been entitled if he had left on 31 March 2004. The pension is calculated including three months’ 
service whilst not a Director. 
3 The pensions shown, except for Mr B P Larcombe, are deferred pensions payable from age 60. Mr B P Larcombe’s figure is the immediate pension granted 
on his retirement. 
4 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the relevant professional guidance applicable at 31 March 2005 
(Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 (version 9.1)) and in the case of Mr B P Larcombe reflect the benefits due to be paid after 31 March 2005 only and therefore 
excludes actual benefits received. 
5 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the relevant professional guidance applicable at 31 March 2004 
(Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 (version 9.1)). 
6 Additional voluntary contributions are excluded from the above table. 
7 The pensions shown above become payable at a Normal Retirement Age of 60. Certain members have guaranteed early retirement rights in order to comply 
with EC sex equality requirements. In the figures given above, the value of these rights has been converted into extra deferred pension of equal value to these 
rights. On early retirement from active membership of the plan, there is a discretionary practice of calculating the early retirement pension by applying a 
reduction factor less than the standard factor, in accordance with Company policy. This is not available to deferred pensioners and no allowance for it is made in 
the calculations of cash equivalents for deferred pensioners under the plan. 
45 Directors’ remuneration report (continued) 
Deferred pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension (“GMP”) are increased in the deferment period according to statutory requirements (subject to 
an annual minimum of 3% per annum on pension accrued prior to 1 July 2004 for those members who joined the plan before 7 February 1992). GMPs are 
increased at fixed rate revaluation with increases vesting at Normal Retirement Age. For members who joined the plan before 1 September 2002, pensions in 
respect of service before 1 July 2004 and in excess of the GMP increase each year in payment to match the increase in the RPI since the pension started 
(or 30 June 1989, if later), subject to an annual maximum of 7.5% per annum and a minimum of 3% per annum. Pensions for members who joined the plan after 
1 September 2002 and pension in respect of service on or after 1 July 2004 for members who joined the plan before 1 September 2002, increase each year in 
payment to match the RPI subject to a maximum increase in any year of 7.5% and a minimum of 0%. On death in deferment or after retirement, a two-thirds 
pension is payable to the member’s spouse.  Dependants’ pensions may be payable in the absence of a spouse’s pension. In addition, on death within the first 
five years of retirement, a lump sum is payable equal to the balance of five years’ pension. 
Directors’ service contracts The non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, hold office in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and
do not have service contracts. Non-executive Directors’ appointment letters provide that there is no entitlement to compensation or other benefits on ceasing to 
be a Director. 
Company policy is that in normal circumstances executive Directors’ notice periods should not exceed one year. 
Mr P E Yea and Mr S P Ball have contracts of employment with 3i plc dated 27 July 2004 and 19 April 2005 respectively. Mr M J Queen and Mr R W Perry 
have contracts of employment with 3i plc dating from their first employment with the Group being 22 June 1987 and 1 July 1985. All of these contracts are 
terminable by 12 months’ notice given by the Company or six months’ notice given by the employee. Save for these notice periods the contracts have no 
unexpired terms. On termination of employment the Company can elect to give pay in lieu of notice. In the case of Mr Yea, the Company can also elect to 
terminate employment without notice subject to making 12 monthly payments thereafter equivalent to monthly basic pay and benefits less any amounts earned 
from alternative employment. 
Until 30 September 2004, Mr B P Larcombe had an employment contract with 3i plc dating from his first employment by the Group on 23 September 1974 
which was terminable by 12 months’ notice given by the Company or six months’ notice given by Mr Larcombe. The contract contained no provision for 
compensation on early termination, save that the Company could elect to give pay in lieu of notice. 
Until the cessation of his employment on 31 August 2004, Mr M M Gagen had an employment contract with 3i Corporation dated 12 July 2000. In line with US 
market practice this contract required him to give six months’ notice. It could, however, be terminated by 3i Corporation without notice, although for termination 
without cause Mr Gagen was entitled to continue to receive his base salary for 12 months following the cessation of employment. 
The Committee considers that compensation payments on early termination of employment should depend on individual circumstances. The duty of Directors to 
mitigate their loss will always be a relevant factor. 
Historic awards This section of the Directors’ remuneration report gives details of historic awards held by Directors under the Management Equity Investment 
Plan and the US carried interest plans. 
Deferred share bonuses under the Management Equity Investment Plan Under the Management Equity Investment Plan, until 31 March 2001 executives 
could be awarded part of their annual bonus in the form of a deferred award of shares. The value of these awards was reported each year as remuneration for 
the year in respect of which they were awarded. Awards took the form of share options issued by an employee benefit trust to acquire shares at no cost to 
themselves after three years provided they remained in employment with the Group and, in the case of executive Directors, they had maintained an agreed 
shareholding during the three year period. There was no performance condition since the award was considered part of the bonus already earned. In 1997 and 
1998, instead of being granted nil-cost options, executives were granted market value options but also received a deferred cash bonus of the same amount 
which was payable only for the purpose of funding the exercise price payable when awards were exercised.

3i Report and accounts 2005 
46 Performance linked awards under the Management Equity Investment Plan As well as share bonus awards, from 1997 to 2000, executives could also 
receive awards linked to longer term Group performance. Participants were awarded options by an employee benefit trust to acquire shares at no cost to 
themselves after five years subject to a performance condition. In 1997 and 1998, instead of nil-cost options, executives were granted market value options but 
also received a deferred cash bonus of the same amount which was payable only to fund the exercise price payable when awards were exercised.

Notes
1 The table details awards made in 1998 and 1999 to the extent that they vested in accordance with the performance condition described below. The 1998 
awards vested as to 100% and the 1999 awards vested as to 64.6%. It has not yet been determined if and to what extent awards granted in 2000 will vest. 
2 In accordance with the rules of the plan, Mr B P Larcombe is permitted, within 12 months of his ceasing to be an employee, to exercise the awards granted in 
1998, 1999 and 2000 to the extent that the three year performance condition is satisfied and Mr M M Gagen is so permitted to exercise the awards granted in 
1998 and 1999. 
The performance condition provided no shares would vest unless the Company’s total shareholder return over a three year performance period (based on a six 
month average share price before the beginning and end of the period) was equal to or exceeded the compounded annual increase in the RPI over the period 
+ 6% per annum. If this minimum return level was achieved, 35% of the shares would vest and all shares would vest if the return was equal to or exceeded RPI 
+ 20% per annum. At performance between these levels, a proportion of shares would vest. If the minimum performance condition was not achieved in the three 
year performance period, the performance period was extended up to a maximum period of seven years from the same base year. The Committee decided a 
performance condition linked to shareholder return was in shareholders’ interests and by linking the condition to RPI inflationary increases were discounted. The 
minimum and the maximum targets, were chosen as being suitably demanding at that time whilst aligning the interests of participants and shareholders. The 
Group’s Human Resources department calculates whether and the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied in accordance with the formula 
and this calculation is audited by Ernst & Young LLP . 
Awards under the US carried interest plans From 2002 to 2004, Mr M M Gagen (who was based in and responsible for the Group’s US business) was 
allocated points under the US carried interest plans. The plans operate on the basis of annual “vintages” of investments and points are used to allocate carried 
interest between participants. New investments made in a particular financial year belong to the same vintage. Further investments in subsequent years are 
treated as belonging to the vintage in which the first investment was made. Payments will be made to the executive Director in relation to his points for a particular 
vintage when proceeds from the realisation of investments are received. If the value of investments for a vintage (both realised and unrealised) exceeds a specified 
internal rate of return (10% for the vintage years ended 31 March 2000 and 2001 and 8% for the vintage years ended 31 March 2002, 2003 and 2004), a 
proportion of the realised profits will be paid to the executive Director in accordance with his points. If the specified internal rate of return is not achieved, no 
amounts will be paid to the executive Director. The number of points allocated to the US based Director was determined by the Committee after taking into 
account market practice in the US. The conditions determining payments under the plans were chosen so as to link participants’ rewards to realised profits from 
investments.

Under the terms of the US carried interest plans, the following points held by Mr M M Gagen were redeemed for nil consideration after he ceased to be a Director: 
115 points (2000 Vintage); 52 points (2001 Vintage); 10 points (2002 Vintage). The balance of the points held by Mr M M Gagen vested. As at 31 March 2005, 
the remaining points held by Mr M M Gagen in the 2002 and 2003 Vintages had a nil accrued value and the points held in the 2004 Vintage had an accrued 
value of £420,754.

47 Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of 3i Group plc 
We have audited the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005, which comprise Consolidated statement of total return, Reconciliation of 
movement in shareholders’ funds, Consolidated revenue statement, Consolidated balance sheet, Parent company balance sheet, Consolidated cash flow 
statement, Accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 50. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out 
therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements which 
are required to be prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards as set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in relation to the financial statements.  The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’ remuneration report. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ 
report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not 
disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement on pages 35 to 39 reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other information 
comprises Financial highlights, 3i at a glance, Our business lines, Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s statement, Operating and financial review, Corporate 
responsibility report, Board of Directors, Directors’ report, unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, Principal subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures, 
Portfolio valuation methodology, Ten largest investments, Forty other large investments, New investment analysis, Portfolio analysis, Realisations analysis and Funds 
under management. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient 
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. 
Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at 31 March 2005 and of the 
profit and total return of the Group for the year then ended; and the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

53 Accounting policies 
A Basis of preparation These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include certain investments and fixed assets at
valuation and in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice – Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies (“SORP”) – and applicable 
accounting standards, except as described below concerning the treatment of capital profits. 
As the Company is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority as a deposit taker, the accounts have also been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of Part VII of the Companies Act 1985 in respect of banking companies and groups. 
The Articles of Association of the Company prohibit the distribution of its capital profits. Accordingly, the Company’s capital profits, shown in note 39, are included 
in the capital reserve. In order to use consistent accounting policies in the Group accounts, the capital profits of subsidiary undertakings have been excluded from 
consolidated revenue and included in capital reserve. These capital profits of subsidiary undertakings are distributable. The Revenue statement of the Company 
has been omitted from these accounts in accordance with section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Financial Reporting Standard 17 – Retirement Benefits (“FRS 17”) The Group has adopted fully the reporting requirements of FRS 17, having previously complied 
with the transitional disclosure requirements of the standard and SSAP 24. The effect of adopting is explained in note 42. 
Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 – Accounting for ESOP Trusts (“UITF 38”) The Group has also adopted UITF 38. This requires shares held by the 3i Group 
Employee Trust to be accounted for as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds rather than as an asset. 
Fees receivable earned and deal related costs incurred as an intrinsic part of an intention to acquire or dispose of an investment, have been accounted for directly 
in the capital reserve. To the extent that taxation losses have been transferred between capital and revenue in order to be utilised against excess taxable profits, 
the transfer is reflected in the Statement of total return, Revenue statement and note 14. 
Administrative expenses associated with making and managing investments are allocated between capital and revenue. Finance costs less interest income on 
surplus funds have been allocated between revenue and capital. This allocation is 70% to capital and 30% to revenue for both administrative expenses and net 
finance costs. 
B Joint ventures and associated undertakings Joint ventures and associated undertakings that are held as part of the investment portfolio of the Group are 
included in the accounts at the Directors’ estimate of Fair Value. Dividends and interest from these investments are included in the revenue account as the 
Directors’ believe that, while not complying with the Companies Act, this gives a true and fair view of the income. This treatment is in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 9 – Associates and Joint Ventures. 
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more venturers under a 
contractual agreement. Joint ventures through which the Group carries on its business and not held as part of the investment portfolio are accounted for using 
the gross equity method of accounting. The treatment adopted is in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 9 – Associates and Joint Ventures. 
C Fixed assets in use by the Group Fixed assets in use by the Group are depreciated by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
office equipment five years; computer equipment three years; computer software three years; motor vehicles four years. Properties in use by the Group are 
included at external professional valuation, which is carried out at each balance sheet date. Depreciation is not provided against the value of the buildings as the 
amount is immaterial and impairment is considered annually. Motor vehicles being acquired on hire purchase are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated 
over their estimated useful lives. The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the revenue account over the period of the agreement and represents 
a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. 
D Financial fixed assets Loan investments, fixed income and equity share investments, together with interests in joint ventures and the shares in Group 
undertakings, are regarded as financial fixed assets as they are held for long-term investment purposes. 
E Valuation of financial fixed assets and investment properties Investment packages comprising mixtures of equity shares, fixed income shares and loan 
investments, together with financial fixed assets of joint ventures, are included at the Directors’ estimate of Fair Value on the following bases: 
a Listed investments and quoted shares for which an active market exists are valued at mid-market price. This value is reduced by an appropriate discount 
dependent on the size of the Group’s holding relative to normal trading volumes. 
b Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors as follows: new investments are generally valued at cost until the first set of accounts for a full financial 
period subsequent to investment are received. An enterprise value for the investee company is estimated using various methodologies, and, after adjusting for 
higher-ranking debt and an appropriate marketability discount, is apportioned over the remaining instruments including the Group’s investments in loans, fixed 
income shares and equity shares. Standard methodologies include applying an average sector earnings multiple to operating profits, valuation by reference to the 
net asset base, sales basis and the price of recent investments made in the investee company. If failure is expected the equity shares are valued at nil and the 
fixed income shares and loan investments are valued at the lower of cost or net recoverable amount. 
c In all of the above categories of investment where failure has occurred the loss is charged against realised capital profits. 
d Deferred consideration is included at the estimated present value of the expected future proceeds. Investment properties are included at external 
professional valuation. 
F Income recognition Dividends receivable on listed shares are brought into account on the ex-dividend date. Dividends receivable on shares where no 
ex-dividend date is quoted are brought into account when the right to receive payment is established. The fixed return on a loan investment is recognised on a 
time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the loan. Other income, including interest receivable from derivatives, is recognised on the accruals 
basis except for income from finance leases and hire purchase contracts, which is credited to revenue so as to result in a constant periodic rate of return on the 
net cash investment. 
3i Report and accounts 2005 
54 G Administrative expenses Administrative expenses which comprise the costs of making and managing investments and the management of the Group are 
accounted for on an accruals basis. Costs associated with making and managing investments are allocated to revenue and capital profits. Costs of management 
of the Group are charged to revenue profit. Costs incurred as an intrinsic part of an intention to acquire or dispose of an investment have been accounted for in 
full as part of capital return as opposed to being allocated between revenue and capital. 
H Finance costs Finance costs, including those of derivatives, are accounted for on an accruals basis. Discounts, premiums and expenses arising on the issue 
of bonds and notes are amortised over the period of the related borrowing. 
I Trading assets Loans and advances to customers and other non-investment assets are carried at the lower of book amount and recoverable amount. 
J Deferred tax Provision is made for deferred tax, using the liability method, on all material timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is provided at a rate at which it is anticipated the timing difference will reverse. Provision is also made for deferred tax on 
the unrealised appreciation of investment held by certain subsidiaries, as reduced by losses, where these are expected to crystallise in the future. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised only when there is evidence that there will be taxable profits in the future to offset the deferred tax asset.
K Foreign currency translation Foreign currency revenue items, assets and liabilities, including those of non-UK subsidiary undertakings, are translated into 
sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date, with the exception of borrowings covered by forward exchange contracts which are translated 
at the contracted rates of exchange. Exchange adjustments arising on the translation of investments, borrowings and net assets including those of overseas 
subsidiary undertakings are dealt with through the appropriate reserves. Exchange adjustments arising on realised transactions are dealt with in the revenue or 
capital profit for the period as appropriate. 
L Pensions Defined benefit pension scheme assets are measured at fair value, scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at 
the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent currency and terms to the scheme liabilities. The current service cost and vested past 
service cost are charged to administrative expenses. The interest cost and the expected return on assets are included as other finance income or costs in the 
revenue reserve. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the capital reserve. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to administrative expenses. 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
In June 2002, the European Union adopted a regulation that requires, from 1 January 2005, European listed groups to prepare their consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU. 
During 2003 the Group formed a project team and initiated a programme to change its accounting policies and systems to be IFRS compliant by 2005. 
These changes are nearing completion and it is our intention to restate the balance sheet at the transition date of 1 April 2004 and the results for the year to 
31 March 2005 on an IFRS basis at the end of June, to allow the impact to be interpreted and understood. 
IFRS differ in certain respects from the Group’s accounting policies under UK GAAP . The summary below outlines the important differences for the Group in 
respect of recognition and measurement on the basis of extant IFRS that will be effective for the year to 31 March 2006, including revised IAS 32 and 39. 
Dividends IFRS require dividends payable to be recorded in the period in which they are approved whereas under UK GAAP dividends are recorded in the period 
to which they relate. 
Share-based payment Under UK GAAP , no compensation expense is recognised for Inland Revenue approved Save-as-you-earn share option schemes or for 
other share option schemes where the option has no intrinsic value (ie where at date of grant the exercise price equals the market value). IFRS require the fair 
value of share options at the date of grant to be recognised as an expense over the vesting period. 
Financial instruments: financial liabilities IFRS require all financial liabilities to be measured at amortised cost except those held for trading and those that 
were designated as fair value through profit and loss on initial recognition. Under UK GAAP financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost. In IFRS as adopted 
by the EU, the option to designate at fair value through profit and loss is not available. 
Liabilities and equity Under UK GAAP , all issued shares are classified as shareholders’ funds, and analysed between equity and non-equity interests. There is no 
concept of non-equity shares in IFRS. Instruments are classified between equity and liabilities in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. 
Instruments such as convertible loans are analysed into their constituent liability and equity parts. 
Transition IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ (IFRS 1) will apply to the Group’s financial statements. The standard 
requires an opening IFRS balance sheet to be prepared as at the date of transition to IFRS, being the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented 
under IFRS in its first IFRS financial statements (1 April 2004). Accounting policies must comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting date of the first IFRS 
financial statements, and applied throughout all periods presented.

As is normal in the private equity industry, the Group offers its investment 
executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful 
investments. The two principal methods of achieving this are the Group’s 
investment performance plans (“IPP”) and carried interest arrangements. 
Under the IPP , payments are made on the basis of realised capital profits on 
investments pooled by team and by year. Payments are made if the realised 
profits and valuation of remaining investments within a pool indicate that a 
performance hurdle will be exceeded. Payments are accrued as the increase 
in asset value is recognised.

Interest payable was allocated so that interest payable less other interest 
receivable and similar income was allocated to revenue and capital profits 
based on the expected split of returns between revenue and capital. This split 
is expected to be 30% revenue and 70% capital.

Under the carried interest arrangements, participants purchase a carried

This entitles them to receive a proportion of the cash flows from those 
investments in excess of a performance hurdle.

833). In addition to the staff costs shown above, the amounts shown in note 4 
have been charged against capital profits in respect of carried interest and 
investment performance plans. 
Costs associated with making and managing investments were allocated to 
revenue and capital profits based on the expected split of returns between 
revenue and capital. This split is expected to be 30% revenue and 70% capital.

12 Pension arrangements 
The Group operates a number of pension schemes. The main scheme, which 
covers most employees, is the 3i Group Pension Plan (“the Plan”). The cost of 
the Plan recognised in the accounts was £12 million (2004: £10 million) and 
other plans was £3 million (2004: £5 million). The Plan is a funded defined 
benefit scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Group’s finances 
and are administered by Trustees. The Group accounts for pension 
arrangements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 17 – Retirement 
Benefits (“FRS 17”), having previously complied with the transitional disclosure 
requirements of the standard and SSAP 24, the effect of adopting FRS 17 is 
explained in note 42. 
The last full actuarial valuation at 30 June 2004 was updated to 31 March 2005 
by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 17. The Plan’s 
liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method. The valuation 
for FRS 17 purposes is based on the membership details and demographic 
assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation. The Plan assets have 
been updated to market value as at 31 March 2005. 
The key FRS 17 assumptions used for the Plan were: 
2005 2004 2003
Price inflation 3.0% 2.9% 2.5%
Salary increases (excluding promotion) 4.5% 4.4% 4.0%
Pension increases 3.1% 3.0% 3.0%
Discount rate 5.4% 5.5% 5.6%
Following advice from the actuaries, no regular employer contributions were 
made during the period 1 July 1985 to 1 April 2002. Regular employer 
contributions recommenced on 1 April 2002. For the year to 31 March 2005 
standard contributions were agreed to be 29.2% of members’ pensionable 
salaries. Additional employer contributions were made in the year to 
31 March 2005 of £60 million (2004: £13 million, 2003: £13 million and 
2002: £13 million). 
New employees joining 3i and the Plan after 1 September 2002 are required to 
contribute 5% of their monthly pensionable salaries. Under its rules, the Plan 
was non contributory for employees, joining prior to 1 September 2002, from 
1 April 1978 to 31 December 2002. From 1 January 2003, the rules of the Plan 
were changed and employees who joined the Plan prior to 1 September 2002 
were required to contribute 1% of monthly pensionable salary, this will 
increase by 1% each year to a target of 5% of pensionable salary. Currently, 
the contributions are 3% of pensionable salary. 
Mr R W Perry and Mr O H J Stocken are Directors of 3i Group plc and were 
also throughout the year Directors of Gardens Pension Trustees Limited, one of 
two Corporate Trustees of the 3i Group Pension Plan. 
During the year, the Board of the Company provided a guarantee to the 
Trustees of the Plan in respect of the liabilities to the Plan of 3i plc, the principal 
employer under the Plan.

Audit services are services required to be undertaken by the auditors which 
include the statutory audit and interim review, regulatory returns and 
formalities relating to borrowing, shareholder and other circulars. This work is 
normally allocated to the auditors. 
Tax and further assurance services are services which it is most efficient for the 
auditors to provide and is allocated to them subject to consideration of any 
impact on their independence. 
Other services are services that could be provided by a number of firms, 
including general consultancy work. All significant consultancy projects are 
normally put out to tender and work would be allocated to the auditors only 
if it did not present a potential threat to the independence of the audit team. 
Other services in this category include due diligence within the investment 
process. If this were to be provided by the auditors, the specific team engaged 
would be independent of the audit. 
In addition to the above the Group has identified £1.3 million of investment 
related fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP by investee companies, where the 
Group’s investee companies and investment teams have appointed the service 
provider. It is estimated that Ernst & Young LLP receive less than 10% of the 
total investment related fees paid to the four largest accounting firms.

The Group’s investments and capital return are primarily included in the Group’s 
ultimate parent company, the affairs of which are directed so as to allow it to 
be approved as an investment trust. As investment trusts are exempt from capital 
gains tax, the Group’s capital return is largely not taxable. 
Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group currently has and 
expects to continue to generate surplus tax losses. A deferred tax asset in 
respect of these surplus losses is not recognised because their utilisation is 
considered unlikely in the foreseeable future.

The difference between the basic and diluted weighted average number of 
shares used in the calculation of earnings per share and total return per share is 
the dilutive effect of the convertible bonds and share options. 
The difference between the basic and diluted number of shares used in the 
calculation of net asset value per share is the dilutive effect of share options. 
18 Related undertakings

On 1 August 2003, 3i Group plc issued 1550 million 1.375% Convertible 
Bonds due 2008. They are convertible at the option of the Bondholder to 
cash and ordinary shares at any time from 11 September 2003 to 25 July 
2008. The number of shares to be issued on conversion will be determined 
by dividing the principal of the bond less the cash settled amount by the 
conversion price in effect on the conversion date. The initial conversion price 
is £8.416757. Unless previously realised and cancelled, redeemed or 
converted, these bonds will be redeemed on 1 August 2008. 
If certain conditions are met, the Issuer may redeem all, but not some only, of 
the Bonds for the time being outstanding at their principal amount. The Issuer 
may make a payment in cash as an alternative to issuing shares upon either 
conversion or redemption. 
Interest is payable on the bonds in equal semi annual instalments in arrears 
on 12 January and 12 July each year. 
The fair value of the convertible bonds at 31 March 2005 was £381 million.

30 Interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
Interest rate risk emanates from the Group’s loan investments and the Group’s funding. The Group’s policy is that fixed rate lending is matched with fixed rate 
borrowings and the interest rate resetting profile of variable rate lending is matched with that of variable rate borrowings through gearing the portfolio. Financial 
instruments including interest rate swaps are used as part of this matching process. Equity investments, which are mainly funded by shareholders’ funds but also 
partially by borrowings in similar currencies, give rise to an interest rate sensitivity gap as a result of the equity investments being non-interest bearing and having 
no fixed maturity date. The interest rate sensitivity gap at 31 March 2005 was:

32 Liquidity 
The Group’s liquidity policy is based on a maturity ladder approach with all mismatch limits of cash flows between cumulative assets and cumulative liabilities over 
various time periods approved by the Board. The limits for shorter periods are also agreed with the Financial Services Authority.
33 Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities 
The Group does not have a trading book and it holds all assets and liabilities in a non-trading book. 
Financial assets Quoted and unquoted equity investments and quoted fixed income shares are included in the consolidated balance sheet at market value or 
Directors’ valuation which equates to fair value. Unquoted fixed income shares and loan investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower 
of cost or recoverable amount. No liquid and active market exists, either for the unquoted fixed income shares or loan investments or their component parts. 
The fair value of other financial assets equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Financial liabilities The Group’s borrowings finance loan investments, fixed income shares and equity shares. As stated above, these unquoted loan and fixed 
income share investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. These investments are not shown at an 
estimated market value as no active and liquid market exists for them. The Report and accounts therefore do not include any recognition of the effect of their 
yield being above or below current market yields. However, Financial Reporting Standard 13 – Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures – requires 
disclosure of the fair value of those elements of the Group’s borrowings that are listed even though, in some cases, the market for those borrowings is not 
particularly active. The remainder of the Group’s borrowings, which are unlisted, do not have a liquid or active market. 
The fair value of the listed element of financial liabilities at 31 March 2005 was £1,440 million (2004: £1,424 million), which compares with a book amount of 
£1,379 million (2004: £1,367 million). These borrowings are used to fund investments which, in general, yield a net margin to the Group and which would 
therefore have a higher fair value than the fair value of the borrowing. The fair value of other financial liabilities equates to their book value in the consolidated 
balance sheet. 
Derivatives The Group does not trade in derivatives. The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they 
are hedging. It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net 
gain or loss is expected to be realised. 
The book value of derivatives represents net interest receivable/(payable) on such instruments at the balance sheet date. The fair value represents the replacement 
cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date. No unrealised gains or losses are included in the balance sheet. The amount of unrecognised gains or losses at 
the balance sheet date equates to the difference between fair value and book value.

The Group has generated surplus tax losses and expects to continue to do so 
in the future. A deferred tax asset in respect of these surplus losses has not 
been recognised because their utilisation is considered unlikely in the 
foreseeable future. 
37 Subordinated liabilities 
Subordinated liabilities comprise limited recourse funding from Kreditanstalt für 
Wiederaufbau (“KfW”), a German federal bank. This funding, which individually 
finances investment assets, is at various fixed rates of interest and maturity 
is dependent upon the disposal of the associated assets. This funding is 
subordinated to other creditors of the individual group undertakings to which 
these funds have been advanced and become non-repayable as assets fail. 
The carrying values of the non-recourse funding are adjusted to reflect the 
amounts expected to be payable when assets are failing.

3i Report and accounts 2005 
70 Portfolio valuation methodology 
A description of the methodology used to value the Group’s portfolio is set out below in order to provide more detailed information than is included each year in the 
accounting policies for the valuation of the portfolio. The methodology complies in all material aspects with the “International private equity and venture capital 
valuation guidelines” issued by the AFIC, BVCA and EVCA. 
Basis of valuation Investments are reported at the Directors’ estimate of Fair Value at the reporting date. Fair Value represents the amount for which an asset 
could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. 
General In estimating Fair Value, we seek to use a methodology that is appropriate in light of the nature, facts and circumstances of the investment and its 
materiality in the context of the total portfolio. Methodologies are applied consistently from period to period, except where a change would result in a better 
estimation of Fair Value. Given the uncertainties inherent in estimating Fair Value, a degree of caution is applied in exercising judgments and making the 
necessary estimates. 
Quoted investments Quoted investments are valued at the closing mid-market price at the reporting date. This value is reduced by a Marketability Discount
of between 0% and 25% dependent on the size of the Group’s holding relative to normal trading volumes in that stock. Where there are formal restrictions on 
dealing in a particular security, a discount is applied, reducing over the term of the restriction. In the case of a six-month restriction, a discount of 20% would 
normally be used. 
Unquoted investments Most unquoted investments are valued using one of the following methodologies: 
– cost, less any required provision; 
– earnings multiple; 
– net assets; 
– price of recent investment; 
– expected sales proceeds. 
New investments are valued at cost for the first 12 months and then until another methodology becomes more appropriate. This generally occurs when the first 
full set of accounts covering a period of at least six months since the date of investment becomes available. 
Any investment in a company that has failed or is expected to fail within the next 12 months has the equity shares valued at nil and the fixed income shares 
and loan instruments valued at the lower of cost and net recoverable amount. 
Generally, the process of estimating the Fair Value of an investment involves selecting one of the above methodologies and using that to derive an Enterprise 
Value for the investee company. The process is then to: 
– deduct from the Enterprise Value all financial instruments ranking ahead of the Group; 
– apply an appropriate Marketability Discount; 
– apportion the remaining value over the other financial instruments including the Group’s loans, fixed income shares and equity shares. 
Where that apportionment indicates a shortfall against the loans or fixed income shares, then the Group considers whether, in estimating Fair Value, the shortfall 
should be applied, and if so, to what extent. 
The Marketability Discount will generally be between 10%-30% with the level set to reflect the Group’s influence over the exit prospects and timing for the investee 
company. 
When using the earnings multiple methodology, earnings before interest and tax (“EBIT”) are normally used, adjusted to a maintainable level and taxed at the 
standard corporation tax rate. Generally, the latest full year historical accounts are used unless there is an indication of a forecast downturn in earnings in the 
current or forecast year, in which case those earnings may be used. An appropriate multiple is applied to these earnings to derive an Enterprise Value. Normally 
the multiple will be the average taxed EBIT multiple for the relevant sector of the FTSE Global SmallCap Europe index, adjusted downwards by the Group to 
exclude loss-making companies. 
Where a company reports an operating loss or the industry standard valuation methodology is by reference to the asset base, then the value may be estimated 
using the net assets methodology. 
The price of recent investment methodology is used mainly for investments in venture capital companies and includes cost of the investment or valuation by 
reference to a subsequent financing round. Valuation increases above cost are only recognised if that round involved a new external investor and the company is 
meeting milestones set by the investors. The relevance of this methodology can be eroded over time due to changes in the technology, business or market which 
may indicate an impairment has occurred. In this case, carrying values will be reduced to reflect Fair Value. 
Other factors that may be taken into account include: 
– the expected effect of ratchets, options and liquidation preferences; 
– any industry standard valuation methodology; 
– offers received as part of a sale process which may either support the value derived from another methodology or be used as the valuation less a 
Marketability Discount of typically 10%. 
For the Group’s smaller investments, the valuation is determined by a more mechanistic approach using information from the latest audited accounts. Equity 
shares are valued at the higher of an earnings or net assets methodology. Fixed income shares and loan investments are valued at the lower of cost and net 
recoverable amount. Approximately 15% by value of the Group’s unquoted investments are valued using this methodology. 
An analysis of the portfolio by valuation method is given in the portfolio analysis on pages 75 and 76. 
71 Ten largest investments 
At 31 March 2005, the Directors’ valuation of the ten largest investments was a total of £636 million. The residual cost of these investments at that date was

Notes
1 The investment information is in respect of the Group’s holding and excludes any co-investment by 3i managed funds. 
2 Income in the year represents dividends received (inclusive of any overseas withholding tax) and gross interest receivable in the year to 31 March 2005. 
3 Net assets and earnings figures are taken from the most recent audited accounts of the investee business. The figures shown are the total earnings on ordinary 
activities after tax and net assets of each business. Because of the varying rights attaching to the classes of shares held by the Group, it could be misleading to 
attribute a certain proportion of earnings and net assets to the proportion of equity capital held. Negative earnings and net assets are shown in brackets. 
4 The residual cost of the equity held in Travelex Holdings Ltd is £120,560. 
5 In April 2004, three portfolio companies were merged to form Yellow Brick Road BV.  3i’s equity value was converted into a loan and into new equity shares. 
6 The cost of the equity held in ERM Holdings Ltd is £387,701. 
7 The loan to Petrofac Ltd is convertible into equity, which has been reflected in the valuation of individual instruments.

“Private equity”, as the term suggests, involves investment of equity capital in private businesses. There are three broad categories of investment within 
private equity: 
– Early stage investment (sometimes called “venture investment”) – this is investment in early stage or start-up businesses, usually engaged in life sciences
research or technology development activities. Here, the investor (“the VC”) would usually take a minority equity stake (ie less than 50% of the equity shares) in 
the business as part of a syndicate of venture investors; and the aim of the investment is to provide funding for development or research expenditure through a 
series of investment “rounds”. Progress and prospects are re-assessed ahead of the provision of further funding. 
– Growth capital (or development capital) investment – this involves the provision of capital to accelerate the growth of established businesses and generally 
involves the VC taking a minority equity position. It is a “product” suited to a diverse range of growth opportunities, including acquisitions, increasing production 
capacity, market or product development, turnaround opportunities, shareholder succession and change of ownership situations. 
– Buyout investment – this involves the purchase of an existing independent business or subsidiary or division of a corporate group from its current owners. 
This category of investment includes management buyouts, management buy-ins, institutional buyouts, etc. Here, the equity in the post buyout business is 
usually shared between the management team and the VC, with the VC usually holding a majority stake. The finance for the buyout would generally comprise 
around 60% of senior and mezzanine debt (usually provided by banks and mezzanine providers), with substantially all of the balance of the purchase price 
coming from the VC and a relatively small amount coming from the management team. In order to reflect the mismatch between the equity finance provided by 
the VC and that provided by the management team and the equity stake taken by each in the underlying business, a large part of the VC’s finance is generally 
provided in the form of redeemable preference shares or shareholder loans. 
Investment objective Like any other investment, the objective of the VC is to earn attractive returns on its investment commensurate with the risk being taken. 
The returns come either in the form of income (interest, dividends or fees) or capital gains. The contrast with investment in quoted companies is that the VC will 
usually prefer to crystallise its capital gain through a trade sale (ie a sale to a corporate purchaser) or flotation on the public markets of the underlying business. 
This preference tends to make private equity investment medium to long term in nature, since time is required to implement the value growth strategy for the 
business and there will also be a wish to optimise the timing of the “exit”. 
The investment lifecycle The investment lifecycle for an investment can be broken down into five distinct phases, with each involving significant resource and 
capability on the part of the VC: 
– Origination – the ability to access and create investment opportunities is critical to the VC’s business model. 
– Developing and validating the investment case – this phase involves capability in the areas of judgment, knowledge and experience within the particular 
business area in which the opportunity lies; building a management team and working with it to develop the value growth strategy; consideration of the exit 
strategy; and “due diligence” on all significant assumptions and inputs to the investment case. 
– Structuring and making the investment – this phase involves financial structuring, negotiation and project management skills on the part of the VC. 
Relationships with banks, mezzanine finance providers, intermediaries and others are also important. 
– Implementing the value growth strategy – this phase involves “actually making it happen”, delivering value growth between making the investment and exit. 
If the strategy involves corporate acquisitions or mergers, restructuring the business, achieving growth in turnover or operating profits, the VC would need to 
have the required capability to ensure these are achieved. As important is the ability to assess and strengthen the management team as the life cycle proceeds 
– this might involve having access to a pool of management talent in order to match a particular need to a particular management skill-set. 
– Exit – this phase generally involves a trade sale or flotation of the underlying business. Exit prospects and strategy should generally be reviewed on an ongoing 
basis during the investment’s life – and the sale or flotation itself requires resource and capability from the VC, since both are lengthy and complex processes. 
Types of investment vehicle The predominant vehicle in the industry is the independent, private, fixed-life, closed-end fund, usually organised as a limited
partnership. These funds typically have a fixed life of 10 years. Investments generally consist of an initial commitment of capital which is then drawn down as the 
investment manager finds investment opportunities. Capital is returned to the investor via earnings distributions and sales of investments.
Some investment vehicles are organised as captive or semi-captive funds. A captive fund invests only for the interest of its parent organisation (which may be a 
bank or investment bank, insurance company, university, or whatever). A semi-captive fund mixes capital from both outside investors and the parent 
organisation. Both captive and semi-captive funds tend to be “evergreen” in nature – income from investments and proceeds received on the realisation of 
investments are substantially retained for further investment rather than being returned to investors. 
There are also a limited number of private equity investment companies, such as 3i, whose shares are listed on a stock exchange. These tend to be evergreen in 
nature and offer investors a relatively liquid exposure to private equity. 
Drivers of private equity investment Some of the main drivers giving rise to investment opportunities are as follows: 
– Stock market conditions and M&A activity levels – a strong stock market acts in many ways as an “engine” for private equity, since it allows acquisitive 
listed companies to purchase businesses at attractive prices and also is more receptive to businesses seeking a listing. The ability of the VC to “exit” at 
reasonably high values is a key part of the investment model, and exit assumptions will be a key input to the pricing parameters at the time of investing. 
In addition, strong activity levels in the M&A market (which will often follow from good stock market conditions) tend to provide a source of investment 
opportunities when the acquiring group disposes of the unwanted parts of the business acquired. 
– Restructuring by large corporate groups – as corporate groups change strategic direction or focus on core activities, they will often seek to sell unwanted or 
non-core subsidiaries or divisions, providing a good source of buyout opportunities. 
– Entrepreneurial culture – this is to do with the eagerness, across a society, of individuals to start up or grow businesses or to give up a secure corporate job 
for the opportunity to run or manage an independent business. 
– Growth strategies – the pursuit of profits by businesses will often involve the use of growth strategies. Whether the strategy is to grow organically or through 
acquisition, there will usually be a funding requirement, which can be met through the provision of growth capital. 
– Regulatory factors – regulatory factors will often act to force corporations to sell off business units or to limit or restrict courses of action by parties operating 
in the complex world of business. Additionally, regulatory factors can act to incentivise certain types of investment or courses of action. Either way, regulation 
can give rise to investment opportunity for private equity. 
– Technological developments and expenditure on information technology – both of these factors act as engines for investment in the early stage 
technology area, as entrepreneurs seek to exploit the development and research opportunities arising. 
– Succession issues – especially in family-owned businesses, succession issues can give rise to investment opportunities.

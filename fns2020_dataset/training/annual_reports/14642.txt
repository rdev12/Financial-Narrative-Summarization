Shareholder Information
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 2014 was a remarkable year for Spire 
Healthcare. Not only did we become 
a public company, but we also bought a 
hospital in Cheam (Greater London), opened 
our first cancer treatment centre in Bristol, 
finalised a new agreement with Bupa and 
reached the end of the two year industry-
wide investigation with the Competition 
and Markets Authority (CMA) – all while 
providing high-quality care to more patients 
than ever and achieving our highest patient 
and consultant satisfaction scores.
Chairman’s statement 
A remarkable year
T
his is Spire Healthcare’s first Annual 
Report following our successful 
Initial Public Offering (IPO) in July 
2014. We have been well received 
as a public company; the combination of a 
growing market and award-winning clinical 
outcomes, coupled with our diversified payor 
mix and strong investment strategy, has led 
to a high and sustained degree of interest 
from UK and international investors.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Our financial performance in 2014 was 
strong. Our seventh full successive year  
of growth resulted in total revenue of  
£856.0 million and an operating profit 
of £114.1 million*. We continue to invest 
significantly in new services, treatments, 
hospitals and equipment. In the last year, 
we have invested £105.1 million across 
these areas, developing further our key 
role in the UK healthcare economy.
Garry Watts
Chairman

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 GOVERNANCE
As part of the IPO, we appointed four 
experienced non-executive directors to our 
Board in June 2014. They have significantly 
strengthened the range of skills and 
expertise in the Boardroom and are helping 
to guide the Company through its inaugural 
phase as a public entity and into the future. 
John Gildersleeve, our Deputy Chairman, 
has extensive retail and plc experience, 
having served on the Boards of Lloyds 
TSB Bank plc, Vodafone Group plc and 
as a director of Tesco plc for 20 years 
until he retired in 2004. He is the current 
Chairman of The British Land Company plc. 
John chairs our Nomination Committee.
Dame Janet Husband brings with her 
a vast range of clinical expertise. She is 
Emeritus Professor of Radiology at the 
Institute of Cancer Research and currently 
serves on the Boards of Royal Marsden 
NHS Foundation Trust and Nuada Medical 
Group. Janet chairs our Clinical Governance 
and Safety Committee.
Robert Lerwill, an experienced finance 
director, currently serves as a non-executive 
director of ITC Limited, a large Indian 
conglomerate, and DJI (Holdings) plc.  
His depth of experience across health  
and telecommunications means he brings  
a unique perspective on our business.  
Robert chairs our Audit and Risk Committee.
Tony Bourne is familiar with the healthcare 
sector, having served as CEO at the British 
Medical Association for nine years. He 
is currently a non-executive director at 
various companies, including Barchester 
Healthcare and Bioquell Plc. Tony chairs 
the Remuneration Committee.
Further information on our governance 
can be found on pages 56 to 92.
DIVIDEND
As indicated in our IPO prospectus, we intend 
to adopt a progressive dividend policy based 
on a payout ratio of around 20% of profit 
after taxation each financial year, in the 
approximate proportions of one-third 
interim and two-thirds final, respectively, 
of the total annual dividend.
Subject to shareholder approval, the 
Company will pay a final dividend in respect 
of the current financial year of 1.8 pence per 
ordinary share. 
PEOPLE
I would like, on behalf of the Board, to  
extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone  
at Spire Healthcare for their extraordinary 
performance during 2014. Of particular  
note was the role of the management  
team during the flotation process. The  
float was achieved during tricky market 
conditions, and under strict timeframes. 
Their dedication reflects the distinct  
culture at Spire and supports our value  
of driving excellence.
Our hospital staff continued to deliver 
excellent care throughout the year, 
illustrated by further improvement in our 
patient satisfaction scores. It is our culture, 
supported by our values, that enables us 
to continue to deliver to those that matter 
most – our patients.
THE FUTURE
Our results this year have been strong. We 
have further developed and strengthened 
our relationships with insurers and the NHS, 
and we are confident of continued growth 
across all our payors. The success of the IPO 
has been pleasing; there will be challenges 
ahead, but I know, with the great team we 
have in place, we can look forward to the 
future with confidence.
Garry Watts
Chairman
With the great 
team we have 
in place, we can 
look forward 
to the future 
with confidence.

Shareholder Information
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Spire has again delivered excellent results 
for its patients, consultants and, with 
its strong financial performance in 2014,  
its investors. With our dedicated staff,  
and experienced management team, 
a  track record of investment discipline 
and  a focus on increasing productivity, 
we are well placed to build on our 
position as a market leader. 
Chief Executive Officer’s statement 
A key part of the UK’s healthcare system
S
pire Healthcare aims to be the UK’s 
leading independent hospital group. 
In 2014, we delivered tailored, 
personalised care to over 260,000 
in-patient and daycase patients, an increase 
of 10.2% on the prior year. In total, including 
out-patient visits, we saw over 700,000 
patients. In June, our outstanding performance 
was recognised when Spire Healthcare was 
named Private Hospital Group of the Year at 
the 2014 HealthInvestor awards, the main 
awards for our industry.
PATIENT CARE – THE HEART  
OF OUR BUSINESS
We aim to deliver care and clinical outcomes 
of the highest quality for our patients. They 
are our first priority.
We had no incidents of MRSA and our  
MSSA and c.difficile infection rates, both  
at 0.30 per 10,000 bed days, were lower  
than the equivalent NHS rates of 0.79  
and 1.47 respectively.

Chief Executive Officer

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Across all our hospitals, our Care Quality 
Commission (CQC) compliance rate was 
99.5%, compared to an independent health 
sector average of 90% and a national average 
of 85%.
The outstanding quality of our care is 
reflected in our patient surveys, where 
93% of patients rated Spire as ‘Excellent’ or 
‘Very good’, and in our survey of Consultant 
satisfaction, where 79% rated us as 
‘Excellent’ or ‘Very good’ and 97% would 
recommend us to their friends and family. 
Our reputation is built on our clinical 
performance and these results are a 
testament to the leadership of our clinical 
team and the work of our staff. It is their 
skills, care and commitment, delivered day 
and night, that makes Spire what it is today.
Further details of our clinical performance 
can be found in the Clinical and Operating 
Reviews on pages 38 to 41, and a review of 
the Board’s Clinical Governance and Safety 
Committee’s oversight can be found on 
pages 70 to 71. 
STRONG PERFORMANCE
Overall revenue for the year grew 12.0% 
to £856.0 million (2013: £764.5 million), 
with positive contributions from all three of 
our major payor groups – PMI, self-pay and 
NHS. Even though we had a higher NHS mix, 
which traditionally has a lower margin, with 
continued productivity and cost-efficiency 
improvements, this growth generated 
an increase of 6.1% in Adjusted EBITDA 
to £159.2 million (2013: £150.0 million). 
Operating profit before exceptional 
items increased 2.7% to £114.1 million 
(2013: £111.1 million) and cash conversion 
reached 103.1%.
While we invested £105.1 million during 
the year across the business, including the 
acquisition of St Anthony’s Hospital, capital 
restructuring at the time of the IPO reduced 
net debt to £424.3 million at year end, with 
a further £100 million committed, undrawn 
loan facility, we are well positioned to invest 
in the next phase of our development.
Further details of our financial performance 
can be found in Simon Gordon’s financial 
review on pages 28 to 35. 
OUR YEAR IN BRIEF
Spire’s IPO in July 2014 marked a significant 
step forward in our corporate development. 
While the IPO involved considerable 
management time, the strength in depth of 
our team meant that the business continued 
to develop positively across all our areas of 
strategic focus. 
INVESTING IN OUR CORE BUSINESSES
Investment in increased capacity continued 
throughout the year.
Most significantly, in May, we completed 
the acquisition of St Anthony’s, a 92-bed, 
four theatre private hospital, located in 
Cheam. With room for further expansion, 
St Anthony’s will be a central platform 
for Spire’s continued growth in cardiology 
and other areas of acute care and is another 
step in our strategy to build services in and 
around Greater London. The acquisition 
received CMA approval in September. 
Spire Southampton Hospital’s new £2 million 
Perform sports medicine centre opened  
in June. Including the flagship facility at  
St George’s Park, we now have 10 Perform 
centres nationwide.
Also in June, Spire Cheshire Hospital opened 
a new Orthopaedic Centre, including 
on-site MRI and CT scanning and upgraded 
out-patient waiting areas, while Spire 
Cambridge Lea Hospital opened a new 
£1.4 million state-of-the-art reception 
and out-patient suite.
New operating theatres were opened at 
Spire Cardiff, Harpenden and South Bank 
hospitals in the year, significantly increasing 
our capacity in these hospitals.

DEVELOPING OUR SERVICE OFFERING
We continued to develop our higher 
acuity services, particularly in oncology 
and cardiology. 
Our first dedicated radiotherapy centre, the 
£13.1 million Specialist Care Centre in Bristol, 
opened in April and our £2.9 million cardiac 
catheterisation lab in Cardiff was completed 
in May. 
The launch of a new cataracts pathway 
enabled us to reduce the cost of treatment, 
with the result that 9.3% more patients were 
attracted to our facilities during the year.
We continue to offer fertility treatment at 
some of our hospitals, but in line with our 
strategic focus, we sold our interest in the 
standalone London Fertility Clinic in August.
We have taken steps to further strengthen 
our operational management, with the 
appointment of four Operations Directors, 
Rob Anderson, Karen Newton, Paul O’Conor 
and Nicola Amery, to replace the single role 
of Chief Operations Officer, formerly held 
by Andrew Gore. Further details of our 
operating performance can be found in 
my Operating Review on pages 40 and 41.
DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY 
STAKEHOLDERS
In November, we concluded a new,  
long-term agreement with Bupa, the UK’s 
leading private medical insurer. Following 
the conclusion of the CMA review of the 
independent healthcare sector, this 
represents a decisive shift to a more 
partnership-style approach, aiming to  
build on our current, excellent working 
relationship in order to drive volume  
growth in independent patient numbers, 
based on affordable healthcare, particularly 
for out-patients, and outstanding clinical 
outcomes. The agreement runs from  
1 April 2015 for a minimum of four years, 
with prices agreed for up to six years.
We are pursuing a range of development 
and engagement activities with our PMI 
and other stakeholders, more details of 
which can be found under Our Strategy 
on pages 18 to 21.
REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE
In October 2014, the CMA published its Final 
Order for measures to increase competition 
in the independent healthcare market after 
its inquiry. We welcomed the recognition 
that there needs to be transparency of 
arrangements between hospitals and 
consultants, and support the drive to 
establish an industry-wide information 
organisation to be the repository for quality 
indicators and measures. We fully support 
initiatives that help patients and GPs feel 
confident when choosing their healthcare 
provider and we continue to work with our 
consultants to implement the Final Order.
In March 2014, we published the findings of 
a report by independent consultancy Verita 
into the work of consultant surgeon Mr Ian 
Paterson at our Spire Little Aston and 
Parkway Hospitals. We commissioned the 
report in April 2013 following a separate 
NHS review into Mr Paterson’s work on 
breast cancer patients. 
The report criticised us for failing to monitor 
Mr Paterson’s work properly and for our 
handling of subsequent complaints. 
I immediately gave a full and unreserved 
apology to all of the patients and their 
families for any distress they suffered as 
a result of their treatment by Mr Paterson 
while he was a surgeon at our hospitals, and 
committed Spire to reviewing our processes 
in order to ensure that such a situation could 
never happen again.

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 OPEN TO EVERYONE
The overall UK healthcare market is subject 
to three major trends – our growing and 
ageing population, the increasing incidence 
of acute and chronic long-term conditions, 
and the continued development of new, 
often expensive, technologies and treatments. 
These factors contribute to independent 
forecasts of growth in healthcare demand 
exceeding 5% a year over the next five years. 
Set against realistic forecasts of GDP and 
public funding growth, the NHS projects a 
growing supply and funding gap that could 
reach approximately £35bn per annum 
by 2020-2021. 
We cannot provide the whole answer, but 
the independent healthcare sector is in a 
position to help meet this demand, working 
with the NHS, as part of the overall UK 
healthcare system.
STRATEGY 
Our strategy is based on four pillars. 
First, we will continue to focus on our 
relationships with each of our three major 
payor groups – PMI, self-pay and the NHS 
– developing targeted responses to their 
individual requirements. 
Second, we will leverage and develop our 
existing well-invested and scalable hospitals, 
maximising existing capacity and opening 
new theatres to meet growing demand. 
We will continue to build relationships 
with our patients, their referring GPs and 
the consultants who provide treatment 
in our hospitals. 
Third, we will develop new sites and services, 
targeting identified growth areas such 
as radiotherapy and cancer care, but also 
orthopaedics, cardiac and general surgery, 
and acquiring or building new hospitals 
in areas where Spire is underrepresented, 
including London.
Fourth, we will continue to drive productivity 
improvement and cost management, both 
centrally and locally.
Our strategy is already delivering across all 
these pillars. In line with best practice for 
public company strategic reporting, further 
details follow my review. We include an 
analysis of our market, our business model, 
more detail of our strategy in action and 
the key performance indicators (KPIs) 
we use to judge our progress. 
OUTLOOK – A PICTURE OF HEALTH
As I said at the time of our IPO and in 
subsequent meetings with shareholders 
and potential investors, I believe that Spire 
is ideally positioned for its next phase of 
development, ready to capture a growing 
share of the UK’s expanding independent 
healthcare market and provide much 
needed additional capacity in areas 
such as radiotherapy and cancer care. 
We have a strong track record of investment 
and growth, based on a culture of clinical 
excellence and care that is highly valued 
by consultants, GPs, payors and patients. 
We are well capitalised and able to fund 
further service and geographical growth. 
And we have a clear strategy in place, 
focused on meeting the requirements 
of all of our stakeholders.
Supported by Spire’s outstanding team, 
I look forward to an exciting future.

Investment plan for Spire  
St Anthony’s Hospital
Located in Cheam, only seven miles  
from London Bridge, the acquisition  
of Spire St Anthony’s Hospital is 
part of our strategy to extend Spire’s 
coverage in and around London.
Founded in 1904 by the Daughters 
of the Cross of Liege, St Anthony’s is 
a 92-bed, four theatre hospital, with an 
eight bed ITU. Skilled and dedicated staff 
are able to deliver high-quality healthcare 
in a calm and peaceful environment.
We acquired St Anthony’s in 2014 
as part of our London development 
strategy and, following CMA approval, 
have commenced an integration and 
development programme. Spire protocols, 
administration and procurement are 
already improving efficiency.
A £27 million investment plan, including 
six new state-of-the-art theatres, will 
provide additional facilities for complex

Shareholder Information Our market
The main provider for primary, 
secondary and tertiary care 
throughout the country is the 
NHS – in 2013–2014, in England, 
its budget was £95.6 billion; 
in Wales, £5.8 billion and, 
in Scotland, £10.7 billion. 
Spire’s principal market is  
private acute healthcare,  
worth, as a sector, an estimated 
£7 .17 billion in 2013, according  
to LaingBuisson. This figure 
includes fees paid to consultants, 
as well as to private providers 
such as Spire.
THE FUNDING GAP
Public spending on the NHS has increased 
faster than general inflation for decades, 
from 3.5% of GDP in the year after its 
establishment, to 7 .9% in the last year 
before the financial crisis. 
Since then, NHS funding has tightened.  
In the absence of significant tax increases  
or non-healthcare spending cuts, funding 
constraints are forecast to continue 
throughout the next parliament.
At the same time, the King’s Fund reports 
that the population of England, Scotland 
and Wales will grow by some five million 
over the next decade and the population 
of those aged 65 and over will grow by 
nearly half by 2032*. 
* Source: Office for National Statistics.
As the population ages, the incidence of 
long-term and chronic conditions is also 
expected to rise.
As a result of these, and other factors,  
NHS England expects a funding gap between 
healthcare demand and projected NHS 
budgets of £30–35 billion per annum by 
2020–2021. 
To put that in context, funding £30 billion 
equates to approximately 5.5 pence on VAT 
or 7 pence on the basic rate of income tax.
Bridging this gap presents an opportunity  
for the independent sector, given its capacity 
to provide capital, to play an increasing  
role in an integrated, multi-provider 
healthcare system.
The total UK healthcare market was estimated  
by the Office for National Statistics to be worth  
£144 billion in 2012.

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 PAYORS
Private healthcare in the UK has three 
main payors – PMI, self-pay and the NHS. 
PMI
The PMI market is dominated by four 
providers, Bupa, AXA, Aviva and Vitality 
(formally PruHealth), which, together 
account for over 87% of the market. Their 
revenues are split between ‘Corporate’, a 
benefit provided to employees by employers, 
which accounted for an estimated 78% 
of the total in 2012 (LaingBuisson) and 
‘Individual’, that is, PMI taken out by private 
individuals, which makes up the balance. 
Altogether LaingBuisson estimates 10.8% of 
the UK population, equivalent to 6,890,000 
people, had PMI in 2012.
PMI provides almost half of UK private 
hospital revenues and, historically, growth 
in lives covered has roughly tracked growth 
in GDP , linked to corporate performance 
and personal incomes. The number of 
people covered by PMI declined slightly 
in the recession after 2008, but is forecast 
to grow as the economic recovery 
gathers momentum. 
The individual PMI market, largely retirees 
from corporate schemes, has proved to 
be price-sensitive and has declined as 
a proportion of the market since the 
mid- 1990s. Private medical insurers 
are responding to pressure for increased 
affordability, negotiating keener prices from 
suppliers and consultants, and developing 
‘white label’ self-pay products such as Bupa 
On Demand.
SELF-PAY 
Patients without medical insurance are 
increasingly paying for private medical 
treatment themselves. Historically, this 
growth has been disproportionately 
attributed to the purchase of cosmetic , 
cardiac and orthopaedic procedures, but 
there is emerging evidence that the self-pay 
sector of the market will continue to grow 
as people choose to pay for other procedures 
and treatments.
Factors driving growth include: increasing 
NHS waiting times; constraints imposed by 
NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) 
on the reimbursement of some procedures; 
the price and level of exclusions applied to 
traditional PMI products; the development 
of more affordable and fixed price offerings, 
and greater awareness and changing 
perceptions of self-pay medical care. 
NHS 
The NHS uses the independent acute 
medical sector extensively to meet capacity 
needs and waiting time targets. Between 
2004 and 2012 inclusive, NHS spending on 
independent sector acute medical care more 
than quadrupled, reaching some £1.2 billion 
in 2012 (LaingBuisson). NHS England figures 
show over 100,000 patients being admitted 
to independent sector hospitals in the last 
quarter of 2013 alone, with a further 160,000 
GP referrals of NHS patients for independent 
sector out-patient appointments over the 
same period. 
NHS patients are treated in the independent 
sector in England under the Any Qualified 
Provider patient choice provisions introduced 
in 2007–2008 and facilitated by the online 
Choose and Book portal, or through local 
hospitals and CCGs contracting for demand 
and waiting list management. 
The NHS’s Payment by Results system is 
based on nationally determined currencies 
and tariffs for treatments, modified 
to reflect differences in regional costs, 
but applied equally to public and private 
healthcare providers. 
OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS
The private acute medical sector is made up 
of hospitals and clinics owned and operated 
by a variety of companies and voluntary 
organisations, together with private patient 
units (PPUs) and pay beds within the NHS.
Spire’s principal competitors are: HCA 
Holdings, Inc (Hospital Corporation of 
America), whose seven hospitals are 
concentrated in London, where it is the main 
provider; BMI Healthcare, owned by General 
Healthcare Group Ltd and, in turn, by listed 
South African hospital group Netcare Ltd 
and Apax Partners LLP; Nuffield Health, a 
not-for-profit provider; and Ramsay Health 
Care UK, the UK subsidiary of an Australian 
international healthcare group, which 
handles a particularly high proportion 
of NHS work.

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 The patient pathway to treatment in a private hospital
The Group receives patients 
through multiple routes. 
The patient’s journey typically 
begins with a visit to their 
GP , who will either treat the 
patient directly or provide 
a referral to a consultant. 
The procedure or treatment 
provided by the consultant 
can be funded by the NHS, 
a PMI provider or by the 
patient directly (referred 
to as ‘self-pay’). 
The Group accepts patients 
using all three funding methods: 
Group hospitals may obtain 
referrals for patients who 
cannot be accommodated 
at local NHS T rusts (NHS 
local contract) or through 
the NHS ‘‘Choose and Book’’ 
system, and PMI and self-pay 
patients can obtain a private 
consultation where they are 
referred to a Group hospital.
Below is a simplified illustration 
of a patient’s potential  
journey through the private 
healthcare system.
Our key relationships are 
with the referrers (GPs and 
consultants), the payors 
(PMI providers, self-pay 
and the NHS) and, of course, 
our patients and staff.

Our strategy aims to build value by offering a wider 
range of treatments, more efficiently, to an increasing 
number of patients.
1.  T o drive strong growth through  
a clear focus on our three payor groups
PMI
• Deepen our relationships with  
key insurers
• Increase and deepen our relationships 
with GPs as referrers
• Continue to expand our higher acuity 
healthcare offer 
OUR PROGRESS
• We have contracts in place with all the 
main PMIs. In 2014, we agreed a new 
contract with Bupa, our largest PMI 
partner, to run from April 2015 for a 
minimum of four years, with prices 
agreed for the next six years, through  
to March 2021 
• We will seek similar agreements with 
our other PMI providers, aimed at 
offering improved cost effectiveness 
• In January 2014, April UK launched 
‘inSpire’, a bespoke Spire-based health 
insurance plan that combines high-
quality healthcare with exceptional 
value for money 
Self-pay
• Continue to engage with GPs, particularly 
regarding areas of NHS service constraint
• Extend transparent pricing and  
quality reporting
• Increase brand awareness
OUR PROGRESS
• We are developing simple and transparent 
packages, and offering patients procedures 
not readily funded by the NHS
• We have introduced fixed prices for our top 
15 procedures – and plan to extend this to 
at least 50 procedures – all supported by 
clear ‘plain English’ terms and conditions 
• We started TV advertising in seven regions 
during 2014 to build brand awareness and 
increase enquiries. Results will feed into 
future marketing plans
NHS
• Continue to build key NHS relationships
• Expand our service offering 
• Invest to meet specific NHS needs
OUR PROGRESS
• Our hospitals provide solutions for NHS 
trusts to manage waiting lists, taking 
elective patients out of overstretched 
hospitals and helping the NHS improve 
value and deliver better outcomes 
• Our hospital directors develop close 
working relationships with CCGs in 
order to respond to local commissioning 
priorities – for example, Spire Hull and 
East Riding Hospital was asked by local 
commissioners to provide a chronic pain 
infusion service. The purchase of three 
additional infusion pumps and the 
development of a specialist team of 
pain consultant anaesthetists and 
nurses at the hospital has seen NHS 
treatments at the Pain Management 
Unit rise 74% between 2012 and 2014

Every two minutes, someone in the UK 
is diagnosed with cancer.* 
The NHS provides treatment for a wide 
range of cancers, but the incidence of 
cancer, and the demand for treatment, 
continues to rise. 
We already work with Cancer Partners 
UK in the running of four specialist 
centres and offer chemotherapy in 21 of 
our 39 hospitals, but, in 2014, we opened 
our first wholly owned, purpose-built, 
radiotherapy centre, close to our hospital 
in Bristol.
The Specialist Care Centre hosts a 
state-of-the-art Linear Accelerator (LinAc), 
offering Intensity Modulated, Volumetric 
Modulated Arc therapy, and Image 
Guided Radiotherapy treatment. Its 
success shows that private provision 
can play a key role in the future of UK 
cancer treatment. 
In December 2014, we announced plans 
for our second cancer treatment centre, 
in Great Baddow near Chelmsford, 
Essex. The facility will house two LinAcs, 
a wide-bore CT scanner, consultant 
offices and consulting rooms, and an 
eight bay chemotherapy suite. 
* Cancer Research UK.
Radiotherapy is a highly effective way 
of treating cancer, yet the UK trails the 
rest of Europe in its use and it remains 
relatively undersupplied in the NHS, with 
just 5.2 LinAcs per million of population.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Financial review
A strong financial performance in 2014 
Good revenue growth was maintained,  
up £91.5 million in the year (+ 12% on 2013),  
with growth in revenue across all payor 
groups, flowing through to increased profits. 
Operating cash flow conversion was strong 
and net debt is at a level that positions  
the Group well for future investments.
T
he Company was admitted to the 
London Stock Exchange on 23 July 
2014 and, therefore, these results 
cover the period both prior to and 
following Admission. The IPO generated 
cash proceeds of £306.9 million net of costs, 
which, combined with a restructuring of 
existing shareholder interests in the Group 
and the refinancing of the bank facilities, 
served to reduce overall Group indebtedness. 
These events fundamentally impacted the 
capital structure of the Group materially 
reducing its net funding costs. Therefore, 
various adjustments have been made to 
normalise the results for the year to reflect 
the new Group financing structure, the 
shares issued on IPO and to eliminate 
one-off exceptional costs, such as 
the costs associated with the IPO.

31 December 2013 to £432.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2014. Underlying growth, excluding revenues relating to  
Spire St Anthony’s Hospital, was 1.4%.
Of the underlying growth of 1.4% in PMI revenues:
•  the decrease in the volumes of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 1.0% decline in revenues;
•  the rate increase in in-patient and daycase (average revenue per case) accounted for a 1.3% increase in revenues and offset the decline 
in volume; and
•  growth in out-patient revenues accounted for a further 1.1% increase, including an increase in minor procedures undertaken in out-patient 
treatment rooms which would previously have been undertaken in theatre.
The growth in rate was adversely impacted by an increase in the proportion of surgical cases treated as daycases. These procedures carry 
a lower revenue per case than in-patient admissions. Revenue per case of in-patient admissions increased by 6.4% relative to the prior year, 
supported by an increase in the complexity of surgical procedures undertaken. The average revenue per daycase admission increased 
by 2.2% in the year.

31 December 2013 to £245.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2014. Underlying growth, excluding revenues relating to Spire 
St Anthony’s Hospital, was 27 .3%.
Of the underlying growth of 27 .3% in NHS revenues:
•  a significant increase in surgical admissions accounted for a 19.9% increase in revenues;
•  the rate increase in in-patient and daycase (average revenue per case) accounted for a 2.6% increase in revenues, notwithstanding a 2.25% 
decline in attributable NHS tariff in the year; and
•  growth in out-patient revenues accounted for a further 4.8% increase in revenues in the year.
In 2013, the in-patient and daycase rate was adversely impacted by a temporary reduction in case mix complexity arising from the transition 
in April 2013 of local NHS Commissioning to Clinical Commissioning Groups, as a result of the Health and Social Care Act. The year ended 
31 December 2014 benefited from both the absence of similar effects and an increase in local contract NHS work, typically more complex 
procedures attracting a higher average revenue per case.

Of the underlying growth of 7 .4% in self-pay revenues:
•  an increase in surgical admissions accounted for a 6.8% increase in revenues;
•  in-patient and daycase (average revenue per case) accounted for a 0.8% decline in revenues; and
•  growth in out-patient revenues accounted for a 1.4% increase in revenues in the year.
Revenue per case for in-patient admissions increased by 1.6% and by 1.5% per daycase admission; however, daycase admissions accounted 
for 59% of total admissions, up from 57% in the previous year.
From the beginning of 2012 until early 2013, the Group benefited from a significant number of hip revision procedures associated with a 
patient recall undertaken by DePuy. These revision procedures were highly complex and priced at a substantial premium to average self-pay 
procedures. The absence of similar work in 2014 had an adverse impact on rates achieved overall and masked a positive rate improvement 
in underlying recurring case mix.
OTHER REVENUE
Other revenue, which includes fees paid to the Group by consultants (e.g for the use of Group facilities and services) and third-party revenues 
(e.g pathology services to third parties), increased by £5.1 million, or 19.2%, in the year, from £26.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 
to £31.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT 
Cost of sales increased in the year by £54.5 million, or 14.3%, from £382.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to £436.6 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
Underlying cost of sales, excluding £10.5 million relating to Spire St Anthony’s Hospital, increased in the period by £44.0 million, or 11.5%, 
from £382.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to £426.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
Underlying gross margin for the year of 2014 was 49.1%, compared to 50.0% in 2013. 
Gross margin has been adversely impacted by a reduction of 3% in NHS tariff applicable to the 2013–2014 fiscal year and a further 2.25% NHS 
tariff reduction applicable from 1 April 2014 for the 2014–2015 fiscal year and by a higher proportion of revenues from the NHS in 2014 than 
in 2013. Some of this impact has been mitigated by improved operating efficiency in the period.
Underlying clinical staff costs, as a percentage of revenues, reduced by 0.1% to 17 .4% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014, as 
compared to 31 December 2013. Underlying direct costs of prostheses, drugs and consumables, as a percentage of revenues, increased from 
21.3% for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 22.1% in 2014. This was due to a significant increase in NHS orthopaedic and ophthalmology 
surgical activity in the period and a general increase in in-patient case complexity across specialties, relative to 2013.
Underlying medical fees payable to consultant surgeons and anaesthetists for services performed in connection with NHS patients grew as 
a consequence of the increase in NHS activity in the year. Medical fees for NHS work increased from 5.2% of total revenues in 2013 to 5.8% of 
total revenues in 2014; however, as a consequence of the continued focus on cost management, these fees reduced as a percentage of NHS 
revenues, from 20.7% in 2013 to 20.0% in 2014.
Other fees payable to consultants for out-patient and diagnostic activities reduced as a percentage of revenues, from 6.0% in 2013 to 5.7%  
in 2014.
OTHER OPERATING COSTS 
Other operating costs for the year ended 31 December 2014 increased by £76.5 million, or 27 .1%, from £282.8 million for the year ended  
31 December 2013 to £359.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Underlying other operating costs, excluding £8.6 million relating to Spire St Anthony’s Hospital, increased in the period by £67 .9 million, 
or 24.0%, from £282.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to £350.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Included within these costs are exceptional costs of £11.5 million for 2013 and £54.0 million for 2014 relating to the business reorganisation, 
corporate restructuring and regulatory and governance costs. Before exceptional items, underlying operating costs increased by £25.4 million, 
or 9.4%, from £271.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to £296.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 on revenue growth 
of 9.5% in the year.
DEPRECIATION
Excluding £0.7 million relating to Spire St Anthony’s Hospital, the charge for depreciation for the year ended 31 December 2014 has increased 
by £1.4 million, or 3.3%, relative to 2013, to £44.4 million. Overall, depreciation arising from capital expenditure in 2014 and the acquisition 
of St Anthony’s, have offset the full year impact on depreciation of reductions in the fixed asset base from the sale in January 2013 of 12 
hospital properties, subject to long leases (‘2013 Freehold Sale’), and of the sale and leaseback of the Spire Washington Hospital premises 
in March 2014.

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 RENT
Rent of land and buildings for the year, excluding £0.1 million relating to Spire St Anthony’s Hospital, increased by £5.7 million, or 10.4%, to 
£60.6 million. The increase is largely the consequence of the annualised impact of the 2013 Freehold Sale (£2.2 million in the year), the first 
annual indexation of rental costs associated with the 2013 Freehold Sale (£1.3 million in the year) and the commencement of rent following 
the sale, subject to lease, of the Spire Washington Hospital, which was concluded on 11 March 2014 with a starting rent of £2.3 million per 
year (£1.9 million in the year). The impact on comparatives will not normalise until the end of the first quarter of 2015.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS
Since Admission, 2.7 million share options comprising of 1.7 million Directors’ Share Bonus Award and 1.0 million Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) have been awarded to executive directors and members of the senior management team. These are conditional on certain market 
and other performance conditions being fulfilled. Further details are contained in note 28 on page 120 of the financial statements. 
The charge to the income statement in the year was £2.8 million (£3.7 million inclusive of NI), of which £2.5 million (£3.4 million inclusive of

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA
EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2014 increased by £5.1 million, or 3.3%, from £154.1 million to £159.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA 
increased by 6.1%, from £150.0 million to £159.2 million (2013 EBITDA adjusted to include £4.1 million rental costs, to include these costs on 
the same basis as for 2014, following the 2013 Freehold Sale and the sale, subject to lease, of the Spire Washington Hospital in March 2014).
OPERATING PROFITS BEFORE AND AFTER EXCEPTIONAL COSTS
Operating profit after exceptional costs decreased by 39.7% in the year to £60.1 million. Before exceptional costs, operating profits increased 
by 2.7%, from £111.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to £114.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The profit on disposal of £18.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 relates principally to the sale of the freehold land and buildings 
of Spire Washington Hospital. The profit in the prior year of £44.2 million relates principally to the profit on the 2013 Freehold Sale.
FINANCE COSTS 
Finance costs in the year include those incurred in respect of borrowings drawn under the capital structure of the Group prior to Admission. 
On Admission, borrowings reduced significantly and, therefore, finance costs also reduced. 
Finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2014, before exceptional finance costs, totalled £85.9 million, a reduction of £68.0 million or 
44.2% over the prior year. This reduction mainly comprises £35.9 million of interest on shareholder debt and £32.1 million on bank loans, net  
of the mark-to-market movement on interest rate swap instruments settled on Admission. Had the finance structure as effected on Admission 
been in place throughout the 2014 financial year, finance costs (before exceptional items) would have further reduced by £65.2 million to  
£20.7 million.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, exceptional finance costs of £42.2 million arose from the 2013 Freehold Sale and relate to interest rate 
swaps being recycled to the income statement as they no longer met the criteria for hedge accounting, net of the early settlement discounts 
arising on the repayment of bank borrowings.
TAXATION
The taxation credit for the year ended 31 December 2014 consisted of a £13.7 million credit for deferred tax and a charge of £0.7 million 
for corporation tax.
The UK corporation tax charge on 2014 profits was £nil (2013:£ nil), reflecting the significant allowable costs arising from the Listing, 
including the settlement of out-of-the-money interest rate swaps. The UK corporation tax charge in the income statement is an adjustment 
to prior years. 
The credit for deferred taxation for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £13.7 million, comprising deferred tax assets previously 
unrecognised, in relation to losses carried forward following the reorganisation of the Spire Group into a single tax group. The credit for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 relates predominantly to the release of deferred tax liabilities associated with fixed assets disposed of as part 
of the 2013 Freehold Sale.

PROFIT AFTER TAXATION
The profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £6.0 million, compared with a profit after taxation for the year ended  
31 December 2013 of £102.2 million. The profit on assets sold as part of the 2013 Freehold Sale and the consequent release of associated 
deferred tax liabilities substantially contributed to the result for 2013.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
Adjusted EPS (after eliminating exceptional items, profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment, and adjusting for the effects of the 
capital restructuring on the IPO) was 18.3 pence per share.

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 OPERATING CASHFLOWS
The cash inflow from operating activities before exceptional items for the year was £164.2 million, which constitutes a cash conversion rate 
from Adjusted EBITDA for the year of 103.1% (2013: £111.2 million or 74.1%). The net cash inflow from movements in working capital in the 
year is £4.0 million, a significant improvement on that reported for the year ended 31 December 2013.
INVESTING AND FINANCING CASHFLOWS
Net cash used in investing activities for the year is £70.0 million, which includes the acquisition of Spire St Anthony’s Hospital in May 2014 for  
£38.5 million and other capital expenditure of £66.6 million, offset by the proceeds from the disposal of the freehold interest (subject to lease) 
in Spire Washington Hospital and the disposal of a fertility business, totalling £34.8 million, and interest received of £0.3 million. Capital 
expenditure comprises the completion of the radiotherapy centre in Bristol, new theatres in Harpenden and South Bank, the completion 
of a cardiac catheterisation laboratory and theatre in Cardiff, MRI at Clare Park and a major reconfiguration and development of facilities 
in Tunbridge Wells, including investment in out-patient areas and static MRI and CT machines at this hospital.
Net cash generated from investing activities for the year ended 31 December 2013 was £647 .1 million, including proceeds from the 2013 
Freehold Sale.
Net cash used in financing activities of £80.0 million comprises net proceeds from the issue of shares of £306.9 million, the net repayment 
of bank debt after cash raised from new borrowings of £345.6 million and interest paid of £41.3 million. 
On Admission, 150,100,341 new ordinary shares were issued by the Company, which generated cash proceeds of £306.9 million. The proceeds, 
combined with a restructuring of existing shareholder interests in the Group and the refinancing of the bank facilities, served to reduce overall 
Group indebtedness and materially reduce the net funding costs of the Group.
In the prior year, in January 2013, the Group completed the £704.0 million 2013 Freehold Sale, the net proceeds of which were used to  
repay debt.
BORROWINGS
At 31 December 2014, the Group has bank debt of £422.2 million, drawn under facilities which mature in 2019 and finance lease debt 
of £76.6 million. Additionally, the Group has a revolving loan facility of £100.0 million available until July 2019, which was undrawn at 
31 December 2014.

NEW CAPACITY  
TO MEET DEMAND
Building within the current hospital, together with 
extended parking, means easy access for our patients to all 
wards, theatres and patient areas. We’re well positioned 
now to treat even more of our local population.
WHERE ARE WE? 
Spire Harpenden Hospital 
Open to everyone
Strategic Report Over the last three decades, Spire 
Harpenden Hospital has grown from  
a small local hospital, with fewer than  
30 beds, to become the largest private 
hospital in North Hertfordshire. Demand, 
particularly from local NHS trusts, 
commissioners and through NHS 
Choose and Book, continues to grow.
By 2013, theatre utilisation was up to 
76% and the hospital was beginning 
to face pinch points in theatre and 
consultant capacity.
An additional theatre, incorporating 
laminar flow and laparoscopic capability, 
an enhanced recovery area and a further 
seven-bedded ward were opened in 
September, and a fully refurbished  
main reception area was opened 
in February 2015. 
Harpenden now has 79 beds, five main 
theatres, an endoscopy theatre and 
extensive digital X-ray, mammography, 
ultrasound, CT and MRI facilities. 
Following the new investment, theatre 
utilisation is 60% and the hospital now 
has capacity for future growth.
Planned to a 5cm tolerance, Spire 
Harpenden Hospital’s new theatre 
block was craned into position within 
the existing hospital complex. The use 
of off-site modular construction enabled 
this nine month, £5 million development 
to be completed with the loss of only one  
day’s operation.

Clinical review
Dr Jean-Jacques de Gorter 
Group Medical Director 
While the transition to becoming a public 
company was an important milestone for 
Spire in 2014, we worked hard to ensure 
that the process did not distract us from 
our primary purpose – delivering safe and 
effective care for our patients. It is pleasing, 
therefore, that we continued to make 
improvements in clinical performance and 
that we were able to put in place a number 
of developments that will stand Spire in 
good stead for the future.
CLINICAL PERFORMANCE
For the second year running, there was not a 
single case of MRSA bacteraemia reported by 
our hospitals. In addition, cases of C. difficile 
fell by 41%, year-on-year, and surgical site 
infections following hip and knee replacement 
surgery remained low. We report hospital 
acquired infection data (MRSA, MSSA, 
E-coli bacteraemia and Clostridium Difficile 
infection) to Public Health England and 
participate in the surveillance programme 
for hip and knee replacement surgical site 
infection. Our rates compare favourably 
with published national averages.
In terms of treatment effectiveness, in 
2014, we reported the lowest-ever rate 
of unplanned patient transfers and 
readmissions. This is a testament to the  
care and attention to detail shown by  
our clinical teams. Good teamwork, robust 
and up-to-date care pathways, and a 
Our Group Medical Director,  
Dr Jean-Jacques de Gorter, 
is responsible for defining 
our clinical governance and 
quality strategy and his team 
audit, monitor and report on 
our quality performance. In 
addition, the Clinical Services 
team supports our hospitals 
to comply with relevant 
healthcare regulations across 
England, Scotland and Wales.

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 willingness to challenge, together create  
the platform for reliable and high-quality 
care within our hospitals.
Nursing teams are able to call upon over 120 
procedure-specific clinical care pathways. 
Clinical care pathways are standardised 
across all our 39 hospitals and are printed 
off individually to form part of each patient’s 
medical records. The pathways set out the 
routine activities that must be completed 
pre and post-operatively and contribute 
to a successful clinical outcome. 
We monitor compliance with our pathways 
by auditing approximately 1,000 records 
every month and reporting our findings 
every quarter. Hospital compliance with key 
nursing processes – such as use of the Early 
Warning Score, venous thromboembolism 
risk (VTE) assessment and the assessment 
of post-operative pain – remains 
exceptionally high. 
We are not complacent and will continue to 
focus on compliance with our care pathways 
and processes.
Our hospitals undertake a considerable 
volume of elective surgery, including many 
complex cases. It is, therefore, particularly 
significant that post-operative mortality 
within 31 days of surgery fell by over 10% 
year-on-year.
Over the past four years, our hospitals 
have been working to improve processes 
for patient discharge and the planning 
necessary to ensure this is undertaken 
in a calm and efficient manner. Patient 
satisfaction with discharge processes 
increased for the fourth year in a row, 
making this the greatest improving 
satisfaction measure over this period.
As we develop and broaden our cancer 
treatment facilities, it is important that 
we support them with modern technology 
and working practices, including ensuring 
that treatment decisions are considered 
and agreed by a multi-disciplinary team. 
In 2014, we launched a transformation 
programme to facilitate these discussions 
and for the effectiveness of treatment 
recommendation to be recorded consistently. 
In time, we expect to publish our performance 
in this regard in order to enable patients to 
make more informed choices regarding their 
cancer treatment, as more and more options 
become available.
SAFETY CULTURE
At the end of 2014, we undertook our first 
Safety Culture survey, based on one used 
by the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality (AHRQ) in the US. This is helping us 
to understand the importance of systems 
and processes, as well as culture and 
leadership, when trying to make care safer 
for patients. All employees and bank workers 
in our hospitals, pathology network, Lifescan, 
mobile imaging and Perform at St George’s 
Park were invited to take part. In summary, 
Spire achieved a rating of 71%, compared 
with the external benchmark of 63%. 
While we were pleased to achieve a score 
above the benchmark, we see this as only 
the first step in reinforcing safety as being 
central to our patient offering. We will 
continue to monitor our culture in this 
way on an annual basis.
Our clinical teams are justifiably proud 
of their care and professionalism. Strong 
clinical systems and processes create a 
stable foundation to build on, supported by 
a healthy culture that values and prioritises 
safety and clinical quality. We will continue 
to learn from the unexpected events 
that will always occur. In terms of clinical 
performance, it is my view that Spire is well 
positioned to continue to deliver excellent 
care to increasing numbers of patients, 
with evermore complex needs. 
We continued to make improvements  
in clinical performance.

PERFORMANCE IN 2014
Together with clinical indicators, we monitor 
our performance through a range of regular 
surveys of our patients, consultants, GPs  
and staff.
Patient satisfaction levels continued to 
increase in 2014, overall quality of service 
rated ‘excellent’ and ‘very good’ rose 1% 
to 93% and the proportion of patients 
who would ‘definitely’ or be ‘very likely’ 
to recommend Spire to their friends 
and family also rose 1% to 88%. 
The proportion of consultants who 
believe that our hospitals go out of their 
way to make a difference to their working 
relationship remained at 96% and those who 
would be ‘very’ or ‘fairly likely’ to choose a 
Spire hospital for their own treatment was 
constant at 94%. 
Surveyed in April 2014, the proportion of 
GPs who rated their satisfaction with Spire’s 
service as ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ dipped 
1% to 90%, while the ease of referring 
patients to Spire remained at 99%.
Our 2014 Staff Engagement Survey attracted 
a 74% response rate. The response rate was 
impacted slightly by the introduction of our 
new Staff Culture survey, which ran at the 
same time. 
Further details of Staff Engagement Survey 
can be found in Our People, the section 
that follows this review, on page 42. 
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
During 2014, there were Care Quality 
Commission (CQC) standard inspections 
at 18 of our locations in England and all 
standards have since been met. 
Spire Southampton Hospital was chosen to 
be part of the pilot programme for the new 
style of CQC inspection in October 2014. The 
hospital received a detailed report, which 
was published on the CQC website, but, as 
it was part of the pilot, it was not officially 
rated as per the CQC recommendations – 
reinspection is due to take place in 2015. 
Healthcare Inspectorate Wales inspected 
our two Welsh hospitals – Cardiff and Yale 
– in 2014. Both were approved with only 
minor actions listed.
Healthcare Improvement Scotland inspected 
our Murrayfield and Shawfair Park hospitals 
– grades achieved were six outcomes in 
the ‘very good’ category and four in the 
‘good’ category. 
OPERATIONAL EXPANSION
In a year that saw the acquisition of 
St Anthony’s Hospital, the opening of 
Bristol’s Specialist Care Centre, new theatres 
in Worcester and Harpenden, and the 
opening of the cardiac catheterisation lab 
in Cardiff, operational challenges centred 
on recruitment, staffing and supply chain 
integration. It is pleasing to report that 
all these facilities are operating ahead 
of expectations and that the integration 
of Spire St Anthony’s Hospital is 
progressing well.
More details on Spire St Anthony’s Hospital 
can be found on pages 10 and 11, on the 
Specialist Care Centre on pages 22 and 23 
and on the expansion of Spire Harpenden 
Hospital on pages 36 and 37 . 
IMPROVING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY
Balancing the advantages of our national 
scale and reach with the requirements 
of individual, local hospital accountability, 
we seek to maximise margins through 
operational efficiency.
We seek to deliver clinical excellence as 
efficiently as possible. T o do this, we listen to

insurers, commissioners), to our staff and to 
our suppliers.

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Theatre utilisation is a key performance 
indicator. While theatre use is demand-
driven, sharing operational best practice  
can optimise capacity. Average utilisation 
increased to 64% from 61% across all our 
hospitals in 2014 (based on maximum 
2,850 hours per year, i.e. 10 hours per 
weekday and seven hours per Saturday, 
250 weekdays and 50 Saturdays per year).
Scope for further improvement remains 
– some 14 of our hospitals are currently 
running below 60% utilisation. 
Throughout 2014, we continued to focus on 
our supply chain and maximising efficiencies 
that support improving patient care. 
Our in-house procurement and supply chain 
model is based at our in NDC in Droitwich. 
In 2014, we delivered over 1.2 million product 
lines to our hospitals with a value of around 
£50 million. The central procurement team 
continues to generate cost savings.
One aspect of our supply chain and 
procurement improvement is the 
development and supply from the NDC 
of hospital-specific medical consumable 
procedure packs that contain all the 
medical consumables required for specific 
procedures. In addition to specification 
modifications and negotiated component 
cost savings, bespoke clinical procedure 
kits meet the exact requirement of each 
Spire hospital, enabling faster response and 
procedure set-up times, improving infection 
control and reducing waste and packaging.
During 2015, we plan to link the supply of 
clinical procedure kits to our SAP enterprise 
resource planning system. This will be part 
of ongoing developments within our IT 
offering, as we further embed SAP across 
the supply chain. 
We began rolling out our SAP system in 
2012 and had fully implemented it across all 
platforms by April 2013. In 2014, we achieved 
full NHS compliance and accreditation for 
integration and use on Choose and Book.
The benefit of an integrated patient, 
financial and warehousing (supply chain 
and stock control) system, which our 
staff and consultants find easy to use, 
is being seen in improved management 
information, cost savings and streamlined 
administration processes.
During 2015, SAP enhancements will 
be largely targeted at improving patient 
experience by the implementation of CRM 
and the expansion of the current direct 
booking capability for insurers and self-pay 
patients. There is also a major ‘Purchase 2 
Pay’ initiative, which, it is hoped, will produce 
major cost savings by improving the 
management of stock across the business 
and a further initiative to provide automated 
NHS discharge information for GPs. 
We continuously seek to improve our 
engineering governance and compliance 
processes across our facilities. Estates and 
engineering audits, including feedback 
reports covering hard facilities management 
services, were completed at all hospitals 
during 2014, helping to ensure that all 
hospitals are operating in line with Spire 
policy and discharging their statutory 
responsibilities.
We monitor and prioritise investment in 
the upgrade of our infrastructure through 
remedial works highlighted in these 
compliance audits, recorded on our Property 
Risk Management system (PRisM). PrisM 
analysis of hospital equipment maintenance 
and replacement schedules aids patient 
safety and provides cost-saving 
opportunities for capital maintenance 
and planned replacement.
All of these operational enhancements 
support a closer focus on cashflow 
throughout the business. This was 
emphasised in 2014 and is an area 
of continued focus in 2015. 
2015 PRIORITIES
We are working to develop our recruitment 
and retention strategies. Further details 
of our Human Resources approach can 
be found in the section on Our People 
that follows this review, on page 42. 
The development and opening of our new 
hospitals in Manchester and Nottingham, 
during 2016–2017 , will require, not only the 
recruitment of additional staff, but also the 
support of our Procurement and Stock 
Management teams throughout next year.
The same will be true for our planned new 
Specialist Care Centre in Chelmsford and 
other sites that will follow, as we roll out 
our radiotherapy services across the country.

Our people are our difference. It’s the 
dedication, warmth and skills of our 
people that sets Spire Healthcare apart. 
We believe that the best service and 
patient care comes from skilled staff who 
are fully engaged and feel truly valued by the 
company they work for – staff who feel they 
make a personal contribution to the success 
of their hospital and can genuinely say that 
Spire is a great place to work. 
At 31 December 2014, we employed over 
8,000 people (over 12,000, including bank 
staff) – equivalent to just over 7 ,000 
full-time jobs – split between nursing, 
theatre staff, allied health professionals, 
and administration and clinical support 
staff (see opposite). 
Our employees are predominantly female 
(10,113 compared to 2,256 male). For senior 
management we employ 27 female 
managers out of a total of 65. 
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
We fully recognise that advancing 
quality is dependent on Spire acting 
as a learning organisation.
We place the individual patient at the centre 
of our business. This means that increasingly 
well-informed patients are key partners 
in decision making, able, with the support 
of their families, carers and consultants, 
to manage their own health and illness.
An effective and consistent patient 
experience feedback loop, encouraging  
not only compliments, but also constructive 
feedback and complaints, is therefore a  
key component of our continuous 
improvement culture.
The other key component comes from our 
staff. We are committed to developing all 
our staff, listening to, and learning from, their 
experiences, to help improve nursing care. 
All clinical activities are aligned to our 
strategic pillars and will be embedded within 
our job descriptions. The aim is to ensure 
clinical quality standards are understood 
and consistent throughout the business. 
ENGAGEMENT AND VALUES 
We take employee engagement seriously; 
every year, we invite all our employees to 
complete a survey to provide feedback 
on how we’re doing and offer suggestions 
about what action could be taken to 
make Spire an even better place to work.  
The survey comprises 40 questions, which  
are designed to establish how effectively  
we do this. 
We are very much looking to the future, as 
we continue to develop new services for our 
patients, maintain our excellent in-patient 
care and remain at the forefront of medical 
developments in the region.

IMPROVING CAPABILITIES
Investment in our staff is investment for 
the future, ensuring that patients and their 
families can rely upon the right staff working 
in the right place with the right skills to 
provide high-quality care.
In 2014, we supported around 100 people 
through our Management Fundamentals 
programme and 11 future leaders through 
our Leadership Essentials programme.
Management Fundamentals is focused 
on developing the people skills of new 
managers. It is designed to build managerial 
capability, skills, behaviours and attitudes 
in areas such as employee engagement, 
performance management, culture, coaching 
and managing absence. 
Leadership Essentials is a seven month,

In line with Spire’s devolved hospital 
management model, each hospital assesses 
individual staff training needs, taking into 
consideration both specialty and regulatory 
requirements and business gap analysis,  
and agrees a personal development plan  
as part of annual appraisals. Our nurses 
undertake annual training in order to 
maintain their registration.

of the fundraising events undertaken was 
a major 620 kilometre cycling challenge 
undertaken over a series of weekends in the 
summer to raise money for Walking with the

LOOKING AFTER OUR ENVIRONMENT 
We want to take care of the environment 
as well as our patients and we continue 
to promote a low-carbon culture across 
our hospitals. Continued monitoring 
and targeting of our buildings’ energy 
consumption takes place through our 
Energy Remote Monitoring system, which 
we run with our partners Schneider Electric.

portion of electrical energy consumed 
through the operation of our buildings 
and has been selected as a key area of 
investment to reduce energy consumption.
We have installed LED street and car park 
lighting at 21 of our hospitals, improving 
lighting and reducing energy consumption.

Energy Solutions estimate 10-year savings 
in excess of £0.5 million on the basis of 
energy savings, reduced maintenance 
costs and environmental tax savings.
Spire Leicester Hospital is now our trial site 
for a similar investment in the upgrade of 
internal lighting systems to LED technology. 
Comparative data from October, November 
and December 2014 indicates potential 
energy savings of up to 69% are achievable. 
We intend to invest further in both these 
areas during 2015 to ensure we continue 
to reduce our electricity consumption 
and realise our energy reduction targets.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Approach to managing risk
Overall responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management  
and internal control systems  
(together ‘the risk management 
framework’) lies with the Board 
of Directors.
The Board has delegated key 
elements of the oversight of  
the Group’s risk management 
framework to two committees, 
as detailed below:
Board Committee Members Committee role Membership
Audit and Risk Chair: Robert Lerwill. 
Members: Dame 
Janet Husband,  
Tony Bourne
To monitor the integrity of financial reporting and to assist 
the Board in its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control and risk management systems
Independent non-executive 
directors
Clinical Governance 
and Safety
Chair: Dame 
Janet Husband. 
Members: Tony 
Bourne, Garry Watts 
and Rob Roger
To promote, on behalf of the Board, a culture of high-
quality and safe patient care, and to monitor the Group’s 
non-financial risks and their associated processes, policies 
and controls in the following areas:
(a) Clinical and regulatory risks
(b) Health and safety
(c) Facilities and plant
Chair: independent  
non-executive director
Members: executive and 
non-executive directors
The Audit and Risk Committee, with the assistance of the Clinical 
Governance and Safety Committee (CGSC), provides the Board with 
advice on the Group’s overall risk appetite and strategy, and a view on 
current risk exposures, the future risk strategy and the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and internal control processes. The 
CGSC reports on the specific risks that it monitors (see table below) 
to the Audit and Risk Committee and additional detail on the work 
of the CGSC (in conjunction with the Audit and Risk Committee) can 
be found on pages 70 and 71.
The risk management framework is designed to identify, evaluate 
and mitigate the risks that the Group faces. The underlying process 
aims to understand and mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and, therefore, can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against loss.
Appetite for risk is considered at Board meetings whenever 
significant strategic, financial or operational decisions are 
made, and is a key part of ongoing discussions about strategy. 
The Board recognises that it has limited control over many of the 
external risks it faces, such as macro-economic events and the 
complex regulatory environment, and it periodically reviews the 
potential impact of such ongoing risks on the business and actively 
considers them in its decision making (see the list of principal risks 
on pages 52 to 55, including how we manage the risks).

Shareholder Information RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The adequacy of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
processes was subject to detailed scrutiny by independent assessors 
as part of the IPO, and was deemed as being appropriate, given 
the nature and scale of the Group at that time. However, the Board 
recognises that, as a listed company, the Group needs to conform 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code (UK Code) and to increasing 
regulatory expectations. In consequence, following the IPO, the 
Board has initiated reviews of existing risk management oversight 
arrangements and processes to identify where improvements 
can be made to bring the Group into line with best practice. 
Since July, the overall corporate governance structure has been 
modified and strengthened to meet the more stringent regulatory 
requirements and UK Code obligations. This is still being formulated 
in certain areas and is being closely monitored to ensure adherence 
to best practice.
The overall risk management framework is being reviewed by the 
Board and its Committees during 2015. 
CLINICAL GOVERNANCE AND SAFETY COMMITTEE
Up until July 2014, clinical delivery and patient safety risk was 
subject to detailed internal scrutiny and monitoring by the executive 
management team and by a Board sub-committee (the Clinical 
Governance and Risk Committee), whose membership comprised 
the executive chairman, a non-executive director and the director 
of Clinical Services. 
Subsequent to the IPO, this Committee has been restructured and 
renamed the CGSC; it is chaired by an independent non-executive 
director, Dame Janet Husband (who possesses relevant clinical 
expertise), and its membership comprises a mix of non-executive 
and executive directors (see details on pages 70 and 71). 
CORPORATE RISKS
All significant risks facing the Group are captured within a Corporate 
Risk Register and are assessed in terms of likelihood and potential 
impact. Each such risk is owned by a member of the executive 
management team who works with the senior management 
responsible for the monitoring and mitigation of that risk. Since July 
2014, the Corporate Risk Register has been subject to detailed review 
and has been updated to reflect the additional risks associated with 
being a listed Group and developing issues in the wider regulatory 
environment, to ensure it remains complete and relevant to support 
decision making. The principal risks facing the Group, drawn from 
the risks listed in the Corporate Risk Register, are detailed on 
pages 52 to 55.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The principal internal controls and assurance activity over the risks 
that are directly manageable by the Group are:
STANDARD POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
The Group has documented policies and standard procedures in place 
covering all significant activities and areas of risk, which are subject 
to regular review and update. 
ASSURANCE OVER CLINICAL DELIVERY AND CLINICAL REGULATORY 
COMPLIANCE RISKS
As a provider of clinical services to patients, the Group faces a specific 
set of non-financial risks associated with such provision. In relation 
to these risks:
• the corporate Clinical Services Team, which is independent of 
the hospital operations and is led by the Group Medical Director, 
oversees a national programme of clinical audits, in addition 
to conducting on-site clinical reviews of every hospital and 
non-hospital unit, according to the approach taken at regulatory 
inspections, as part of the overall framework for clinical governance 
and quality, to ensure that clinical risk and clinical regulatory 
compliance is managed effectively across all registered sites. 
The results of these activities are regularly reviewed by the 
corporate Clinical Services Team, business unit directors and 
matrons, the executive management team and the CGSC; 
Risk management and internal control

Strategic Report
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 • comprehensive, non-financial management information on clinical 
performance, including safety, clinical effectiveness and customer 
experience, is produced and reviewed quarterly against pre-agreed 
standards by the corporate Clinical Services Team, business unit 
directors and matrons, the executive management team and the 
CGSC. Specific KPI measures drawn from this management 
information are given on pages 24 and 27;
• the Group is subject to substantial levels of external inspection and 
review, both by the range of clinical regulators and through choice, 
such as the rolling programme of Health & Safety inspections 
carried out by third-party specialists. The outcomes of all such 
inspection activity are reviewed by management, the executive 
management team and the CGSC; and
• the structures and processes for internal confirmation of clinical 
regulatory compliance and the level of evidence and assurance 
required to monitor this on an ongoing basis have been further 
strengthened and formalised from early 2015.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTROLS
Financial control is established through:
• the annual process of preparing business plans and budgets, 
followed up by close monitoring of operational performance 
by the executive management team and the Board; 
• monthly monitoring of actual results, compared to budgets, 
forecasts and the previous year;
• all material capital expenditure is subject to an investment 
evaluation and authorisation procedure;
• common accounting policies and procedures; and
• the Group’s treasury position and forecast liquidity are kept under 
review to ensure that borrowings are aligned with the Group’s 
growth and are in compliance with banking covenants.
Other non-financial operational risk is managed by means of 
the application of best practice, as defined by Group policies and 
standard procedures, in areas such as project management, Human 
Resources management and IT security and delivery, supported by 
detailed performance monitoring of outputs and issues.
INTERNAL AUDIT/INTERNAL CONTROL ASSURANCE
The Group has not historically considered it necessary to establish 
an Internal Audit function, in part because, through the way that 
hospitals and administration activities are structured, the initiation 
of transactions are entirely separated from the delivery of the 
associated services and their financial recording, and the low level 
of delegated authority at hospital level, which limits risk. Reliance is 
placed on the management review process, transaction-level controls 
built into business processes and other forms of assurance activity 
and audits being performed across the Group, including Clinical 
and Health and Safety audits, and regulatory inspections. 
The need for an Internal Audit function will be reviewed by the Audit 
and Risk Committee during 2015, alongside the implementation of 
any revisions to the risk management framework, taking into account 
assurance activity undertaken on clinical delivery, clinical regulatory 
compliance and on the risk management framework.
CONTINUOUS LEARNING
Accepting that an internal control system cannot guarantee to reduce 
error or loss to zero, the Group takes all instances of complaints, 
control failures, regulatory non-compliance or other risk events very 
seriously, and has detailed processes in place to take action in respect 
of each specific issue identified, to understand the cause and to learn 
from the event wherever possible, so that the chance of re-occurrence 
is minimised. An open culture is promoted within the Group that 
positively encourages the reporting of all risk events and other issues 
arising. The number and nature of events arising and the operation 
of event management processes are closely monitored by hospital 
management, the executive management team, the CGSC and 
the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Group operates an independent whistleblowing service 
to facilitate reporting of any issues or concerns that staff may 
have that they are unwilling to raise via any other channel.

Risk Description and impact Risk change Related strategic pillars How we manage the risk
Macroeconomic 
conditions
Approximately 70% of the Group’s revenue is dependent on private patients having private 
medical insurance (PMI), paid by their employer or paid by the individual, or being able to 
afford its services (self-pay). 
In an economic downturn, the number of insured individuals falls with the level of 
employment and individuals have reduced real income to fund insurance or ‘self-pay’  
for procedures.
This would have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, the results of its operations  
and prospects.
Down The Board manages this risk by regularly reviewing market conditions and economic indicators to assess whether 
actions are required.
As successfully employed in the recent economic downturn, if the private market contracts, the Group can try to 
reduce costs and future investment to improve profit and cashflow, and may be able to offer the released capacity 
to the NHS at its lower tariff, reducing the impact on profit. 
Government policy Change in the medium-term public funding of NHS services provision, and/or the 
prioritisation of this funding to particular service lines over time (elective healthcare, 
A&E, community care, etc.), could adversely reduce the flow of NHS patients. 
Changes in the service level requirements for providers of NHS services, and service level 
commitments to members of the public served by the NHS, could adversely impact the 
attractiveness of privately funded treatment.
A fundamental change in the tariff structure (pricing arrangements), associated with the 
provision of services to the NHS, could result in reduced access to patients, reduced tariffs, 
or reduced prices leading to reduced volumes and/or margins.
Up The Group believes that the private sector has become a fundamental partner of the NHS across the UK. The 
continued use of private facilities is, in Spire’s view, the best way to meet the challenges facing the NHS particularly 
as there is limited capacity within the NHS to take back work currently undertaken by the private sector. 
The Group’s service levels are confirmed by regular surveys of patients, GPs and consultants, which provide ongoing 
feedback to ensure NHS requirements (whether as providers or as commitments to its patients) are met. In 
addition, the Board regularly reviews the competitiveness of its patient offering (both NHS and private patients). 
The Board continually monitors government policy, NHS requirements and associated tariff structures to consider 
the need for cost and/or investment reduction, whether in the short, medium or long term.
See Spire Hull and East Riding Hospital’s case study (on pages 46 and 47), which demonstrates a successful 
partnership with the NHS.
Laws, regulations 
and loss of 
reputation
The Group operates in a highly regulated environment, including complying with the 
requirements of, for example, the CQC, Monitor and the CMA. 
Failure to comply with laws, regulations or regulatory standards may expose the Group to 
patient claims, fines, penalties, damage to reputation, suspension from the treatment of NHS 
patients and loss of private patients, such that the Group may not be able to operate one or 
more of its hospitals, causing a significant reduction in profit.
In addition, the Group could fail to anticipate legal or regulatory changes leading to a 
significant financial or reputational impact.
Down Following the IPO, the Group is in the process of implementing a new group-wide risk management framework 
(and associated policies and procedures), which is tasked with the review, monitoring and, via the executive 
management team, ensuring that these risks are mitigated as far as possible. During 2015, this framework will 
be further strengthened in order to monitor and react to the changing regulatory framework of a listed company 
in the healthcare sector. 
Emerging legal or regulatory changes are monitored by the Board, its executive management team and the 
risk Board Committees, as well as consultations with external advisers and industry briefings. 
Clinical care Spire operates in a highly complex medical sector and requires high clinical standards from 
staff, consultants and third-party suppliers. If they fail to meet the standards required, the 
Group may be subject to litigation and/or media coverage, resulting in reputational damage 
and, potentially, financial loss.
The Group’s future growth depends upon its ability to maintain its reputation for high-quality 
services by meeting its quality goals. Poor clinical outcomes, negative media comment or 
patient, GP and/or consultant dissatisfaction could reduce the quality ratings, which could 
lead to a loss of patient referrals. 
The Group could receive claims arising from clinical care that could exceed its insurance limits 
of cover, giving rise to additional expenses being borne by the Group.
Level Spire has implemented and continually monitors its clinical standards, policies and procedures. The introduction 
of the Board’s Clinical Governance and Safety Committee will aid the monitoring and control of clinical risks.
A number of key performance indicators are used in the assessment of clinical standards and these may be found 
in the Clinical Review, on pages 38 and 39.
The Group reviews and maintains insurance to mitigate the possibility of a major loss. Adequacy of cover 
is reviewed annually with the Group’s brokers.

Risk Description and impact Risk change Related strategic pillars How we manage the risk
Competitor 
challenge
Spire operates in a highly competitive market. New or existing competitors may enter the 
market of one or more of our existing hospitals, or offer new services, reducing the market 
share for the Group.
The potential impact would be the loss of market share and reduced profitability  
and cash-flow.
Level The Group maintains a watching brief on new and existing competitor activity and retains the ability to react 
quickly to changes in patient and market demand.
The Group considers that a partial mitigation of the impact of competitor activity is ensured by providing patients 
with high-quality care and by maintaining good working relationships with GPs and consultants.
Concentration 
of PMI market 
The PMI market is concentrated, with the top four companies – Bupa, AXA, Aviva and 
VitalityHealth (formerly PruHealth) – having a market share of over 87% (see page 13).
Loss of an existing contractual relationship with any of the key players could significantly 
reduce revenue and profit.
Down The Group works hard to maintain good relationships and a joint product/patient health offering with the PMI 
companies, which, it is believed, assists the healthcare sector as a whole in delivering high-quality patient care. 
The Board believes continuing to invest in its well-placed portfolio of hospitals should provide a natural fit to the 
local requirements of all the PMI providers.
The Group has entered into contracts to continue the good relationships for the long term (see Bupa in the 
Chief Executive Officer’s statement on page 8) and to reduce the Group’s risk.
Availability of key 
medical staff
Due to growing demand for healthcare, and a limited supply of appropriately qualified 
nursing staff, the healthcare sector is seeing a rising shortage of skilled nursing staff. 
Profitable growth, in line with the Group’s strategy, requires an expansion of clinical services 
in hospitals, particularly including more complex surgical procedures and ongoing treatment 
of higher-risk patients, which could be impacted by a shortage of key medical staff.
In order to expand our directory of services at hospital level, in line with our strategy, 
it is  vital to have access to appropriately qualified, self-employed consultants. 
The market may well see salary rates rise as competition for staff increases and, 
as a result, the Group’s costs would increase and its profits would reduce. 
Up The Board focuses on staff retention, evidenced by very high levels of staff satisfaction and, hence, low staff 
turnover, and its excellent reputation to attract new staff. 
Overseas recruitment of English-speaking nurses is being used to mitigate the UK shortage of trained nursing staff 
and to reduce the cost of using agency staff. 
The Group believes consultants are attracted by its advanced facilities, technology and equipment, excellent brand 
and reputation, the availability of a broad range of treatments, skilled nursing staff and medical support staff, and 
the efficiency of administrative support. The Group undertakes continuous investment in its equipment, facilities 
and services to retain high-quality consultants and also provides theatre capacity to new consultants. This is 
confirmed by high consultant satisfaction levels, see page 24. 
An employee survey is conducted annually to establish employee satisfaction and, where appropriate, changes 
in working practices are made in response to the survey findings to aid retention.
Investment plans 
and execution
The capital investment programme (which includes IT system developments) for the Group in 
2015 and beyond consists of the largest number of parallel developments undertaken to date.
The management of the programme brings risks relating to: 
• delays in bringing additional facilities, or IT functionality, on line;
• cost overruns; and
• change capacity and project management capability.
Any major cost overrun or substantial delay in delivery could impact upon the expected 
returns and the Group’s planned profit growth and future cashflow.
Up The Group ensures change and project risks are minimised by the following:
• a detailed financial and operational appraisal process is in place to evaluate the expected returns on capital. 
During the course of development, the actual costs and estimated returns are regularly monitored; 
• implementing robust bid procedures, including a thorough review of the contract terms and conditions, 
technical requirements and programme cost forecasting;
• rigorous planning, and programme and project management;
• the selection of contractors and suppliers is based upon track record of delivery and credit worthiness; and
• regular reviews of the programme, and individual projects, by the executive sponsor and the Board.
Liquidity and 
covenant risk
The Group may have insufficient liquid resources to meet its financial liabilities  
as they fall due, or breach financial covenants linked to its borrowings.
Failure to meet its obligations or covenants would have a substantial adverse effect 
on the Group’s reputation and may lead to borrowings becoming repayable earlier 
than contracted for.
Down The Group actively monitors and manages its liquid asset position, its financial liabilities falling due and the cover 
against its loan covenants.
Forward projections show that the Group can meet its liquidity requirements from existing liquid assets and 
maintain its loan covenant obligations, even in adverse scenarios. In addition, there is a committed, undrawn 
revolving credit facility of £100 million available to meet liquidity needs, if required.
In an adverse scenario, capital expenditure could be cut back to reduce the demand on liquidity.
Interest rate risk The Group has liabilities outstanding under floating rate bank loan facilities 
and, is therefore, exposed to interest rate risk from fluctuations in market rates.
Cashflows would be adversely impacted due to any increases in interest rates, 
reducing availability for other purposes.
Down On a regular basis, the Group reviews the cost benefit of entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge 
its exposure to interest rate volatility based on existing variable rates, current and predicted interest yield curves, 
and the cost of associated medium-term derivative financial instruments.
The impact of changes in market rates of interest would be partially mitigated by increased rates receivable  
on money market deposits.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Chairman’s governance letter
 F
ollowing the significant changes in narrative reporting recently 
introduced, we now present our Annual Report within the 
expanded reporting requirements, including our Strategic 
Report and the Remuneration, Audit and Risk, and the new 
Clinical Governance and Safety Committee reports, together with 
our greenhouse gas emissions and diversity data. 
We have used the reporting structure to explain the Spire Healthcare 
story, its strategy and the active ongoing management of our 
successful business model.
BOARD 
On Admission, we formed a new Board, which will assist in ensuring 
we deliver the Group’s strategy for the future.
The new independent non-executive directors have each taken 
specific responsibility for a Board Committee and report within 
the following Corporate Governance section upon the activities 
of the Board Committee that they have chaired since Admission.
I consider that the Board’s composition addresses our current 
requirements for expertise, diversity and experience and, as such,  
is well-equipped to face the challenge of setting and managing  
the strategic direction of the business. 
EVALUATION
As the Group was listed on 23 July 2014, the Board decided that an 
evaluation of the Board, Committees and individual directors was 
inappropriate, as the Board had not been in place for a sufficient 
length of time to provide a meaningful review across the Group’s 
annual business cycle; the first evaluation will be carried out  
during 2015.
This will be an informal evaluation and will include strategy, 
succession planning and Board composition, as well as the changing 
governance and compliance obligations placed on PLC Boards. 
As a new Board with diverse commercial skills and experience, 
I believe we have already developed good working relationships 
and Board synergies, which will aid our future stewardship of the 
Company and its overall governance. We look forward to meeting 
the strategic challenges that the rapidly evolving healthcare sector 
poses for the Group.
The Board is committed to an open dialogue with our shareholders 
and stakeholders; I and John Gildersleeve, our Deputy Chairman, 
ensure we are available for effective engagement, whether at 
the Annual General Meeting, or other investor relations activities. 
The ongoing programme of meetings in 2014 with investors, 
led by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, 
covered in excess of 130 meetings and presentations, of which 
74 were subsequent to the IPO process.
Finally, my Board colleagues and I look forward to meeting 
shareholders at our first AGM at 11am on 21 May 2015 in Freshfields 
Bruckhaus Deringer’s offices at 65 Fleet Street, London EC4Y 1HS.
Garry Watts

Dear Shareholder,  
Welcome to the first Annual 
Report in which your Board, 
supported by the executive

the challenges of governance  
as an independent public

to the London Stock Exchange  
on 23 July 2014.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Corporate governance
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
(UK CODE)
The Group has complied with, and will continue to comply with, the 
principles (and code provisions) of the UK Code, except as described 
below, from the date of Admission.
Independence is determined by ensuring that, apart from receiving 
their fees for acting as directors or owning shares, non-executive 
directors do not have any other material relationship or additional 
remuneration from, or transactions with, the Group, its promoters,  
its management or its subsidiaries, which in the judgement of the 
Board may affect, or could appear to affect, their independence  
of judgement.
The UK Code recommends that at least half the Board of Directors 
of a UK-listed company, excluding the Chairman, should comprise 
non-executive directors determined by the Board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from relationships or 
circumstances that may affect, or could appear to affect, the 
directors’ judgement.
The Group complies with this recommendation of the UK Code, 
notwithstanding that Simon Rowlands and Dr Supraj Rajagopalan  
are not independent, as they have been nominated to act as 
non-executive directors by Cinven Funds, the principal shareholder  
who entered into a Relationship Agreement with the Company on  
7 July 2014. Under the terms of that agreement, for as long as they 
and their associates control in excess of 30% of the votes able to 
be cast, they are entitled to appoint two non-executive directors. 
When Cinven Funds control between 15% and 30% of votes, they 
will be entitled to appoint one non-executive director. They control 
48.35% of votes as at 23 March 2015.
The directors believe that the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
will enable the Group to carry on its business independently  
of Cinven Funds.
The UK Code also recommends that the Chairman of the Board of 
Directors should meet the independence criteria set out in the Code 
on appointment.
Garry Watts was not independent on appointment, having previously 
served as executive chairman of Spire. Following his appointment  
as non-executive chairman, Garry is responsible for the leadership 
and overall effectiveness of the Board and setting the Board’s agenda, 
but he is no longer responsible for the day-to-day management of  
the Group.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Simon Rowlands and Dr Supraj Rajagopalan are partners at Cinven 
Funds, which controls 48.35% of the voting rights in the Company 
as at 23 March 2015. 
Save as set out in the paragraph above, there are no actual or 
potential conflicts of interest between any duties owed by the 
directors or senior management to the Company and their private 
interests or other duties.
The Group complies with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, 
except as noted.

THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer is set out in writing and was reviewed 
and approved by the Board during the Admission process. 
THE NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The non-executive directors bring a wide range of skills and 
experience to the Board. The independent non-executive directors 
represent a strong, independent element on the Board and are well 
placed to constructively challenge and support management. They 
help to shape the Group’s strategy, scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting the Group’s objectives and monitor the 
reporting of performance. 
Their role is also to satisfy themselves with regard to the integrity  
of the Group’s financial information and to ensure that the  
Group’s internal controls and risk management systems are robust 
and defensible. 
The independent non-executive directors oversee the adequacy 
of the risk management and internal control systems (from 
their membership of the Audit and Risk Committee and Clinical 
Governance and Safety Committee (CGSC), as well as the 
remuneration for the executive directors (from their membership 
of the Remuneration Committee).

YOUR BOARD IN 2014
Since the date of Admission, the Board met on four scheduled 
occasions (including one by telephone conference) for the year 
ended 31 December 2014.
The agenda at scheduled meetings in 2014 covered standing agenda 
items, including: a review on the Group’s performance by the Chief 
Executive Officer, the current month’s and YTD financial statistics 
by the CFO and a report from the Chair of the Clinical Governance 
and Safety Committee (including a clinical performance report). In 
addition, the Board received a verbal report from other Committee 
Chairmen, where the Committee met immediately in advance of the 
scheduled Board meeting, and the Board regularly received reports 
on legal and statutory matters.
Also in 2014, the Board focused upon major elements of the Group’s 
operations by:
• reviewing, and approving, the Group’s five-year Strategic Plan;
• considering a draft 2015 Annual Operating Plan; and
• receiving, reviewing and approving major capital  
expenditure proposals.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and 
delegates certain matters to Committees, as outlined elsewhere.

(monthly and YTD); approving capital expenditure; setting and 
approving the Group’s strategy and annual budget; and a review 
of the draft dividend policy. 
THE BOARD’S PLAN FOR 2015
It is planned that the Board will convene on eight formal scheduled 
occasions (including one by telephone conference) during 2015, as 
well as holding any necessary ad hoc Board and Committee meetings 
to consider non-routine business. 
The Chairman and the other non-executive directors are scheduled 
to meet on their own without the executive directors present. 
In addition, the non-executive directors will also meet without 
the Chairman present to discuss matters such as the 
Chairman’s performance.
The Board will maintain its focus on the Group’s pursuit of its 
2015 targets and, during the year, its activities will include:
• review and approve the 2014 Annual Report;
• review the proposed final dividend for 2014;
• approve the 2015 Annual Operating Plan; 
• consider specific major themes;
• review the risk management framework; and
• follow a rolling agenda, ensuring proper time for strategic debate.
The Board will enhance and streamline information flows to the 
Board and Committees (via an on-line portal with Board documents, 
briefing papers and a library of relevant information about the 
Group and its activities), will meet the senior leadership across the 
Group and will review the delegation of its authority, as appropriate.
Furthermore, the Board will consider clinical safety matters 
and maintain overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management processes via the 
relevant Board Committees.

  The Nomination Committee has to ensure the best possible leadership and, as the on-executive directors were appointed for the first time on 24 June 2014, there has been no meeting of this 
Committee in 2014 (two meetings have been scheduled in 2015).
To the extent that directors are unable to attend scheduled meetings, 
or additional meetings called on short notice, they will receive the 
papers in advance and relay their comments to the Chairman for 
communication at the meeting. The Chairman will follow up after 
the  meeting in relation to the decisions taken.
EFFECTIVENESS
BOARD COMPOSITION
The Board seeks to ensure that both it and its Committees have the 
appropriate range of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
of the Group to enable them to discharge their respective duties 
and responsibilities effectively; for example, the 2015 Board calendar 
includes Board development training sessions on the role and 
regulatory powers of the CQC.
The number of non-executive directors and their range of skills and 
experience were carefully reviewed and agreed as part of the IPO 
process. The continuing requirements and the number of directors, 
together with the Group’s succession plans, will form part of the 
Nomination Committee activities and the Board’s evaluation process 
in 2015. The Board considers its size and composition to be 
appropriate for the current requirements of the business. 
Committee composition is set out in the relevant Committee 
reports. No-one other than Committee Chairs and members of 
the Committees is entitled to participate in meetings of the Audit 
and Risk, Nomination, Remuneration and Clinical Governance and 
Safety Committees, unless by invitation of the Committee Chair. 
The Board considers that half of the Board is independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship  
that could affect the exercise of their independent judgement.  
Simon Rowlands and Dr Supraj Rajagopalan are remunerated by 
Cinven Funds and are not considered to be independent. 
As the Chairman was previously the executive chairman prior 
to Admission, he did not satisfy the independence criteria on 
his appointment to the Board. John Gildersleeve was appointed 
as the Senior Independent Director and Deputy Chairman. 
Biographical details of the Directors are set out on pages 56 and 57.
APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD
Recommendations for appointments to the Board are made by 
the Nomination Committee. The Committee will follow a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of 
new directors to the Board. Further information is set out 
in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 72 and 73.

Governance
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 TIME COMMITMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN  
AND THE NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Chairman and non-executive directors each have a letter 
of appointment, which sets out the terms and conditions of their 
directorship. An indication of the anticipated time commitment is 
provided in any recruitment role specification, and each director’s 
letter of appointment provides details of the meetings that they 
are expected to attend.
Non-executive directors are required to set aside sufficient time to 
prepare for meetings, and to regularly refresh and update their skills 
and knowledge. In signing their letters of appointment, all directors 
have consequently agreed to commit sufficient time for the proper 
performance of their responsibilities, acknowledging that this will 
vary from year to year, depending on the Group’s activities. 
Directors are expected to attend all Board and Committee meetings, 
and any additional meetings, as required. Each director’s other 
significant commitments were disclosed to the Board at the time 
of their appointment and they are required to notify the Board of 
any subsequent changes. The Group has reviewed the availability 
of the non-executive directors and considers that each of them is 
able to, and in practice does, devote the necessary amount of time 
to the Group’s business. 
INDUCTION AND TRAINING
An induction programme was used in 2014 for the initial introduction 
of all non-executive directors to the Group’s activities.
Generally, reference materials are provided, including information 
about the Board, its Committees, directors’ duties, procedures for 
dealing in the Group’s shares and other regulatory and governance 
matters, and directors are advised of their legal and other duties, 
and obligations as directors of a listed company. 
The Company Secretary ensures that any additional request for 
information is promptly supplied. Whilst the Chairman, through 
the Company Secretary, ensures that there is an ongoing process 
to review any internal or external training and development needs. 
As already noted, in the event of a general training need, in-house 
training will be provided to the entire Board. Necessary and relevant 
regulatory updates are provided as a standing item at each Board 
meeting in the Group Company Secretary’s report and Board briefing 
by external advisers, where appropriate. 
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT
The Board ensures that it receives, in a timely manner, information 
of an appropriate quality to enable it to adequately discharge its 
responsibilities. Papers are provided to the directors in advance of 
the relevant Board or Committee meeting to enable them to make 
further enquiries about any matters prior to the meeting, should they 
so wish. This also allows directors who are unable to attend to submit 
views in advance of the meeting. 
Outside the Board papers process, the Chief Executive provides 
written updates to non-executive directors on important business 
issues, including financial and commercial information. In addition, 
relevant updates on shareholder matters (including analyst’s reports) 
are also provided to the Board. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. There is also an agreed procedure in place for directors, 
in the furtherance of their duties, to take independent legal advice, 
if necessary, at the Group’s expense.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The UK Code requires (main principle (B.6)) that the Board should 
undertake a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its Committees and individual directors.
As the date of Admission was 23 July 2014, the Board had not yet 
had sufficient time working together for an evaluation of their 
performance to be sufficiently wide-ranging across the full business 
cycle of the Group.
Hence, no Board evaluation was performed in 2014.
The Board will undertake an informal evaluation of its performance, 
and that of its Committees, in 2015. 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
All the directors offer themselves for election at the first AGM and, 
in future, will be re-elected in accordance with the requirements 
of the UK Code. The biographical details of each of the directors 
are set out in the 2015 Notice of AGM. The Board believes that each 
of the directors standing for election is effective and demonstrates 
commitment to their respective roles. Accordingly, the Board 
recommends that shareholders approve the resolutions to be 
proposed at the 2015 AGM relating to the election of the directors.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES 
The directors of the Group have the benefit of a third-party 
indemnity provision, as defined by section 236 of the Companies 
Act 2006, in the Group’s Articles of Association. In addition, directors  
and officers of the Group are covered by directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance. 
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Board has established a formal system to authorise situations 
where a director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company (Situational Conflicts). 
Directors declare Situational Conflicts, so that they can be considered 
for authorisation by the non-conflicted directors. 
In considering a Situational Conflict, these directors act in the 
way they consider would be most likely to promote the success 
of the Group, and may impose limits, or conditions, when giving 
authorisation or, subsequently, if they think this is appropriate. 
The Company Secretary records the consideration of any conflict  
and any authorisations granted. The Board believes that the  
system it has in place for reporting Situational Conflicts continue  
to operate effectively.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 ACCOUNTABILITY
THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE 
The Committee’s report is set out on pages 67 to 69 and identifies 
its members, whose details are set out on pages 56 and 57.
The report describes its work in discharging its responsibilities in 
the period ended 31 December 2014 and its terms of reference 
can be found on the Group’s website (www.spirehealthcare.com).
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining 
a sound system of risk management and internal control, and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. This system is designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risks facing the Group and safeguard its assets. 
No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Group’s system is designed to 
provide the directors with reasonable assurance that issues are 
identified on a timely basis and are dealt with appropriately. 
The Audit and Risk Committee and the Clinical Governance and 
Safety Committee, whose reports are set out on pages 67 to 69 
and pages 70 and 71, respectively, assist the Board in reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management system and 
internal controls, including financial, clinical, operational and 
compliance controls.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND RISK 
Only independent non-executive directors are allowed to serve 
on both the Audit and Risk, and Remuneration Committees. The 
non-executive directors are, therefore, able to bring their experience 
and knowledge of the activities of each Committee to bear when 
considering the critical judgements of the other. 
This means that the directors are in a position to consider carefully 
the impact of incentive arrangements on the Group’s risk profile 
and to ensure the Group’s remuneration policy and programme 
are structured, so as to accord with the long-term objectives and 
risk appetite of the Group. 
FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL RISK
Independent non-executive directors serve on the Clinical 
Governance and Safety Committee, as well as the Chief Executive 
Officer. In conjunction with the independent members of the 
Audit and Risk Committee, both Committees aim to ensure that 
the control and monitoring of both financial and non-financial 
risks is satisfactory. 
In addition, the Committees, jointly, seek to ensure, as far as 
practicable, there are no elements omitted or unnecessarily 
duplicated and that all critical judgements receive the correct 
level of challenge. 
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board is committed to communicating with shareholders 
and stakeholders in a clear and open manner, and seeks to ensure 
effective engagement through the Group’s regular communications, 
the AGM and other investor relations activities. 
The Group undertakes an ongoing programme of meetings 
with investors, which is managed by the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer. The majority of meetings with investors 
are led by them. 
During the year, there were in excess of 130 individual meetings, 
conference presentations, group lunches and telephone briefings 
with investors, attended by one or both of the CEO and CFO, 
supported by the Investor Relations Director, of which 74 were 
subsequent to the IPO process. 
The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Committee Chairs 
remain open for discussion with shareholders on matters under 
their areas of responsibility, either through contacting the Company 
secretary or directly at the AGM.
The Company reports its financial results to shareholders twice  
a year, with the publication of its Annual and Half-yearly  
Financial Reports. 
It also currently issues further trading updates each year with the 
publication of an Interim Management Statement. In conjunction 
with these announcements, presentations or teleconference calls 
are held with institutional investors and analysts, and copies of any 
presentation materials issued are made available on the Company’s 
website (www.spirehealthcare.com). 
All directors are expected to attend the Company’s AGM,  
providing shareholders with the opportunity to question them  
about issues relating to the Group, either during the meeting,  
or informally afterwards.

has determined that the Chairman, Robert Lerwill, has recent and 
relevant financial experience. 
The Committee members’ biographies are on page 57, and its terms 
of reference (approved by the Board) can be found on the Group’s 
website, www.spirehealthcare.com.
The Company Secretary, or his deputy, is Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee will normally meet at least three times a year. 
It met twice in the short period between the IPO and 31 December 
2014, with attendance disclosed on page 64. The Committee 
normally invites the external auditor and the Chief Financial Officer 
to attend each meeting and other members of the management 
team attend as and when invited. Representatives of the Group’s 
external auditor have a private session with the Committee/
Chairman of the Committee. 
EXTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Committee is responsible for monitoring, reviewing and 
challenging the integrity of the financial statements, and ensuring 
compliance with legal, regulatory and statutory requirements, 
giving due consideration to the provisions of the UK Code. 
The external auditor provided reports for the half-year and year 
end reporting, including all significant issues, with an assessment 
of the prudence of management’s judgements. The Committee 
considered that management’s judgements were cautious, 
but not overly prudent, a view shared by the external auditor,  
Ernst & Young LLP (EY).
EY proposed no material audit adjustments arising from their 
audit work, which provided additional comfort to the Committee. 
At the request of the Board, the Committee considered whether 
the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts was fair, balanced and 
understandable, and whether it provided the necessary information 
for the shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. The Committee was satisfied that, taken 
as a whole, the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and has affirmed that view to the full Board.
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing the financial reporting and internal financial controls of the Group, for reviewing 
the Group’s internal control and risk management systems, and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the external auditor 
of the Group and for reporting its findings and recommendations to the Board.
These comprise:
• receiving and reviewing the Annual Report and Accounts of the Group and half-yearly financial statements and any public financial 
announcements, and advising the Board on whether the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable;
• receiving and reviewing reports from the external auditor, monitoring their effectiveness and independence, and approving their 
appointment and their terms of engagement; 
•  monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management system; 
•  reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal financial controls and internal control systems, assessing and advising 
the Board on the internal financial, operational and compliance controls; and
•  overseeing the Group’s procedures for detecting fraud and relating to whistleblowing.

ACTIVITIES
The main activities were as follows:
• adopting the Committee’s terms of reference, which are set out on our website:  
http://investors.spirehealthcare.com/corporate-governance/committees/;
• agreeing the Committee’s rolling agenda for 2014;
• approving the terms of engagement of the external auditor, including its remuneration and reviewing its independence;
• approving the plan for the external audit for 2014;
• reviewing changes to the Group’s capital structure in preparation for the IPO;
• challenging and reviewing the financial and regulatory reporting relating to the IPO, including the Combined Historical Financial 
Information included within the Price Range Prospectus;
• discussing and reviewing the Group’s accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements;
• receiving and approving the Interim Report and the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts;
• reviewing the systems of internal control, including assessing the requirement for an internal audit function;
• agreeing the policy for approval of non-audit services provided by the external auditor – details are on our website:  
http://investors.spirehealthcare.com/corporate-governance/committees/;
• considering the adequacy of the risk management systems of the Group; and
• receiving a report on the IT function and how its risks are managed, with particular focus on IT security.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND MATERIAL JUDGEMENTS
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates 
and judgements. The table below summarises the matters where the most significant judgements have been made in relation to reporting 
in 2014. EY also identified these matters in its audit report, commenting that they had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources and in directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Matters Judgement and estimation required How the Committee gained comfort on the matter
Revenue recognition The complexity of the pricing structures and the  
high volume of procedures undertaken present  
a risk in relation to the accuracy and completeness  
of revenue recognition.
By assessing the internal measures taken in the 
analytical review of revenues and procedures relating 
to the controls over the invoicing process. In addition, 
EY tested key manual controls and performed 
extensive substantive testing, with no issues 
being noted by it during this work. 
Goodwill carrying amounts The carrying value of goodwill was significant 
(£519.1 million as at 31 December 2014). It is 
tested by reference to its value in use, which 
involves judgements by management as regards 
the assumptions used in forecasting cash flows, 
in particular regarding growth rates and the 
discount rate applied.
By challenging the reasonableness of assumptions 
used in impairment calculations by management 
and the appropriateness of the judgements and 
forecasts used the growth rate and discount rate 
and reviewing the sensitivity analyses as applied 
to the key assumptions.
Recognition of deferred tax 
balances
The reorganisation of the Group’s ownership 
structure prior to IPO results in a higher inherent 
risk associated with the calculation of tax balances.
There are judgements required in estimating the 
liability to deferred tax on the property portfolio 
(£91.7 million as at 31 December 2014) and in the 
recognition of deferred tax assets (£43.6 million as 
at 31 December 2014) in accordance with IAS 12, 
particularly in respect of available losses.
By reviewing the key assumptions adopted by 
management in the calculation of deferred tax, in 
particular the assumptions about the future use or 
disposal of properties and the deductibility of items 
yet to be approved by the relevant tax authority.
EY reviewed the tax calculations in detail, testing 
key assumptions, with no issues being noted.
Treatment of costs directly 
attributable to the Group’s IPO
Management has exercised judgement about  
how the IPO costs are presented in the financial 
statements. Exceptional costs of £54 million, mainly 
related to the IPO, were classified as exceptional, 
in accordance with the Group’s definition thereof,  
and charged to the Income Statement. Costs arising 
from the IPO directly related to the issue of shares 
have not been expensed, but netted to equity in 
accordance with IAS 32.
By reviewing management’s approach to identifying 
costs as directly attributable to the issue of shares, 
as netted to equity.
Careful consideration was given by management  
to the FRC guidance issued on 13 December 2013,  
as regards consistency in reporting exceptional  
items, as it relates to items arising in 2014. Particular 
attention was given to the nature and magnitude  
of the costs incurred.

Governance
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 EXTERNAL AUDITOR 
The Committee oversees the Group’s relationship with the external 
auditor and formally reviews the relationship, policies and procedures 
to ensure independence.
The Committee adheres to the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standard 3, which requires the rotation of the audit partner for listed 
companies every five years. EY has audited the financial statements 
of Spire since 2008 under the same audit engagement partner, David 
Hales and, therefore, his term will end in 2015. As a FTSE 250 Group, 
we will comply with the new provisions requiring an audit tender 
at least every 10 years and our approach to this will be considered 
further in 2015.
As noted, we reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditor. We did this by:
• reviewing its proposed plan for the 2014 audit;
• discussing the results of its audit, including its views about 
material accounting issues and key judgements and estimates, 
and its audit report;
• reviewing the quality of the people and service provided by EY; and
• evaluating all of the relationships between the external auditor and 
the Group, to determine whether these impair, or appear to impair, 
the auditor’s independence.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES AND INDEPENDENCE
The details of our policy in relation to non-audit services are set 
out on our website: www.investors.spirehealthcare.com/corporate-
governance/committees/ . In summary, there are certain services 
termed ‘excluded services’ that are not permitted to be provided 
by the external auditor, including where the auditor may be required 
to audit its own work, would participate in activities that would 
normally be undertaken by management or is remunerated through 
a ‘success fee’ structure.
Total non-audit services provided by EY to the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 totalled £0.5 million. The majority of the 
services related to the IPO in July 2014. IPO services are typically 
performed by auditors, as they are mostly assurance-related; the fee 
was not contingent or success-based. Excluding the fees in relation 
to the IPO, non-audit fees principally related to tax advisory and 
compliance services and they represent less than 20% of the recurring 
base fee and will remain subject to scrutiny and approval by the 
Committee. A full breakdown of non-audit fees paid during the year 
is disclosed within note 12 to the financial statements on page 109.
The Committee considers the requirements of the UK Code and 
the appropriateness of tendering the external audit contract as 
part of normal business practice. Based on an ongoing assessment, 
for example, of the quality of the external auditor’s report to the 
Committee and the audit partner’s interaction with the Committee, 
the Committee remains satisfied with the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the audit. The Committee, therefore, has not 
considered it necessary to require the audit to be put to tender.
The Committee has recommended, and the Board has agreed,  
that, subject to shareholder approval, EY will be reappointed at  
the 2015 AGM. 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
An overview of the risk management and internal controls processes 
are contained on pages 48 to 51. The Committee, with the assistance 
of the Clinical Governance and Safety Committee (CGSC) (which 
focuses on key non-financial risks, including patient and clinical risks), 
carried out the following:
• reviewed the work carried out by the CGSC in relation to the risks 
within its remit;
• reviewed the Group’s system of internal control;
• monitored the risks and associated controls over the financial 
reporting processes, including the process by which the Group’s 
financial statements are prepared for publication; and
• reviewed reports from the external auditor on any issues  
identified during the course of its work, including a report  
on control weaknesses.
The overall risk management framework, including the Board’s 
appetite for risk and the underlying process for capturing and 
reporting risk and control data, will be reviewed by the Board 
and its Committees during 2015 to ensure, as far as possible, 
that changes to reflect the new regulatory environment and 
best practice are incorporated.
WHISTLEBLOWING
The Committee also continued its monitoring and oversight of the 
procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of qualifying 
disclosures by staff. 
The Group offers its staff an independent and confidential service, 
where staff may register any concerns about any wrongdoing or 
safety at work. The General Counsel is, as Whistleblowing Officer, 
responsible for the investigation of any concerns arising and 
reporting directly to the Committee.
ACCOUNTABILITY 
At the year-end, following a detailed review by the Committee of 
the Corporate Risk Register and the principal risks drawn from it, 
consideration of reports on the operation of the risk management 
and internal control systems from senior management, the results 
of all external audit, review and inspection activity and all reported 
risk events, the directors confirmed that no material failings or 
weaknesses were identified.
ANNUAL EVALUATION OF THE COMMITTEE’S PERFORMANCE
As the Committee has only been in existence for a short period 
of time, an evaluation of its performance has not been undertaken. 
The first evaluation is scheduled for 2015.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Clinical Governance and  
Safety Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our first Report of 
the Clinical Governance and Safety Committee (the ‘Committee’ 
or ‘CGSC’) since Spire was admitted to the London Stock Exchange 
in July 2014.
COMMITTEE PURPOSE
The Group’s mission is to bring together the best people, dedicated 
to developing excellent clinical environments and delivering the 
highest-quality patient care. The CGSC oversees, reviews and 
monitors the quality of our clinical services with the aim of ensuring 
that the highest standards of governance are consistently met and 
that clinical outcomes, patient safety and patient experience 
continuously improve in support of this mission. 
The Committee also has an important role in identifying areas of 
clinical risk, and of ensuring that controls are in place to mitigate 
such risk as far as possible. Close links between the CGSC and the 
Audit and Risk Committee have been developed to support the 
Company’s robust approach to risk management. 
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
Since listing, the Committee has been reconstituted, bringing 
together non-executive directors and senior management to further 
develop a sound framework of clinical governance within Spire. With 
my recent, relevant and broad clinical experience, acquired during 
a long medical career, I have the required experience to chair this 
Committee of the Board.
The CGSC members during the period since Admission were:
Dame  
Janet Husband
Independent  
Non-Executive Director Committee Chair
Tony Bourne Independent  
Non-Executive Director
Rob Roger Chief Executive Officer
Garry Watts Group Chairman
Members’ biographies and details of Committee attendance are  
on pages 56 and 57, and page 64, respectively. 
The Group Company Secretary, or his appointed nominee, is secretary 
to the Committee. 
The Committee operates in an inclusive manner. The Company’s 
Group Medical Director and Chief Nursing Officer attend each 
meeting, with other management and Board members invited, as 
appropriate. This openness supports the quality and transparency 
of the Committee’s work and the communication of its deliberations 
with the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board and the hospitals’ 
executive management teams.
COMMITTEE MEETINGS
The Committee will meet eight times in 2015, in accordance with 
its terms of reference, with meetings scheduled to take place before 
each Board meeting, so that there is a timely flow of information 
on clinical governance matters to the Board. 
From the above meetings schedule, the Committee will hold four 
meetings at Spire’s head office in London, and four in a designated 
Spire hospital, thereby providing the opportunity for the Committee 
to meet Hospital Directors, matrons and other front-line staff and 
to tour the hospital facilities. This will aid a ‘ward to Board’ approach  
to clinical governance and also permits the hospital management 
team to present its own strategic developments and challenges  
and to focus on specific aspects of clinical governance relevant 
to its own experience. 
The work of this Committee, in 
overseeing the delivery of clinical 
governance, patient safety and 
care quality, is central to the 
success of Spire Healthcare.

Governance
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The Committee reviews a number of standing items, including:
• the Group Medical Director’s Review of performance, in the form 
of a Clinical Governance and Safety Report, and, on a quarterly 
basis, a review of Serious Adverse Events;
• health and safety; 
• information governance; and
• whistleblowing. 
In 2014, the Committee developed its strategy, which not only 
focuses on monitoring clinical performance and trends in practice, 
but also on a programme of themed reviews to address key strategic 
quality areas in a rolling agenda over the next two years. 
Themed reviews planned for 2015 include: 
• a programme of preparation and training for the new CQC 
inspections regime;
• a review of our complaints process and its compliance with 
national guidance; 
• a review of Spire’s in-house clinical review process of individual 
hospitals, which will enable us to benchmark our hospitals against 
well-defined standards; and
• a review of the quality of service provided by resident medical 
officers at each of our 39 hospitals. 
We will also undertake specific ‘deep dives’ to investigate compliance 
with best practice guidance and to take action where needed.  
This approach will ensure that the Committee has a detailed 
understanding of contemporary clinical issues and of the  
challenges of delivering the highest standards of modern  
hospital-based healthcare. 
2014 ACTIVITIES
The Committee held two meetings at head office and one off-site 
meeting in 2014.
Apart from standing review activities, the Committee conducted 
its first themed review, examining the clinical governance structure 
across Spire, information flows, the escalation of issues through 
the executive management to the Board, and ensuring that 
the structures and processes comply with best practice across 
healthcare organisations in the UK. 
In future, the Committee intends to review its clinical governance 
framework in the light of developing practice on a regular basis. 
The off-site meeting was held at Spire Bristol Hospital in November. 
Hospital staff, including management, clinicians and nurses, met 
members of the Committee and were able to highlight particular 
successes and discuss areas targeted for further improvement. 
Members of the Committee were able to see the hospital’s levels of 
care for themselves and to meet the Chair of the hospital’s Medical 
Advisory Committee and a number of other specialist consultants.
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
In order to better understand the business, culture and ethos within 
Spire’s diverse group of hospitals, I am also undertaking a programme 
of informal visits to all of our hospitals. These visits will enable me 
to engage more closely with senior clinical and managerial staff 
and to be ‘visible’ as Chair of the CGSC. In 2014, I visited 13 of 
our 39 hospitals and plan to complete my tour during 2015. 
These hospital visits have allowed me to question the hospital 
management teams on various issues, to learn about their aspirations 
and challenges, and to gather ideas and suggestions that may have 
an impact on the future strategy of both the Committee and the 
Group. I have also learnt an enormous amount about the complexity 
and variety of Spire’s healthcare business and of the influences that 
drive change and development in the local environment. 
Equally important, I have been able to talk to individual patients on 
a one-to-one basis and have learnt about their experience of being 
a patient at a Spire hospital and how they viewed the quality of 
care they have received. 
I am pleased to report that the feedback from the patients I have 
met has been overwhelmingly positive. 
TERMS OF REFERENCE AND EVALUATION 
The Committee operates under formal terms of reference that were 
approved by the Board during the year. The terms of reference are 
available on the Group’s website (www.spirehealthcare.com). 
Within these terms, the Committee and its individual members are 
empowered to obtain outside legal or other independent professional 
advice (at the cost of the Group). Such powers were not required 
during the period. 
As the Committee has only been in existence for a short period of 
time, an evaluation of its performance has not been undertaken. 
The first evaluation is scheduled for 2015.
Details of the risk management and internal control processes 
are contained on pages 48 to 51.
The Committee believes that it has received sufficient, relevant and 
reliable information from management and the clinical executive 
team to enable us to discharge our responsibilities. 
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
In this Report, our aim has been to present information in a 
simple and transparent way and I hope that shareholders will 
find it informative.
As Chair of the Clinical Governance and Safety Committee, I am 
committed to ensuring an open dialogue with our shareholders. If 
you have any questions about clinical governance or safety generally, 
or the contents of this report, please contact me via the Company 
Secretary – companysecretary@spirehealthcare.com.
The work of this Committee, in maintaining the highest standards 
of clinical governance, patient safety and care quality, is central to 
the success of Spire Healthcare. It is part of a governance structure 
that seeks to balance central and common standards and processes 
with the unique circumstances of each of our hospitals. As a process 
seeking continuous improvement, I look forward to reporting on 
our further progress in a year’s time.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Nomination Committee Report
THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee (the ‘Committee’) must have at 
least three members, of which a majority must be independent 
non-executive directors. The Board appoints the Chairman of the 
Committee, who must be either the Chairman of the Board or an 
independent non-executive director. During the year, I was appointed 
to the role of Chairman of the Committee, though, in my absence, 
the Committee will be chaired by an independent non-executive 
director. The Company Secretary or, in his absence, the Deputy 
Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. 
MEETINGS
The Committee meets as and when required, but did not meet in 
the period following the IPO, as the appointments of all independent 
non-executive directors were made on the same date and there was 
no immediate requirement for further consideration of the Board’s 
diversity of skill and experience, nor that of succession planning at 
the Board and below.
Meetings of the Committee are scheduled to take place twice in  
2015 and the Committee will invite other senior executives to assist 
their discussions.
The meetings will consider any standing items of business, together 
with ad hoc discussion between Committee meetings in the event 
of new director recruitment and I will report the outcome of our 
meetings to the Board.
The Committee operates under formal terms of reference, which 
were reviewed and approved by the Board. The terms of reference 
are available on the Group’s website (www.spirehealthcare.com). 
The Committee and its members are also empowered to obtain 
outside legal or other independent professional advice (at the cost 
of the Group) in relation to its deliberations (which were not exercised 
during the period) and to secure the attendance at its meetings of 
any employee or other parties, should it be considered necessary. 
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Committee’s foremost priorities are to ensure that the Group 
has the best possible leadership and a clear plan for both executive 
and non-executive director succession. Its prime focus is, therefore, to 
concentrate upon the strength of the Board, for which appointments 
will be made on merit against objective criteria, selecting the best 
candidate for the post. The Nomination Committee advises the Board 
on these appointments, and also on retirements and resignations 
from the Board, and its other Committees. 
The Committee’s key objectives can be found on page 63. 
The Committee did not 
meet in the period following 
Admission, as the appointments 
of all independent non-executive 
directors took place at the  
same time.

Governance
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 BOARD COMPOSITION
All the executive and independent non-executive directors have 
served at a very senior level in global and UK-based organisations, 
have international experience across a variety of industries, and most 
have financial experience. At present, one of the seven executive and 
independent non-executive directors is female.
It should be noted that in Lord Davies’ original recommendation 
on Women on Boards, he stated that listed companies in the 
FTSE 100 should aim for a minimum of 25% female Board member 
representation by 2015. He also recommended that FTSE 350 
companies should be setting their own challenging targets and 
expected that many would achieve a much higher figure than 
this minimum. We note this requirement and aim to move 
towards this target as soon as practicable.
PROCESS FOR BOARD APPOINTMENTS
When considering Board recruitment, the Committee will draw up  
a specification for a director, taking into consideration the balance  
of skills, knowledge and experience of its existing Board members, 
the diversity of the Board, the independence of continuing Board 
members, together with the ongoing requirements and strategic 
development of the Group. The search process can then focus on 
appointing a candidate with a balance of skills that will enhance  
the Board.
The Committee will utilise the services of an executive search firm 
to identify appropriate candidates, ensuring that the search firm 
appointed does not have any other connection with the Group. In 
addition, the Committee will only use those firms that have adopted 
the Voluntary Code of Conduct addressing gender diversity and best 
practice in search assignments. A ‘long list’ of potential appointees 
will then be reviewed, followed by the shortlisting of candidates for 
interview, based upon the objective criteria identified at inception. 
Care is taken to ensure that all proposed appointees will have 
sufficient time to devote to the role and do not have any conflicts of 
interest. The Committee will then recommend a preferred candidate 
and the directors not on the Committee will meet the candidate. 
Following these meetings, and assuming acceptance, the Committee 
will make a formal recommendation to the Board on the 
appointment. Wherever possible, the Nomination Committee 
will arrange for all directors to meet the preferred candidate. 
BOARD SUCCESSION
The Committee will regularly examine succession planning based 
on the Board’s balance of skills and overall diversity. Led by the 
Committee, succession planning of the Board will form an integral 
part of the Board’s annual strategy meeting.
SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION
During 2015, it is anticipated that the executive directors will submit 
succession plans in respect of senior executives to the Board for 
review. The Board also actively seeks to meet with key executives 
throughout the Group in order to gain a greater understanding of the 
breadth and depth of management talent. During 2015, this process 
will be augmented to include a series of formal presentations to the 
Board by relevant members of the executive management team, 
and of the senior leadership team. This will allow members of the 
Committee to adopt a more informed approach to the requirements 
of Board and/or Group succession planning in 2015.
COMMITTEE EVALUATION
As the Committee has only been in existence for a short period of 
time and did not meet in 2014, an evaluation of its performance 
has not been undertaken. The first evaluation is scheduled for 2015.
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Committee met in March 2015 and reviewed the continuation 
in office, and potential re-appointment, of all members of the Board. 
Following this review, the Committee recommended to the Board 
that all directors should be re-appointed, and hence all directors 
will seek re-election at the AGM.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report
Tony Bourne 
Chair, Remuneration Committee 
Other members: John Gildersleeve, Robert Lerwill
ANNUAL STATEMENT FROM THE REMUNERATION  
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
Dear Shareholder 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our first Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (‘DRR’) following the IPO in July 2014, which 
has been prepared in accordance with the relevant legislation, 
including Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) 
and the Listing Rules. This Report is, therefore, set out in two parts:
i.  Policy Report – This sets out our Remuneration Policy (‘Policy’)  
for all directors of the Group, which will be subject to a binding 
shareholder vote at our 2015 AGM.
ii.  Annual Report on Remuneration – This sets out how our directors 
were paid in 2014 and how we will apply our Policy in 2015. There 
will be an advisory shareholder vote on this section of the Report 
at the 2015 AGM.
OUR APPROACH TO REMUNERATION
The overall remuneration structure was designed prior to the IPO 
and detailed in the Prospectus. The approach was intended to 
provide a simple and transparent structure that reflected our 
business operations and future strategy. The structure also 
took into account evolving market norms and best practices. 
The Committee has spent considerable time focusing on how the 
remuneration structure adopted prior to IPO should be implemented 
in practice. The Committee wanted to enshrine core behaviours and 
values that have been integral to Spire Healthcare’s success to date 
and to tie variable pay to future Group success with performance-
related payments being aligned with sustainable shareholder value, 
and subject to the achievement of rigorous and stretching targets. 
The Committee considers that our new policy provides a well-
balanced remuneration package that will continue to attract and 
retain people of the right calibre, and incentivise our executive 
directors and senior executives to achieve the short and longer-term 
business targets of the Group and to deliver shareholder value. 
The Committee operates under terms of reference approved by the 
Board, available on the Group’s website (www.spirehealthcare. com)
REMUNERATION DECISIONS IN RESPECT OF 2014
As described elsewhere in the Strategic Report and in the financial 
highlights on page 1, during our first year as a listed Group, we 
achieved a strong financial performance, and continue to deliver 
on our strategic and operational priorities. 
The 2014 annual bonus awards were based on a mix of financial and 
non-financial metrics. On the basis of the reported EBITDAR outcome 
of £219.9 million and the achievement of strategic and personal 
objectives, including delivering a successful IPO of the Group, 
approximately 34% of the maximum bonus potential was paid to the 
executive directors, of which one-third will be deferred into shares.
During the year, the Committee also considered the terms of the 
Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), adopted at IPO. The 
first awards were granted in September 2014. The Committee has 
determined that these 2014 awards to senior executives, including 
executive directors, are based on stretching relative Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’) and Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) performance targets. 
Subject to achievement of the relevant targets, these awards will 
vest in early 2017 in accordance with the normal business cycle. 
The Committee is satisfied that the targets are appropriately linked 
to delivery of demanding long-term financial goals and the creation 
of shareholder value. 
As noted in the Prospectus, executive directors are expected to build 
and retain a shareholding at least equivalent to twice their salary. 
This will create further alignment with shareholders. Both executive 
directors meet this guideline.
REMUNERATION DECISIONS FOR 2015
In relation to remuneration arrangements for the executive directors 
in respect of 2015 performance and beyond, the only structural 
change is to introduce clawback provisions for both the annual bonus 
and LTIP awards (see page 77 for more detail). The Committee is of 
the view that this change further strengthens the existing malus 
provision that already applies to our incentive plans.
Apart from a change to the annual bonus metrics (replacing EBITDAR 
with EBITDA measures and introducing a balanced scorecard of 
strategic objectives) and weightings, no other changes are proposed 
in respect of 2015 bonus awards. LTIP awards to be granted in 2015 
will continue to be subject to EPS and relative TSR targets.

Performance 
measures
Salary • To provide fixed 
remuneration 
that is 
appropriate 
for the role 
and to secure 
and retain the 
talent required 
by the Group.
• The Committee takes into account 
a number of factors when setting 
salaries, including:
 − scope and responsibility of the role;
 − the skills and experience  
of the individual;
 − salary levels for similar roles 
within appropriate comparators; 
 − overall structure of the remuneration 
package; and
 − pay and conditions elsewhere  
in the Group.
• Salaries are normally reviewed annually, 
with any increase usually taking effect 
in January.
•  While there is no defined maximum 
opportunity, salary increases normally 
take into account increases for full-time 
employees across the Group.
•  The Committee retains discretion to make 
higher increases in certain circumstances, 
for example, following an increase in the 
scope and/or responsibility of the role, or a 
significant change in market practice or the 
development of the individual in the role.
•  The current salaries effective from  
1 January 2015 are:
 − CEO: £525,000
 − C F O : £ 3 5 0 , 000
• None
Benefits • Fixed element 
of remuneration 
providing 
market 
competitive 
benefits to 
both support 
retention and 
recruit people 
of the necessary 
calibre.
•  A range of role-appropriate benefits 
may be provided to executive directors, 
including such items as private medical 
insurance (for the executive director and 
their family), permanent health assurance, 
participation in an income protection 
scheme, life assurance, an annual health 
assessment (for the executive director and 
their spouse) and a car allowance. 
•  Additional one-off benefits may also be 
provided where the Committee considers 
this appropriate (e.g on relocation). 
•  Executive directors are also eligible to 
participate in any all-employee share 
plans operated by the Company from  
time to time on the same basis as other 
eligible colleagues.
•  The Committee keeps the benefits 
package offered to existing and new 
executive directors under review.
• Whilst no maximum limit exists, individual 
benefit arrangements take into account 
a number of factors, including market 
practice for comparable roles within 
appropriate pay comparators.
• Participation in any HMRC -approved 
all-employee share plan is subject to  
the maximum permitted by the 
relevant tax legislation.
• None
Retirement 
benefits
•  F i x e d el em en t 
of remuneration 
to assist with 
retirement 
planning.
•  R e t i r em en t 
benefits are 
provided to 
both support 
retention and 
recruit people 
of the necessary 
calibre.
•  Executive directors can opt to join the 
Company’s defined contribution scheme, 
receive a contribution into a personal 
pension scheme, take a cash supplement 
or any combination of the three.
•  The employer defined contribution level, 
the contribution into a personal pension 
scheme and/or cash supplement are 
kept under review by the Committee.
•  The retirement benefits are not included 
in calculating bonus and long-term 
incentive quantum.
•  The maximum level of retirement benefits 
is 25% of base salary, and the current 
provision for the executive directors 
is 18% of base salary.
•  They are set by taking into account a 
number of factors, including market 
practice for comparable roles at 
appropriate pay comparators.
•  For new executive directors, the nature and 
value of any retirement benefits provided 
will be, in the Committee’s view, reasonable 
in the context of market practice for 
comparable roles and take account of both 
the individual’s circumstances and the cost 
to the Group.

•  The Committee sets targets that require 
appropriate levels of performance, taking 
into account internal and external

•  As soon as practicable after the year 
end, the Committee meets to review 
performance against objectives and 
determines payout levels. The Committee 
may adjust payments to ensure they are 
reflective of overall performance.
•  A portion of any bonus (as determined by 
the Committee) is normally deferred into 
an award of shares under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan (DBP). Currently one-third of  
any bonus is deferred for a period of three 
years (although the Committee may vary 
this approach). 
•  DBP awards may be in the form of 
conditional share awards or nil-cost options

(currently 
one-third). 
•  Awards are based on a combination  
of financial, operational and  
individual goals measured over  
one financial year.
•  At least 50% of the award will be 
assessed against Group financial 
metrics. The remainder of the  
award will be based on performance 
against strategic objectives and/or 
individual objectives. Details of the 
performance measures for 2014 and 
2015 are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
•  A sliding scale between 0% and 100% 
of the maximum award pays out for 
achievement between the minimum 
and maximum performance 
thresholds. 
•  For annual bonuses in respect of  
2015, the targets will be based on 
EBITDA and a balanced scorecard 
of strategic metrics. 
•  The details of measures, targets 
and weightings may be varied by 
the Committee year-on-year based  
on the Group’s strategic priorities.

be based on share price measures. 
The remainder will be based on either 
financial and/or operational measures.
•  At the threshold performance, no more 
than 25% of the award will vest, rising

Governance
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGETS
Annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures are designed to provide 
an appropriate balance between incentivising executive directors 
to meet financial targets for the year and to deliver specific strategic, 
operational and personal goals. This balance allows the Committee 
to review the Group’s performance in the round against the key 
elements of our strategy, and appropriately incentivise and reward 
the executive directors. 
Bonus targets are set by the Committee each year to ensure that 
executive directors are focused on the key financial and strategic 
objectives for the financial year. In doing so, the Committee usually 
takes into account a number of internal and external reference 
points, including the Group’s business plan.
LTIP
The Committee believes it is important that the performance 
conditions applying to LTIP awards support the long-term ambitions 
of the Group and the creation of shareholder value. The Committee 
currently considers that a combination of relative TSR and financial 
metrics (currently EPS) are the most appropriate measures to assess 
the underlying performance of the business, while creating alignment 
with shareholders and rewarding long-term value creation.
The Committee will keep the measures and weightings under review 
to ensure that the most appropriate measures to incentivise the 
long-term success of the Group are used.
RECOVERY PROVISIONS (MALUS AND CLAWBACK)
Prior to vesting, the Committee may cancel or reduce the number 
of shares subject to, or impose additional conditions on, LTIP , DBP 
awards and Directors’ Share Bonus Awards in circumstances 
where the Committee considers it to be appropriate (‘malus’). Such 
circumstances may include: a serious misstatement of the Group’s 
audited financial results, a serious miscalculation of any relevant 
performance measure, a serious failure of risk management or 
regulatory compliance by a relevant entity, serious reputational 
damage to the Group, or the participant’s material misconduct.
In addition, for cash bonus awards in respect of 2015 and future 
years, and for LTIP awards granted after 1 January 2015, the 
Committee may also claw back vested awards in certain extreme 
circumstances (including those listed above) for up to two years 
following the determination of the relevant performance outcome. 
Prior to applying malus or clawback, the Committee will take into 
account all relevant factors (including, where a serious failure of 
risk management or regulatory compliance or serious reputational 
damage has occurred, the degree of involvement of the employee 
in that failure or damage in question and the employee’s level 
of responsibility) in deciding whether, and to what extent, it is 
reasonable to operate malus and/or clawback. The Committee 
is satisfied that the above provisions provide robust safeguards 
against inappropriate payment of incentive awards.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
Directors’ Share Bonus Plan Awards (‘Awards’) were granted to 
Rob Roger, Simon Gordon and Garry Watts (in recognition of his 
performance as Executive Chairman) to reflect their contribution 
to the Company prior to Admission. These awards were made over 
shares in the form of nil-cost options. The awards are split into two 
equal tranches, which normally become exercisable on the first and 
second anniversary of Admission, respectively.
Although these awards were made in recognition of services 
provided to the Company prior to Admission, the awards will only 
be exercisable in full if the 90-day average share price prior to the 
first and second anniversary of Admission is at least 359 pence. If, 
at the relevant anniversary, the average share price is at or below 
224 pence then the number of shares in the relevant tranche to 
which the options relate will be reduced by approximately 35%. 
Where the average share price at the relevant anniversary is 
between 224 pence and 359 pence, the proportion exercisable 
will be reduced on a pro-rata basis.
RECRUITMENT POLICY
In determining remuneration for new executive directors, the 
Committee will consider all relevant factors, including the calibre of 
the individual and the external market, while aiming not to pay more 
than is necessary to secure the required talent. The Committee would 
seek to act in what it considers to be the best interests of the Group 
and its shareholders. Normally, the Committee will seek to align the 
new executive director’s remuneration package to the remuneration 
policy, as set out above. 
Salary and benefits (including any retirement benefits) will be 
determined in accordance with the policy table above. In certain 
instances, the Committee may decide to appoint an executive 
director to the Board on a lower-than-typical salary, with the 
intention of gradually increasing the salary to move closer to market 
level as they build experience in the role. Normally, benefits will be 
limited to those outlined in the policy table above, including a 
relocation allowance in certain circumstances.
The maximum level of variable pay (excluding any buyouts) that may 
be awarded to a new executive director will be limited to 350% of 
base salary, which is consistent with the policy table above. Incentives 
will normally be granted under the existing plans; however, where 
appropriate, the Committee may tailor the award (e.g timeframe, 
form, performance criteria) based on the commercial circumstances. 
The Committee may ‘buyout’ remuneration terms a new hire has 
had to forfeit on joining the Group. Buyout awards are intended 
to be of comparable commercial value, and capped accordingly. 
The Committee will take into account all relevant factors when 
determining the quantum and form/structure of any buyout, 
including any performance conditions attached to any forfeited 
awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the 
proportion of the vesting/performance period remaining. 
The service contracts for new appointments will be consistent with 
the policy described below. Where an executive director is appointed 
from within the organisation, the policy of the Group is that any 
legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original 
terms and conditions. Similarly, if an executive is appointed following 
an acquisition of, or merger with, another company, legacy terms and 
conditions would be honoured.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS AND PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
The key employment terms and other conditions of the current executive directors, as stipulated in their service contracts, are set out below:
Provision Policy
Notice period •  12 months’ notice by either the Group or the executive director. This is also the policy for new recruits.
Benefits •  The Group may agree that certain benefits will be specified within the executive directors’  
service contracts. 
•  The current executive directors are contractually entitled to private medical insurance (for the executive 
director and his family), permanent health assurance, income protection, life assurance, an annual health 
assessment (for the executive director and their spouse) and a car allowance.
Termination payment •  It is the Group’s policy that service contracts contain provisions that allow the Group to terminate 
employment by making a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) equivalent to (i) 12 months’ base salary 
and (ii) the cost of specific benefits (including retirement benefits). 
•  Upon termination by the Group, the Group can determine whether a PILON is made as a single lump sum or 
paid in instalments, subject to mitigation. Where the sum is paid in instalments, the executive director has 
a duty to use reasonable endeavours to secure alternative employment as soon as reasonably practicable. 
In the event the executive director commences alternative employment with an annual salary of greater 
than £30,000, there will be a pro-rata reduction in the PILON payments.
Immediate termination • The service contract of an executive director may also be terminated immediately and with no liability to 
make payment in certain circumstances, such as the executive director bringing the Group into disrepute  
or committing a fundamental breach of their employment obligations.
External appointments • Executive directors may accept one position as a non-executive director of another publically listed 
company that is not a competitor of the Group, subject to prior approval of the Board. External 
appointments to any other company (and treatment of any fees) are also subject to the prior approval 
of the Board.
In the event that the employment of an executive director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with 
the terms of the service contract between the Group and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans in which they participate. 
Where an executive director’s employment with the Group ceases prior to the payment of the annual bonus in respect of a financial year, 
the Committee in its absolute discretion will determine whether any bonus should be paid and the extent to which deferral into shares 
should be applied. Any awards would normally be pro-rated. For bonuses in respect of 2015 onwards, clawback provisions will also apply. 
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the executive director is dismissed for misconduct, no bonus will be payable.

to determine that awards can vest earlier.
•  DBP and LTIP awards will continue to be subject to the 
malus provisions outlined on page 77 until the vesting of 
the awards. LTIP awards granted from 2015 onwards will 
also be subject to a clawback provision, as described above.

case of dismissal for cause).
•  Awards vest on the first and second anniversary of 
Admission to the extent the share price performance 
targets have been met.
•  Awards will continue to be subject to the malus provisions 
outlined on page 77 until the vesting of the awards.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Group seeks to appoint non-executive directors who have relevant professional knowledge (and/or specific technical skills) to support 
the current expertise of the Board and to match the healthcare sector within which the Group operates.
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman and/or non-executive director, remuneration arrangements will normally be in line  
with those detailed in the relevant table below. Fees to non-executive directors will not include share options or other performance- 
related elements.
Remuneration of independent non-executive directors, with the exception of the Chairman, is determined by the Chairman and the executive 
directors. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee. Directors are not involved in any decisions in relation to their 
own remuneration. 
The table below sets out the remuneration policy with respect to non-executive directors. Non-executive directors do not participate 
in the Group’s bonus arrangements, share incentive schemes or retirement benefit plans. 
Approach to setting remuneration  
for non-executive directors Opportunity
•  Fees are set at appropriate levels to ensure 
non-executive directors are paid to reflect 
the individual responsibility taken, as 
well as the skills and experience of the 
individual. Fees are reviewed periodically. 
•  When setting fee levels, consideration is 
given to a number of factors, including 
responsibilities and market positioning. 
•  Where appropriate, benefits to the role 
may be provided. Travel and other 
reasonable expenses (including fees 
incurred in obtaining professional advice  
in the furtherance of their duties and any 
associated taxes) incurred in the course  
of performing their duties may be paid  
by the Group or reimbursed to non-
executive directors.
• The total fees paid to non-executive directors will remain within the limit stated 
in the Articles of Association of the Company.
•  Individual fees reflect responsibility and time commitment, as well as the skills and 
experience of the individual. Additional fees may be paid for further responsibilities, 
such as chairmanship of committees.
•  Any benefits provided will be reasonable in the market context and take account of the 
individual circumstances and benefits provided to comparable roles. Expenses reasonably 
incurred in the performance of the role may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Group, 
as appropriate, including any tax due on the benefits. Non-executive directors will also be 
covered by the Group’s indemnity insurance.
•  The fees as at 31 December 2014 were: 
 − Chairman: £257 ,000
 − Deputy Chairman and Senior independent director: £140,000
 − Non-executive director basic fee: £50,000
 − Committee chairmanship: £10,000
• Individuals appointed to the Board by Cinven Funds pursuant to the Relationship Agreement 
do not currently receive any annual fees from the Company.
Under the terms of his appointment, Garry Watts is entitled to private medical expenses insurance (for both himself and his spouse and any 
dependent children), life assurance, annual health assessment (for both himself and his spouse) and office facilities to perform his duties as 
Chairman. Medical expenses insurance and life assurance will be provided under the Group’s arrangements or, if he obtains equivalent benefits 
directly, the Group will meet his costs (up to a specified cap).
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. They do not have service 
contracts with either the Group or any of its subsidiaries. 
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below. This is the policy for current and any new non-executive directors.
Provision Policy
Period •  In line with the UK Code, the Chairman and all independent non-executive directors are subject to annual re-election 
by shareholders at each AGM.
•  After the initial three-year term, the Chairman and the non-executive directors are typically expected to serve a further 
three-year term.
Termination •  The appointment of the Chairman is terminable by either the Group or the director by giving 12 months’ notice.
•  The appointment of the Deputy Chairman is terminable by either the Group or the director by giving three 
months’ notice.
•  The appointment of any independent non-executive directors is terminable by either the Group or the director by giving 
two months’ notice.
•  The non-executive directors nominated by Cinven Funds pursuant to the terms of the Relationship Agreement are 
terminable without notice.

Governance
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 FURTHER DETAILED PROVISIONS
The DBP and LTIP , as well as the outstanding legacy Directors’ Share Bonus Awards, will be operated in accordance with the relevant plan 
rules (which were summarised for shareholders in the Prospectus). The Committee may adjust or amend awards only in accordance with the 
provisions of the relevant plan rules. This includes making adjustments to awards to reflect one-off corporate events, such as a change in the 
Group’s capital structure. In accordance with the plan rules, awards may be settled in cash rather than shares, where the Committee considers 
this appropriate.
The performance conditions applicable to incentive awards may be amended on an appropriate basis determined by the Committee, 
if an event occurs or circumstances arise that cause the Committee to consider the performance condition is no longer a fair measure of 
performance (and, in the case of the Directors’ Share Bonus Award, the Committee determines fairly and reasonably that the circumstances 
prevailing at grant have changed). For LTIP and Directors’ Share Bonus Awards, the amended performance condition will be at least as 
challenging as the original condition.
Under the DBP , LTIP and Directors’ Share Bonus Awards, participants may receive an additional amount, in cash or shares, to take account 
of the value of dividends the participant would have received on the shares that vest.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, LTIP awards may vest to the extent that the Committee determines, taking into account 
the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisfied, and such other factors as the Committee considers relevant in the 
circumstances, provided that, unless the Committee determines otherwise, awards will be adjusted to reflect the period of time that has 
elapsed between grant and cessation of employment/directorship; DBP awards will normally vest in full; and legacy Share Bonus Awards 
may vest based on the per-share price payable to shareholders on the relevant transaction, or, in the case of a winding-up, the share price 
at the time. Alternatively, awards may be exchanged for equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
The Committee may make any remuneration payments (including vesting of incentives) and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding that 
they are not in line with the Policy set out above, where the terms of that payment were agreed before this Policy came into effect; or at a time 
when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
The DBP and LTIP incorporate dilution limits. These limits are 10% in any rolling 10-year period for all plans and 5% in any rolling 10-year 
period for executive share plans. Shares issued out of treasury will count towards these limits for so long as this is required under institutional 
shareholder guidelines. Shares issued, or to be issued, pursuant to any awards granted on or before the date of Admission will not count 
towards these limits. In addition, awards that lapse shall be disregarded for the purposes of these limits.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes 
or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
ILLUSTRATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of stretching 
short-term and long-term performance targets aligned with the Group’s objectives, and on delivering shareholder value. The Committee 
considers the level of remuneration that may be received under different performance outcomes to ensure that this is appropriate in the 
context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders. 
The charts that follow provide illustrative values of the annual remuneration packages for executive directors in 2015 under three assumed 
performance scenarios. These charts are for illustrative purposes only and actual outcomes may differ from those shown.

REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY
The Policy for our executive directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration across 
the Group. When making decisions in respect of the executive director remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into consideration 
the pay and conditions for employees throughout the Group. As stated in the policy table, salary increases are, in practice, normally aligned 
to the general employee population. The Committee does not directly consult with our employees as part of the process of determining 
executive pay.
DIFFERENCES IN REMUNERATION POLICY FOR ALL EMPLOYEES
The remuneration of the wider employee population is based on the same reward philosophy, whilst the components of remuneration 
vary with seniority. All employees, including executive directors, receive a salary and role appropriate benefits. Role-specific annual bonus 
arrangements are operated across the Group. For more senior roles, a portion of the bonus is deferred on a similar basis to executive directors. 
Only senior individuals who can have significant influence on the performance of the Group as a whole are invited to participate in the 
long-term incentive plans. This provides those individuals with an incentive to help achieve the Group’s medium and long-term objectives 
and create shareholder value, whilst ensuring their remuneration varies to the extent these goals are achieved.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The structure of remuneration for Board members was presented to shareholders in the Prospectus prior to Admission.
The Committee is mindful of shareholder views when evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy, and intends to appropriately 
consult with shareholders prior to any significant proposed changes to the remuneration policy.

The following table sets out the total remuneration for the executive directors for the year ended 31 December 2014. This comprises the total 
remuneration received over the full year from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014, including remuneration received from the Group prior to 
Admission and the incorporation of the Company on 12 June 2014.
As Spire Healthcare Group plc was a newly listed company during 2014, there is no disclosure in this report of prior year information.

2 The value of the Share Bonus Award is calculated at the date of Admission based on a share price of £2.10.
ADDITIONAL NOTES TO THE TABLE
SALARY
On Admission, the salary for the Chief Executive Officer was £525,000 and the salary for the Chief Financial Officer was £350,000, and their 
salary for 2015 remains unchanged.
BENEFITS
The benefits consist of private medical insurance (for the executive director and their family), permanent health assurance, life assurance  
and a car allowance. Under his contractual terms, Simon Gordon also has an annual health assessment (for himself and his spouse). 
Under his contractual terms, Rob Roger also has income protection cover.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The amount set out in the table represents the Group contribution to the directors’ retirement planning at a rate of 18% of base salary.  
Simon Gordon is a member of the the Spire Healthcare Pension Plan and Rob Roger has a personal pension scheme.
ANNUAL BONUS
The executive directors’ annual bonus targets were set at the beginning of the financial year, prior to Admission, and were amended on 
Admission by pro-rating to reflect the new circumstances of the company. The EBITDAR reported for the full year of £219.9m was ahead 
of the amended threshold target. Additionally, both Rob Roger and Simon Gordon achieved their strategic and personal objectives in full, 
including the successful delivery of the IPO, such that each has earned in total a bonus of 34.3% of their maximum potential annual bonus.
The Committee is satisfied that the resulting payments of £195,400 and £118,200 to Rob Roger and Simon Gordon respectively are fully 
merited. The performance targets in relation to the 2014 awards, which were set prior to Admission, are considered to be commercially 
sensitive. The Committee have implemented a revised bonus framework for 2015 (as set out on page 86). 
Two-thirds of the bonus will be paid in cash. The remaining one-third of the bonus in respect of 2014 will be deferred into shares under  
the DBP . These shares will be deferred for a period of three years, conditional on continued employment. These shares will remain subject  
to a malus provision.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
No awards under the LTIP vested in the 2014 financial year and, subsequently, no award is shown in the single figure table above. 
The first awards under the LTIP were granted on 30 September 2014. These awards were granted in the form of nil-cost options over Spire 
Healthcare Group plc shares, with the number of shares that may vest conditional on performance to the end of the 2016 financial year.  
The maximum award granted to executive directors was equivalent to 200% of base salary.
Shortly following Admission, the Committee considered the key long-term objectives over the 2014 to 2016 performance period. 
The Committee determined that the awards for the performance period to 31 December 2016 should be linked to the value created 
for shareholders over the period, and as a consequence that the awards should be equally weighted against relative TSR and EPS 
performance targets. Further details of the performance conditions are set out on page 84.

LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS – VARIABLE INCENTIVES RELATING TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO ADMISSION
As disclosed in the Prospectus, the Company granted, conditional on Admission, Accrued Incentive Payments and Share Bonus Plan Awards. 
These are legacy arrangements that were adopted and operated prior to Admission. These figures have been included in the single-figure 
table above in the interests of transparency; however, it should be noted that they relate to performance delivered prior to Admission.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENT – ACCRUED INCENTIVE PAYMENTS
Bonus awards were made to approximately 160 current and former employees of the Group, including the executive directors Rob Roger, 
Simon Gordon and Garry Watts (in respect of his pre-Admission role of Executive Chairman). Half of the award made to Simon Gordon was 
delivered in shares. All remaining awards were paid in cash. 
LEGACY ARRANGEMENT – DIRECTORS’ SHARE BONUS PLAN AWARDS
Awards were granted to Rob Roger, Simon Gordon and Garry Watts (in recognition of his performance in his pre-Admission role of Executive 
Chairman) to reflect their contribution to the Company prior to Admission. Details of these awards are set out below. In order to create further 
alignment with shareholders, these awards were made over shares in the form of nil-cost options and split into two equal tranches, which 
become exercisable on the first and second anniversary of Admission, respectively. 
Although these awards were made in recognition of services provided to the Company prior to Admission and, as such, are not subject to 
continued employment, the Share Bonus Awards will only remain exercisable in full if the 90 day average share price prior to the first and 
second anniversary of Admission is at least 359 pence. If, at the relevant anniversary, the average share price is at or below 224 pence then 
the number of shares in the relevant tranche, to which the awards relate, will be reduced by approximately 35%. Where the average share 
price at the relevant anniversary is between 224 pence and 359 pence then the proportion exercisable will be reduced on a pro-rata basis.
As the awards were made in respect of the period prior to Admission, they are not subject to continued employment, except in the case of 
dismissal for cause, and remain subject to the malus provisions detailed in the remuneration policy. The amounts shown in the single-figure 
tables is the minimum number of shares that may vest valued at the share price on Admission (210 pence). 
No further awards will be made under this arrangement.

provides remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with the Company that may impair their independence. During the

The Chairman, CEO, CFO and Simon Rowlands attended committee meetings by invitation in order to provide the Committee with additional 
context. The Company Secretary (or in his absence, the Deputy Company Secretary) act as the Committee’s secretary. No individual

LISTING ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
The Company’s registered office and principal place of business is  
at 3 Dorset Rise, London EC4Y 8EN. On 23 July 2014, the entire issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company was admitted to the premium 
listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority 
and to unconditional trading on the London Stock Exchange plc’s 
main market for listed securities.
DIVIDEND
The directors are recommending a final dividend in respect of 2014 
of 1.8 pence per ordinary share which, if approved by shareholders at 
the AGM, will be paid on 30 June 2015 to shareholders on the register 
at 5 June 2015.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The directors of the Company were all appointed in June 2014, prior 
to Admission to Listing and their biographical information is set out 
on pages 56 and 57 . All directors will retire at the AGM and offer 
themselves for re-election. Further information on the contractual 
arrangements of the executive directors is given on page 88. The 
non-executive directors do not have service agreements. 
POWERS OF THE DIRECTORS
The business of the Company is managed by the directors who 
may exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to any relevant 
legislation, any directions given by the Company by passing a special 
resolution and to the Company’s Articles of Association. The Articles, 
for example, contain specific provisions concerning the Company’s 
power to borrow money and issue shares.
APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS
Rules relating to the appointment and removal of the directors 
are contained within the Company’s Articles of Association.
DIRECTOR’S INDEMNITIES 
See page 65 in the Corporate Governance section.
AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The Company may only make amendments to the Articles 
of Association of the Company, by way of special resolution 
of the shareholders, in accordance with the Companies Act. 
EMPLOYEES 
The Group is an equal opportunities employer and is committed 
to creating an environment which will attract, retain and motivate 
its people, by creating a working environment in which individuals 
are able to make best use of their skills, free from discrimination 
or harassment, and in which all decisions are based on merit. Spire 
Healthcare employs people who consider themselves to have a 
disability (a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial 
and long term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal 
day to day activities). Employees who consider themselves to have 
a disability are under no obligation to inform their employer of this, 
however, we are fully aware of, and comply with, our obligations 
in accordance with the relevant provisions of The Equality Act 2010. 
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for 
employment from disabled persons. Should an employee become 
disabled during their employment with Spire Healthcare, every effort 
is made to enable them to continue their service with the Group.
Further information on our employees can be found in Our People 
on pages 42 and 43. 
POLITICAL DONATIONS AND EXPENDITURE
The Group made no political donations in the period since Admission. 
Although the Company does not make, and does not intend to make, 
donations to political parties, within the normal meaning of that 
expression, the definition of political donations under the Companies 
Act 2006 is very broad and includes expenses legitimately incurred as 
part of the process of talking to members of parliament and opinion 
formers to ensure that the issues and concerns of the Group are 
considered and addressed. These activities are not intended to 
support any political party and the Group’s policy is not to make 
any donations for political purposes in the normally accepted sense.
A resolution (continuing the approval granted by shareholders 
as part of the IPO) will therefore be proposed at the AGM seeking 
shareholder approval for the directors to be given authority to make 
donations and incur expenditure which might otherwise be caught 
by the terms of the Companies Act 2006. The authority sought will 
be limited to a maximum amount of £100,000.

SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS 
The following agreements are considered to be significant in terms 
of their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole 
and could alter or terminate on a change of control of the Group:
• the Group’s bank facility agreement contains provisions entitling 
the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the 
event of a change of control;
• there are a number of contracts which allow the counterparties 
to alter or terminate those arrangements in the event of a change 
of control of the Company. These arrangements are commercially 
sensitive and confidential and their disclosure could be seriously 
prejudicial to the Group; and

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
There have been no material events affecting the Group or Company 
since 31 December 2014. 
GOING CONCERN
On Admission on 23 July 2014, the Group refinanced its bank loan 
facilities with a facility that matures in 2019. The proceeds from the 
issue of new ordinary shares, existing resources and £425.0 million 
from the new term loans, were applied in the repayment of all of 
the existing bank loan and interest rate swap liabilities. Loans from 
former parent undertakings were settled through the issue of new 
shares in the Company.
The directors have considered the Group’s forecasts and projections, 
and the risks associated with their delivery, and are satisfied that the 
Group will be able to operate within the covenants imposed by the 
new bank loan facility for the foreseeable future. In relation to available 
cash resources, the directors have had regard to both cash at bank 
and a £100 million committed, undrawn revolving credit facility.
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing 
these financial statements.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITOR
Having made enquiries of fellow directors and of the Company’s 
auditor, each of the directors confirms that:
• to the best of their knowledge and belief, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
• they have taken all the steps a director might reasonably 
be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information. 
RE-APPOINTMENT OF AUDITOR
Resolutions for the re-appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the 
Auditor of the Company and to authorise the directors to determine 
its remuneration are to be proposed at the AGM. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (THE ‘AGM’)
The Annual General Meeting of Spire Healthcare Group plc will be

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts, including the consolidated financial statements 
and the Company financial statements, Directors’ Report, including 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Strategic Report in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. Under that law, the 
directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU.
Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under company law, the directors 
must not approve the financial statements, unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company on a consolidated and individual basis, and of the profit 
or loss of the Company on a consolidated basis for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• present information, including accounting policies, in 
a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs as adopted by the EU is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the Group’s and Company’s financial 
position and financial performance;
•  state that the Group’s and Company’s financial statements have 
complied with IFRSs as adopted by EU, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on a going-concern basis, unless  
it is not appropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions, and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the 
Company’s financial position and enable them to ensure compliance 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the Company’s assets and for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 
56 and 57, confirms that:
•  to the best of their knowledge, the consolidated financial 
statements and the Company financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give  
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company on a consolidated and individual basis;
•  to the best of their knowledge, the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company on  
a consolidated and individual basis, together with a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and
•  they consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014
OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED
We have audited the financial statements of Spire Healthcare Group 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and 
Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Group and 
Parent Company Cash Flow Statements and the related notes 1 to 
34. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
•  the Group and Parent Company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and for the Parent Company as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 92, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
OUR AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing 
our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit 
and on the financial statements. For the purposes of determining 
whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of 
misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the financial 
statements, would be changed or influenced.
We then determine a lower level of performance materiality 
which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce 
to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of 
uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a 
magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would 
be material for the financial statements as a whole. We determined 
materiality for the Group to be £4.2 million (2013: £3.6 million), which 
is calculated as 5% (2013: 5%) of adjusted profit before tax. We adjust 
the loss before tax as reported by the Group to exclude the impact of:
• exceptional items of £54.0 million (note 8 to the 
financial statements);
•  profit on disposal of hospital properties of £18.5 million 
(note 9 to the financial statements); and
•  interest on loans from former ultimate parent undertakings and 
management of £54.8 million (note 11 to the financial statements).
We exclude exceptional items and the profit on disposal of hospital 
properties with the intention of avoiding inappropriate fluctuations 
in our materiality from year to year as a result of non-recurring items 
that do not reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group. 
Similarly interest paid to the former shareholders prior to the Group 
being admitted to the London Stock Exchange on 23 July 2014 is 
excluded so that the pre-tax profit reflects the trading performance 
of the newly restructured Group. As a result of excluding these items, 
adjusted pre-tax profit from which we have calculated the 5% basis 
for materiality is £83.3 million.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that 
performance materiality for the Group should be 75% (2013: 75%) 
of materiality, namely £2.9 million (2013: £2.7 million), which reflects 
our assessment of the overall control environment and the history of 
no or very few audit adjustments. Our approach is designed to have 
a reasonable probability of ensuring that the total of uncorrected 
and undetected audit differences does not exceed our materiality 
of £4.2 million (2013: £3.6 million) for the financial statements 
as a whole.

T o the members of Spire Healthcare Group plc continued
We evaluated any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
The Group continues to operate solely in the UK and with common 
financial systems, processes and controls covering all of its operations. 
Two trading entities account for 96% of the Group’s revenue, 
and both were subject to full scope audits for the year ended 
31 December 2014. Two other non-trading entities were also included 
within full scope audit procedures, resulting in 96.3% of the Group’s 
revenue, 100% of the Group’s operating profit before exceptionals 
and 46.5% of the Group’s assets being covered through full scope 
audit procedures. 
Specific scope audit procedures were performed for 26 other entities, 
the majority of which comprise the Group’s head office and property 
functions and covered 52.6% of the Group’s asset base. These entities 
were selected for specific scope audit procedures for which the 
extent of audit work was based on our assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement and of the materiality of those locations 
to the Group’s business operations.
Combined full and specific scope audit procedures performed across 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014, covered over 99% 
of the Group’s revenue, 100% of the Group’s operating profit before 
exceptional items and 99% of the Group’s total assets. The audits of 
all these components are performed at a materiality level calculated 
by reference to a proportion of the Group performance materiality 
appropriate to the relevant scale of the business concerned. The 
components were allocated a performance materiality threshold 
ranging between £0.6 million and £2.9 million.
The audit of all of the components within the Group is undertaken 
by one audit team which is led by the senior statutory auditor. 
Due to the nature of the main risk areas noted below, the audit 
team is supported by experts in taxation, property valuations, 
and the evaluation of appropriate discount rates used within 
value-in-use calculations.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
We consider that the following areas present the greatest risk of 
material misstatement in the financial statements and consequently 
have had the greatest impact on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources and the efforts of the engagement team, including 
the more senior members of the team. This is not a complete list 
of all risks identified and addressed through our audit procedures. 
PRINCIPAL RISK AREA AND RATIONALE AUDIT RESPONSE
Revenue recognition
Consistent with the significant issues as identified by the Audit and 
Risk Committee, we considered that the complexity of the pricing 
structure, specifically the high volume of different procedures that 
are undertaken across the patient revenue streams creates a risk that 
systematic errors or manipulation of pricing could lead to an error in 
reported revenues (£856.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 
(2013: £764.5 million)). 
This risk is considered to be higher in recording PMI and NHS related 
revenues where the extent of pricing variations is most significant 
and requires clinical input as appropriate. 
The Group’s accounting policies themselves in respect of revenue 
recognition are not considered to present any significant risk of 
misstatement because revenue is recognised only on completion 
of medical procedures.
We identified the controls over the occurrence of revenue to 
be the most appropriate to test. The remaining audit procedures 
over revenue measurement and validation utilised a substantive 
approach. To address the risks of mis-statement in relation 
to the revenue recognition we performed a number of 
procedures, including:
• transactional level pricing validation was performed on a 
sample of invoices across the Group and agreed back to source 
pricing documentation and evidence of input from clinical 
review as applicable;
• post year end credit note testing to validate that pre year 
end revenue was not inappropriately recognised; 
• analysis of credit notes raised during through the period to 
consider if prior history indicated trends of errors in invoicing;
• consideration and support of any payor pricing disputes, or 
likelihood thereof, during the period to gain evidence that there 
was no material inappropriate billing during the period under 
review; and
• analytical review at a hospital level to consider unusual trends 
that could indicate material misstatement to revenue. 95

Financial Statements
Shareholder Information
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014
PRINCIPAL RISK AREA AND RATIONALE AUDIT RESPONSE
Goodwill carrying amounts
We focused on this area due to (i) the significance of the 
carrying value of the goodwill being assessed (£519.1 million as 
at 31 December 2014); and (ii) as a result of the level of subjectivity 
associated with the forecast assumptions which underpin 
management’s assessment of value-in-use, including the degree 
of subjectivity of cash flow forecasts, associated growth rates 
and the appropriateness of the discount rate applied.
We examined the Group’s forecast cash flows which underpin 
management’s impairment review. We tested the basis of 
preparing those forecasts taking into account the accuracy 
of previous forecasts and the historic evidence supporting 
underlying assumptions. 
Future cash flow assumptions were challenged through comparison 
of current trading performance, seeking corroborative evidence 
and enquiry with management in respect of key growth and 
trading assumptions.
The reasonableness of other key assumptions such as the discount 
rate and long term growth rate were tested with appropriate input 
from EY valuation experts and applying an independent assessment 
on general market indicators to conclude on the appropriateness 
of these assumptions.
We also tested the mathematical integrity of management’s 
model and carried out audit procedures on management’s 
sensitivity calculations.
We also tested management’s assessment on whether any 
reasonably possible change in these key assumptions would result 
in an impairment of goodwill and therefore require disclosure under 
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Appropriate recognition of deferred tax balances
We consider that the Group’s structure, including the changes arising 
during the year as a result of the Group reconstruction prior to IPO, 
results in there being a higher inherent risk associated with the 
calculation of current and deferred tax balances and the resulting tax 
position adopted by the Group. This is consistent with both the 
significant issue as identified by the Audit and Risk Committee and 
the significant judgement as set out in note 4 to these financial 
statements.
We consider that there is a level of estimation in assessing the tax 
base of the property portfolio for the purposes of calculating the 
associated deferred tax liability (£91.7 million as at 31 December 
2014). Such calculations are dependent on management’s assumption 
on use or possible disposal of properties in the future.
The scope for recognition of the Group’s deferred tax assets  
(£43.6 million as at 31 December 2014) in accordance with 
IAS 12, particularly in respect of available losses is also a 
matter of judgement. 
We considered the status of any recent and current tax audits and 
enquiries and reperformed management’s true up to the corporation 
tax calculations from the tax returns submitted for the prior year.
We understood and verified management’s assumptions supporting 
the calculation of the deferred tax liability arising in respect of 
the property portfolio. Through our enquiries with management, 
we assessed the appropriateness of how the carrying amounts 
are assumed to be recovered with regard to Group’s business 
plans and known developments.
In respect of both current and deferred tax, we tested 
management’s estimates of appropriate levels of allowed tax 
deductions where the final tax treatment is yet to be agreed by 
the relevant tax authority. This included examining any available 
correspondence with tax authorities or tax advisors at the time 
of our audit procedures to corroborate the treatment adopted 
by management.
We considered the appropriateness of the taxation disclosures 
made in the financial statements.
Treatment of costs directly attributable to the Group’s IPO
We considered the judgement management has exercised in 
appropriately presenting significant costs incurred in respect of the IPO.
Costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of new share 
capital may be allocated directly against share premium. This presents 
the risk that management may allocate costs to equity that are not 
directly attributable to the IPO, resulting a misstatement of profit. In 
addition costs directly incurred in raising new debt are required to be 
presented set off against the associated loan balance. This increases 
the risk that management may present costs in the balance sheet 
that are not directly related to raising new debt.
We also considered the classification of employee bonus charges 
and other expenses incurred as a consequence of the IPO process 
as exceptional.
We have audited costs that are reported by management to be 
related to the IPO and in particular tested management’s allocation 
of such costs that are presented as directly attributable to the 
share issuance (£11.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2014) 
or new debt (£5.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2014).
We also considered the appropriateness of presenting the other IPO 
related costs as exceptional costs (£46.1 million for the year ended 
31 December 2014) and concluded that such presentation was in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy and the relevant 
2013 FRC guidance. 96

Notes to the financial statements
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Spire Healthcare Group plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (collectively, ‘the Group’) owns and operates private hospitals and clinics 
in the UK and provides a range of private healthcare services.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on  
23 March 2015.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the UK 
(registered number: 9084066). The address of its registered office is 3 Dorset Rise, London, EC4Y 8EN.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(‘IFRS’) and on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value. 
GROUP REORGANISATION DURING 2014
Spire Healthcare Group Limited was incorporated on 12 June 2014 and was subsequently re-registered as a public company on 23 June 2014 
with the name Spire Healthcare Group plc.
With effect from 18 July 2014, the Company became the legal parent of Spire Healthcare Group UK Limited and Spire UK Holdco 2A Limited 
and their respective subsidiary undertakings. The Group was admitted to the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange on 23 July 2014 
(the ‘Admission’).
These companies were under common management and control throughout the years presented and, therefore, these financial statements 
have been prepared as if the reorganisation had taken place as at the beginning of the earliest year presented herein. 
The comparative financial statements comprised Spire Healthcare Group UK Limited and Spire UK Holdco 2A Limited, together with each 
of their subsidiaries, as included in note 18, and, until 17 January 2013, the comparative financial statements also included Spire UK Holdco 
1A Limited, Spire UK Holdco 3A Limited and their subsidiaries.
As the group reorganisation did not lead to a change in control of the companies included in the Group, it has been accounted for using the 
pooling-of-interest method by aggregating the assets, liabilities, results, share capital and reserves, after eliminating intercompany balances 
and unrealised profits. The financial information, therefore, reflects the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the components of the 
Group that constituted the property ownership and trading businesses. 
Transactions with Cinven Funds (the controlling party until Admission on 23 July 2014) and other entities under common control that were 
not acquired and, therefore, are not part of the Group, are disclosed as transactions with related parties (see note 33 for further information 
on related party transactions).
GOING CONCERN
On Admission on 23 July 2014, the Group refinanced its bank loan facilities with a facility that matures in 2019. The proceeds from the issue of 
new ordinary shares, existing resources and £425.0 million from the new term loans, were applied in the repayment of all of the existing bank 
loan and interest rate swap liabilities. Loans from former parent undertakings were settled through the issue of new shares in the Company.
The directors have considered the Group’s forecasts and projections, and the risks associated with their delivery, and are satisfied that, the 
Group will be able to operate within the covenants imposed by the new bank loan facility for the foreseeable future. In relation to available 
cash resources, the directors have had regard to both cash at bank and a £100.0 million committed undrawn revolving credit facility. 
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED
The principal accounting policies adopted are described below and were consistently applied for all periods presented, except as noted below.
Revenue recognition
The Group derives its revenue primarily from providing private health care services to both the public sector and private patients in the UK.
Revenue from charges to patients is recognised when the treatment is provided.
Interest income
Interest is recognised on an effective interest rate basis.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales principally comprises salaries of clinical staff, consultant and clinical fees, medical services and inventories, including drugs, 
consumables and prostheses.  103

Other operating costs
Other operating costs mainly comprise non-clinical staff costs, rent associated with properties leased under operating leases, depreciation, 
maintenance and running costs of properties and equipment. It also includes administrative expenses, including the provision of central 
support services, IT and other administrative costs. 
Operating profit
Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging exceptional items, 
as defined below.
Operating profit is adjusted to exclude exceptional items to calculate the Key Performance Indicator ‘Operating profit before exceptional 
items’, which is utilised in measuring performance before the impact of non-recurring, exceptional items in the income statement.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, either individually or in aggregate, need to be disclosed separately 
to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Consolidation
The results of all subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements. The results of subsidiary undertakings 
acquired during the period are brought into the accounts from the date of purchase, being the date on which the Group obtains control. 
The results of subsidiaries disposed of during the period are included in the accounts until the date of disposal or the Group’s control ceases.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
• power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); 
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
Business combination and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating costs. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation 
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquired 
businesses at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there 
is an indication that the value of the goodwill may be impaired.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or properties under construction. Other assets are depreciated so as to write off the carrying 
amounts of the assets over their expected useful lives, as follows: 
Freehold buildings and improvements – 5-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements –  lower of unexpired lease term or expected 
life, with a maximum of 35 years
Plant and machinery – 5-10 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 3-10 years
The expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and revised as appropriate. The review of the asset lives 
and residual values of properties takes into consideration the plans of the business and levels of expenditure incurred on an ongoing basis 
to maintain the properties in a fit and proper state for their ongoing use as hospitals and the forecast timing of disposal. 104

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014
  
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost means purchase price, less trade discounts, calculated on an 
average basis. Net realisable value means estimated selling price, less trade discounts, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement 
of cash flows.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,  
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost on an effective interest basis.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Pensions
The Group operates the Spire Healthcare Pension a defined contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those 
of the Group in independently administered funds.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Other employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A 
provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonuses if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes under which the Group receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of the options is recognised as an expense. Where the share awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group has used 
the Black Scholes valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. Where the share awards have total shareholder return (‘TSR’) market 
related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values (see note 28). 
The resulting fair values are recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
At the end of each year, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market conditions 
and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered to be an integral part of the grant 
itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate.
Leases
Leasing arrangements which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset 
had been purchased outright. The assets are included in tangible assets and depreciated over their estimated economic lives or over the term 
of the lease, whichever is the shorter.
The capital element of the leasing commitments is included in liabilities as obligations under finance leases. The lease rentals are treated 
as consisting of capital and interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligation and the interest element 
is charged to the income statement in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Taxation including deferred taxation
Total income tax on the result for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly 
in equity and other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable result for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for: 
• goodwill not deductible for tax purposes;
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and
• investments in subsidiary companies where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be used.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group may enter into derivative financial instrument arrangements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured to their  
fair value at each balance sheet date.
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting to such derivatives if the criteria for doing so are met.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised, in the same 
line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in other 
comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from share premium. 
Where the employee benefit trust purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders in both the Company and 
the Consolidated balance sheet until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS 
The following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations that are applicable to the Group and are effective from 1 January 2014 
and have been applied to these financial statements:
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
• IAS 32 Financial Instruments, Presentation (May 2012 annual improvements)
• IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting – Amendments to IAS 39
• IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32
These new and amended standards and interpretations did not have any significant effect on the financial position of the Group, or result in 
changes in accounting policy or any significant additional disclosure. There have been other new and amended standards and interpretations 
issued, or have come into effect, from 1 January 2014; however, they are not applicable to the Group and, hence, not included above. 106

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT YET APPLIED
The standards and interpretations issued, but only effective for annual periods beginning on, or after, 1 January 2015 or later, which are 
considered applicable and may have significant impact on the Group financial statements, are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt 
these standards, if applicable, when they become effective. 
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and 
hedge accounting. Subject to endorsement for use in the European Union, IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on, or after, 
1 January 2018, with earlier application permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. 
The impact of the standard on the Group’s performance and financial position will be evaluated.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers – The standard replaces all existing IFRS standards and interpretations that currently 
govern revenue recognition under IFRS and provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with 
customers. It does not apply to insurance contracts, to financial instruments or to lease contracts, which fall within the scope of other 
IFRSs. The standard also requires entities to provide users of financial statements with more disclosures. Subject to endorsement for 
use in the European Union, IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on, or after, 1 January 2017, and is to be applied retrospectively, 
with earlier application permitted. The impact of the standard on the Group’s performance and financial position is being evaluated.
4. SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, and estimates about the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following 
accounting policies have been identified as involving particularly complex judgements or subjective estimates:
JUDGEMENTS
• Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be available in future against which they can be 
utilised. Future taxable profits are estimated based on business plans which include estimates and assumptions regarding economic growth, 
interest, inflation rates and taxation rates.
The Group owns a portfolio of freehold and leasehold property interests. The Group has recognised a deferred tax liability in its financial 
statements in respect of capital gains tax and other taxes based on the assumption that a proportion of the freehold properties will be 
disposed of in future years, with the remaining properties being realised through use. This calculation requires judgement about the timing 
and number of the related property disposals, which is potentially impacted by changes to plans made by the business over time and, in 
particular, changes in business plans in respect of the holding or disposing of properties.
• Leases
In the determination of the classification of a number of leases over hospital properties as operating leases, assumptions have been made 
about the discount rate applied to the annual rent payable over the remainder of the lease term and of the useful economic life of the 
hospitals. Further information about commitments under these leases is given in note 29.
•  E x c ep t i o n a l i tem s 
Judgements are required as to whether items that are material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed as exceptional. 
Deciding which items meet this definition requires the Group to exercise its judgement. Details of these items categorised as exceptional 
are outlined in note 8.
ESTIMATES
• Estimation of useful lives and residual values
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives, taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives 
of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors 
such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments 
consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining lives of the assets and projected disposal values. The estimated useful 
lives of property, plant and equipment are set out in note 3.
• Goodwill
Goodwill is considered for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. This 
is achieved by comparing the value-in-use of the goodwill with its carrying value in the accounts. The value-in-use calculations require 
the Group to estimate future cash flows expected to arise in the future, taking into account market conditions. The present value of these 
cash flows is determined using an appropriate discount rate.
The assumptions considered to be most critical in reviewing goodwill for impairment are contained in note 16. 
• Share-based payments
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on  
the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

6. SEGMENTAL REPORTING
In determining the Group’s operating segment, management has primarily considered the financial information in the internal reports that 
are reviewed and used by the executive management team and the Board of Directors (in aggregate the chief operating decision maker) in 
assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. The financial information in those internal reports in respect of revenue 
and expenses has led management to conclude that the Group has a single operating segment, being the provision of healthcare services.
All revenue is attributable to and all non-current assets are located in the United Kingdom.
Revenue by wider customer (payor) group is shown below:
(£ million) 2014 2013
Insured 432.4 413.7

Corporate restructuring and financing costs – 3.5
Regulatory costs 4.0 5.0
7.9 11.5
Total exceptional costs 54.0 11.5
IPO RELATED
In July 2014, the Group was listed on the London Stock Exchange. The costs charged to the income statement relate to costs incurred  
as a result of the listing, but not directly related to the issues of new shares. These costs include such items as IPO bonuses, marketing 
expenditure, professional and other services. These costs were largely tax deductible. A deferred tax asset was recognised in relation 
to the share-based payments.
NON-IPO RELATED
In the year ended 31 December 2014, reorganisation and set up costs were mainly associated with the costs of acquisition of St Anthony’s 
Hospital, which as a material acquisition in the current year, has been treated as exceptional. Regulatory costs include costs relating to the 
Competition and Markets Authority (‘CMA’) enquiry and £3.3 million of estimated liabilities payable to third parties, arising from uninsured, 
or partly uninsured, claims for damages in respect of the supply of medical products and other legal claims made in respect of services 
previously supplied to patients. These costs were largely tax deductible except for the costs of acquisition of St Anthony’s Hospital.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, reorganisation and set up costs were mainly associated with the dual running IT costs and an onerous 
lease. Corporate restructuring and refinancing costs related to advisers’ fees associated with the sale of twelve property owning companies 
on 17 January 2013, subject to leases (‘2013 Freehold Sale’), and other refinancing activity. Regulatory costs mainly comprised the costs of 
the CMA enquiry.
9. PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
On 15 August 2014, the Group completed the disposal of the assets of Spire Fertility (Disposal) Limited (formerly London Fertility Centre 
Limited) for a consideration of £3.0 million. The assets had a net book value at the disposal date of £3.8 million.
On 11 March 2014, the Group completed the sale of a long leasehold interest in the land and buildings of the Spire Washington Hospital, 
Washington, Tyne and Wear, for a consideration of £32.3 million. The property and associated plant and equipment had a net book value 
at the disposal date of £12.3 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the profit on disposal included that arising on the 2013 Freehold Sale on 17 January 2013. 
Total consideration received was £704.0 million and the net cash proceeds of the transaction were used to repay bank borrowings 
and interest rate swaps.

Exceptional finance costs – 42.2
Total finance costs 85.9 196.1
Finance costs capitalised during the year were calculated based on a weighted cost of borrowing of 8% (2013: 8%).
Exceptional finance costs
In the year ended 31 December 2013, following the extension of the Group’s bank loan facilities, and reflecting the Group’s revised strategy 
for future re-financing, it was determined that the remaining interest rate swap contracts no longer met the criteria for hedge accounting 
and, therefore, the non-cash fair value of swap losses of £68.8 million, previously accumulated in the hedging reserve, were recycled to the 
income statement.
Other items arising in the year ended 31 December 2013 include a credit related to the partial waiver of bank debt and interest rate swap 
liabilities on settlement, net of the unamortised debt costs. This resulted in a total net credit of £26.6 million.
12. AUDITOR’S REMUNERATION

13. TAX ON LOSS continued
(ii) Factors affecting the tax credit
The effective tax assessed for the year, all of which arises in the UK, differs from the standard weighted rate of corporation tax in the UK. 
The differences are explained below:
(£ million) 2014 2013
Weighted rate of corporation tax 21.5% 23.25%
Loss before taxation (7.0) (51.9)
Tax credit on loss at weighted rate of corporation tax (1.5) (12.1)
Effects of:
Deferred tax released on disposal of property – (130.8)
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 10.4 20.1
Deferred tax credit on property assets (3.7) (12.2)
Non-taxable profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment (3.3) (10.8)
Movements on deferred tax asset previously not recognised (13.7) –
Difference in tax rates – 2.3
Adjustments to prior years (1.1) (9.1)
Other items (0.1) (1.5)
Total tax credit for the year (13.0) (154.1)
As at 31 December 2014, subsidiary undertakings of the Group have the following to offset against future trading profits:
• unused capital allowances of £277.6 million (31 December 2013: £237.6 million); and 
• unutilised losses totalling £155.5 million (2013: £117.2 million).
With effect from Admission, the Group was restructured. This allows the recognition, for deferred tax, of previously unrecognised losses 
and results in the overall tax credit for the year. 
The amounts described above relating to unused capital allowances and carried forward losses include amounts recognised as deferred tax assets.
14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares. For year ended 31 December 2014, the calculation is based on the 401,081,391 shares that were in issue on Admission on 
23 July 2014. For shares prior to the Admission date, as a proxy, the calculation is based on the 250,000,000 shares that were issued to Cinven, 
the former ultimate parent undertaking of the Group, and current and former management on Admission on 23 July 2014 in exchange for 
the liabilities to the former ultimate shareholders and management. 
For year ended 31 December 2013, the calculation is based on the 250,000,000 shares mentioned above.

15. BUSINESS COMBINATION
On 22 May 2014, the Group acquired St Anthony’s Hospital for a total consideration of £38.5 million. St Anthony’s Hospital is a 92-bed private 
hospital based in Cheam, Surrey. This acquisition supports the Group’s strategy of increasing its presence in the Greater London region. 
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities as at the acquisition date are set out below. Accounting standards permit up to 
12 months for provisional acquisition accounting to be finalised following the acquisition date, if any subsequent information provides 
better evidence of the item’s fair value at the date of acquisition.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014
15. BUSINESS COMBINATION continued
The total consideration of £38.5 million comprised of the following:
• a cash payment of £38.0 million, which was made in May 2014; and
• a deferred consideration contingent upon the working capital of the business on completion date. This amount was determined 
to be £0.5 million by the parties involved in August 2014 and the amount was settled at that time.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition primarily because of the geographical location of the established hospital, procurement and other 
synergies, relationships with consultants and other clinical personnel, as well as deferred tax liability recognition on the property. 
St Anthony’s Hospital contributed revenue of £19.2 million and an operating profit of £0.1 million in the period from the date of acquisition 
to the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2014, the first day of the financial year, revenue would have been £31.2 million. Management is 
not disclosing the profit or loss of the combined entity for the current reporting year due to impracticability, as this disclosure could potentially 
be misleading and does not reflect the actual results that would have arisen if the hospital had been trading under the ownership of the Spire 
Group. St Anthony’s Hospital was previously a not-for-profit organisation. 
Acquisition costs of £2.0 million have been expensed in the income statement.

The goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed annually for impairment or when there is an event that may indicate impairment. In the year, 
the Group’s goodwill in relation to an investment in a medical practice of £1.0 million was impaired following a CMA Final Order, whereby 
consultants are allowed to practise wherever they wish. The prior year’s impairment of £0.9 million relates to Spire Fertility (Disposal) Limited 
(formerly London Fertility Centre Limited), a business disposed of by the Group during the year. The directors do not believe that any further 
impairment is required in the financial period.
IMPAIRMENT TESTING 
Goodwill arose principally from separate acquisitions of two hospital businesses:
• £422.5 million from the acquisition of hospitals from Bupa in 2007; and
• £82.6 million on the acquisition of the Classic Hospitals Group in 2008.
The balance of £14.0 million arose on subsequent acquisitions.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is calculated by reference to its estimated value in use.
In order to estimate the value-in-use, management have used trading projections covering the four year period to December 2018, 
which were extended to cover the five year period to December 2019.

16. INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued
Management identified a number of key assumptions relevant to the value-in-use calculations, being revenue growth, which is impacted by an 
interaction of a number of elements of the operating model, including pricing trends, volume growth and the mix and complexity of discharges, 
assumptions regarding cost inflation and discount rates. These variables are interdependent and the forecast cash flows reflect management’s 
expectations based on current market trends. Revenue growth is projected to be in line with past experience and expectations of future 
performance, averaging 5.9% for the five year period (2013: 6.5%). Cost assumptions are consistent with the Group’s historic track record, 
after taking account of headline inflation at 3.3% (2013: 3.3%).
A long-term growth rate of 2.25% (2013: 2.25%) has been applied to cash flows beyond 2019, which is based on historic growth rates achieved 
by the sector, which have typically exceeded RPI. Pre-tax discount rates were based on the capital asset pricing model, utilising a sector specific 
Beta in arriving at the equity premium and cost of debt based on current bank lending rates. A specific pre-tax discount rate was calculated 
to reflect the profile of cash flows inherent to that specific cash-generating unit and this was 10.2% (2013: 10.2%).
The recoverable amount from acquisitions is calculated based on cash flow forecasts that reflect the assumptions stated above. A sensitivity 
analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. For example, an increase of 3% in the pre-tax 
discount rate to 13.2%, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments. Similarly, zero growth in the period beyond 
2019, with all other assumptions held constant or combined with a 1% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, did not identify any impairments.
As at the balance sheet date, it is not considered to be reasonably possible that circumstances will change, so that the key assumptions made 
in assessing the recoverable amount relating to each of the acquisitions will be revised to the point where the goodwill is considered impaired.

comprising a 5 year, £425.0 million term loan and a 5 year £100.0 million revolving facility. The proceeds of these facilities, together with 
existing funds of the Group, have been used in the full repayment of the existing bank debt and interest rate swap liabilities. The new 
loans are non-amortising and carry interest at an initial margin of 2.25% over LIBOR. On the same date, the amounts due to the former 
ultimate parent undertakings and management were capitalised in exchange for the issue of ordinary shares.
(b)    On 17 January 2013, following a partial refinancing of the Spire Group under the 2013 Freehold Sale, term loans with a total value 
of £606.4 million were either repaid or waived.
      On 18 December 2013, one of the Spire operating groups was refinanced, following which all of the liabilities outstanding under 
its bank facilities were repaid.

Presented as: 
Deferred tax asset – (17.1)
Deferred tax liability 48.1 77.4
48.1 60.3
Deferred tax on property, plant and equipment has arisen on differences between the carrying value of the relevant assets and the tax base. 
Other deferred tax items relate to temporary differences on non-specific provisions and expense accruals. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates 
that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2014 of £11.4 million, comprising £1.9 million of trading losses and 
£9.5 million of capital losses (2013: £17 .1 million, comprising £1.4 million of trading losses and £15.7 million of capital losses). A deferred 
tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these amounts due to uncertainties as to the timing of future profits that the trading 
losses could be set against and whether capital gains will arise against which the capital losses could be utilised.

28. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes for executive directors and other employees, all of which are equity settled. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle any of the options in cash. The total cost recognised in the income 
statement was £2.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: £nil). Employer’s NI is being accrued, where applicable, at the rate of 
13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate at the time the options are exercised, based on the share price at the reporting 
date. The total NI charge for the year was £0.9 million (2013: £nil).
The following table analyses the total cost between each of the relevant schemes, together with the number of options outstanding:

A summary of the main features of the scheme is shown below: 
DIRECTORS’ SHARE BONUS AWARD
At the time of the IPO on 23 July 2014, the Company granted nil cost share options to executive directors to reflect their contribution prior 
to Admission. The maximum number of shares underlying the awards total 1,671,200. Each award has been divided into two equal tranches, 
which will become exercisable on the first and second anniversaries of Admission. The number of options that will vest will depend on 
conditions relating to share price on the relevant date. For further details, see the Directors’ Remuneration Report, on pages 74 to 88
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The long term incentive plan (‘LTIP’) is open to executive directors and designated senior managers, and awards are made at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee. Awards are subject to market and non-market performance criteria and vest over a 2.4 year period.
DEFERRED BONUS PLAN
The deferred bonus plan is a discretionary executive share bonus plan under which the Remuneration Committee determines that 
a proportion of a participant’s annual bonus will be deferred. The market value of the shares granted to any employee will be equal  
to one-third of the total annual bonus that would otherwise have been payable to the individual. The awards will be granted on the  
day after the announcement of the Group’s annual results. The awards will normally vest over a three year period.

29. COMMITMENTS
(a) Operating leases
The Group had future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, as set out below:
2014 2013
(£ million)
Land and 
buildings Other
Land and

Not later than one year 61.9 0.7 56.3 –

Later than five years  1,353.0 – 1,340.9 2.2
1,658.9 2.1 1,626.9 2.9
On 17 January 2013, the Group sold twelve of its property-owning companies to a consortium of investors, comprising Malaysia’s Employees 
Provident Fund (EPF), affiliated funds of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group and Moor Park Capital. This sale involved varying the terms 
of lease agreements, which, until that date, had been in place between these property-owning companies and other operating companies 
in the Group. 
As a result of the sale, the Group has long-term institutional lease arrangements (up to December 2042, subject to renewal or extension), 
with the landlord for each of the 12 properties. The leases include key terms such as annual rental covenants and minimum levels of capital 
expenditure invested by the Group. Rent is indexed annually in line with RPI, subject to a floor of 0.0% and a cap of 5.0%. The capital 
expenditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period during the term of the leases, require the Group to incur, 
in total, £5.0 million of maintenance capital expenditure and £3.0 million of additional capital expenditure on the portfolio of 12 hospitals 
each year, such being subject to indexation in line with RPI.
(b) Consignment stock
At 31 December 2014, the Group held consignment stock on sale or return of £19.3 million (31 December 2013: £17 .6 million).
(c) Capital expenditure commitments
Capital commitments comprise amounts payable under capital contracts which are duly authorised and in progress at the balance sheet date. 
They include the full cost of goods and services to be provided under the contracts through to completion. The Group has rights within its 
contracts to terminate at short notice and, therefore, cancellation payments are minimal.
Capital commitments at the end of the year were as follows:
(£ million) 2014 2013
Contracted but not provided for 6.4 25.0 122

30. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Group had the following guarantees at 31 December 2014:
• Spire Healthcare Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Group, has entered into an Authorised Guarantee Agreement (AGA) with regard to 
the premises of the former customer contact centre at Victoria Harbour City, Manchester. Under the AGA, Spire Healthcare Limited will act 
as a guarantor to the new tenants until the end of the lease term, January 2016. The maximum contingent liability at the balance sheet date 
was £0.8 million (2013: £1.3 million).
• The bankers to Spire Healthcare Limited have issued a letter of credit in the maximum amount of £1.5 million (2013: £1.5 million) in relation 
to contractual pension obligations and statutory insurance cover in respect of the Group’s potential liability to claims made by employees 
under The Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969.
• Under certain lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010, the Group has given undertakings relating to obligations in the lease 
documentation and the assets of the Group are subject to a fixed and floating charge.
31. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objective is to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing to enable the Group to continue as a going 
concern, to continue the future development of the business and to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.
The Board closely manages trading capital, defined as net assets plus net debt. The Group’s net assets at 31 December 2014 were £960.0 
million (2013: £256.2 million net liabilities) and net debt, calculated as total debt (comprising obligations under finance leases and borrowings), 
less cash and cash equivalents, amounted to £424.3 million (2013: £670.9 million).
Principal focus of capital management revolves around working capital management and compliance with externally imposed financial 
covenants. Throughout the period, the Group complied with all covenants required by our lending group.
Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval 
by the Board. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group’s committed undrawn facilities, and cash and cash equivalents, were as follows:
(£ million) 2014 2013
Committed undrawn revolving credit facility 100.0 28.5
Cash and cash equivalents 74.5 111.5
32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• credit risk;
• liquidity risk; and
• market risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
The directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits 
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
• Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group’s exposure to credit risk 
from trade receivables is considered to be low because of the nature of its customers and policies in place to prevent credit risk occurring.
Most revenues arise from insured patients’ business and the NHS. Insured revenues give rise to trade receivables which are mainly due 
from large insurance institutions, which have high credit worthiness. The remainder of revenues arise from individual self-pay patients 
and consultants.

32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. 
This allowance is composed of specific losses that relate to individual exposures and also a collective loss component established in respect 
of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified, determined based on historical data of payment statistics.
Note 20 shows the ageing and customer profiles of trade receivables outstanding at the year end.
• Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in short-term money market deposits with large financial institutions, 
which must be rated at least Investment Grade by key rating agencies.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
Liquidity is managed across the Group and consideration is taken of the segregation of accounts for regulatory purposes. Short-term 
operational working capital requirements are met by cash in hand and overdraft facilities.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of at least 90 days, 
including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition to cash on demand, the Group has available the following lines of credit:
• £100 million of revolving credit facility, which was fully undrawn as at 31 December 2014.
The following are the contractual maturities, as at the balance sheet date, of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Bases of valuation
As of 31 December 2014, the Group did not hold financial instruments that are included in level 1, 2 or 3 of the hierarchy. Interest rate swaps 
existing on 31 December 2013 were repaid in full on Admission.
The management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their 
carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The carrying value of the other financial instruments, being finance leases and debt, is approximately equal to their fair value, except for 
floating rate debt, which is after the deduction of £5.1 million (2013: £1 million) of issue costs, based on a review of current terms against 
market and expected short term settlements. 
As at 31 December 2014, the Group did not hold any financial instruments measured at fair value.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, there were no transfers between the levels in the fair value hierarchy.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:
Liabilities measured at fair value
(£ million)
Value as at
31 December 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Interest rate swaps 74.5 – 74.5 – 
Financial liabilities at fair value using hedge accounting
Interest rate swaps – – – – 
74.5 – 74.5 – 
During the year ended 31 December 2013, there were no transfers between the levels in the fair value hierarchy.
MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings 
of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in market rates. This affects future cash flows from money market 
investments and the cost of floating rate borrowings.
From time to time, the Group considers the cost benefit of entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest 
rate volatility based on existing variable rates, current and predicted interest yield curves and the cost of associated medium term derivative 
financial instruments.
Interest rates on variable rate loans are determined by LIBOR fixings on a quarterly basis. Interest is settled on all loans in line with agreements 
and is settled at least annually.

Notes to the Parent Company financial statements
This section contains the notes to the Company financial statements.
The issued share capital is consistent with the Spire Healthcare Group plc Group financial statements. 
Refer to note 27 of the Group financial statements.
C1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union.
Spire Healthcare Group Limited was incorporated on 12 June 2014 and was subsequently re-registered as a public company 
on 23 June 2014 with the name Spire Healthcare Group plc.
The Company applies consistent accounting policies, as applied by the Group. To the extent that an accounting policy is relevant to both 
Group and Company financial statements, refer to the Group financial statements for disclosure of the accounting policy. Material policies 
that apply to the Company only are included as appropriate.
Spire has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the Income Statement 
of the Parent Company.
The Company did not have items to be reported as other comprehensive income; therefore, no statement of comprehensive income 
was prepared.
The profit attributable to the Company for the period ended 31 December 2014 was £36.1 million.
These financial statements have been prepared for the period from the Company’s incorporation, 12 June 2014, to 31 December 2014.
C2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THIS SECTION
INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment. In testing for impairment, the carrying 
value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs of disposal. The fair value is calculated using the 
same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 16 to the Group financial statements.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised by the 
Company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 
cost in subsidiary undertakings. The subsidiary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect 
the deemed capital contribution from the Company.
C3. KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS SECTION
IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiaries’ 
assets based on fair values calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 16 of the Group 
financial statements.
C4. STAFF COSTS AND DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The Company had no employees during the period, except for the directors. The information on compensation for the directors is disclosed 
in note C13.

LEASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH A CONSORTIUM OF INVESTORS

of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group and Moor Park Capital, in relation to the sale of twelve of the Spire Group’s property-owning 
companies on 17 January 2013. With effect from 17 January 2013, the total third-party annual commitments of the Group under these 
operating leases increased by £51.3 million per annum. 132
Financial Statements
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014
  
C11. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES continued 
As a result of the sale, the Group has long-term institutional lease arrangements (up to December 2042, subject to renewal or extension), 
with the landlord for each of the 12 properties. The leases include key terms such as annual rental covenants and minimum levels of capital 
expenditure invested by the Group. The capital expenditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period during the 
term of the leases, require the Group to incur, in total, £5.0 million of maintenance capital expenditure and £3.0 million of additional capital 
expenditure on the portfolio of 12 hospitals each year, such being subject to indexation in line with RPI. If the minimum capital expenditure 
levels are not met, the Group is required to enter into a recovery plan in order to comply with the covenants, but no default would be deemed 
to have occurred.
The Company is a party to this guarantee.
LEASE AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY CLASSIC HOSPITALS LIMITED
Under lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010 by Classic Hospitals Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company, the Company 
has undertaken to guarantee the payment of rentals over the lease term to August 2040, and to ensure that the other covenants in the lease 
are observed. The initial rentals payable under the leases in 2010 were £6.3 million per annum, which will be subject to an increase in future 
years. As part of these arrangements, the assets of the Company are subject to a fixed and floating charge.
C12. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The objective and management of the Company’s capital structure is consistent with the Group (see note 31 to the Group

“BOILER ROOM” SCAMS
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based “brokers” who target UK shareholders, using persuasive and 
high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams in what often turn out to be worthless, non-existent or high-risk shares in US or UK 
investments. These operations are commonly known as “boiler rooms”. 
A firm authorised by the FCA will not contact you out of the blue with an offer to either buy or sell shares.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. 
Always:
Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person contacting you is authorised by the FCA;
Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation;
Use the contact details from the Register to call them back – not those given to you;
Report the matter to the FCA by calling 0800 111 6768; and 
If the calls persist, hang up.
If approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams.

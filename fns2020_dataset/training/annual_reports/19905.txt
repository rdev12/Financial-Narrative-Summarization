Student Accommodation Operator of the Year 
UNITE won the inaugural RESI award for Student 
Accommodation Operator of the Y ear, recognising our 
achievements in delivering an exceptional student experience, 
profitable occupancy rates and the best management of our 
portfolios and assets nationally. The judges said: “UNITE 
observes a high standard of thought and care that the  
RESI industry in general should take on board.”
 
Secured six new sites
We secured six new development sites which will add 3,530 
beds to our portfolio. A turnkey development in Huddersfield 
opens in 201 4, while the other five development sites in 
Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Newcastle and two sites in London 
(Wembley and Islington), open in 2016.
 
Award-winning refinancing
In recognition of our Treasury Team’s achievements, including 
refinancing 66% of UNITE’s debt and increasing our unsecured 
borrowings, we won the Association of Corporate Treasurers 
UK Treasury Team of the Y ear Award for companies with  
a market cap below £2 billion. The judges said: “UNITE’s 
Treasury Team did a lot in a short space of time.”
 
Share placing
We completed a £5 1 million share placing in June that  
allowed us to secure new development sites in strong regional 
University cities. The three sites in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and 
Newcastle, together with a fourth site that is under offer, mean 
that the proceeds from the placing are now fully deployed.

1420-1 UNITE AR_1.Strategic_v14.indd   3 02/04/2014   17:59 In 2013 the business continued to build  
on the positive momentum of recent years. 
EPRA adjusted earnings per share increased 
to 18.0 pence, 13.6 pence excluding the 
UCC performance fee (201 2: 9.9 pence), 
and adjusted NAV per share (fully diluted) 
rose 9. 1% to 382 pence from 350 pence a 
year earlier. We are declaring a final dividend 
of 3.2 pence per share (201 2: 3.0 pence), 
making 4.8 pence for the full year (201 2: 4.0 
pence), a 20% rise. Including dividends, the 
business delivered a total return on equity  
of 10.5% for the year.
Importantly, the business’ performance has been  
based on continued improvements to service levels  
which further enhance our brand. Our most recent service 
satisfaction surveys again saw an increase to highest 
ever levels and we have clear plans in place to build  
on this further in 2014.
Alongside the delivery of a strong financial performance 
we also achieved a number of important milestones 
which will underpin growth in the coming years. We 
have transformed our capital base and created the 
capacity to expand our portfolio, further strengthened 
our operating platform and brand and grown our secured 
development pipeline meaningfully. All of these things 
give us confidence that our growth and performance 
are sustainable.
The basis of our continued progress remains our dedicated 
teams of people throughout the business. I would like to 
congratulate them on their achievements in 2013 and 
thank them for their continued significant contribution.
At Board level, Liz McMeikan joined us as a Non-
Executive Director in February 2014 and Richard Walker, 
who acts as Chair of both the Remuneration and Health 
and Safety Committees, will retire at the next AGM after 
nine years’ valued service. I would like to thank Richard for 
his contribution throughout his time on the Board and  
warmly welcome Liz.
Our market outlook is the most encouraging it has  
been for a number of years. Government policy is clearly 
supportive of increasing University enrolment, from which 
our investment portfolio and development pipeline are 
well positioned to benefit, and we are currently seeing 
little sign of inflationary pressure to our key input costs. 
We remain conscious of the risks inherent in a fragile 
economic recovery but look forward with optimism.

Market review 
Understanding our market 
Student intake in 2013/14 saw a 37,000 increase in UK 
and EU student enrolment year on year. This saw student 
numbers return to pre-201 1 levels following the slight dip 
in 2012/13 after Government changes to the University 
funding system and the allocation of places. There were 
677,000 applicants competing for 496,000 places, 
meaning that approximately 181,000 people failed to 
secure a place. This surplus of applicants over available 
places provides comfort that student numbers should be 
maintained at or above current levels in the future. As at 
31 January 2014, applications for the next academic year 
(2014/15) were up a further 4% year on year. 
The market has seen a continued increase in both 
non-EU and EU students choosing to study in the UK. 
There are currently 106,000 EU students in the UK, an 
increase of 55% in the last ten years, and EU applications 
for 2014/15 were up 5% (as at January 2014). We expect 
EU demand to remain healthy for the foreseeable future.
In recent years non-EU student numbers have grown 
steadily, with applications up 9% compared with 2010,  
and this has been achieved despite a tightening of student 
visa regulations. There are currently 268,000 non-EU 
students studying in the UK, representing 16% of total  
full-time students and 20% of full-time students requiring 
accommodation. The UK has a 13% share of the global 
international student market and if this share is maintained 
a recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) forecast suggests an additional 
250,000 non-EU students could be studying in the UK  
by 2025.
In his 2013 Autumn Statement, the Chancellor announced 
his intention to fund an additional 30,000 University places 
for 2014/15 and to remove the student number cap 
completely from 2015, which the Treasury anticipates 
could lead to an increase in enrolments of up to 60,000 
(12%) UK and EU students, compared to current levels. 
We have not yet factored this into our forecasts.

Market review continued 
Taking into account the above factors, longer term we 
expect demand for UK Higher Education to remain strong, 
both from domestic and international students. Stronger 
Universities, where UNITE has concentrated its activities, 
are well placed to benefit from the greater level of market 
forces in the sector and we expect all strong University 
towns and cities to experience sustained growth.
The significant growth in full-time student numbers over 
the past 20 years has led to a significant demand/supply 
imbalance in the student accommodation sector and this 
is likely to remain, and potentially widen, over the next  
few years. New accommodation supply is likely to be 
constrained for some time due primarily to lack of capital 
and although this will ease as credit conditions improve 
and regional economies recover, it is unlikely that the rate 
of new supply will keep pace with the overall growth in 
student numbers in stronger towns and cities.
The significant growth in full-time 
student numbers over the past  
20 years has led to a significant  
demand/supply imbalance in the 
student accommodation sector. 
As a result of the favourable demand/supply dynamics 
we continue to believe that the rental growth outlook  
will be positive for some time. We have forecast rental 
growth of 3% for 2014/15 and consider the outlook to 
be positive thereafter. Our view of rental growth could be 
further positively affected by the planned removal of the 
student number cap from 2015/16 referred to above.  
If implemented, this could lead to a substantial rise in 
student numbers at a time when the level of new 
accommodation supply is still constrained and, again, 
stronger Universities are going to be best placed  
to benefit.
New competitors have entered the sector over the past 
two to three years and others are likely to do so in due 
course. However these operators tend to lack scale, which 
we believe places them at a disadvantage. At the same 
time, a number of longer standing competitors face certain 
financial challenges which are likely to restrict their ability 
to grow and invest in their businesses for the long term. 
Against this backdrop, and with a positive market outlook, 
we believe it is vital that we invest carefully in enhancing 
our brand and service platform to create genuine, 
sustainable competitive advantage. This will then form  
the basis of continued positive performance in the  
longer term.

1420-1 UNITE AR_1.Strategic_v14.indd   10 02/04/2014   17:59 Contribution of students to the UK economy 
Higher Education contributes £1 7 .5 billion to the UK economy. Student numbers have returned to pre-201 1 
numbers, their highest ever levels, and the number and quality of leading Higher Education institutions in 
the UK continue to make it an attractive destination for both international and EU students. With student 
numbers forecast to rise further following the Government’s decision to remove the number cap from 2015, 
the value students bring to the UK economy is likely to grow.

Chief Executive’s strategic review 
A year of progress 
Throughout 2013 we continued to deliver the clear, 
consistent strategy that has underpinned performance  
since 2010. This strategy has been based on three priorities:
• To grow recurring profit and cash flow through a 
combination of rental growth, new openings and cost 
savings, while building an increasingly strong brand
• To enhance portfolio quality through a programme of 
highly selective developments, focusing on London and 
strong regional locations, together with the disposal of 
non-core assets, and
• To strengthen the Group’s capital base.
We made good progress on all fronts and this is reflected 
in our key financial indicators:
Financial highlights

NPC £25.6m £19.1m
EPRA earnings per share 18.0p 9.9p
Adjusted earnings per share (pre 
UCC performance fee)

Total return (NAV growth plus 
dividends) 10.5% 1 1.3%
See-through LTV ratio 49% 52%
Operating cash flow £23.2m £17.2m
The business has now delivered an average total return on 
equity of 10.4% per annum over the past four years. This is 
in line with our stated objective of delivering low double digit, 
balanced total returns and has been achieved against a 
difficult economic backdrop. 
Adjusted earnings (pre UCC performance fee) now account 
for 37% of returns, compared to 6% in 2010, and we are on 
track to achieve our strategic target of a 4.5% EPRA EPS 
yield on opening NAV for 2015. Dividends for the full year 
are 4.8 pence per share, a 20% increase on 2012, and  
are 2.7 times covered by operating cash flow.

Capital structure
The substantial progress we made in 201 3 with our financing 
activity was particularly encouraging. Across the course of the 
year our team secured £ 1. 1 billion of new debt facilities either 
on behalf of co-investment vehicles or on the UNITE balance 
sheet, with a further £124 million arranged since the year 
end that has brought our principal refinancing activity to  
a conclusion. This has enabled us to take advantage of 
historically low interest rates for the longer term while  
also improving the diversity and flexibility of our funding. 
Taking into account the post year end activity, our average 
cost of debt is now 4.7% (2012: 5.5%), materially accretive 
to ungeared investment yields at an average 6.5% and 
development yields at 9- 10%. The weighted average 
period to expiry has been extended to 7.1 years (2012: 4.1 
years), providing certainty of financing costs for the longer 
term. Our loan-to-value ratio fell to 49% from 52% at 
December 2012 and we intend to continue reducing  
this over time towards 40% as future capital growth and 
development profits increase the Group’s equity base.
Simplification of our co-investment vehicles remains a priority 
for 201 4. In December we crystallised our UCC performance 
fee which will be re-invested into additional units and increase 
our stake in UCC from 30% to 34%. We are progressing  
the planned sale of our OCB joint venture, the proceeds of 
which will be invested in increasing our stake in UCC 
further, and once our stake in UCC reaches 50% it will 
be merged with LSAV, thereby reducing the number of 
co-investment vehicles from four to two. We have entered 
into an exclusivity agreement with a credible prospective 
purchaser of the OCB assets at a level supportive of current 
valuations. Due to its relative complexity, the planned sale 
has taken longer than originally expected but we are 
confident that a sale will be concluded later in 2014.
Portfolio activity
In June we raised £51.2 million of new equity by way of a 
share placing to part-fund a highly targeted £125 million 
regional development programme. We have subsequently 
made very good progress in committing this new capital 
with approximately 70% already committed to three new 
12 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1420-1 UNITE AR_1.Strategic_v14.indd   12 02/04/2014   17:59 projects, subject to planning and expected to be delivered 
in 2016. The remainder is allocated to a fourth project 
where we are in exclusive negotiations. The prospective 
returns from this activity are attractive, with yields on cost 
in the region of 9.5% to 10%.
This regional development programme supplements our 
ongoing London development activity being undertaken by 
LSAV, our 50/50 joint venture with GIC. LSAV also made 
good progress in the year with additional sites and planning 
consents secured. Its target £330 million development 
programme is now 60% committed with all funding in place 
and returns expected to be in the region of 9% yield on cost.
The combined effect of our London and regional 
development programme on future growth prospects is 
significant. If our return expectations are achieved, the 
secured development pipeline will add 39 pence (10%)  
to adjusted NAV per share and 13 pence per share (96%) 
to recurring EPRA EPS once completed. Projects where 
the Group is in exclusive negotiations could add a further  
6 pence and 1 pence to NAV per share and EPS respectively.
Development costs in London are increasing (both  
for land and build) whereas in strong regional locations 
they remain low and are currently showing little sign of 
inflation. As a result of this and the encouraging demand 
outlook we currently favour new development in strong 
regional locations over London. We expect these 
favourable conditions to persist in the regions for  
the next 12 to 18 months.
Investor interest in the student accommodation sector is 
broadening and deepening and 2013 was another year of 
healthy transaction volumes. We expect to see continued 
activity throughout 2014 and this is likely to translate into 
stronger yields as the year progresses. However the relative 
lack of liquidity in the sector when compared to other sub 
sectors of the property market mean that yield movements 
in general are likely to lag the wider market to some extent.
Brand and operating platform
Over the past few years we have increased the levels of 
recurring profit and cash flow from our operating business 
materially, evidenced most clearly by the increase in NPC 
from £4.1 million in 2010 to £25.6 million in 2013. Over 
this period the operational portfolio has only increased  
in size by 3%; the improvement in profitability has been 
delivered through a combination of rental growth, portfolio 
recycling and cost efficiences. However, most importantly 
our improvements have been supported by consistent 
enhancements to service levels.
Our cost base has been tightly controlled but has 
significant capacity. Since 2010, our NOI margin has 
improved from 69.8% to 71.4% and net overheads (after 
deducting fees received from co-investment vehicles) 
have fallen by 25%, from £1 1.2 million to £8.4 million. 
These efficiency gains have been achieved without 
impairing operational capacity and we continue to  
believe that our operating platform is capable of managing 
approximately 60,000 beds at minimal additional cost. 
Service satisfaction levels again increased to highest  
ever levels in 2013, reflecting students’ appreciation of  
the improvements we have made. Targeted investments in 
technology and processes, such as mobile working, have 
allowed us to free up front-line staff to spend more time on 
high customer impact duties, such as longer opening hours 
and more rapid maintenance response, while also reducing 
overall operating costs. We have also invested consistently 
in our estate, including the installation of high speed Wi-Fi 
throughout our buildings and our ongoing lifecycle investment 
programmes, again improving customers’ experiences.
For 2014 we have a clear plan of further upgrades to our 
service proposition, all of which is deliverable within the 
framework of our financial plans. These improvements 
are built on our brand promise to provide a ‘Home for 
Success’ and we are confident that they will further 
differentiate us positively from our competitors.
Outlook
The substantial progress we have made in the areas of 
capital structure, portfolio quality and operating platform 
combine to support our growth prospects for the next few 
years. We have a strong capital base, attractive secured 
development pipeline, scalable operating business and 
market leading brand.
At the same time, the market outlook for the student 
accommodation sector is the most positive that it has 
been for a number of years. UCAS applications data 
shows an increase in University applications of 4% year 
on year and applications from non-EU students and UK 
school leavers, both core markets for UNITE, are at record 
highs. Government policy is supportive of rising student 
enrolment, Universities are increasingly looking to the 
private sector for solutions, investor interest is increasing 
and development costs remain comparatively low. 
The performance of the business in the early part of 201 4 
supports this outlook. In particular, reservations for 201 4/15 
stand at 64% (2013: 62%) and we are experiencing 
increased demand from all customer segments (re-
bookers, new customers and University referrals) through 
both on-line and off-line channels. Pricing is supportive of 
our 3% rental growth guidance for the full year, our cost 
reduction activity has been largely concluded and we 
have three new properties on schedule to be opened for 
the 2014/15 academic year. The combination of these 
factors gives us confidence that in 2014 we will continue 
to deliver strong performance and growth.

Business model and strategic priorities
Creating long-term value 
Creating long-term value 
Our focused business model seeks to deliver low double digit returns and sustainable, growing cash flows  
by being the most trusted brand in the sector, having the highest quality portfolio and maintaining a strong 
capital structure. Maintaining strong relationships with University partners, customers and employees is  
also crucial to our success.
Operations
Our Operations business unit is responsible for running our 130 
properties, including those managed and operated on behalf of  
our co-investment vehicles. Operations adds value by:
• Delivering operating cash flow, net portfolio contribution and profit through 
rental income and delivery of our service platform
• Differentiating UNITE from its competitors by ensuring our service meets and 
exceeds the needs of students and Universities and provides a safe and secure 
environment for students and employees alike
• Delivering sustainable annual growth in rental income and profits, increasing 
the value of our investment portfolio
• Ensuring our infrastructure is able to support cost saving and  
service improvement initiatives such as mobile working
• Earning a management fee for operating all properties on behalf  
of our co-investment vehicles.
We measure progress in this business unit through earnings per share, operating 
cash flow, customer satisfaction, Higher Education trust and safety benchmarks 
each year. 
Property
Our Property business unit is responsible for our development  
and asset management strategy as well as overseeing the fund 
management processes for each of our four co-investment vehicles. 
The Property business adds value by:
•  Identifying and managing the delivery of new development opportunities to 
promote sustainable growth 
•  Maintaining and enhancing the value of our investment assets through targeted 
asset management activities
• Identifying and managing asset disposal opportunities, generating capital for 
re-investment into the portfolio, new development activity.
The key metric for the Property business is net asset value (NAV) per share.

Building on our achievements 
Sales, rental growth and profitability 
Our strong performance continued throughout 2013, 
resulting in a £6.5million, 34% increase in NPC to 
£25.6 million compared to last year (2012: £19.1 million). 
This growth has been driven by high occupancy, rental 
growth and the impact of portfolio movements as well 
as operational efficiencies and ongoing cost discipline. 
Adjusted profit (pre UCC performance fee) increased  
by £7.2 million to £23.1 million or 13.6 pence per share 
compared to 2012 (December 2012: £15.9 million, 
9.9 pence per share).

Total income from the managed portfolio increased to 
£240.7 million (2012: £240.2 million) driven by rental 
growth and increased occupancy, offset by the reduction 
in the number of managed beds as a result of non-core 
disposals.
The Group’s NOI margin increased to 71.4% from 71.0% 
in December 2012 as we delivered further efficiencies 
and productivity improvements, while improving our 
service and the quality of our estate through targeted 
investment. Overheads reduced by 13% to £19 million  
as a result of the full year impact of efficiency savings 
flowing through and our key overhead efficiency measure 
(total operating expenses less management fees as a 
proportion of UNITE’s share of investment asset value) 
has also benefited from these efficiencies, having now 
2013 has been a year of achievement for UNITE, from which we look to build 
on in the coming year. Our recurring profit has been transformed from a loss  
of £5.4 million five years ago to a sustainable £25.6 million which is largely 
cash backed, our customer service is improving and is consistently strong 
across the business, we are working more closely and effectively with our 
Higher Education partners, and reservations for the next academic year are 
ahead of this time last year. Most importantly, we’ve achieved all this alongside 
our highest ever customer and employee satisfaction scores. 
The majority of UNITE’s 1,000 employees sit within our Operations business 
unit and they are key to our success. We delivered substantial efficiencies and 
operational improvements during 2013, the scale of change which can cause 
staff to become dejected. However, the outstanding people within UNITE have 
embraced the changes. In 2013, we provided a clear career path through 
accredited training courses, introduced timesaving technology and taught staff 
the real skills required to deliver outstanding customer service. 
Our processes and technology were also a focus during 2013. Perhaps our 
most significant step change was the installation of high speed Wi-Fi 
throughout all our properties, an important milestone and considered to be a 
hygiene factor by our customers. We reviewed all our key processes through 
the lens of customer service to ensure they are effective and efficient and used 
technology to remove administrative burden, making us an easier company to 
do business with. 
Looking ahead, we will continue the work we started in 2013 with further 
investment in our digital offering, our service platform and our brand. We 
do this in the context of positive investor sentiment towards the student 
accommodation sector and favourable Government policy following two years 
of funding cuts, fee increases and uncertainty. Our activity over the next 24 
months will further differentiate UNITE and ensure we provide a home for 
success – a place that students seek out because we help them achieve 
more in their University life.

MD Operations 
fallen to 61 bps (December 2012: 92 bps), in line with our 
target of 60 bps. This will deteriorate marginally when we 
exit our OCB joint venture and increase our stake in UCC 
but we intend to maintain 60 bps as our ongoing target.
Finance costs (comprising interest and lease payments) 
fell to £47 million (2012: £48.5 million), reflecting the fall 
in the Group’s average cost of debt as various refinancing 
events were completed while development pre-contract 
and other costs fell £0.7 million to £2.5 million. EPRA 
earnings includes a one-off receipt of £7.5 million 
performance fee from UCC following the completion  
of refinancing within the joint venture.
Occupancy and rental growth
Occupancy across UNITE’s portfolio for the 2013/14 
academic year stands at 98% and like-for-like rental 
growth of 3% was achieved on our stabilised portfolio. 
The number of students enrolling at UK Universities 
increased by 37,000 on 2012/13 levels, recovering  
much of the previous year’s drop and contributing to  
the overall strong occupancy and rent performance.
Reservations for the 2014/15 academic year are 
encouraging, standing at 64% (62% at the same point last 
year), and recent Government announcements together 
with the continued attraction of the UK as a destination  
for international students, suggest a further increase in  
the number of new students next year of around 20,000. 
This provides us with further confidence in occupancy  
and rental levels for the 2014/15 academic year, which  
we again expect to show rental growth of around 3%.
Investment in people, technology  
and relationships
Over the past few years we have invested carefully in 
building and retaining the expertise of our staff; utilising 
technology as a way to both enhance service levels and 
reduce operating costs; and in increasing and maintaining 
our profile in the University sector, building on the strong, 
long standing relationships we have in a number of cities. 
Building on our long track record in the sector, these 
investments have formed strong foundations from which 
we will continue to build our brand.
People
The knowledge, commitment and competence of our staff 
base continues to be at the heart of our performance,  
and during 2013 we made further investments in learning 
and development to provide clear career progression 
opportunities for all roles and grades. The empowerment  
of our teams, has progressed further, with city managers 
encouraged to make the right decisions for students to 
improve the experience of living with UNITE, and this has 
been reflected in our highest ever customer satisfaction 
scores, in both our Spring and Autumn independent surveys.
Technology
We have made further improvements to our online 
booking platform throughout the year, driving additional 
visits and bookings. Similarly, the latest iteration of our 
mobile working device for service teams has reduced 
more time-consuming activity, and provided clarity and 
transparency to customers regarding inspections, 
maintenance requests, and room charges.
University relationships
The creation of our specialist University Partnerships 
Team at the start of 2013 is proving successful, with 
stronger relationships now in place with our most 
significant University partners and new relationships 
being established. This has opened doors for more 
strategic discussions about future ways of working.
Our presence in the Higher Education sector has become 
yet more substantial, and we have presented or spoken at 
a wide range of events and conferences, and launched 
high-profile research publications undertaken in-house, 
which have stimulated healthy levels of interest and 
engagement from Universities and sector groups. We will 
build on this further in 2014.
Student numbers 
Around 37,000 more students started degrees in the 
2013/14 academic year than the year before, substantially 
reversing the drop seen in 2012/13. This was partly due to 
the Government’s relaxation of the student number caps 
applied to University enrolment but also the positive impact 
of deferrals returning to normalised levels. Acceptances 
were up year on year across all student groups, with UK and 
non-EU students showing the healthiest increases, further 
underlining the structural robustness of the student sector.
Operations outlook
Our Operations business continued its strong 
performance against all key measures throughout 2013. 
High occupancy, consistent rental growth and portfolio 
recycling, combined with the successful embedding of 
cost efficiencies, continued to drive sustainable profit 
growth, alongside further improvements to service levels 
and the experience we provide for our students.
We are continuing to invest in our operating platform and 
expanding our digital presence, recently launching new 
smartphone apps and online community features to 
further increase the strength of our brand and competitive 
advantage. Having completed the installation of Wi-Fi 
throughout all our properties in the summer of 2013, we 
are looking to increase broadband speed significantly for 
the new academic year, and have also appointed a partner 
to install LED lighting across our portfolio over the next 
two years. This will reduce our operating costs and carbon 
footprint while further improving our students’ experience. 
As the student accommodation market continues to 
mature, the combination of our continued investment in 
brand and service driving rental growth, coupled with a 
growing portfolio as new properties are completed, will 
underpin further profit growth for 2014 and we continue 
to target a 4.5% EPS yield for 2015.
“Our activity  
over the next 24 
months will further 
differentiate UNITE 
and ensure we 
provide a home  
for success…”

NAV growth
Adjusted NAV per share increased by 9.1% to 382 pence 
(on a fully diluted basis) at 31 December 2013, up from 
350 pence at 31 December 2012. In total, adjusted net 
assets were £682 million at 31 December 2013, up from 
£567 million a year earlier.
The main factors behind the growth in adjusted NAV per 
share were:  
• The growth in the value of the Group’s share of 
investment assets (+ 16 pence), as a result of rental 
growth, some yield compression and asset specific 
write downs associated with the disposal of legacy 
NHS assets;
• The value added to the development portfolio 
(+14 pence)
• The impact of financing activity (-6 pence), related 
primarily to swap breakage costs, partially offset by  
the positive impact of our convertible bond issuance
• The positive impact of retained profits after dividends 
(+14 pence)
• The impact of the £50 million equity issue in June 
(-6 pence). 
Looking forward, our portfolio is well placed to deliver 
continued growth. Our focus on the strongest University 
locations underpins rental growth prospects and we 
will continue to deliver meaningful upside from our 
development activity. We have three projects, comprising 
1,555 beds and accounting for approximately 70% of  
the proceeds of our June share placing, secured under 
contract in strong regional locations and are in exclusive 
negotiations on a fourth. In addition, 60% of our target 
LSAV pipeline has also been secured across three 
London projects comprising 2,350 beds. 
In total, our secured pipeline is expected to deliver 
39 pence per share of NAV uplift once completed if 
expected returns are achieved (UNITE share). Projects 
where the Group is in exclusive negotiations could add  
a further 6 pence. The development pipeline will have  
an even more significant positive impact on EPS once 
delivered with the secured projects adding 13 pence  
and those where the Group is in exclusive negotiations  
a further 1 pence.
Property portfolio
The valuation of our property portfolio at 31 December 
2013, including our share of gross assets held in USAF 
and joint ventures, was £1,370 million (31 December 
2012: £1,245 million). The £125 million increase in 
portfolio value was attributable to £76 million of capital 
expenditure less disposals of £14 million and £63 million 
of valuation increases. The valuation of the stabilised 
investment portfolio increased by 3.0% on a like-for-like 
basis over the year, primarily as a result of rental growth.

Our Property business unit comprises Asset Management and Property 
Development, who support our operational colleagues in maximising our 
existing portfolio as well as seeking out new opportunities for growth. I also 
look after our Fund Management team who manage our four co-investment 
vehicles. Our Property business has had the same core team for the last ten 
years; we are a lean operation of 22 people. This same ten-year period has 
seen a great deal of volatility in the property sector, but the team’s wealth of 
expertise and the strong fundamentals of the student accommodation sector 
have enabled UNITE to take full advantage of market conditions. 
While tentative signs of general economic recovery slowly felt during 2013, the 
Higher Education sector demonstrated good fundamentals with a bounce back 
in student numbers for the 2013/14 academic year which brought overall 
student levels back in line with those seen in 201 1. Against this positive 
backdrop, demand for exposure into purpose built student accommodation 
increased too. Our development activity continued to build strong momentum 
both in London and also across the UK. We secured several new projects in 
London, through our JV with GIC, which are high quality locations and will be 
significantly accretive to returns. Overall, these projects will account for around 
60% of the capital we’ve identified for deployment into development activities. 
Timing for these and prior years’ acquisitions was strong. Subsequently, 
London is displaying development cost inflation and an increase to barriers to 
entry. In response to this, our strategy evolved to include wider UK development 
projects and we’ve made good progress in building a high quality pipeline of 
future projects, accounting for the full proceeds raised over the summer for 
this purpose .  
Our asset management saw UNITE’s remaining non-core assets sold or 
contracts exchanged. Our portfolio is now 100% student accommodation. Four 
refurbishment or extension projects were undertaken in the year, which 
alongside other initiatives delivered an NAV upside of around £7 million.  
This proven track record in challenging conditions positions us well for the 
future as we continue to feel the impact of economic recovery. With the market 
outlook strengthening in terms of student numbers, investor interest in the 
student accommodation sector and regional development costs still low, I’m 
confident the energy and expertise of my team will continue to give UNITE 
clear competitive edge.

The proportion of our property portfolio that is income generating decreased to 86% from 93% at December 2012, 
with 14% now under development. This reflects the progress with our 2014 and 2015 development programme as well 
as the commitment of capital to 2016 deliveries. The development weighting will continue to increase over the next 
year as our activity in this area accelerates and our remaining non-core investment assets are sold. We expect the 
development weighting to peak at approximately 20% in 2015.

The investment portfolio is split between London (41%) and the rest of the UK (59%). At the beginning of the year, 
London projects would have represented approximately 50% of the UNITE portfolio on a built out basis. However, the 
acceleration of our regional development activity during 2013 means that our built out London weighting has fallen 
marginally to around 48% by the year end.
We currently favour new development in strong regional locations over London and as a result it is likely that our built 
out London weighting will fall further, to around 40%, as our regional development pipeline expands.

Our risk management framework
Embedding a risk  
management culture 
Our Group strategy targets low double digit returns with 
low risk. The Board, when setting the Group’s strategy 
and overseeing its implementation, also determines the 
nature and extent of the significant risks in this strategy 
and ensures that sound risk management and internal 
control systems are in place commensurate with the risk. 
The Board undertakes a formal risk review at least twice  
a year at Group Board meetings. This involves a thorough 
risk review of UNITE’s material risks (presented by the 
Risk Committee’s Chair, Joe Lister) and also serves as an 
opportunity to step back and consider any emerging risks. 
The culture of the organisation, set by the Group Board,  
is to ensure ‘Risk Trackers’ are maintained which clearly 
scope out the risks and their impact, and assign an 
accountable person to own and manage each risk.  
This risk tracking approach is embedded within UNITE 
and leads to a real, tactile and substantive approach  
to risk management.
Risk and Impact How we manage the risk Change from  last year What happened in the year
Market risks 
Changes in Government policy  
(such as on HE funding and 
immigration) may affect student 
numbers and behaviour. 
May reduce demand and hence 
profitability and asset values.
On-going monitoring of Government 
policy and its impact on, and 
forecasts of, student numbers whilst 
in parallel regularly reviewing our 
portfolio to ensure we are 
appropriately sized in the right 
locations. 
Student numbers in the UK recovered strongly 
after disruption in Government policy changes 
affected the 2012/2013 University year. 
Occupancy of 98% for 2013/2014 academic 
year, compared to 96% in 2012/2013, 
demonstrates this recovery in student numbers 
is translating into occupancy. 
Underlying demand for HE study in the UK 
remains extremely strong (the UK continues  
to be the 2nd most popular).
To read more go to page 9.
Significant volume of new entrants, 
particularly in London, may lead to 
over-supply in certain markets. 
May result in price cutting by 
competitors in certain markets  
to fill voids. 
UNITE focus and strategy:
• supply/demand imbalance 
• exposure to best Universities
• seeking out opportunities, not 
only in London but also across the 
UK, for development in select 
cities where the supply/demand 
metrics and land & build costs 
bring value to our portfolio
• more affluent customer base 
including overseas students
• strong sales and marketing 
expertise
• development of affordable 
product 
• flexible approach to tenancies
The Government’s announcement in the 2013 
Autumn Statement that the cap on student 
numbers will be abolished supports growth in 
student numbers.
Student intake for 2013/2014 at least  
30,000 higher than 2012/2013, representing  
a 6% increase. 
To read more go to page 9.
Macro issues such as an EU 
referendum (leading to the UK leaving 
the EU) or Scottish independence.
Departure from EU may impact our 
non-UK EU student business. 
Scotland independence may add 
complexity to our business.
On-going monitoring of these macro 
issues to ensure we are prepared 
for any macro changes.
The UK’s position on an independent Scotland 
retaining the Pound Sterling and whether an 
independent Scotland would need to re-apply 
for EU membership have become clearer 
during the year. We will continue to monitor 
these developments and proactively ascertain 
what this means for our business so we are 
ready to manage any change accordingly.
Property markets are cyclical and 
performance depends on general 
economic conditions.
Reduction in asset values reducing 
financial returns.
Forecast rental growth and 
recurring profit offsets any yield 
movement. 
Clear and active asset management 
strategy.
The UK is experiencing a more positive 
economic outlook and there is general 
improvement in strength of the UK’s 
commercial and residential property markets.
Maximising portfolio value through programme 
of refurbishments and extensions. Customer 
satisfaction at highest ever levels supporting 
rental growth.

A year of results 
Income statement and profit measures
NPC and EPRA Earnings are the key profitability 
performance measures for the Group. The detail of this 
performance is set out in the Operations Review section 
of this report. 
2013 £m 2012 £m
Net portfolio contribution 25.6 19.1
EPRA earnings profit 30.6 15.9
Adjusted profit (pre UCC 
performance fee)
23.1 15.9
Profit before tax 77.1 126.2
EPRA earnings per share 18.0p 9.9p
Adjusted earnings per share 
(pre UCC performance fee)
13.6p 9.9p
EPRA earnings of £30.6 million for 2013 (2012: 
£15.9 million) includes the one-off receipt of a £7.5 million 
performance fee from UCC following the completion  
of refinancing within the joint venture. Excluding this 
amount, adjusted profit (pre UCC performance fee) was 
£23.1 million or 13.6 pence per share (2012: £15.9 million 
and 9.9 pence per share).
Profit before tax includes valuation gains and profit/loss 
on disposal of investment properties of £46.9 million 
(2012: £59.7 million). In 2012, a gain of £49.7 million was 
also included in profit before tax as a result of the one-off 
transfer of stock properties to investment assets.
A full reconciliation of NPC to Adjusted Profit and our 
Reported Profit before Tax is given in Section 2 of the 
financial statements.
Tax
The Group has built up a significant amount of brought 
forward tax losses and capital allowances, primarily as a 
result of the high volume of development activity it has 
undertaken over the last ten years. A net deferred tax 
asset of £0.6 million has been recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet representing the amount of tax that the 
Group believes it will be able to offset over the next three 
years with its brought forward losses. Deferred tax assets 
of a further £9.6 million have not been recognised in the 
Group’s balance sheet due to the uncertainty of future 
profits in the relevant companies and the ability to offset 
the losses against them. The existence of the brought 
forward losses means that the Group is unlikely to incur 
meaningful levels of tax within the next three years.

¹   Key debt statistics are shown on a proforma basis to include the impact of refinancing completed in January 2014.
Debt maturity and LTV
As a result of the refinancing activity, the Group’s debt 
maturity profile has improved significantly and the 
weighted average loan maturity is 7.1 years (2012: 4.1 
years). The Group’s see through LTV reduced to 49% at 
31 December 2013 from 52% at the end of 2012. We will 
continue to manage our gearing proactively and intend to 
continue reducing this over time towards 40% as future 
capital growth and development profits increase the 
Group’s equity base. 
Covenant headroom
We were in full compliance with all of our borrowing 
covenants at 31 December 2013. Our debt facilities 
include loan to value and interest cover covenants that are 
measured at both a Group and an individual portfolio level 
and we have maintained significant headroom against all 
measures. Covenant headroom will reduce  
as surplus capital is deployed into new development 
opportunities but we intend to maintain substantial 
headroom against all covenants.
Interest rate hedging arrangements  
and cost of debt
Our see through cost of debt has reduced to 4.7% (2012: 
5.5%), primarily as a result of the USAF bond and other 
financing activity, and the Group now has 86% of its see 
through investment debt subject to a fixed interest rate 
(31 December: 88%). The Group cancelled certain 
interest rate swaps in the year as part of its refinancing 
activity, resulting in a £17.9 million reduction in adjusted 
profit (2012: £10.6 million). This reflected our decision  
to accelerate the remainder of some refinancing activity  
to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. 
This resulted in swap cancellation costs being incurred  
in 2013, slightly earlier than anticipated. 
As the Group’s refinancing activity is largely complete, 
swap breakage costs will be much lower in future years. 
We anticipate a further £2-3 million of such costs in 2014 
and, in total, the cancellation costs incurred across 2013 
and 2014 will be in line with management expectations 
and previous guidance.
Cash flow and net debt
The Operations business has generated £23.2 million of 
net cash in 2013 (2012: £17.2 million) and see through 
net debt increased to £666 million (2012: £648 million). 
The key components of the movement in net debt were 
inflows from the share placing (£50 million), operational 
cash flow (£23 million) and disposal proceeds (£14 
million) less outflows related to swap break costs of £18 
million and capital expenditure investment of £76 million. 
Dividend
We are recommending a final dividend payment  
of 3.2 pence per share, (2012: 3.0 pence), making 
4.8 pence for the full year, 0.8 pence per share higher 
than 2012 (2012: 4.0 pence), an increase of 20%.  
The increased dividend is a result of strong earnings 
growth and maintains our dividend pay-out ratio of one 
third of NPC (NPC being a proxy for cash generation  
in the business). At this level the dividend is 2.7 times 
covered by operating cash flow.
Subject to approval at UNITE’s Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) on 15 May 2014, the recommended final dividend 
will be paid on 19 May 2014 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 16 April 2014.
Share placing
We completed a placing of 16 million new ordinary shares 
in June at a price of 320 pence per share, raising net 
proceeds of £50 million. The proceeds are being used to 
fund a highly targeted regional development programme 
and this capital should be fully committed to projects 
during the first quarter 2014 and we expect those 
projects to be completed in 2016.
The placing has reduced NAV at 31 December 2013 by 
6 pence per share due to the additional number of shares 
in issue. This modest NAV dilution is expected to unwind 
in 2014 and become substantially accretive from 2015 as 
profitable new developments are delivered. From an EPS 
perspective, the impact across 2013 was broadly neutral 
as the placing proceeds were immediately deployed to 
reduce debt levels on revolving facilities, thereby saving 
interest costs.
Debt financing
During 2013 we maintained our focus on reducing 
gearing levels, extending debt maturities, diversifying 
sources of capital and reducing financing costs, and 
have had some important successes. We completed 
over £1.1 billion of refinancing during 2013 and have 
concluded a further £124 million facility since the year 
end. Consequently the Group’s refinancing activity is now 
largely complete. All key debt statistics have improved 
significantly as a result of this activity:
“We transformed the 
capital structure of 
the business, 
securing long term 
funding that will 
support our growth 
aspirations…”
In 2013 we delivered growth in all of our key financial metrics. Profits, cash flow 
and NAV growth mean that UNITE is well positioned to look forward with 
increasing confidence. The outlook for further rental growth and new beds 
opening in 2015 and 2016 mean we have good visibility about the future 
growth of the business. 
In 2013, we transformed the capital structure of the business, securing long 
term funding that will support our growth aspirations. The £51 million share 
placing that was completed in June has allowed us to secure new development 
sites in strong regional University cities. The three sites in Edinburgh, Aberdeen 
and Newcastle together with a fourth site that is under offer, mean that the 
proceeds from the placing are now fully deployed. We also secured over £1.1 
billion of new debt finance on behalf of the Group and our co-investment 
vehicles. This new debt has been secured from a variety of sources and has 
resulted in cheaper finance and longer debt maturities. 
We have continued to work closely with our co-investment partners to set and 
deliver the strategies across all of the co-investment vehicles. Looking  
forward, we are well positioned to take advantage of the favourable conditions 
in our market, with a strong, stable and flexible capital structure.

Capital structure
A strong, stable and flexible capital structure is essential to support 
our growth aspirations and to ensure we can deliver our strategy.  
We achieve this by:
• Proactively managing the Group’s borrowings, ensuring they are structured 
appropriately to support the strategic objectives of the business
• Securing equity and new debt facilities to fund development activity
• Diversifying UNITE’s sources of capital to reduce risk
• Simplifying the capital structure of the business.
We measure the strength of our capital structure through loan-to-value (LTV), 
weighted average loan maturity and cash.
Relationships
Our business model is reliant on us having strong relationships with 
Universities, our suppliers and partners, and behaving with integrity  
in our relationships. We achieve this by:
• Having a customer-focused approach
• Working closely with our Higher Education partners to provide a seamless 
service to their students and tailoring our service to meet their needs
• Working strategically with University leaders to partner with them in the 
realisation of their estates and residences strategies
• Developing our employees and building a high-performance culture that 
supports them in achieving their personal and professional potential.

Business model and strategic priorities
The right strategy  
for growth 
16 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1420-1 UNITE AR_1.Strategic_v14.indd   16 02/04/2014   18:00 Strategic priorities 
During 2013, we continued to deliver the clear, consistent strategy, 
that has underpinned UNITE’s strong performance in recent years.  
It has three priorities:
• To grow recurring profits and cash flow through a combination  
of rental growth, new openings and cost savings, through our 
market leading services platform, while building the most trusted 
brand in the sector 
•  To enhance our portfolio quality through a programme of highly 
selective developments, focusing on London and strong regional 
locations, together with the disposal of non-core assets, and 
• To strengthen the Group’s capital base.
By maintaining the most trusted brand in the student accommodation 
sector, the highest quality portfolio and the strongest capital structure, 
we are delivering sustainable, growing recurring cash flow and 
increasing the value of our business each year. One-third of our recurring 
cash flow is distributed to shareholders as dividends, two-thirds is 
reinvested back into the business to promote sustainable growth.
This year, we made good progress on all fronts. 
 
Market leading service platform: 
In 2013 we focused on developing our people, technology and 
University relationships in an integrated and sustainable way.  
We have driven further efficiency and service improvements  
which are measured by our customer satisfaction levels and Higher 
Education ‘trust’ score (see page 24 for details of our KPIs) and  
we received record-breaking scores for both these KPIs in 2013. 
Progress includes:
• Continued investment in our people by providing clear career 
progression and accredited training programmes for all levels. We 
also introduced cultural training for city-based employees who work 
with Chinese students, our largest group of international students. 
• Further improvements to our online booking platform, driving 
additional visits and bookings. Our latest mobile working device has 
improved efficiency and increased transparency for customers on 
areas such as room inspections, charging and maintenance requests. 
• Our specialist University Partnerships Team, created at the 
beginning of 2013, has helped us build stronger and more strategic 
relationships with our Higher Education partners. We also increased 
our level of engagement at HE sector events, giving more speeches 
and presentations, which has helped generate interest in UNITE. 
These investments will provide the foundation from which we will 
continue to build our brand in 2014. We will continue to invest in our 
digital platforms and place an increased focus on the link between 
accommodation and success at University.
 
Improving portfolio quality: 
Throughout 2013 we made good progress on improving the  
quality of our portfolio through proactive asset management, 
disposing of further non-core assets, progress on our ongoing 
London development programme and the announcement of a new, 
targeted, regional development programme. Progress includes:
• Announced a targeted £125 million, wholly owned, regional 
development programme for which we secured funding (see below), 
and we have subsequently made good progress in fully allocating 
this capital to four projects. 
• Made good progress with our London development programme 
though our 50/50 LSAV joint venture, securing three new sites  
in 2013. 
• Completed the disposal of £75 million of non-core assets. 
• Secured planning for 41 additional rooms in a development project 
in Bristol, due to open in 2015. We also gained consent for 69 new 
rooms in an existing property in Coventry which will be in operation 
for the 2014/15 academic year. 
• Construction of our three new openings for the 2014/15 academic 
year progressed well with all projects on track and on budget. 
With development costs in London increasing, we see further 
opportunity in strong regional locations over the next 12-18 months, 
particularly in light of encouraging demand outlook for student 
accommodation (see Market review on page 9). 
 
Sustainable capital structure: 
We made substantial progress with our financing activity during 
2013. Across the year, we secured £1.1 billion of new debt facilities 
either on behalf of co-investment vehicles or the UNITE Group. This 
has enabled us to take advantage of historically low interest rates 
while also improving the diversity and flexibility of our funding. 
Progress includes:
• A successful £51 million share placing in June 2013, to fund a 
targeted regional development programme. This capital has now 
been deployed, (see page 35) for more information. The remainder 
of UNITE’s development programme will be funded by the proceeds 
of a convertible bond issue in October which raised £88 million. 
• Reduced our average cost of debt from 5.5% in 2012 to 4.7%  
and extended the weighted average loan maturity from 4 years  
to 7 years. 
• Undertook a refinancing programme for USAF, increasing the 
Fund’s weighted average debt maturity from 2 years at the start  
of 2013 to 9 years, while reducing its total cost of interest from 
5.0% to 3.7%.
• Concluded plans to increase our stake in our UCC joint venture 
from 30% to 34%, taking us closer to the 50% stake we require  
in order to merge UCC with LSAV, our other joint venture with GIC.
During 2014, simplifying our co-investment vehicles remains a priority. 
To this end, we will continue to increase our stake in UCC towards 
50% and to progress the planned sale of our OCB joint venture.

We continued to expand our digital presence, using 
technology to remove administrative burden and to  
make us an easier company to do business with. 
We expanded our mobile working programme, adding the ability to perform 
check-outs and room inspections on the move to our existing maintenance 
app. The new apps helped improve efficiency, reduced the time staff spend 
on administrative tasks and enhanced the customer experience. During 
2013, mobile working helped our customer-facing teams:
• complete 160,481 inspections
• repair or check 3.6 million items 
• take 89,303 photographs during check-out.

Upgrades to our National Contact Centre significantly increased the 
volume of calls they were able to accept and make. The team:
• took over 100,000 inbound calls
• made 70,000 outbound calls
• generated 21,000 email responses to customers
• scheduled 25,000 maintenance requests 
• secured 48% of all our direct let sales.
We established the UNITE Customer Panel, creating an online panel of 
more than 500 students with whom we are able to test ideas and get 
feedback on proposed improvements.
To help improve internal communication and streamline our operations,  
we launched Team Talk, a suite of internal communications channels to help 
share information and best practice across the business. Team Talk includes 
Team Talk Home, our intranet system, providing employees with a bank of 
information and news to access as they need it, ‘Chatterbox’, our employee 
online forum, and Team Talk weekly, monthly and termly updates. 
We completed the installation of high speed Wi-Fi throughout all our 
properties in the summer of 2013 and made further improvements to  
our online booking platform which drove more site visits and bookings,  
and increased the time visitors spent on our site by 20%.

We exchanged contracts on two prime London sites that we will develop  
as part of our LSAV joint venture, in Islington and Wembley Park. These 
sites will bring 1,597 beds to our London portfolio. The new rooms will be 
developed to UNITE’s new room design, which provides a modern, high 
quality look and feel, at a very competitive price point.
We also secured three further development sites in Aberdeen, Edinburgh 
and Newcastle, a total of 1,555 beds. Work will begin on site next year, 
subject to planning, and the properties will open in 2016.
Topping out at Stratford 
We celebrated the structural completion of our new London property 
in Stratford City, adjacent to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and 
Westfield Stratford City shopping centre, with a topping out performed 
by Dennis Hone, Chief Executive of the London Legacy Development 
Corporation. The 1,001 bedroom development boasts panoramic 
views across London and is the first property to be built entirely to 
UNITE’s new specification room design.

capital structure 
We made substantial progress strengthening our capital 
structure during 2013, raising £51 million of equity through 
a share placing in June to fund regional developments and 
securing £1.1 billion of new debt facilities on behalf of 
UNITE and our co-investment vehicles. 
This funding activity means that we have sufficient capital in place to  
fund our growth plans over the coming years. The refinancing activity  
has transformed the profile of our borrowings: 
• Extending our weighted average loan maturity from 4 to 7 years
• Reducing our cost of debt to 4.7% (2012: 5%) 
• Lowering our LTV ratio from 52% to 49% 
• Diversifying our sources of funds with 75% of debt now provided from 
non-bank sources
• Improving flexibility with 27% of debt being unsecured.
We have continued to work closely with our funding partners to deliver  
a number of innovative and noteworthy funding projects, and the Treasury 
Team were recognised for their achievements, being awarded the 
Association of Corporate Treasurer’s award for the Treasury Team  
of the Year.
Highlights
• UNITE Group plc issued £90 million of unsecured convertible bonds  
at a coupon of 2.5%
• UNITE Group plc secured a £124 million ten-year facility from Mass 
Mutual for a portfolio of core assets at a cost of 4.5%
• USAF issued £465 million of secured bonds with a 10-12-year maturity 
profile, lowering USAF’s average cost of debt to 3.7%
• UCC refinanced its entire debt, with a nine-year £149 million facility

UNITE’s Capital Operating Guidelines (COGs) are a set of metrics 
designed to provide the business with guidelines for:
• Capital commitment
• Capital structure
• Capital allocation.
Significant progress was made with our COGs in 2013, due to the 
substantial volume of successful refinancing activity completed in the year, 
all of which had a positive impact on the Group’s cost of debt, debt maturity 
and diversity of lenders.

Key performance indicators 
Measuring our progress 
Delivering shareholder value
Our KPIs have been selected to provide a balance between financial and operational targets. They comprise the key metrics that we focus on 
to run our business. 
NAV 
382p
Measure
NPC measures the income from rental properties after financing 
costs and our total non-development related overheads. It is a proxy 
for cash generation in the business. Adjusted EPS is a measure of 
profit per share in line with EPRA guidelines. 
Comments
Consistent improvement in performance has been driven by high 
levels of occupancy, rental growth, cost control and enhancements 
to our portfolio.
Target
Increase EPS yield, measured as EPS divided by opening NAV, to 
4.5% by 2015 (3.9% in 2013).
Measure
Our adjusted NAV per share measures the market value of properties 
and developments less any debt used to fund them plus any working 
capital in the business.  
 
Comments
Consistent NAV growth has been delivered through rental growth, 
development profits and retained earnings. 
Target
We are well placed to continue delivering strong balanced returns, 
contributing to a low double digit total return.
Measure
Measures our ratio of debt to property values. 
Comments
Continued to deliver reduction in LTV through ongoing focus on 
disposals and growing the value of the property portfolio.
Target 
To continue reducing LTV towards 40% over time.
Measure
Measures the total return to shareholders calculated by the growth in 
adjusted NAV plus dividends.
Comments
Total return has averaged over 10% over the last four years, driven by 
growth in recurring earnings, NAV and dividends.
Target
Continue to deliver low double digit total returns.

Measure
Employee Tri*M is an independent benchmark that measures how 
satisfied and motivated towards achieving our strategy our employees 
are. It enables us to identify areas for improvement and ensures we 
are able to deliver high quality service while minimising staff turnover 
and recruitment costs. Scores range from -30 to 134.
Comments
Year on year we have seen an improvement in employee satisfaction, 
cementing UNITE’s position in the top 10% of European service 
companies. UNITE has continued to improve across all metrics, 
delivering an increase of five points in 2013 due to a significant rise in 
employees’ perception of UNITE’s market strength and motivation.  
Target
We will continue to focus on development programmes, line 
management and empowering teams in order to maintain employee 
satisfaction as a core strength. We aim to maintain our position in the 
top 10% of European customer service organisations.
Measure
Since 201 1, we have undertaken annual qualitative research with our 
HE partners to understand their perception of UNITE and the degree 
to which we meet their needs and those of their students. This 
generates an annual ‘trust score’. 
Comments
Understanding what our HE partners need from us, both for them as 
institutions and for their students, is a vital part of improving our level 
of service and achieving a strong branded service platform. In 2013 
our HE partners recognised the work we did at a national and a local 
level to engage with them, and the improvements we made to our 
service for students. 
Target
We aim to become the accommodation partner of choice for the  
HE sector.

Safety

Measure
Measures the number of reportable accidents in our Operations 
business each year as a means of assessing our success in 
approaching health and safety. 
 
Comments
In 2012 we introduced a new software reporting system, AIMS 
(Accident and Incident Management System). This has provided 
greater visibility on incident reporting and resulted in the subsequent 
increase shown. This is reflective of safety being a high priority with  
a number of working procedures being revised or introduced into  
the business.
Target
We strive to reduce the number of reportable incidents year on year.
Measure
We undertake an independent survey twice a year using key indices 
to understand our relationship with our customers, the experience  
we provide and their likelihood to re-book and recommend UNITE. 
Companies receive a score ranging from -66 to 134 and our score  
is benchmarked against other high performing service companies. 
Comments
The improvements in the last few years reflect our drive to put our 
customers at the heart of everything we do. This has most recently 
been enhanced by setting up a Customer Panel of more than 500 
UNITE students, with whom we discuss ideas and opportunities to 
improve the overall experience. Our current score places us within  
the top 33% of service industries covered by the same methodolgy.
Target
We aim to reach the top 10% of benchmarked companies within the 
next four years, which requires a further steady increase year on year.

Our risk management framework
Embedding a risk  
management culture 
Our Group strategy targets low double digit returns with 
low risk. The Board, when setting the Group’s strategy 
and overseeing its implementation, also determines the 
nature and extent of the significant risks in this strategy 
and ensures that sound risk management and internal 
control systems are in place commensurate with the risk. 
The Board undertakes a formal risk review at least twice  
a year at Group Board meetings. This involves a thorough 
risk review of UNITE’s material risks (presented by the 
Risk Committee’s Chair, Joe Lister) and also serves as an 
opportunity to step back and consider any emerging risks. 
The culture of the organisation, set by the Group Board,  
is to ensure ‘Risk Trackers’ are maintained which clearly 
scope out the risks and their impact, and assign an 
accountable person to own and manage each risk.  
This risk tracking approach is embedded within UNITE 
and leads to a real, tactile and substantive approach  
to risk management.
Risk Committee 
• J J Lister  
(Chair of Risk Committee and  
Chief Financial Officer)
• R C Simpson (MD Property)
• R S Smith (MD Operations)
• M Creedy (Director of Fund Management)
• S Taylor (Internal Audit)
• C R Szpojnarowicz  
(Company Secretary/Head of Legal)
The Group’s Risk Committee, which meets quarterly, 
serves as a bridge between the business unit boards  
and the Group Board, and allows a focused forum for  
risk review. It thoroughly reviews, and scrutinises, the 
business unit boards’ risk management plans and also 
helps ensure these business risks are being considered 
holistically, providing a conduit for the free flow of 
information on risk across UNITE’s business units. The 
Risk Committee also monitors Group policies and the 
most important controls as well as prioritising other risk 
management activities.

last year 
What happened in the year
Market risks 
Changes in Government policy  
(such as on HE funding and 
immigration) may affect student 
numbers and behaviour. 
May reduce demand and hence 
profitability and asset values.
Ongoing monitoring of  
Government policy and its impact 
on, and forecasts of, student 
numbers whilst in parallel regularly 
reviewing our portfolio to ensure  
we are appropriately sized in the 
right locations. 
Student numbers in the UK recovered strongly 
after disruption in Government policy changes 
affected the 2012/13 University year. 
Occupancy of 98% for 2013/14 academic 
year, compared to 96% in 2012/13, 
demonstrates this recovery in student numbers 
is translating into occupancy. 
Underlying demand for HE study in the UK 
remains extremely strong (the UK continues  
to be the 2nd most popular).
To read more go to page 9.
Significant volume of new entrants, 
particularly in London, may lead to 
over-supply in certain markets. 
May result in price cutting by 
competitors in certain markets  
to fill voids. 
UNITE focus and strategy:
• Supply/demand imbalance 
• Exposure to best Universities
• Seeking out opportunities, not 
only in London but also across the 
UK, for development in select 
cities where the supply/demand 
metrics and land & build costs 
bring value to our portfolio
• More affluent customer base 
including overseas students
• Strong sales and marketing 
expertise
• Development of  
affordable product 
• Flexible approach to tenancies.
The Government’s announcement in the 2013 
Autumn Statement that the cap on student 
numbers will be abolished supports growth 
in student numbers.
Student intake for 2013/14 at least  
30,000 higher than 2012/13, representing  
a 6% increase. 
To read more go to page 9.
Macro issues such as an EU 
referendum (leading to the UK leaving 
the EU) or Scottish independence.
Departure from EU may impact our 
non-UK EU student business. 
Scotland independence may add 
complexity to our business.
Ongoing monitoring of these macro 
issues to ensure we are prepared 
for any macro changes.
The UK’s position on an independent Scotland 
retaining the Pound Sterling and whether an 
independent Scotland would need to re-apply 
for EU membership have become clearer 
during the year. We will continue to monitor 
these developments and proactively ascertain 
what this means for our business so we are 
ready to manage any change accordingly.
Property markets are cyclical and 
performance depends on general 
economic conditions.
Reduction in asset values reducing 
financial returns.
Forecast rental growth and 
recurring profit offsets any  
yield movement. 
Clear and active asset  
management strategy.
The UK is experiencing a more positive 
economic outlook and there is general 
improvement in strength of the UK’s 
commercial and residential property markets.
Maximising portfolio value through programme 
of refurbishments and extensions. Customer 
satisfaction at highest ever levels supporting 
rental growth.

Operations risks
Major health and safety (H&S) incident 
in property, development site or office.
Reputational damage and impact to 
students living with us.
H&S is given direct Board 
supervision by the H&S Committee 
(a sub-committee of the Board) 
which actively supervises H&S 
ensuring robust policies and 
procedures are in place and 
consistently complied with.
H&S is also actively reviewed  
at the Operations and Property 
business unit boards, ensuring  
that H&S is top of mind in our day  
to day operations and regularly 
assessed and validated. 
H&S continues to be a primary focus and 
robust processes are embedded throughout 
the organisation following the appointment  
of a new Head of Safety Support Services 
during the year and regular attention by the 
H&S Committee. 
A new incident management reporting system 
was introduced during the year and fire safety 
reviews have been a key focus for 2013 with 
fire identified as a key H&S risk.

Operations review 
Building on our achievements 
Sales, rental growth and profitability 
Our strong performance continued throughout 2013, 
resulting in a £6.5million, 34% increase in NPC to 
£25.6 million compared to last year (2012: £19.1 million). 
This growth has been driven by high occupancy, rental 
growth and the impact of portfolio movements as well 
as operational efficiencies and ongoing cost discipline. 
Adjusted profit (pre UCC performance fee) increased  
by £7.2 million to £23.1 million or 13.6 pence per share 
compared to 2012 (December 2012: £15.9 million, 
9.9 pence per share).

Total income from the managed portfolio increased  
to £240.7 million (2012: £240.2 million) driven by  
rental growth and increased occupancy, offset by  
the reduction in the number of managed beds as  
a result of non-core disposals.
The Group’s NOI margin increased to 71.4% from 71.0% 
in December 2012 as we delivered further efficiencies 
and productivity improvements, while improving our 
service and the quality of our estate through targeted 
investment. Overheads reduced by 13% to £19 million  
as a result of the full year impact of efficiency savings 
flowing through and our key overhead efficiency measure 
(total operating expenses less management fees as a 
proportion of UNITE’s share of investment asset value) 
has also benefited from these efficiencies, having now 
2013 has been a year of achievement for UNITE, which we look to build  
on in the coming year. Our recurring profit has been transformed from a loss  
of £5.4 million five years ago to a sustainable £25.6 million which is largely 
cash backed, our customer service is improving and is consistently strong 
across the business, we are working more closely and effectively with our 
Higher Education partners, and reservations for the next academic year  
are ahead of this time last year. Most importantly, we’ve achieved all this 
alongside our highest ever customer and employee satisfaction scores. 
The majority of UNITE’s 1,000 employees sit within our Operations business 
unit and they are key to our success. We delivered substantial efficiencies  
and operational improvements during 2013, the scale of change which can 
cause staff to become dejected. However, the outstanding people within 
UNITE have embraced the changes. In 2013, we provided a clear career path 
through accredited training courses, introduced timesaving technology and 
taught staff the real skills required to deliver outstanding customer service. 
Our processes and technology were also a focus during 2013. Perhaps  
our most significant step change was the installation of high speed Wi-Fi 
throughout all our properties, an important milestone and considered to be  
a hygiene factor by our customers. We reviewed all our key processes through 
the lens of customer service to ensure they are effective and efficient and used 
technology to remove administrative burden, making us an easier company to 
do business with. 
Looking ahead, we will continue the work we started in 2013 with further 
investment in our digital offering, our service platform and our brand. We 
do this in the context of positive investor sentiment towards the student 
accommodation sector and favourable Government policy following two years 
of funding cuts, fee increases and uncertainty. Our activity over the next 24 
months will further differentiate UNITE and ensure we provide a home for 
success – a place that students seek out because we help them achieve 
more in their University life.

1420-1 UNITE AR_1.Strategic_v14.indd   30 02/04/2014   18:00 fallen to 61 bps (December 2012: 92 bps), in line with our 
target of 60 bps. This will deteriorate marginally when we 
exit our OCB joint venture and increase our stake in UCC 
but we intend to maintain 60 bps as our ongoing target.
Finance costs (comprising interest and lease payments) 
fell to £47 million (2012: £48.5 million), reflecting the fall 
in the Group’s average cost of debt as various refinancing 
events were completed while development pre-contract 
and other costs fell £0.7 million to £2.5 million. EPRA 
earnings includes a one-off receipt of £7.5 million 
performance fee from UCC following the completion  
of refinancing within the joint venture.
Occupancy and rental growth
Occupancy across UNITE’s portfolio for the 2013/14 
academic year stands at 98% and like-for-like rental 
growth of 3% was achieved on our stabilised portfolio. 
The number of students enrolling at UK Universities 
increased by 37,000 on 2012/13 levels, recovering  
much of the previous year’s drop and contributing to  
the overall strong occupancy and rent performance.
Reservations for the 2014/15 academic year are 
encouraging, standing at 64% (62% at the same point last 
year), and recent Government announcements together 
with the continued attraction of the UK as a destination  
for international students, suggest a further increase in  
the number of new students next year of around 20,000. 
This provides us with further confidence in occupancy  
and rental levels for the 2014/15 academic year, which  
we again expect to show rental growth of around 3%.
Investment in people, technology  
and relationships
Over the past few years we have invested carefully in 
building and retaining the expertise of our staff; utilising 
technology as a way to both enhance service levels and 
reduce operating costs; and in increasing and maintaining 
our profile in the University sector, building on the strong, 
long standing relationships we have in a number of cities. 
Building on our long track record in the sector, these 
investments have formed strong foundations from which 
we will continue to build our brand.
People
The knowledge, commitment and competence of our staff 
base continues to be at the heart of our performance,  
and during 2013 we made further investments in learning 
and development to provide clear career progression 
opportunities for all roles and grades. The empowerment  
of our teams has progressed further, with city managers 
encouraged to make the right decisions for students to 
improve the experience of living with UNITE, and this has 
been reflected in our highest ever customer satisfaction 
scores, in both our Spring and Autumn independent surveys.
Technology
We have made further improvements to our online 
booking platform throughout the year, driving additional 
visits and bookings. Similarly, the latest iteration of our 
mobile working device for service teams has reduced 
more time-consuming activity, and provided clarity and 
transparency to customers regarding inspections, 
maintenance requests, and room charges.
University relationships
The creation of our specialist University Partnerships 
Team at the start of 2013 is proving successful, with 
stronger relationships now in place with our most 
significant University partners and new relationships 
being established. This has opened doors for more 
strategic discussions about future ways of working.
Our presence in the Higher Education sector has  
become yet more substantial, and we have presented or 
spoken at a wide range of events and conferences, and 
launched high-profile research publications undertaken 
in-house, which have stimulated healthy levels of interest 
and engagement from Universities and sector groups.  
We will build on this further in 2014.
Student numbers 
Around 37,000 more students started degrees in the 
2013/14 academic year than the year before, substantially 
reversing the drop seen in 2012/13. This was partly due to 
the Government’s relaxation of the student number caps 
applied to University enrolment but also the positive impact 
of deferrals returning to normalised levels. Acceptances 
were up year on year across all student groups, with UK and 
non-EU students showing the healthiest increases, further 
underlining the structural robustness of the student sector.
Operations outlook
Our Operations business continued its strong 
performance against all key measures throughout 2013. 
High occupancy, consistent rental growth and portfolio 
recycling, combined with the successful embedding of 
cost efficiencies, continued to drive sustainable profit 
growth, alongside further improvements to service levels 
and the experience we provide for our students.
We are continuing to invest in our operating platform  
and expanding our digital presence, recently launching 
new smartphone apps and online community features to 
further increase the strength of our brand and competitive 
advantage. Having completed the installation of Wi-Fi 
throughout all our properties in the summer of 2013, we 
are looking to increase broadband speed significantly for 
the new academic year, and have also appointed a partner 
to install LED lighting across our portfolio over the next 
two years. This will reduce our operating costs and carbon 
footprint while further improving our students’ experience. 
As the student accommodation market continues to 
mature, the combination of our continued investment in 
brand and service driving rental growth, coupled with a 
growing portfolio as new properties are completed, will 
underpin further profit growth for 2014 and we continue 
to target a 4.5% EPS yield for 2015.

Building on our achievements 
NAV growth
Adjusted NAV per share increased by 9.1% to 382 pence 
(on a fully diluted basis) at 31 December 2013, up from 
350 pence at 31 December 2012. In total, adjusted net 
assets were £682 million at 31 December 2013, up from 
£567 million a year earlier.
The main factors behind the growth in adjusted NAV per 
share were: 
• The growth in the value of the Group’s share of 
investment assets (+ 16 pence), as a result of rental 
growth, some yield compression and asset specific 
write downs associated with the disposal of legacy 
NHS assets
• The value added to the development portfolio 
(+14 pence)
• The impact of financing activity (-6 pence), related 
primarily to swap breakage costs, partially offset by  
the positive impact of our convertible bond issuance
• The positive impact of retained profits after dividends 
(+14 pence)
• The impact of the £50 million equity issue in June 
(-6 pence). 
Looking forward, our portfolio is well placed to deliver 
continued growth. Our focus on the strongest University 
locations underpins rental growth prospects and we 
will continue to deliver meaningful upside from our 
development activity. We have three projects, comprising 
1,555 beds and accounting for approximately 70% of  
the proceeds of our June share placing, secured under 
contract in strong regional locations and are in exclusive 
negotiations on a fourth. In addition, 60% of our target 
LSAV pipeline has also been secured across three 
London projects comprising 2,356 beds. 
In total, our secured pipeline is expected to deliver 
39 pence per share of NAV uplift once completed if 
expected returns are achieved (UNITE share). Projects 
where the Group is in exclusive negotiations could add  
a further 6 pence. The development pipeline will have  
an even more significant positive impact on EPS once 
delivered with the secured projects adding 13 pence  
and those where the Group is in exclusive negotiations  
a further 1 pence.
Property portfolio
The valuation of our property portfolio at 31 December 
2013, including our share of gross assets held in USAF 
and joint ventures, was £1,370 million (31 December 
2012: £1,245 million). The £125 million increase in 
portfolio value was attributable to £76 million of capital 
expenditure less disposals of £14 million and £63 million 
of valuation increases. The valuation of the stabilised 
investment portfolio increased by 3% on a like-for-like 
basis over the year, primarily as a result of rental growth. 
“This proven track 
record in challenging 
conditions positions 
us well for the 
future…”
Our Property business unit comprises Asset Management and Property 
Development, who support our operational colleagues in maximising our 
existing portfolio as well as seeking out new opportunities for growth. I also 
look after our Fund Management team who manage our four co-investment 
vehicles. Our Property business has had the same core team for the last ten 
years; we are a lean operation of 22 people. This same ten-year period has 
seen a great deal of volatility in the property sector, but the team’s wealth of 
expertise and the strong fundamentals of the student accommodation sector 
have enabled UNITE to take full advantage of market conditions. 
While tentative signs of general economic recovery were slowly felt during 
2013, the Higher Education sector demonstrated good fundamentals with  
a bounce back in student numbers for the 2013/14 academic year which 
brought overall student levels back in line with those seen in 201 1. Against  
this positive backdrop, demand for exposure into purpose built student 
accommodation increased too. Our development activity continued to build 
strong momentum both in London and also across the UK. We secured  
several new projects in London, through our JV with GIC, which are high quality 
locations and will be significantly accretive to returns. Overall, these projects 
will account for around 60% of the capital we’ve identified for deployment  
into development activities. Timing for these and prior years’ acquisitions was 
strong. Subsequently, London is displaying development cost inflation and an 
increase to barriers to entry. In response to this, our strategy evolved to include 
wider UK development projects and we’ve made good progress in building a 
high quality pipeline of future projects, accounting for the full proceeds raised 
over the summer for this purpose. 
Our Asset Management saw UNITE’s remaining non-core assets sold or 
contracts exchanged. Our portfolio is now 100% student accommodation.  
Four refurbishment or extension projects were undertaken in the year, which 
alongside other initiatives delivered an NAV upside of around £7 million. 
This proven track record in challenging conditions positions us well for the 
future as we continue to feel the impact of economic recovery. With the market 
outlook strengthening in terms of student numbers, investor interest in the 
student accommodation sector and regional development costs still low, I’m 
confident the energy and expertise of my team will continue to give UNITE 
clear competitive edge.

The proportion of our property portfolio that is income generating decreased to 86% from 93% at December 2012, 
with 14% now under development. This reflects the progress with our 2014 and 2015 development programme as  
well as the commitment of capital to 2016 deliveries. The development weighting will continue to increase over the 
next year as our activity in this area accelerates and our remaining non-core investment assets are sold. We expect  
the development weighting to peak at approximately 20% in 2015.

The investment portfolio is split between London (41%) and the rest of the UK (59%). At the beginning of the year, 
London projects would have represented approximately 50% of the UNITE portfolio on a built out basis. However,  
the acceleration of our regional development activity during 2013 means that our built out London weighting has  
fallen marginally to around 48% by the year end.
We currently favour new development in strong regional locations over London and as a result it is likely that our built 
out London weighting will fall further, to around 40%, as our regional development pipeline expands.

Student accommodation yields
Over the latter part of 2013, yields for student accommodation started to show some signs of modest compression. 
Across our portfolio, net initial yields moved from 6.55% to 6.50% reflecting a change of 5 bps. This was partly due to 
portfolio mix but also some movement in stronger regional locations, reflecting the increasing level of demand for good 
quality, well located purpose built student accommodation.

Provincial 6.75–7.25% 6.35–6.6% 7.1–7.35% 6.35–6.6%
The investment market for student accommodation  
assets was positive in 2013 with approximately  
£2.1 billion of transactions recorded during the year, 
compared to £2.7 billion in 2012 when two particularly 
large transactions completed. The most significant 
transactions in 2013 were the sale of several former  
Opal portfolios for which demand was strongest from 
overseas investors. The portfolio nature of these 
transactions, together with the mixed quality of the 
underlying assets, makes precise yield evidence hard  
to establish. However, we believe the transactions  
were supportive of our current valuations.
Investor interest in the student accommodation sector 
is continuing to broaden and we expect continued high 
levels of transactional activity in 2014. However, in 
comparison to more established sub sectors of the UK 
Real Estate market, liquidity remains relatively low and  
we therefore expect yield movements to lag the wider 
market slightly.
Our business model is focused on growing recurring  
cash flow, primarily through new development activity and 
leveraging our brand across our established, high quality 
investment portfolio to deliver sustainable rental growth. 
We have largely completed our non-core asset disposal 
programme (with £60 million of disposals completed/
exchanged unconditionally since our 2012 result and a 
further £15 million conditionally exchanged), and put in 
place a fixed low cost, longer term debt structure against 
our high quality core assets, meaning that the level of 
future asset disposals will be lower than in recent years.  
At this stage in our business, therefore, investment yields 
are of less importance to business performance than the 
‘cash on cash’ economics of development, cost control 
and rental growth.
Development activity
During 2013 we made good progress with our  
four developments onsite, secured two new London 
development projects for LSAV (our 50/50 development 
joint venture with GIC) and accelerated our development 
activity in strong regional locations, subsequently securing 
three new sites in the early part of 2014. Our new regional 
development activity is being funded from the proceeds of 
a successful share placing in June 2013 (£50 million net 
proceeds), the majority of which has been committed to 
specific projects, and a convertible bond issue in October 
(£88 million net proceeds).

Wholly owned development
Our three 2014 completions are proceeding in line with 
budget and programme and are on track to be open and 
let for the 2014/15 academic year. Subject to achieving 
90% occupancy, our Stratford project will be sold to LSAV 
later in 2014 and this will release funds back to the Group 
for investment into further development activity. We intend 
to retain the other two projects on balance sheet.
Following our decision to accelerate development activity 
in strong regional locations, our experience has been 
very encouraging. We have secured three projects  
 
(in Newcastle, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) for 2016 delivery 
and are in exclusive negotiations on a fourth project. 
These projects are all supportive of our 9.5– 10% yield  
on cost targets and are in very strong locations that we 
expect to perform well for the long term. 
Regional development costs are currently low, 
occupational demand remains strong and the planning 
environment is generally supportive. This creates a very 
attractive opportunity which we believe will persist for  
no longer than 12– 18 months.

1420-1 UNITE AR_1.Strategic_v14.indd   36 02/04/2014   18:00 LSAV development
Within LSAV, three excellent schemes have now been 
secured; Angel Lane in Stratford, Stapleton House in 
Islington and Wembley Park, meaning that 60% of 
LSAV’s capital has been committed. Work began on 
Angel Lane, our second Stratford project, in late 2013  
for completion in 2015. Stapleton House and Wembley 
Park are expected to obtain planning consents during 
2014 and construction will start shortly thereafter for 
delivery in 2016. The three secured projects have a 
projected yield on cost of 9.0%.
Looking forward, the London development market is 
becoming more challenging. Alternative use (particularly 
residential) values for prospective sites are increasing and 
reducing the competitiveness of student accommodation 
bids, construction costs are beginning to escalate and the 
imminent adoption of the Community Infrastructure Levy 
(CIL) will have a further negative impact on the viability 
of student schemes. We have not placed a London 
development site under offer since Wembley Park in May 
2013 and, based on current pricing, are unlikely to do so 
during 2014 unless there is a correction to land values.
Asset disposals
We have achieved £75 million of disposals comprising 
non-core assets from both the Group’s own balance sheet 
and on behalf of co-investment vehicles, in line with 
expectations. These disposals included our remaining 
NHS properties and, as a result, our portfolio is now 
comprised exclusively of student accommodation assets.

Since early 201 1 the Group has sold £198 million  
of non-core assets comprising 2,390 beds, from its  
wholly owned and co-investment portfolios. Following  
this activity, our non-core asset disposal programme is 
now substantially complete and, as a result, asset sales  
in the future will be lower.

EPRA earnings of £30.6 million for 2013 (2012: 
£15.9 million) includes the one-off receipt of a £7.5 million 
performance fee from UCC following the completion  
of refinancing within the joint venture. Excluding this 
amount, adjusted profit (pre UCC performance fee) was 
£23.1 million or 13.6 pence per share (2012: £15.9 million 
and 9.9 pence per share).
Profit before tax includes valuation gains and profit/loss 
on disposal of investment properties of £46.9 million 
(2012: £59.7 million). In 2012, a gain of £49.7 million was 
also included in profit before tax as a result of the one-off 
transfer of stock properties to investment assets.
A full reconciliation of NPC to Adjusted Profit and our 
Reported Profit before Tax is given in Section 2 of the 
financial statements.
Tax
The Group has built up a significant amount of brought 
forward tax losses and capital allowances, primarily as a 
result of the high volume of development activity it has 
undertaken over the last ten years. A net deferred tax 
asset of £0.6 million has been recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet representing the amount of tax that the 
Group believes it will be able to offset over the next three 
years with its brought forward losses. Deferred tax assets 
of a further £9.6 million have not been recognised in the 
Group’s balance sheet due to the uncertainty of future 
profits in the relevant companies and the ability to offset 
the losses against them. The existence of the brought 
forward losses means that the Group is unlikely to incur 
meaningful levels of tax within the next three years.
“We transformed  
the capital structure 
of the business, 
securing long-term 
funding that will 
support our growth 
aspirations…”
In 2013 we delivered growth in all of our key financial metrics. Profits, cash  
flow and NAV growth mean that UNITE is well positioned to look forward with 
increasing confidence. The outlook for further rental growth and new beds 
opening in 2015 and 2016 mean we have good visibility about the future 
growth of the business. 
In 2013, we transformed the capital structure of the business, securing 
long-term funding that will support our growth aspirations. The £51 million 
share placing that was completed in June has allowed us to secure new 
development sites in strong regional University cities. The three sites in 
Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Newcastle together with a fourth site that is under 
offer, mean that the proceeds from the placing are now fully deployed. We also 
secured over £1.1 billion of new debt finance on behalf of the Group and our 
co-investment vehicles. This new debt has been secured from a variety of 
sources and has resulted in cheaper finance and longer debt maturities. 
We have continued to work closely with our co-investment partners to set 
and deliver the strategies across all of the co-investment vehicles. Looking  
forward, we are well positioned to take advantage of the favourable conditions 
in our market, with a strong, stable and flexible capital structure.

¹   Key debt statistics are shown on a proforma basis to include the 
impact of refinancing completed in January 2014.
Debt maturity and LTV
As a result of the refinancing activity, the Group’s  
debt maturity profile has improved significantly and  
the weighted average loan maturity is 7.1 years (2012:  
4.1 years). The Group’s see-through LTV reduced to 49% 
at 31 December 2013 from 52% at the end of 2012. We 
will continue to manage our gearing proactively and intend 
to continue reducing this over time towards 40% as future 
capital growth and development profits increase the 
Group’s equity base. 
Covenant headroom
We were in full compliance with all of our borrowing 
covenants at 31 December 2013. Our debt facilities 
include loan-to-value and interest cover covenants that 
are measured at both a Group and an individual portfolio 
level and we have maintained significant headroom 
against all measures. Covenant headroom will reduce  
as surplus capital is deployed into new development 
opportunities but we intend to maintain substantial 
headroom against all covenants.
Interest rate hedging arrangements  
and cost of debt
Our see-through cost of debt has reduced to 4.7%  
(2012: 5.5%), primarily as a result of the USAF bond and 
other financing activity, and the Group now has 86% of its 
see-through investment debt subject to a fixed interest 
rate (31 December: 88%). The Group cancelled certain 
interest rate swaps in the year as part of its refinancing 
activity, resulting in a £17.9 million reduction in adjusted 
profit (2012: £10.6 million). This reflected our decision  
to accelerate the remainder of some refinancing activity  
to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. 
This resulted in swap cancellation costs being incurred  
in 2013, slightly earlier than anticipated. 
As the Group’s refinancing activity is largely complete, 
swap breakage costs will be much lower in future years. 
We anticipate a further £2-3 million of such costs in 2014 
and, in total, the cancellation costs incurred across 2013 
and 2014 will be in line with management expectations 
and previous guidance.
Cash flow and net debt
The Operations business has generated £23.2 million  
of net cash in 2013 (2012: £17.2 million) and see-through 
net debt increased to £666 million (2012: £648 million). 
The key components of the movement in net debt were 
inflows from the share placing (£50 million), operational 
cash flow (£23 million) and disposal proceeds (£14 
million) less outflows related to swap break costs of £18 
million and capital expenditure investment of £76 million. 
Dividend
We are recommending a final dividend payment  
of 3.2 pence per share, (2012: 3.0 pence), making 
4.8 pence for the full year, 0.8 pence per share higher 
than 2012 (2012: 4.0 pence), an increase of 20%.  
The increased dividend is a result of strong earnings 
growth and maintains our dividend pay-out ratio of 
one-third of NPC (NPC being a proxy for cash generation  
in the business). At this level the dividend is 2.7 times 
covered by operating cash flow.
Subject to approval at UNITE’s annual general meeting 
(AGM) on 15 May 2014, the recommended final dividend 
will be paid on 19 May 2014 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 22 April 2014.
Share placing
We completed a placing of 16 million new ordinary shares 
in June at a price of 320 pence per share, raising net 
proceeds of £50 million. The proceeds are being used to 
fund a highly targeted regional development programme 
and this capital should be fully committed to projects 
during the first quarter 2014 and we expect those 
projects to be completed in 2016.
The placing has reduced NAV at 31 December 2013 by 
6 pence per share due to the additional number of shares 
in issue. This modest NAV dilution is expected to unwind 
in 2014 and become substantially accretive from 2015 as 
profitable new developments are delivered. From an EPS 
perspective, the impact across 2013 was broadly neutral 
as the placing proceeds were immediately deployed to 
reduce debt levels on revolving facilities, thereby saving 
interest costs.
Debt financing
During 2013 we maintained our focus on reducing 
gearing levels, extending debt maturities, diversifying 
sources of capital and reducing financing costs, and 
have had some important successes. We completed 
over £1.1 billion of refinancing during 2013 and have 
concluded a further £124 million facility since the year 
end. Consequently the Group’s refinancing activity is  
now largely complete. All key debt statistics have 
improved significantly as a result of this activity:

USAF 1,355 (583) (15) 757 125 43% 12.6% Infinite 16%

OCB 174 (96) (4) 72 18 55% 1.4% 2014 25%
During the year, both USAF and UCC completed major 
refinancing of their debts. In USAF, £565 million of new 
debt was put in place through a secured bond programme. 
This resulted in a reduction in USAF’s average cost of  
debt to 3.7% (2012: 5%) and increased debt maturity  
to 9 years (2012: 2 years). This new financing will result in 
increased profits available for distribution, with the income 
yield expected to increase to approximately 7% (2012: 
5.5%). UCC arranged a £149 million facility with Legal 
& General and a £77 million facility with RBS resulting  
in a reduction in its average cost of debt to 4% by  
the year end (2012: 5.5%) and an increase in maturity  
to 7 years (2012: 1 year).
Following the conclusion of the refinancing in UCC, a 
performance fee of £7.5 million became payable. The  
fee will be used to increase UNITE’s stake in UCC from 
30% to 34%.
USAF delivered a total return of 12.6% in 2013 and has 
been among the top performing fund in the IPD Specialist 
Funds index over the past five years, reflecting the quality 
of its portfolio and consistent rental growth performance. 
Following the refinancing of the majority of its debt 
facilities into longer term, fixed low cost bonds, its growth 
prospects have improved further and we anticipate 
ongoing strong performance. The Group has a 16.4% 
stake in USAF and we consider this to be a core 
strategic investment.
We have taken the decision to realise our investment in 
the OCB joint venture, which matures in August 2014, 
alongside OCB as our joint venture partner. We have now 
agreed terms with a credible prospective purchaser of  
the OCB JV assets and have entered into an exclusivity 
agreement with them. Due to the relative complexity of 
the transaction it has taken longer than originally planned. 
However, we remain confident that the assets will be sold 
later in 2014 at levels supportive of current valuations.
Once the OCB sale has concluded we intend to invest  
our share of proceeds to increase our stake in our UCC 
joint venture with GIC towards 50%. This will allow us to 
maintain our level of London exposure, avoid earnings 
dilution and help trigger the automatic merger of UCC  
and LSAV into a single entity. Once this outcome has 
been achieved the number of indirect vehicles we  
manage will reduce from four to two, contributing to a 
significant simplification of the Group’s balance sheet.
Outlook
In recent months the market outlook for the student 
accommodation sector has strengthened further. As a 
result the outlook is the most positive it has been for a 
number of years:
• Demand, as evidenced by applications, continues  
to increase and planned Government policy changes 
look set to ensure this translates into higher levels of 
enrolments in the coming years, underpinning rental 
growth prospects
• Regional economies are recovering but land and 
build prices remain depressed, creating a window  
of opportunity for development in strong regional 
locations at cyclically low costs. The Group is well 
placed to capitalise on these
• Investor interest in the sector is broadening and 
deepening, both amongst UK and international 
investors. Although liquidity remains low relative  
to more established property sub-sectors and yield 
movements may therefore lag slightly, the emergence 
of sustained investor appetite is encouraging and 
contributes to a positive yield outlook.
Following a period of strong operational performance, 
targeted portfolio repositioning and comprehensive 
refinancing, UNITE is well placed to benefit from the 
improving sector outlook.

Corporate responsibility review
ENVIRONMENT
During 2013, we continued to work to reduce UNITE’s impact on the  
environment, taking important steps towards formalising our environmental 
policies and procedures. We are pleased that our residential carbon emissions 
from gas, electricity and operating our buildings reduced meaningfully compared 
to last year, 10- 15% across each measure. We attribute this, in large part, to 
improved communication with our customers about heating controls and energy 
use, and milder weather. Also, DEFRA slightly reduced its carbon factor for 
electricity, which reduced our total electricity CO
2
 per bed by 7.3% in addition to 
lower consumption. Our CO
2
 emissions from company vehicles increased by 32% 
and during 2014 we are actively working to reduce these emissions through staff 
engagement and by setting reduction targets, following further evaluation of the 
2013 data. 
Within our properties, we installed new heating controls and are trialling ways  
we can reduce heating demand. We are now able to collect data for over 95% of 
our electricity consumption through automatic meter readings and have installed 
extensive sub-metering to a number of sites, monitoring energy consumption for 
individual uses such as bedroom heating, lighting, small-power, water heating and 
cooking. This is providing valuable data to help us target and assess energy 
saving opportunities. 
Shower-head and toilet upgrades have been trialled and the best solutions  
for high usage sites been identified. We’ve installed a water treatment system  
at selected sites that prevents limescale damage to toilets, boilers and water 
services, and in doing so reduces energy and water consumption. Following last 
year’s pilot, we installed LED lighting in three properties and plan to replace all 
existing lighting across our entire portfolio with state of the art LED lighting and 
controls over the next two years.
Our Energy and Environment team undertook a climate change risk assessment 
with the Operations Board which informed their business strategy and planning. 
The team also recruited a dedicated Sustainability Engagement Coordinator who 
will be launching a nationwide sustainability engagement campaign aimed at 
employees and students during 2014. 
COMMITTED TO  
SUSTAINABLE  
VALUE 
We offer our students safe, secure and welcoming accommodation that  
supports their success whether defined as academic success, personal growth  
or future employability. Underpinning this is the trust we build with our employees, 
customers, partner Universities, communities and suppliers through operating our 
business in a transparent and responsible manner. We place a particular emphasis 
on the following areas:
  Minimising our impact on the ENVIRONMENT through a commitment to 
sustainable business practice.
  Working closely with our stakeholders to engage with, and integrate into, local 
COMMUNITIES.
  Creating a BUSINESS that exceeds the expectations of its partner Universities 
and suppliers, and provides best in class returns for our investors. We owe our 
success to considering and exceeding the needs of all our stakeholders.
  Growing diverse, talented and engaged teams and providing the opportunities  
for our PEOPLE to realise their personal and professional potential.
To enable this, our Strategy & Commercial Director is responsible for managing 
our performance across these four key areas.
We want UNITE to be the most sought  
after and trusted student accommodation 
brand, known as a good corporate citizen 
that is committed to responsible business 
practice. This supports our position as a 
sustainable business generating strong 
recurring cash flows.
 LED lighting upgrade 
We have partnered with Philips Lighting to install state  
of the art LED lighting and advanced controls in all our 
buildings, including every customer bedroom. This  
will bring significant energy and carbon savings, reduce 
maintenance and hazardous waste, and considerably 
improve lighting levels to create a healthier and more 
effective environment for customers and staff.

the CRC scheme and to independent bodies such as the Global Real Estate 
Sustainability Benchmark and West of England Carbon Challenge. UNITE is also 
now a member of the Environmental Association for Universities and Colleges. In 
2013 we received an E rating from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reflecting 
our lack of formal environmental policies and targets. While recognising that many 
respondents fail to even achieve an E rating, we are keen to improve our CDP 
rating as a measure of our environmental performance. We had already identified 
our policies and procedures as an area of opportunity and are implementing an 
environmental management system in line with the requirement of ISO 14001 
during 2014.

 Climate Week in Exeter 
Across our properties in Exeter the city team rolled  
out a week long programme of events for Climate Week  
to raise awareness among students and staff of how  
to reduce their carbon footprint. Daily energy saving 
activities encouraged students to turn down their heaters 
and wear a jumper, switch off lights, and grow their own 
edible plant.
Heating controls
A warm and comfortable home is an essential part of 
what we offer our customers; however, equally important 
is that we do this efficiently and effectively. As colder 
weather approached, we worked closely with specialist 
heating controls manufacturer, Prefect Controls, to 
optimise our existing heating systems and develop the 
next generation including timer and presence controls.

Corporate responsibility review continued 
Forming stronger 
relationships with local 
communities, charities, 
businesses, Universities, 
our staff and the 
students who live with  
us, creates additional 
value for wider society.
COMMUNITIES 
We recognise that all businesses have a responsibility to manage their operations 
in a way which has a positive impact on all stakeholders and communities. We take 
this responsibility very seriously and believe that forming stronger relationships 
with local communities, charities, businesses, Universities, our staff and the 
students who live with us creates additional value for wider society.
We created the UNITE Foundation in 2012 to focus our charitable and  
community activity on causes which have the most resonance for the sector  
in which we work, in turn forging closer links with many parties who are crucial  
to the successful delivery of our strategy. During 2013, we expanded the UNITE 
Foundation Scholarship programme so that it now supports 56 students from 
disadvantaged backgrounds through partnerships with seven Universities. We 
recognise that access to student accommodation is a valuable asset that can 
support social mobility in Higher Education. We also provide interns from the 
Speaker’s Parliamentary Placements Scheme and Upreach with subsidised 
accommodation enabling them to take up employment opportunities away 
from home.
The UNITE Foundation also makes targeted donations to established charities 
that further the aims of the Foundation including IntoUniversity, which provides 
local learning centres that support young people from disadvantaged backgrounds 
to attain either a University place or another chosen aspiration. In 2013 we 
provided opportunities for our employees and customers to volunteer their skills 
and time to support IntoUniversity. This included helping to prepare a new centre 
for opening in Nottingham and running a Christmas party for children from the 
Bristol centre. Students living with UNITE also volunteered as mentors to children 
at IntoUniversity centres.
 
Healthy eating 
Our Liverpool team partnered with local business, 
Student Grub Company, and Liverpool John Moores 
University to provide a free fruit and veg box for students 
when they checked-in. Each welcome box contained 
everything students needed to cook a healthy meal  
for all their flatmates. In addition to providing a great 
welcome gift, the box promoted healthy eating as part  
of our Wellbeing campaign, helped the team strengthen 
University relationships and had a positive impact  
on the community by supporting local providers. 
Curtis Reid, President of Liverpool Students’ Union, said: 
“It’s fantastic that LJMU and UNITE are 
working together to promote healthy living 
to new students. Student Grub shows  
that it is possible for students to eat well  
on a budget.”
44 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1420-1 UNITE AR_1.Strategic_v14.indd   44 02/04/2014   18:00 During 2013 our city teams made some strong progress in building relationships 
with local councils and emergency services, and integrating students into their 
local community. For example:
• Our North London team piloted a scheme with Islington Council, helping  
adults with learning difficulties find employment and, so far, have provided one 
permanent role through the programme – 90% of people with learning 
difficulties never get a job after college. 
• Our team in Bath built ties with the local Police and Communities Together 
group and now hosts the local meetings in one of our common rooms. This  
has improved the team’s relationship with the local community and raised 
awareness of UNITE in the wider area. 
• As part of our Wellbeing programme, the Liverpool team partnered with local 
business Student Grub and Liverpool John Moores University to provide every 
flat in one of our properties with a box of healthy food to encourage students  
to cook a healthy meal together.
• UNITE’s Nottingham team set up a series of initiatives focused on improving 
students’ employability through community engagement. They built relationships 
with the University Volunteering scheme, the University Tutor scheme and the 
IntoUniversity centre in Nottingham to involve customers in volunteering and 
encourage students to become involved in the local community.
• Our Newcastle team work closely with local café, Skylight, close to one of its 
properties. The café is run as a social enterprise that trains and employs homeless 
people. The team uses Skylight for meetings and team events, orders its catering 
from the café and allows Skylight to use their common room for events. 
We recognise that we could do more, centrally, to support this activity and  
our focus for 2014 is on improving our capabilities in this area so that we can 
establish minimum requirements for communities outreach and learn from  
the best practice that is already taking place in some of our cites. We plan to 
become members of Business in the Community to help with our approach  
and to build a network of community champions within our cities. 
 
Creating employment
Neil joined our Emily Bowes Court property team  
as our post room assistant on a pilot scheme we ran in 
partnership with Islington Council to find jobs for adults 
with learning difficulties. Despite having been looking 
for work for eight years, Neil soon settled into his role and 
has relieved the Emily Bowes service and sales assistants 
of processing up to eight sacks of mail per day. This 
scheme not only benefited Neil as an individual but has 
enriched the team at Emily Bowes.
 
Supporting Parliamentary interns
The UNITE Foundation partners with the Social Mobility 
Foundation to support the Speaker’s Parliamentary 
Placements Scheme. This is a paid internship scheme 
that gives participants the opportunity to spend more  
than nine months working with a Member of Parliament  
in Westminster. It aims to broaden diversity within 
government by targeting those who would otherwise  
find the cost of living and working in London without  
pay, prohibitive.
“ London is one of the most expensive  
cities in the world to live in and the cost of 
housing is often one of the biggest barriers 
to those who seek to take up internships in 
our capital. That is why the support of the 
UNITE Foundation is so vital to the young 
people who take part in the Speaker’s 
Parliamentary Placements Scheme.”

BUSINESS 
We behave with integrity in the relationships that allow our business model to 
work. This underpins our position as a sustainable business generating strong 
recurring cash flows. 
During 2013 our Procurement team updated our supplier pre-qualification 
questionnaire to ensure that the companies we work with are responsible,  
well-run businesses that treat their staff fairly and have the right procedures  
and insurance in place. This gives us a more holistic view of suppliers when viewed 
alongside our financial due diligence process. Where possible, we work with local 
suppliers, particularly in our cities, and use an umbrella company that enables us to 
trade with sole traders in a protected way. We also installed a portal that ensures 
our employment agencies are paid a fixed margin, giving us transparency of 
temporary staff costs so we can ensure our agency workers are paid fairly.
UNITE has always undertaken and published research and in 2013, recruited  
a dedicated Market Intelligence (MI) team to ensure all the Group’s business 
decisions are underpinned by insight. The MI team established the UNITE 
Customer Panel made up of 400 UNITE students, which allows us to gain  
direct feedback and input into decisions from our customers. The Panel is being 
expanded in 2014 to include non-UNITE students and parents, and will also be 
offered to University partners. The team also runs the Group’s Research and 
Insight Forum which coordinates research across our business units so that  
we gain maximum value from any research we undertake, and are able to  
share this effectively with the wider sector. 
Our internal processes and procedures, and our Operations Manual were  
updated by our Operations Support Team during 2013. Access to these 
important documents was improved through our investment in mobile working 
which allows them to be accessed from anywhere in our properties. Accessing 
these resources through mobile devices also helped employees follow the 
guidelines more consistently as they were guided through step by step. Our  
crisis procedures were also reviewed and updated by Operations Support in 
partnership with our Health and Safety team. 
Around half our 41,000 rooms are rented to students through nominations 
agreements with Universities. We continued to strengthen our relationships  
with our University partners through the formation of a dedicated University 
Partnerships team. We recognise that every institution has different needs and 
this team worked closely with UNITE’s Head of Higher Education Engagement, 
and our city teams, throughout the year to improve the way we manage HE 
relationships and to tailor our accommodation offer to better meet the needs  
of our nominations agreement partners.
The UK’s Higher Education sector is going through a time of profound change  
and growth. Our Head of Higher Education Engagement works closely with senior 
colleagues across the business to stay ahead of changes in the sector. By doing 
so, we can better understand the role that accommodation can play in enhancing 
a unique student experience for each of our University partners.
We behave with 
integrity in the 
relationships that  
allow our business model 
to work. This underpins 
our position as a 
sustainable business 
generating strong 
recurring cash flows.
 
Supporting small businesses
Our Scotland Area Facilities Manager, John Stevenson, 
began working with sole trade window cleaner, First 
Glass, at one of the city’s five properties. He was very 
reliable and John was keen to give him more work. John 
worked with business owner, Kenny Rogers, over time  
on his business plan and strategy. First Glass is now 
contracted to clean the windows at all UNITE’s Glasgow, 
Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Leeds and Newcastle sites and has 
won a number of other contracts. Kenny now employs six 
members of staff and operates a fleet of five vehicles.

Becoming a Supervisor 
UNITE’s accredited development programme, Becoming 
a Supervisor, is designed to provide participants with the 
confidence, skills and knowledge to progress to the next 
stage of their career. Emma Hamilton, Business 
Development Coordinator, said: 
“The course has been a great development 
platform for me that has supported my 
supervisory responsibilities. I feel better 
equipped to carry out my role with the 
knowledge and skills I have been able to 
develop and I felt a sense of achievement 
and pride after passing the course. I am 
looking forward to future development 
courses that will be on offer and I will 
certainly recommend the Becoming a 
Supervisor course to my colleagues.”
PEOPLE
We aim to grow diverse, talented and engaged teams where all employees have 
the support, development and opportunity to realise their professional and personal 
potential, enabling success and delivering a sustainable high performance culture. 
In 201 3 we focused on training and development, and providing clear career 
progression for our employees. Online learning became freely available on the intranet 
with modules including Mobile Working and Loan Working. We also launched our 
Becoming a Supervisor training course. There were 65 successful graduates in the 
inaugural year who are now on the path to more senior roles within UNITE. Importantly, 
Becoming a Supervisor is accredited by the Institute of Leadership and Management 
(ILM). Further development programmes for all roles are being introduced in 201 4.
Students from 21 5 countries lived with us during 201 3 and introduced cultural training 
for staff who have a high percentage of international students living in their properties 
from China, Malaysia, Cyprus, Thailand, India and Nigeria. 
The investment that we have made has been recognised externally and this year we 
gained the ‘Investors in People Silver’ accreditation. We also received our highest ever 
employee satisfaction score in our annual survey. 
201 3 was a successful year for UNITE thanks to the hard work of our employees. We 
celebrated the contribution of 1 1 5 staff members who went the extra mile for UNITE  
at our annual, black tie, Stars Awards. Our long service awards took place at Woburn 
Abbey and brought together 1 1 4 employees with over 370 years’ collective service. 
We aim to grow diverse, talented and engaged teams where  
all employees have the support, development and opportunity  
to realise their professional and personal potential, enabling 
success and delivering a sustainable high performance culture.
 
Launched Wellbeing programme
Student mental health is a growing concern across the 
HE sector. Our annual Higher Education partner survey 
confirmed feedback from our staff, that this was an area 
in which accommodation providers can make a significant 
impact on the lives of students. In 2013 we launched 
Wellbeing, a broad approach to ensuring the welfare of 
our student residents in all aspects of their life – physical 
health, mental health, study and achievement. Working  
in close partnership with University student services 
departments, our staff are able to provide support to 
students in a crisis, a sympathetic ear to students who are 
unhappy or concerned, and referrals to counselling and 
other specialist services to those who need it. Wellbeing  
is also about promoting positive lifestyles and habits, and 
initiatives involving healthy eating, stress reduction, good 
study habits and exercise throughout the year.

Health and Safety remained at the core of our business and the main areas  
of focus in 2013 were workplace safety and fire prevention. For more information  
on the work of the Group’s Health and Safety Committee, see page 61.
The Safety Support team rolled out a new Accident and Incident Management 
System (AIMS) which provides greater clarity over incidents relating to workplace 
safety, fire prevention, security and customer welfare support. On fire prevention, 
we installed over 500 fire door alarms in kitchens which help our customers 
recognise the importance of keeping kitchen fire protection doors closed. The 
installation programme is continuing into 2014 with a further 300 installations 
planned. During 2013, we also saw the roll-out of further safety training and a new 
Safety Support Services intranet site detailing clear procedures to support both 
our Health and Safety and Fire Prevention Policies. A Health and Safety training 
session was also held for the Operations Board and all Area Managers, to ensure 
their knowledge and understanding of the area is up to date.
 Online accident reporting 
In 2013 the Safety Support Services team worked with 
internal business partners to build an online reportable 
accident and incident system. Employees are now able to 
report safety issues, welfare incidents, accidents, theft 
and fires online. From this, managers are able to access 
reports that permit trend analysis to be carried out and 
risk control measures to be applied in an attempt to 
prevent or reduce the risk to safety of both customers and 
staff. Since its launch in May 2013, there have been over 
2,000 incidents reported on the system, ranging from 
minor incidents such as flooding to reportable accidents. 
The business now has sight of activities relating to safety 
and allows UNITE to act as both a responsible landlord 
and employer.

In 2013 the Safety Support Services team produced an 
internal safety management system for UNITE. This 
consisted of an overarching Group Safety Policy and a 
Fire Prevention Policy and procedural guides to support 
business compliance from gymnasiums to window safety. 
Risk assessments for all job roles have been created 
alongside a suite of safety and fire safety training courses 
to further develop our employees in key focus areas.
The team has worked with internal business partners  
to build a Safety Support Services home page on our 
company Intranet site. This simple and user friendly ‘one 
stop shop’ for safety was launched at the end of 2013  
and has proved invaluable as a support to the business, 
highlighting that people are our passion and safety is  
our strength.

 Cultural awareness
With an eclectic mix of nationalities living with UNITE it is important 
for our employees to understand what international students will be 
experiencing and the cultural differences they will encounter through 
living and learning in the UK. We have produced a number of cultural 
guides, available through Online Learning, to help us support and 
meet their needs. The largest percentage of international students 
living with us come from China; in light of this we created a more 
in-depth Chinese training programme and customer-facing employees 
from all 23 cities have attended the course since its inception in  
July 2013.. 
UNITE DIVERSITY 
POLICY
UNITE values diversity amongst its workforce. Our aim is that our 
workforce will be truly representative of all sections of society and 
each employee will feel respected and able to give their best.
The purpose of this policy is to promote a culture of equality and 
fairness for all and ensure no person acting on our behalf shall 
discriminate in any situation against another individual or group, 
directly or indirectly, because of any of the nine protected 
characteristics stated in the Equality Act 2010. The protected 
characteristics are: 
• age

Corporate governance 
Chairman’s overview and Code compliance
Committed to a culture  
of good governance 
Dear shareholders, 
How governance supported UNITE’s strategy  
during 2013 
Our Group strategy comprises three elements: grow recurring  
profits and cash flow while building on our market leading service 
platform; enhance our portfolio quality; and strengthen our capital 
base. A strong governance culture and framework built around  
these three elements is essential to secure its successful delivery. 
During 2013, the Board has continued to oversee the progression  
and implementation of the three strands of the Group’s strategy.  
The Board meets twice a year to focus on UNITE’s strategy, often  
at Universities across the UK in order to meet Vice-Chancellors  
and learn about their accommodation requirements and broader 
developments in the Higher Education sector.
The Board has driven the development of a market leading service 
platform with a particular emphasis on service delivery. Further, 
ensuring governance on health and safety is an integral part of  
our market leading service platform; the Board ensures health  
and safety governance through the Health and Safety Committee. 
A second area of focus was enhancing the quality of our portfolio. 
The Board reviewed and approved three new development projects, 
secured under contract, in strong regional locations, as well as three 
London projects as part of the LSAV pipeline. The Board scrutinised 
these projects, ensuring they meet the quality, location and target 
returns set by our strategy. 
Finally, the Board focused on strengthening our capital structure.  
The focus in 2013 was on reducing our cost of debt, extending our 
weighted average loan maturity and diversifying our sources of finance 
(for more detail see page 38). The Board, led by the CEO and CFO, 
oversaw this activity, with a number of successful refinancings, a share 
placing and the issue of a convertible bond, all completed during 2013.
Our governance priorities for 2014
During 2014, our Governance priorities will focus on:
• The allocation of our capital and the Group’s new developments; 
the Board will oversee the management of the build process, 
with a particular emphasis on planning and the timetable  
to completion
• Enhancing our market leading service platform; the Board will 
oversee the development of our brand coupled with an upgrade 
to our IT systems which will directly impact the way our 
customers deal with us. 
50 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1420-1 UNITE AR_2.Gov_v6.indd   50 02/04/2014   17:59 “ The Board has ultimate responsibility  
to UNITE shareholders for all the Group’s 
activities and also a broader responsibility, 
extending to environmental and social 
issues, recognising that the Group is home 
to 41,000 students during a crucial stage  
of their personal development…”
 
 
The UNITE Board is able to oversee the setting and implementation  
of the Group‘s strategy due to its flat management structure; four 
members of the Board are Executive Directors and therefore actively 
involved in the day to day implementation of the strategy. This 
executive perspective is balanced by five Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Chairman, who bring a depth and breadth of experience 
in senior management, finance, customer service and real estate. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility to UNITE shareholders for  
all the Group’s activities and also a broader responsibility, extending  
to environmental and social issues, recognising that the Group is  
home to 4 1,000 students during a crucial stage of their personal 
development, and with Universities right across the UK. To discharge 
this broader responsibility effectively, the Group needs to operate in an 
open, harmonious and transparent manner. One way in which this is 
achieved is by ensuring open communication between the Board and 
senior UNITE management. Senior management regularly present to 
the Board; for example, during 2013, UNITE’s Development Director, 
Funds Directors (representing our various co-investment vehicles), 
University Partnerships Director, Head of Legal & Company Secretary 
and Operations Directors (among others) presented to the Board.  
This access to senior management opens dialogue beyond the 
boardroom itself. 
Further, with Board meetings located in cities across the UK, the 
Board visits our new developments and the existing properties and 
meets with our Operations teams, giving them a grounded insight  
to the implementation of the strategy. 
Appointments and succession
During 2013, the Nomination Committee continued to ensure the  
Board had the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge in order to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. As part of an orderly succession plan, Stuart 
Beevor left the Board after nine years and Andrew Jones was appointed 
to supplement our Real Estate experience. In May 201 4, Richard Walker 
will also leave us after nine years’ service and we have appointed 
Elizabeth McMeikan (who joined on 1 February 201 4), who brings 
significant experience in customer-focused businesses to our Board.
Richard Walker’s positions as Chair of the Remuneration Committee  
and Chair of the Health and Safety Committee will be taken by Elizabeth 
McMeikan and Sir Tim Wilson respectively, following Richard’s departure. 
UK Corporate Governance Code
During 2013, our governance framework was enhanced to take  
into account the revisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the Code) introduced in September 2012 and also the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the 2013 Regulations).
The Code remained the minimum standard against which we 
measured ourselves during 2013. The Code is published by the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
We complied with all the provisions in the Code during 2013 and 
expect to be fully compliant during 2014. 
The edition of the Code published in September 2012 applied 
throughout our financial year ending 31 December 2013, but the 
Financial Conduct Authority has yet to change the Listing Rules and 
therefore requires that certain compliance statements are made in 
relation to the previous edition of the Code, issued in June 2010.  
This report addresses the requirements of both editions of the Code.
During the year to 31 December 2013 the Company has in all 
respects complied with the provisions of both editions of the Code.

Shareholders by geography % Relations with shareholders
The Board attaches a high priority to effective communication  
with shareholders and with other providers of capital to the business, 
and welcomes their views on the Group’s approach to corporate 
governance. In addition to the final and interim presentations, a series 
of meetings between institutional shareholders/other providers of 
capital and senior management were held throughout 2013. The 
Board is made aware of the views of major shareholders concerning 
the Company through, among other means, regular analyst and 
broker briefings, and surveys of shareholder opinion. That process  
will continue throughout 2014.
The Board, together with its professional advisers, actively analyses 
the Register of the Company with a view to ensuring the long-term 
stability of the Register.
The Company maintains a corporate website containing a wide  
range of information of interest to institutional and private investors. 
The Company has frequent discussions with shareholders on a range 
of issues affecting its performance, both following the Company’s 
announcements and in response to specific requests. The Company 
regularly seeks feedback on the perception of the Company  
amongst its shareholders, the investor community more broadly  
and its stakeholders.
Save in exceptional circumstances, all members of the Board attend 
the Company’s annual general meetings and shareholders are invited 
to ask questions during the meeting and to meet with Directors prior 
to, and after, the formal proceedings. At the meeting, the Chairman 
reviews the Group’s current trading.
The results of the votes at the annual general meetings, together with 
details of the level of proxy votes lodged for each resolution, are made 
available on a regulatory information service and on the Company’s

Board structure
Set out below is an outline of UNITE’s governance structure:
How the Board operates 
Meetings
The Board discusses and approves, annually, a forward agenda of 
items for the forthcoming year. This forward agenda sets out a wide 
range of matters to be reviewed and (to the extent necessary) 
approved at Board meetings, and at meetings of its Committees. 
Meetings are held in our head office in Bristol, in London (where a 
large proportion of our properties are located and also the largest 
concentration of Higher Education institutions in the UK) and in cities 
throughout the UK. These cities are selected to give the Board an 
opportunity to see, first-hand, the Company’s operations, properties 
and developments across the UK. During these city visits, the Board 
meets with senior leaders in the Higher Education sector, such  
as Vice-Chancellors of Universities UNITE partners with, so that  
the Board can hear how our business is performing and how  
the Higher Education sector is developing, directly from some  
of our key stakeholders. 
Board meetings are structured around the following areas:
• Operational, property and financial updates: To provide  
the Board with the necessary information to track the Group’s 
performance and challenge any problems with performance
• New development schemes: This is to review and challenge new 
development schemes being recommended by management and, 
due to the significant capital expenditure involved and key strategic 
decisions required, approve these schemes 
• Strategy and five year plan: To discuss, review and approve our 
strategy and five year plan, and track how we are performing 
against our current strategy and the five year plan
• Risk review: A review and discussion of our key risks at a Group 
level and also a review of our operational level risks (the Board’s 
operational risk review is to verify that risks have been properly 
identified and that appropriate risk mitigation plans are being 
properly managed with clear actions and ownership
• Market and Higher Education sector updates: To ensure  
the Board is equipped with the most up-to-date knowledge and 
understanding of the industry and environment we are operating in

• Training: To ensure the Board is up to date on key legal and 
regulatory changes (for example, during 2013, there was training  
on changes in the UK Corporate Governance Code, changes in 
executive remuneration reporting and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and changes in narrative reporting for the annual report) 
• Regular updates from the Board Committees on their 
activities and recommendations: This to ensure the detailed 
work performed in the Board Committees is considered by the 
Board as a whole. 
Senior managers are regularly invited to attend meetings and  
present to the Board on the areas they manage, and for which they 
have domain expertise. This provides the Board, and in particular the 
Non-Executives, with direct and open access to managers throughout 
the Group and helps foster a culture of openness and directness. 
Details of the number of meetings the Board and its Committees held 
during the year, and attendance of Directors at those meetings, are 
set out in the table on page 57.

Board tenure
Each of the Executive Directors has a rolling contract of  
employment with a 12-month notice period, whilst Non-Executive 
Directors are, subject to re-election by shareholders, appointed to the 
Board for a term of approximately three years. In accordance with the 
recommendations of the Code, the Directors will all retire at the annual 
general meeting and (other than Richard Walker who, after serving for 
nine years, will retire from Board at the annual general meeting), will 
submit themselves for re-election by shareholders.

Company’s expense when the Directors deem it necessary in order 
for them to carry out their responsibilities. The Directors also have 
regular dialogue with, and direct access to, the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary who ensures Board processes and corporate 
governance practices are followed.
Insurance
The Company maintains Directors and Officers Liability insurance, 
which is renewed on an annual basis.

Board induction 
Elizabeth McMiekan joined the Board on 1 February 2014  
as a Non-Executive Director and takes over as Remuneration 
Committee Chair once Richard Walker retires from the Board  
in May 2014. Her induction was organised by the Company 
Secretary and covered our operations and developments, the 
Higher Education industry, corporate governance and risk. In 
addition, with Elizabeth taking over the Remuneration Committee 
chair, Elizabeth’s induction was further tailored to cover the 2013 
changes in remuneration reporting and she spent time with the 
Group’s remuneration consultants, Kepler Associates. So that 
Elizabeth could get close to the business, she visited a handful of 
our operating properties and our development sites throughout the 
UK. This will continue going forward, with Group Board meetings 
taking place throughout the UK with visits to our operating 
properties and development sites.
Induction
On appointment, each Director takes part in a comprehensive and 
personalised induction programme covering:
• The business and operations of the Group and the Higher 
Education sector, the role of the Board and matters reserved  
for its decisions; the terms of reference and membership of  
Board Committees; and powers delegated to those Committees
• The Group’s corporate governance practices and procedures  
and the latest financial information about the Group, and
• Their legal and regulatory responsibilities as a Director and, 
specifically, as a Director of a listed company.
As part of the induction programme, each Director also visits key 
locations to see our business operations and properties first hand  
and the Higher Education institutions we are partnering with. Also, 
they meet with key senior executives so from the outset they have 
access to managers throughout the organisation to help them form 
their own independent views on the Group and its performance, and 
the Higher Education sector we operate in. In addition, they are given 
the opportunity to meet with representatives of the Company’s  
key advisors.
This induction is also supplemented with ongoing training throughout 
the year to ensure the Board is kept up to date with key legal, 
regulatory and industry updates.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers each of its five Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent. Accordingly, the Company meets the requirement of  
the Code in relation to members of the FTSE 350 that at least half  
of the Board (excluding the Chairman) is made up of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. In addition, Phil White (Chairman of the 
Board) was considered independent on his appointment to that role.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals on strategy, and bring strong, 
independent judgement, knowledge and experience to the Board’s 
deliberations. Non-Executive Directors are expected to commit 
approximately 20 days per annum to the business of the Group.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office and at the annual general meeting.
Performance evaluation
Each year the Board, its Committees and Directors are evaluated 
considering (among other things) the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge on the Board, its diversity (including 
gender), how it works together as a unit and other factors relevant  
to its effectiveness. Every third year, this evaluation is conducted  
by an external advisor with the requisite skill and expertise. The last 
independent evaluation was undertaken in 201 1 by Ffion Hague 
Independent Board Evaluation (which has no other connection with 
the Company) followed by internal reviews in 2012 and 2013. 
During 2013, the Non-Executive Directors, and the Board as a  
whole, considered the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees 
considering the criteria set out above. The Chairman evaluated  
the effectiveness of the Chief Executive and the Chief Executive 
evaluated the effectiveness of the other Executive Directors. In 
addition, the Senior Independent Director evaluated the Chairman. 
This 2013 review concluded that the Board and its Committees  
were working effectively. In particular, it was noted that meetings  
were productive and well prepared for and the meetings ran smoothly. 
Senior managers throughout the organisation were invited to present 
to the Board on their areas of expertise. This ensured the Board had  
a deeper and uncluttered view of the organisation, our operations  
and the Higher Education industry. Further, this helped the Board 
constructively challenge matters brought to them for approval, and 
ensure there was well informed dialogue at the Board meetings. 
The 2013 internal evaluation noted that, due to the large number of 
regulatory changes coming into force during 2013 (notably on the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, executive remuneration and narrative 
reporting), the Board should receive training on these key changes 
during 2013. This training did take place during 2013 with the result 
that the Board felt confident with the changes and believed it was 
being kept up to date with these developments. 
A formal independent evaluation will be undertaken during the second 
half of 2014.

Nomination Committee 
report
Sir Tim Wilson
Chair of the Nomination Committee
Dear shareholders, 
The Nomination Committee is integral to an effective Board. It 
ensures the Board has the correct balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge. In addition, the Nomination Committee 
drives Board succession planning. In discharging this responsibility,  
it is critical that the Nomination Committee anticipates the Group’s 
challenges and opportunities so we can help future proof the  
Board with the appropriate diversity of skills and experience for  
the changing environment we operate in. 
During 2013, the Nomination Committee focus has been on 
appointing a new Non-Executive Director, Elizabeth McMeikan,  
who joined us on 1 February 2014. Elizabeth’s appointment was part 
of our timely succession planning for Richard Walker, the Chair of our 
Remuneration Committee and Health and Safety Committee, who 
leaves us in May 2014 after nine years’ service. Following Richard 
Walker’s departure, Elizabeth will become the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and I will take over as Chair of the  
Health and Safety Committee. 
Further, during 2013, we monitored the induction of Andrew Jones, 
who joined the Board on 1 February 2013, and also focused on senior 
management succession planning to ensure the future leadership 
needs of the business are kept under review.
Committee overview
Composition
The Committee is comprised entirely of Non-Executive Directors.  
The members of the Committee are set out on page 58 of the 
corporate governance statement. At the invitation of the Committee, 
any other Director or other person may be invited to attend meetings 
of the Committee if considered desirable in assisting the Committee 
in fulfilling its role.
Role
The role of the Committee is to:
• Ensure appropriate procedures are adopted and followed in  
the nomination, selection, training, evaluation and re-election  
of Directors and for succession planning, with due regard in all 
cases to the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender
• Regularly review the structure, size, composition, skills and 
experience of the Board and to make recommendations with  
regard to any adjustments considered necessary
• When it is agreed that an appointment to the Board should be 
made, lead a selection process that is formal, rigorous and 
transparent, and 
• Be responsible for identifying, reviewing and recommending 
candidates for appointment to the Board.
Activities in 2013
The major activity of the Committee in 2013 was the search and 
appointment of a Non-Executive Director to replace Richard Walker 
(who retires from the Board at the annual general meeting). 
The Nomination Committee decided to look for someone with 
experience as an operator in a multi-site environment, particularly  
in the retail and/or leisure sector, where customer service is of  
vital importance and an understanding of digital media and social 
networking is key. The Zygos Partnership (a signatory to the Voluntary 
Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms) was engaged to 
conduct a thorough search and this resulted in a strong list of 
candidates. The Zygos Partnership has no other connection with the 
Company. Following a series of meetings between the Nomination 
Committee and these candidates, Elizabeth McMeikan was invited to 
join the Board, which she did on 1 February 2014. Biographical details 
of Elizabeth McMeikan are set out on page 52. 
In addition, as part of an ongoing Board succession planning review, 
the Nomination Committee reviewed the skills and experience of 
senior managers in the Group’s various business units. The primary 
purpose was to establish the internal pipeline for future Board 
candidates and identify development needs for these high potentials.
Board diversity 
As a business that provides homes for 41,000 students from many 
different backgrounds and countries, the Board recognises that 
diversity at the Board level and across the Group, including gender,  
is critical to our continued success. The Board is proud of the diversity 
of the Group as a whole, an organisation made up of employees  
who, like our customers, are from many different backgrounds and 
countries and have diverse personalities, experiences, perspectives 
and skills (see table on page 49). This is fundamental to us providing 
the best customer service to our diverse customers and 
understanding their needs. 
The Nomination Committee considered during 2013 whether  
it wanted to set specific targets for female representation on the 
Board or other diversity targets. The Committee welcomes the 
developments in the Code to consider diversity at a Board level,  
but the Committee does not feel the setting of targets is necessarily 
in the best interests of the Group and its stakeholders. Rather, the 
Committee will consider gender diversity, along with all other aspects 
of diversity, with its more general remit to consider the balance of 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge when reviewing 
appointments to the Board.

Committee report
Richard Walker 
Chair of the Health & Safety Committee 
Dear shareholders,
The Health and Safety Committee ensures the governance of  
health and safety in both our ongoing operations and our construction 
and development activity. We are home to 41,000 students and their 
safety, welfare and security are critical not only to us but also other 
key stakeholders, such as parents and Universities as well as the 
police and fire services. 
During 2013, the focus of the Committee has been on the 
governance of workplace safety and fire prevention procedures, our 
key health and safety risks. These priorities have been implemented 
by our new Head of Health and Safety, appointed at the start of 2013. 
Fire and workplace safety will continue as our health and safety 
priorities for 2014, with a particular focus on a new auditing 
programme we are rolling out during 2014 to further enhance  
our safety and security in our properties. Further, we will be bench 
marking UNITE against other similar providers on workplace safety 
and fire prevention to help ensure governance in our health and  
safety processes and implement industry best practices.
I am pleased to report that during 2013 UNITE became a full member 
of the British Safety Council and affiliate member of the University 
Health and Safety Association. 
Committee overview 
Composition
• Richard Walker (Chair)
• Sir Tim Wilson 
• Mark Allan 
Richard Simpson (Managing Director, Property) and Richard Smith 
(Managing Director, Operations), together with the Group Head  
of Health and Safety, Douglas Cameron, also attend meetings  
of the Committee.
Role
The role of the Health and Safety Committee is to:
• Ensure the Group’s policies, procedures and working practices 
regarding health and safety meet or exceed legal obligations
• Annually review the Group’s Health and Safety policy
• Ensure the Board is kept abreast of any regulatory changes  
in relation to health and safety and environmental issues and the 
impact such changes may have on the business of the Group, and
• Receive reports as to business unit health and safety and 
environmental performance, policies and arrangements and  
any major health and safety incidents so as to ensure  
management identifies and implements any corrective  
action considered appropriate.
Activities in 2013
The major activity of the Committee in 2013 was workplace  
safety and fire prevention. The Safety Support team rolled out a  
new Accident and Incident Management System (AIMS) which 
provides greater clarity over incidents relating to workplace safety,  
fire prevention, security and customer welfare support. AIMS is being 
used by the business to direct resources more effectively and provide 
enhanced support material and training. 
On fire prevention, the business installed over 500 fire door  
alarms in kitchens. These alarms help ensure our customers 
recognise the importance of keeping kitchen fire protection doors 
closed, this being one of the greatest causes of fire in our operating 
properties. The installation programme will continue into 2014 with  
a further 300 installations planned. During 2013, we also saw the 
roll-out of further safety training and a new Safety Support Services 
intranet site detailing clear procedures to support both our Health  
and Safety and Fire Prevention Policies. 
Priorities for 2014
The Committee has set the following strategic priorities for 2014:
• A new auditing programme for fire risk assessment and  
workplace safety
• Revision of fire prevention procedures so as to see a decrease  
in incidents as well as false fire alarm activations
• A review of our induction and job role training for team members 
• Improved information for our customers using modern  
media technology
• Benchmarking UNITE against other similar providers for our 
workplace safety and fire prevention to help ensure governance  
in our health and safety processes and implement industry  
best practices.

Accountability
Audit Committee report
Manjit Wolstenholme
Chair of the Audit Committee
Dear shareholders, 
The Audit Committee plays an important role sitting between 
management and shareholders. The Committee has specific duties  
as set out in its terms of reference, in line with the Code, and goes 
beyond to reassure shareholders that their interests are properly 
protected in respect of the Company’s financial management  
and reporting. 
The Audit Committee works to a structured programme of activities, 
with agenda items focused to coincide with key events in the annual 
financial reporting cycle. The Committee reports regularly to the 
Board on its work. 
During 2013, the Audit Committee has continued to monitor the 
integrity of the Group’s financial statements; assisted the Board in 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control and risk 
management systems; reviewed the internal audit activity and findings; 
and reviewed arrangements for the Group’s employees to raise 
concerns in confidence. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the performance of the Group’s 
external auditor each year and believes the relationship with the 
auditor continues to be effective. We remain satisfied with the 
auditor’s independence and effectiveness and have recommended  
to the Board that they be re-appointed. 
As noted in this corporate governance statement, the Board 
delegates certain of its duties, responsibilities and powers to the  
Audit Committee, so that these can receive suitably focused attention. 
However, the Audit Committee acts on behalf of the full Board, and 
the matters reviewed and managed by the Committee remain the 
responsibility of the Directors taken as a whole.
Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has delegated authority from the Board  
set out in its written terms of reference. The terms of reference 
for the Audit Committee take into account the requirements of the 
Code and are available for inspection at the registered office and at 
the annual general meeting and can also be found on the Company 
website at www.unite-group.co.uk/about-unite/ 
corporate-governance. 
The key objectives of the Audit Committee are:
• To provide effective governance and control over the integrity  
of the Group’s financial reporting and review significant financial 
reporting judgements
• To review the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls, including financial controls and risk management systems
• To monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function 
and review its material findings, and 
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control. However, such a system is designed to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement.
The provisions of the Code in respect of internal controls require that 
Directors review all controls including operational, compliance and risk 
management, as well as financial controls. Through reports from the 
Board’s Committees, the Group’s Risk Committee and the Group’s 
business unit boards (Operations Board and Property Board), the 
Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls for the period covered by the Annual Report and 
Accounts and has concluded that such controls were effective 
throughout such period.
Further information on the Company’s internal control framework is 
set out in the Audit Committee report. The Board delegates certain of 
its duties, responsibilities and powers to the Audit Committee, so that 
these can receive suitably focused attention, but in so doing the Audit 
Committee acts on behalf of the full Board, and the matters reviewed 
and managed by the Audit Committee remain the responsibility of the 
Directors taken as a whole.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Risk management
The Board, when setting the strategy, also determines the nature and 
extent of the significant risks and its risk appetite in implementing this 
strategy. Each year the Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management systems and how the Board did this during 2013 is 
set out in ‘Risk management’ on page 64. 
Business model
For a description of the Group’s business model, see page 16 of the 
strategic report. 
62 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1420-1 UNITE AR_2.Gov_v6.indd   62 02/04/2014   18:00 • To oversee the relationship with the external auditor, including 
making recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment of the external auditor and monitoring the  
external auditor’s objectivity and independence.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The members of the Committee are set out on page 58 of this corporate 
governance statement. The Committee members are all independent 
Non-Executives and have been selected with the aim of providing the 
wide range of financial and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil the 
Committee’s duties. The Board considers that as a chartered accountant 
I have recent and relevant financial experience.
Meetings are attended, by invitation, by the Chief Executive, the  
Chief Financial Officer, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Group 
Financial Controller and the External Reporting and Tax Manager.
I also invite our external auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, to each meeting.  
The Committee regularly meets separately with KPMG Audit Plc 
without others being present. As appropriate, I also invite our internal 
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to attend the meetings. 
Committee meetings
The Committee met five times during the year and attendance at those 
meetings is shown on page 57 of this corporate governance statement. 
Main activities of the Committee during the year
The Committee assists the Board in carrying out its responsibilities in 
relation to financial reporting requirements, risk management and the 
assessment of internal controls. It also reviews the effectiveness of 
the Company’s Internal Audit function and manages the Company’s 
relationship with the external auditor.
As part of this process of working with the Board and to maximise 
effectiveness, meetings of the Committee generally take place just 
prior to a Company Board meeting. I report to the Board as part of a 
separate agenda item, on the activity of the Committee and matters  
of particular relevance to the Board in the conduct of their work. At its 
five meetings during the year, the Committee focused on the activities 
described below.
Following the publication of the revised version of the Code, which 
applies to financial years commencing on or after 1 October 2012,  
the Board requested that the Committee advise it on whether we 
believe the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. The Committee has undertaken a review and is 
satisfied that there are appropriate controls and procedures in place  
to ensure the Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balance and 
understandable. Additionally, this review covered all of the changes  
to the Code and the Committee has ensured the appropriate changes 
have been made to the Group’s external reporting.
The Committee reviewed the half-year and annual financial 
statements and the significant financial reporting judgements.  
As part of this review, the Committee reviewed the liquidity risk and 
the basis for preparing the accounts on a going concern basis as 
outlined below. The Committee also reviewed the external auditor’s 
report on these financial statements. 
The Committee considered and approved the audit approach and 
scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the external auditor 
and the fees for the same. The Committee also considered the 
independence of the auditor and the recommendations in the  
Code regarding the tender of the external audit contract. 
The Committee considered reports from the internal auditors on their 
audits and assessment of the control environment. The Committee 
reviewed and proposed areas of focus for the Internal Audit 
programme of review. 
Financial reporting
The primary focus of the Committee in relation to financial reporting in 
respect of the year ending 2013 was to review with both management 
and the external auditor the appropriateness of the half-year and 
annual financial statements concentrating on:
• The quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices
• The clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial 
reporting standards and relevant financial and governance 
reporting requirements
• Material areas in which significant judgements have been applied or 
there has been discussion with the external auditor, and
• Whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
To aid our review, the Committee considers reports from the External 
Reporting Manager and also reports from the external auditor on the 
outcomes of their half-year review and annual audit. As a Committee 
we support KPMG Audit Plc in displaying the necessary professional 
scepticism their role requires.
Significant issues considered by the Committee 
After discussion with both management and the external auditor,  
the Committee determined that the key risk of misstatement of  
the Group’s 2013 financial statements related to:
• Property valuations, and
• Deferred tax assets. 
Property valuation
The Group’s principal assets are investment properties and investment 
properties under development that are either owned on balance sheet  
or in the Group’s Fund or joint ventures. The investment properties are 
carried at fair value based on an appraisal by the Group’s external valuers 
who carry out the valuations in accordance with the Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors Red Book valuation guide, taking into account 
transactional evidence during the year. The valuation of property assets 
involves significant judgement and changes in the core assumptions 
could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets. 
Management discuss the underlying performance of each asset with the 
external valuers and provide detailed performance data to them including 
rents, University lease agreements, occupancy, property costs and costs 
to complete (for development properties). Management receive detailed 
reports from the valuers and perform a detailed review of the valuations 
to ensure management consider the valuations to be appropriate.

The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 63
1420-1 UNITE AR_2.Gov_v6.indd   63 02/04/2014   18:00 During the year, the Committee met with two of the Group’s valuers 
and challenged them on the basis of their valuations and their core 
assumptions, including the yield for each property, rental growth and 
forecast costs. The Committee was satisfied that the Group’s valuers 
were appropriately qualified and provided an independent assessment 
of the Group’s assets. The Committee was satisfied that an appropriate 
valuation process had taken place, the core assumptions used  
were reasonable and hence the carrying value of investment and 
development properties in the financial statements was appropriate.
The auditor explained their audit procedures to test the valuation of 
investment and development properties and the Group’s disclosures 
on the subject. On the basis of their audit work, the auditor reported 
no inconsistencies or misstatements that were material in the context 
of the financial statements as a whole.
Deferred tax assets
The Group has significant tax losses brought forward from prior  
years. Recognition of deferred tax assets relating to these losses is 
only made when it is probable that these losses will be utilised in the 
future and is therefore dependent on the forecast taxable profits 
which involve significant judgements and assumptions regarding 
future performance. Recent changes in Group strategy to reduce 
gearing levels and improved profitability have made the future use  
of these losses more likely. Management regularly prepare forecasts 
of the Group results which are reviewed at Board level. Management 
have used these forecasts to model the Group’s future taxable profits 
which were then reviewed with the support of external tax advisors  
to ensure management considered the forecast taxable profits 
appropriate. Management also considered the impact on the Group’s 
tax profile of potential conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust 
(REIT) in the medium term and whether complexities in the Group 
structure might make some of the tax losses inaccessible at some 
point in the future. Management therefore decided to restrict deferred 
tax assets in respect of the next three years’ forecast taxable profits.
During the year, the Committee has regularly discussed the recognition 
of a deferred tax asset with management and the Group’s external 
auditor. The Committee was satisfied that the forecast approach and 
three year recognition criteria and assumptions were reasonable and 
hence the recognition of only a relatively small deferred tax asset 
included in the financial statements was appropriate.
The auditor explained their audit procedures to test the assets 
recognised and the Group’s disclosures on the subject. On the  
basis of the audit work, the auditor reported no inconsistencies  
or misstatements that were material in the context of the financial 
statements as a whole.
Risk management
The Group’s risk assessment process and the way in which significant 
business risks are managed is a key area of focus for the Committee.
Our work here was driven primarily by performing an assessment of 
the approach taken by the Group’s Risk Committee which is chaired 
by Joe Lister, the Group CFO. The Risk Committee is responsible for 
the delivery of the Group’s risk management framework, which the 
Committee has approved, and the Group’s assessment of its principal 
risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 27 to 29. We reviewed 
and challenged reports from the CFO and Head of Legal on the 
Group’s risk evaluation process and reviewed changes to significant 
risks identified at both operating entity and Group levels. As part of 
this review, the Committee also considered the risk management 
procedures within the business and was satisfied that the key Group 
risks were being appropriately managed. 
The risk assessment flags the importance of the internal control 
framework to manage risk and this forms a separate area of review  
for the Committee. 
Internal control
Led by the Group’s risk assessment process, we reviewed the  
process by which the Group evaluated its control environment. 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining  
adequate internal controls over financial reporting, including over  
the Group’s consolidation process. Internal controls are designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external 
reporting purposes. A comprehensive strategic planning, budgeting 
and forecasting process is in place. Monthly financial information  
and performance insight is reported to the Board. 
The Committee’s work to review the effectiveness of the internal 
controls was driven by the Group Financial Controller’s reports on  
the effectiveness of internal controls; the feedback from the Group’s 
internal auditor on specific areas of control that are tested on a 
periodic basis and a request to our external auditor to provide specific 
feedback and assessment of the Group’s financial controls and any 
areas of weakness. No significant weaknesses were identified 
through the course of the Committee’s reviews.
Internal audit
The Group engages PricewaterhouseCoopers to perform internal 
audit activity. The Committee discussed and provided guidance for  
the programme of activity that would be undertaken by the internal

The relationship with PricewaterhouseCoopers is managed by an 
Internal Audit Manager and the Group Financial Controller. Reports 
from the CFO include updates on audit activities and progress of the

concluded that the financial controls tested appeared to be designed 
and operating effectively. 
External audit
The effectiveness of the external audit process is facilitated by 
appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the audit cycle.  
We receive from KPMG Audit Plc a detailed audit plan, identifying  
its assessment of these key risks. 
For the 2013 financial year the significant risks identified were  
in relation to the valuation of properties, funding covenants and 
refinancing, the recognition of income, cost and interest capitalisation 
and joint ventures due to the inherent management judgement 
required in these areas. These risks are tracked through the year and 
we challenged the work done by the auditors to test management’s 
assumptions and estimates around these areas. We assess the 
effectiveness of the audit process in addressing these matters  
through the reporting we receive from KPMG Audit Plc at both the 
half-year and year end. In addition we performed a review of auditor 
effectiveness. We perform this through the use of a questionnaire  
and discussion with management. We use this approach to gain 
comfort that the external auditor is duly qualified, independent  
and carries out its audit strategy appropriately.
For the 2013 financial year, the Committee was satisfied that there  
had been appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas of audit 
risk and assessed the quality of the audit process to be good. We hold 
private meetings with the external auditor at each Committee meeting 
to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback from 
the Committee and the auditor without management being present. 
Matters typically discussed include: 
• The auditor’s assessment of business and financial statement risks 
and management activity thereof
• The transparency and openness of interactions with management, 
confirmation that there has been no restriction in scope placed on 
them by management and the independence of its audit, and
• How they have exercised professional scepticism. 
I also meet with the external lead audit partner outside the formal 
committee process throughout the year.
Independence and external audit tender
The Committee considers the re-appointment of the external auditor, 
including the rotation of the audit partner, each year and also assesses 
their independence on an ongoing basis. To maintain the objectivity of 
the audit process, the Group supports audit partner rotation and the 
external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible for  
the Group audit every five years. The current lead audit partner, Bill 
Meredith, has been in place for two years. KPMG Audit Plc has been 
the Company’s external auditor since its stock market listing in  
1999 ( 1 4 years). 
While the Group has not formally tendered the audit since then, the 
audit partner has been regularly rotated after five years of service on 
the Audit and Bill Meredith was instated prior to the launch of the 
revised Code. The transitional guidance suggests that the audit is 
tendered at the end of the current audit partner’s five-year term, so in 
2016. Notwithstanding this, the Audit Committee considers it 
appropriate to conduct a tender of the external audit contract before 
2016 and a tender will be run within the next two years. 
In addition, as part of the Audit Committee’s assessment of the 
independence of the auditor, the Committee receives details of any 
relationships between the Company and KPMG Audit Plc that may  
have a bearing on their independence and receives confirmation  
that it is independent of the Company. 
Non-audit services
To further safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external 
auditor from becoming compromised, the Committee has a formal 
policy governing the engagement of the external auditor to provide 
non-audit services. No material changes have been made to this policy 
during the year. This precludes KPMG Audit Plc from providing certain 
services such as valuation work or the provision of accounting services.
For certain specific permitted services (reporting accountant activities, 
tax advisory and compliance work and debt advisory services), the 
Committee has pre-approved that KPMG Audit Plc can be engaged  
by management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject to 
specified fee limits for individual engagements and fee limits for each 
type of specific service. For all other services, or those permitted 
services that exceed the specified fee limits, I as Chairman, or in my 
absence another member, can pre-approve permitted services.

During the year KPMG Audit Plc charged the Group £0.3 million for 
audit and audit related services. The Committee approved the fees for 
audit services for 2013 after a review of the level and nature of work  
to be performed, including the impact of acquisitions, and after being 
satisfied by KPMG Audit Plc that the fees were appropriate for the 
scope of the work required. These fees are also benchmarked against 
other listed real estate companies of comparable size and complexity.
In addition to the statutory audit fee and fees for the audit of subsidiaries, 
KPMG Audit Plc charged the Group a further £0.2 million for taxation 
compliance and £0. 1 million for tax advisory services. While non-audit 
services amount to approximately 100% of the audit services, the Audit 
Committee considers this appropriate given that a significant portion of 
the non-audit services relate to the provision of tax compliance services 
(principally assistance with corporation tax returns). The Committee 
considers that these services are most suitably performed by the 
external auditor and could not be provided as cost effectively by another 
professional auditing firm. No valuation or accounting services are 
provided by KPMG Audit Plc. 
The Audit Committee recognises that, to help ensure external auditor 
objectivity and independence, the level of fees for non-audit services 
as compared to fees for audit services going forward needs to be 
reduced. To address this, the Company will (as mentioned above) put 
its external audit contract out to tender within the next two years. 
Following the results of this tender, the Audit Committee will then 
consider what further steps are needed, if any, to reduce the level  
of fees for non-audit services charged by the external auditor as 
compared with the fees for its audit services. 
Further details of the fees paid, for both audit and non-audit services,  
can be found in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
KPMG LLP
KPMG has informed us that for administrative reasons and to instigate 
the orderly wind down of business, they wish to formally change the 
entity which conducts our audit from KPMG Audit Plc to KPMG LLP . 
KPMG Audit Plc has indicated that it will not stand for re-appointment  
at our 201 4 annual general meeting, however, KPMG LLP will seek 
election at this meeting. Our Board has decided to recommend KPMG 
LLP to be appointed as external auditor to the Company at the 201 4 
annual general meeting and an authority for the Directors to set the 
remuneration of the auditor will also be sought.

1420-1 UNITE AR_2.Gov_v6.indd   66 02/04/2014   18:00 Dear shareholder,
It is my pleasure to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for  
the year ended 31 December 2013. We continue to operate a simple 
remuneration structure made up of base salary and benefits, a bonus 
plan and a single long-term incentive plan, which provides a clear link 
between pay and our strategic objectives.
Performance of the Company in 2013
2013 was another excellent year for the Group as we continued to 
deliver sustainable returns and growth for our shareholders. The key 
highlights are as follows:
• Recurring profits, measured as adjusted earnings per share, 
increased by 37.4% to 13.6 pence 
• NAV per share increased by 9.1% to 382 pence
• See-through LTV ratio reduced to 49% from 52%
• See-through cost of debt reduced to 4.7% from 5.5%
• The Group invested £73.6 million (on a see-through basis; £83.9 
million gross) in continuing development projects and improvements 
to the existing investment portfolio
• Largely completed our non-core asset disposal programme with 
£60 million of disposals (of which £19 million are wholly owned 
assets, £34 million UCC assets and £7 million USAF assets) 
completed/exchanged unconditionally since our 2012 results  
and a further £15 million conditionally exchanged
• Increased our dividend by 20% for the full financial year.
Aligning Remuneration Policy with Company  
principles and strategy
Building on its market leading position, the Group has been pursuing  
a clear and consistent strategy to grow recurring profits and cash flow, 
enhance the portfolio quality and establish a sustainable capital 
structure. We operate one simple annual bonus plan and LTIP where 
performance is assessed against a range of financial, operational and 
long-term returns ensuring value is delivered to our shareholders and 
participants are rewarded for the successful delivery of the key 
strategic objectives of the Company. Remuneration is heavily weighted 
towards variable pay, which is dependent on performance, ensuring  
a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the 
amount paid to our Directors.
Remuneration decisions for 2013
The basic salaries for Executive Directors will increase by 2.5%, in line 
with the rest of the organisation, effective 1 March 2014. 
Following an outstanding year for the Group, Executive Directors will 
receive bonuses of 121% of their respective base salaries (out of a 
maximum 144% of salary). The Committee is satisfied that these 
bonuses reflect the Executives’ contribution to the underlying 
performance of the Company over the last year.
Under the LTIP, performance share awards made in 201 1 vested  
on performance to 31 December 2013. These awards were based  
on net asset value, net portfolio contribution and total shareholder 
return (TSR) outperformance of the FTSE 350 Real Estate. The 
Company exceeded maximum targets for both the NPC and TSR 
elements, whilst strong NAV performance resulted in around half  
of that element vesting. 
During 2013, UNITE raised £50 million through a successful placing 
of new shares. Following the placing, the Remuneration Committee 
evaluated the potential impact on the outcomes of the performance 
related annual bonus and LTIP in respect of 2013. Given the quantum 
(less than 5% impact) and the consistent improved performance of 
the business as a whole, the Committee decided against amending 
the targets for the Executive Directors and other senior personnel.
During the year, soft clawback was introduced to the Executive 
Directors’ bonuses and LTIPs reflecting feedback from our 
shareholders. The Committee also agreed to evolve the metrics on 
both the annual bonus and LTIP for 2014, reflecting feedback from 
shareholders as we continue to simplify our business model and 
reporting. Earnings per share and total return will replace NPC and 
NAV on the LTIP and we will move to an earnings per share metric  
for the annual bonus (from adjusted earnings).
Remuneration policy for 2014
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy is set out for shareholder approval 
in the policy report on pages 68 to 75. Details on how the policy will 
be applied in practice for the 2014 financial year are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 76 to 87. The Committee  
will continue to review the annual bonus and LTIP and will welcome 
feedback from our shareholders as we remain committed to an  
open and transparent dialogue.
New Chair 
After nine years as a Non-Executive Director for UNITE, I will be 
retiring from the Board at the AGM. At that stage, Elizabeth McMeikan 
will become Chair of the Remuneration Committee and I wish her well 
in her new role at UNITE.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. It also meets the requirements of the UK Listing 
Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
In accordance with the Regulations, the following sections of the 
Remuneration Report are subject to audit: the single total figure of 
remuneration for Directors and accompanying notes (pages 77 to 81), 
scheme interests awarded during the financial year (pages 82 to 83), 
payments to past Directors (page 83), payments for loss of office 
(page 83) and the statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share 
interests (pages 85 to 87). The remaining sections of the report are 
not subject to audit.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Group aims to balance the need to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and other senior executives of an appropriate 
calibre with the need to be cost effective, whilst at the same time 
rewarding exceptional performance. The Committee has designed 
a Remuneration Policy that balances those factors, taking account  
of prevailing best practice, investor expectations and the level of 
remuneration and pay awards made generally to employees of 
the Group.
In addition to the above, the Remuneration Policy for the Executive 
Directors and other senior executives is based on the following  
key principles:
• A significant proportion of remuneration should be tied to the 
achievement of specific and stretching performance conditions  
that align remuneration with the creation of shareholder value  
and the delivery of the Group’s strategic plan.

Performance Related Annual Bonus
To incentivise and reward strong performance against financial and non-
financial annual targets, thus delivering value to shareholders and being 
consistent with the delivery of the strategic plan.
Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the 
start of the year.
The scheme has two elements: a ‘corporate’ element and  
an ‘individual’ multiplier element. At the end of the year, the 
Remuneration Committee determines the extent to which 
targets have been achieved.
Bonus payments are delivered in cash unless an individual’s 
shareholding requirements have not been met, in which  
case up to 50% of the annual bonus payable to the relevant 
Director is satisfied by an allocation of shares in the Company, 
which are held in its Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) 
and are subject to clawback provisions.
For Executive Directors, the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 144% of base salary, comprising:
• A maximum bonus under the corporate element of 120%  
of salary; achieving on-target performance warrants a  
bonus equivalent to 70% of salary
• A maximum multiplier under the individual element of  
1.2, with a range of zero to 1.2
For threshold level performance, the bonus will be 50%  
of base salary.
Performance is assessed on an annual basis, as measured against specific 
objectives set at the start of each year. The measures include financial and 
non-financial metrics as well as the achievement of personal objectives.
Corporate measures will be weighted appropriately each year according to 
business priorities. Measures may include, but are not limited to, adjusted 
earnings, EPS, NAV growth, cash flow, LTV gearing and customer satisfaction. 
Weightings of individual measures may vary between 10% and 50%, with the 
range of performance required under each measure calibrated with reference 
to UNITE’s internal budgets. Financial measures will make up at least 75% of 
the total opportunity under the corporate element.
The individual element is based on the strength of an Executives’ personal 
performance over the course of the year, as measured by the twice-annual 
Performance Development Programme review.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic bonus outcomes  
both upwards (within the plan limits) and downwards (including down to  
zero) to ensure alignment of pay with performance, e.g. in the event of one  
of the targets under the bonus being significantly missed or unforeseen 
circumstances outside of management control. The Committee also 
considers measures outside of the bonus framework (e.g. H&S) to  
ensure there is no reward for failure.
Further details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable are 
provided on page 78. 
LTIP
To drive sustained long-term performance that supports the creation of 
shareholder value.
The LTIP comprises a Performance Share Plan (PSP) and  
an approved Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS).
The ESOS is used to deliver a proportion of the LTIP in a 
tax-efficient manner, and is subject to the same performance 
conditions as awards made under the PSP.
Award levels and performance conditions are reviewed before 
each award cycle to ensure they remain appropriate and no 
less stretching than the first cycle.
Clawback will apply on unvested LTIP shares in the  
event of gross misconduct, material misstatement, if a 
mistake has been made in calculating vesting for a previous 
award or in any other circumstance that the Committee 
considers appropriate.
The LTIP provides for an award up to a normal aggregate  
limit of 150% of salary for Executive Directors, with an overall 
limit of 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
For LTIP participants below Board level, the maximum annual 
LTIP opportunity is capped at 100% of base salary.
Awards may include a grant of HMRC approved options not 
exceeding £10k per annum, valued on a fair value exchange 
(currently 50-60% of a PSP award).
The Committee has the discretion to authorise a payment, in 
cash or shares, equal to the value of dividends which would 
have accrued on vested shares during the vesting period.
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance 
against three equally-weighted measures, which are currently as follows:
• Adjusted EPS
• TR, and
• Relative TSR.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the performance measures  
to ensure they continue to be linked to the delivery of Company strategy.
Under each measure, threshold performance will result in 25% of maximum 
vesting for that element, rising on a straight line to full vesting.
Awards made under the LTIP will have a performance period of at least 
three years and a minimum vesting period of three years. If no entitlement  
has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will 
lapse. Vesting of awards may, at the discretion of the Committee, be deferred 
in whole or in part for a period of up to two years following the end of a 
three-year vesting period. The Company’s current policy is for awards to vest 
two-thirds after three years with the remaining one-third deferred for an 
additional year.
As under the Performance Related Annual Bonus, the Committee has 
discretion to adjust the formulaic LTIP outcomes to ensure alignment of pay 
with performance, i.e. to ensure the outcome is a true reflection of the 
performance of the Company.
Details of the targets to be used in future LTIP grants are included in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.

vesting for that element, rising on a straight line to full vesting.
Awards made under the LTIP will have a performance period of at least 
three years and a minimum vesting period of three years. If no entitlement  
has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will 
lapse. Vesting of awards may, at the discretion of the Committee, be deferred 
in whole or in part for a period of up to two years following the end of a 
three-year vesting period. The Company’s current policy is for awards to vest 
two-thirds after three years with the remaining one-third deferred for an 
additional year.
As under the Performance Related Annual Bonus, the Committee has 
discretion to adjust the formulaic LTIP outcomes to ensure alignment of pay 
with performance, i.e. to ensure the outcome is a true reflection of the 
performance of the Company.
Details of the targets to be used in future LTIP grants are included in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Notes to the policy table
The Committee is satisfied that the above Remuneration Policy is in  
the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive 
risk-taking. 
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
The measures used under the annual bonus plan are selected annually 
to reflect the Group’s main objectives for the year and reflect both 
financial and non-financial priorities. Following a review, and consistent 
with changes made to performance measures under the LTIP, the 
Committee determined that the adjusted earnings measure under the 
annual bonus would be replaced with EPS from 2014 onwards.
The Committee considers the combination of measures in the LTIP  
to be appropriate. As disclosed in our Annual Report last year, the 
Committee reviewed the performance measures during 2013 to ensure 
they are fully aligned with our strategy and with shareholders’ interests. 
Following the review, the Committee concluded that an adjusted EPS 
measure would be more closely aligned with the Group’s strategic plans 
and with the profit attributable to shareholders. Similarly, the Committee 
resolved that a Total Return measure would improve alignment between 
Executives’ and shareholders’ interests. Consequently, for LTIP awards 
made from 201 4, the NPC and NAV growth measures will be replaced 
by measures of adjusted EPS and Total Return respectively. Relative 
TSR is considered to remain the best measure to capture creation of 
shareholder value and rewards management for outperformance of  
the Company’s peers.
Targets applying to the bonus and LTIP are reviewed annually, based 
on a number of internal and external reference points. Performance 
targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the 
particular strategic priorities and economic environment in a given 
year. Under the annual bonus, target performance typically requires 
meaningful improvement on the previous year’s outturn, and for 
financial measures, targets are typically in line with the upper end 
of market consensus.
Remuneration policy for other employees
UNITE’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across 
the Group, with consideration given to the level of experience, 
responsibility, individual performance and salary levels in  
comparable companies.
All employees are eligible to participate in an annual bonus  
scheme with similar metrics to those used for the Executive  
Directors. Opportunities and specific performance conditions  
vary by organisational level with business area-specific metrics 
incorporated where appropriate.
Senior managers (c.25 individuals) are eligible to participate in the 
LTIP. Performance conditions are consistent for all participants, while 
award sizes vary by organisational level. Specific cash incentives are 
also in place to motivate, reward and retain staff below Board level. 
All employees are eligible to participate in the Company’s SAYE 
scheme on the same terms.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee continues to recognise the importance of Executive 
Directors aligning their interests with shareholders through building up 
a significant shareholding in the Company. Shareholding guidelines 
are in place that require Executive Directors to acquire a holding 
(excluding shares held conditionally pursuant to LTIP awards) 
equivalent to 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 150% 
of base salary for each of the other Executive Directors. Until the 
relevant shareholding levels are acquired, 50% of the annual bonus 
payable to the relevant Director is satisfied by an allocation of shares 
in the Company, which are held in its Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (ESOT). Subject to the Directors’ continued employment within 
the Group, such shares are transferred to the Director on the third 
anniversary of the original allocation. Details of the Executive 
Directors’ current personal shareholdings are provided in the  
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Non-Executive Director remuneration
Subject to annual re-election by shareholders, Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial term of approximately three  
years. Subsequent terms of three years may be awarded. Current 
appointments will expire at the annual general meeting in 2014 in the 
cases of Richard Walker and Sir Tim Wilson; at the annual general 
meeting in 2015 in the cases of Phil White and Manjit Wolstenholme; 
and at the annual general meeting in 2016 in the case of Andrew 
Jones and 2017 in the case of Elizabeth McMeikan. The appointment 
and re-appointment and the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors 
are matters reserved for the full Board.
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the 
Company’s performance related bonus plan, long-term incentive  
plans or pension arrangements.

Performance 
metrics
Fees
To attract and 
retain Non-
Executive 
Directors of the 
highest calibre 
with broad 
commercial and 
other experience 
relevant to the 
Company.
Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any 
adjustments effective 1 January in the year  
following review.
The fees paid to the Chairman are determined by  
the Committee, whilst the fees of the Non-Executive 
Directors are determined by the Board.
Additional fees are payable for acting as Senior 
Independent Director and as Chairman of any of  
the Board’s Committees (Audit, Remuneration, 
Nomination and Health and Safety). 
Fee levels are benchmarked against sector 
comparators and FTSE-listed companies of  
similar size and complexity. Time commitment  
and responsibility are taken into account when 
reviewing fee levels.
Non-Executive Director fee increases are applied 
in line with the outcome of the annual fee review. 
Fees for the year commencing 1 January 2014 
are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Fee levels will be next reviewed during 2014, with 
any increase effective 1 January 2015. 
It is expected that increases to Non-Executive 
Director fee levels will be in line with salaried 
employees over the life of the policy. However, in 
the event that there is a material misalignment 
with the market or a change in the complexity, 
responsibility or time commitment required to fulfil 
a Non-Executive Director role, the Board has 
discretion to make an appropriate adjustment to 
the fee level.

Pay for performance scenarios
The charts below provide an illustration of the potential future  
reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential 
split between the different elements of remuneration under three 
different performance scenarios: ‘minimum’, ‘on-target’ and ‘maximum’.
Potential reward opportunities are based on UNITE’s Remuneration 
Policy, applied to 2014 base salaries. The annual bonus and LTIP are 
based on the level of maximum opportunities applied in FY2013. Note 
that the LTIP awards granted in a year do not normally vest until the 
third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value is based 
on the face value at award rather than vesting (i.e. the scenarios 
exclude the impact of any share price movement over the period).

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Approach to recruitment remuneration
External appointment
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all the 
existing components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach 
Maximum annual 
grant value 
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, 
experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current basic salary. Where new 
appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased 
increases over a period of two to three years subject to the individual’s development in the role.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement in line with 
existing policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include (but are not limited to) the 
provision of a company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance and any necessary relocation 
expenses. New appointees will also be eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes. 
SAYE
Performance 
Related Annual 
Bonus
The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum 
being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year. Targets for the individual 
element will be tailored to each Executive.
144% of salary
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other Executives, as 
described in the policy table. The normal aggregate limit of 150% of salary will apply, save in 
exceptional circumstances where up to 200% of salary may be awarded.
200% of salary
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee 
will take into consideration all relevant factors (including quantum, 
nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate 
was recruited) to ensure arrangements are in the best interests of both 
UNITE and its shareholders. The Committee may make an award in 
respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer on a like-for-like basis, which 
may be awarded in addition to the remuneration structure outlined in 
the table above. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant 
factors including time to vesting, any performance conditions attached 
to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met. Any 
such ‘buy-out’ awards will typically be made under the existing annual 
bonus and LTIP schemes, although in exceptional circumstances the 
Committee may exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 
9.4.2 R to make awards using a different structure. Any ‘buy-out’ 
awards would have a fair value no higher than the awards forfeited.
Internal promotion
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal 
promotion, the Remuneration Committee and Board will be consistent 
with the policy for external appointees detailed above. Where an 
individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion 
to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these 
arrangements. The Remuneration Policy for other employees is set out 
on page 72. Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are 
typically no higher than Executive Directors, but measures may vary  
to provide better line-of-sight.
Non-Executive Directors
In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Remuneration 
Committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table on page 73. A 
base fee in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for 
Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior 
Independent Director or as Chairman of the Board’s Committees.

1420-1 UNITE AR_2.Gov_v6.indd   74 02/04/2014   18:00 Service contracts and treatment for leavers  
and change of control
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early 
termination, are carefully considered by the Committee. In accordance 
with general market practice, each of the Executive Directors has a 
rolling service contract requiring 12 months’ notice of termination  
on either side. Such contracts contain no specific provision for 
compensation for loss of office, other than an obligation to pay for any 
notice period waived by the Company, where pay is defined as salary 
plus benefits only. Executive Director service contracts are available  
to view at the Company’s registered office.
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential 
incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders  
and participants. The table below summarises how the awards  
under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific 
circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the 
Committee’s discretion:
Executive Date of service contract
M C Allan 31 October 1999
J J Lister 28 March 2002
R C Simpson 28 September 201 1
R S Smith 28 September 201 1
External appointments 
With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the 
overriding requirements of the Group, Executive Directors may  
accept external appointments as Non-Executive Directors of other 
companies and retain any fees received. None of the Executive 
Directors currently hold such an appointment. Details of any external 
directorships held by Executive Directors, including associated fees, 
will be provided in future reports where applicable.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere  
in the Company
When making decisions on Executive Director remuneration, the 
Committee considers pay and conditions across UNITE. Prior to  
the annual salary review, the Operations HR Director provides the 
Committee with a summary of the proposed level of increase for 
overall employee pay. The Remuneration Committee does not formally 
consult with employees on the executive Remuneration Policy  
and framework.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Remuneration Committee maintains a regular dialogue with  
its major shareholders. Following feedback from shareholders,  
and as disclosed in last year’s Remuneration Report, the Committee 
has replaced NPC with adjusted EPS in the LTIP for awards going 
forward. The Committee will continue to monitor trends and 
developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure 
the structure of the executive remuneration remains appropriate.

In the event of a change of control, UNITE awards may alternatively be exchanged for new equivalent awards in the 
acquirer where appropriate.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Annual Report on Remuneration
The following section provides details of how UNITE’s Remuneration 
Policy was implemented during the financial year ending 31 
December 2013.
Remuneration Committee membership in 2013
The primary role of the Committee is to:
• Review, recommend and monitor the level and structure  
of remuneration for the Executive Directors and other  
senior Executives
• Approve the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors
• Determine the balance between base pay and performance related 
elements of the package so as to align Directors’ interests to those 
of shareholders.
The Committee’s terms of reference are set out on the Company’s 
website. As of 31 December 2013, the Remuneration Committee 
comprised five independent Non-Executive Directors: 
• Richard Walker (Committee Chairman)
• Phil White
• Sir Tim Wilson
• Manjit Wolstenholme
• Andrew Jones.
In addition, certain Executives, including Mark Allan (Chief Executive), 
are, from time to time, invited to attend meetings of the Committee. 
Nicola Yates (former Group HR Director) also attended three 
meetings during the year prior to her departure from the Company 
during 2013. No individuals are involved in decisions relating to their 
own remuneration. The Remuneration Committee met five times 
during the year and details of members’ attendance at meetings  
are provided in the corporate governance section on page 57. 
Key activities of the Remuneration Committee in 2013 were  
as follows:
• Review of executive remuneration and Department for Business, 
Innovation and Skills proposals on executive pay 
• Considered remuneration market trends and corporate governance 
developments 
• Conducted a benchmarking exercise on Executive Directors’ 
salaries and other benefits
• Consulted with major shareholders on executive remuneration
• Reviewed and approved the Executive Directors’ performance 
against 2013 annual objectives and determined the bonuses 
payable
• Approved Share Awards for 2013
• Reviewed and approved salary increases for the Executive 
Directors and senior management for 2014
• Determined the Executive Directors bonus and LTIP performance 
targets for 2014 in line with the Company’s strategic plan
• Reviewed and approved the Chairman’s fee
• Reviewed the revised remuneration reporting regulations and 
prepared the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Advisors
Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’) was originally appointed by the 
Committee in 2010 as its executive remuneration advisor and was 
retained during the most recent financial year. The Committee 
undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure Kepler remains 
independent and that the advice provided is impartial and objective. 
Kepler is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct 
for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at  
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. In 2013 Kepler provided 
independent advice on Remuneration Policy and the external 
remuneration environment; salary benchmarking data; and 
performance testing for long-term incentive plans. Kepler reports 
directly to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and does 
not advise the Company on any other issues. Their total fees for the 
provision of remuneration services in 2013 were £69,865 on the 
basis of time and materials.

  Taxable benefits consist primarily of a company car or car allowance and private healthcare insurance. Mark Allan is provided with a company car of £30,293 in value. Joe Lister, 
Richard Simpson and Richard Smith are entitled to company car allowances of £14,000, £13,000 and £13,000 respectively. 
2
  During the year, three of the Directors (Joe Lister, Richard Simpson and Richard Smith) participated in the UNITE Group Personal Pension Scheme, which is a money purchase 
scheme, in relation to whom the Company contributed around 20% of salary. The Company also paid Mark Allan a cash pension allowance of £72,303 (2012: £70,533).

  Payment for performance during the year. For 2012 and 2013, Mark Allan and Joe Lister, having already reached their share ownership guidelines, received 100% of their bonus 
awards in cash. Richard Simpson and Richard Smith received 50% of their 2012 and 2013 bonus awards by way of a deferred allocation of shares through the Company’s ESOT. 
See following sections for further details.

   LTIP awards granted prior to 201 1 were partially based on a TSR performance measure which ran for three years from the grant date (typically April to April). In order to allow 
better comparability going forward, the figure for 2012 represents the value of the 2010 award which was substantially, but not fully, completed by the end of the 2012 financial 
year. 2010 awards are valued using the market price at the date of vesting (12 April 2013) of 324.2p. For the 201 1 awards, the market price on the date of vesting is currently 
unknown; the value is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2013 of 397.2p. See following sections for further details.

 ‘Other’ includes the embedded value of SAYE options at grant and cash payments in lieu of dividends for vested 201 1 LTIP awards.

Annual Report on Remuneration continued
Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2013 (audited)
Performance Related Annual Bonus in respect of 2013 performance
The 2013 annual bonus consists of two elements, corporate and individual. The corporate element of the bonus is calculated on a sliding scale 
up to a maximum of 120% of base salary, in accordance with which ‘on-target’ performance by the Group results in a corporate bonus of an 
amount equivalent to 70% of base salary. To determine the actual bonus payment to an Executive Director, a multiplier (being the ‘individual’ 
element of the scheme) ranging between zero and 1.2 is applied against the corporate bonus. 
Applying the maximum individual multiplier (of 1.2) against the maximum corporate bonus (of 120% of base salary), results in a maximum 
annual performance related bonus opportunity of 144% of base salary. However, bonus payments at that level would only be made subject to 
the achievement of extremely stretching corporate performance targets and exceptional individual performance by the relevant Director. Target 
performance typically requires meaningful improvement on the previous year’s outturn, and for financial measures, targets are typically in line 
with the upper end of market consensus.
The performance related bonuses awarded in respect of 2013 reflect corporate bonuses of 100.9% of base salary. After applying individual 
multipliers, actual performance related bonus payments awarded to the Executive Directors were 121% of their respective base salaries (and 
around 84% of their maximum bonus opportunities). Further details, including the targets set and performance against each of the metrics,  
are provided the tables below:

During the year, UNITE raised £50 million through a successful 
placing of new shares. Following the placing, the Remuneration 
Committee evaluated the potential impact on the outcomes of the 
Performance Related Annual Bonus and LTIP in respect of 2013 
performance. The Committee concluded that the placing would, in  
the short term, lead to:
• A dilution of NAV per share due to the placing price being below 
NAV and the lag factor before proceed deployment 
• An increase in NPC of £1 million as a result of using the cash to 
repay debt and save interest costs 
• A corresponding improvement in operating cash flow, and 
• A reduction in see-through LTV as a result of the lower level of  
net debt.
The impact of the placing on the Performance Related Annual Bonus 
and LTIP outcomes in respect of 2013 performance was estimated to 
contribute a small increase in total remuneration (in the order of 3% to 
5% of salary for Executive Directors). Following careful consideration, 
the Committee determined that no changes would be made to the 
corporate element of Performance Related Annual Bonus as the 
impact would be felt by a broader participant population than the 
Executive Directors. However, amongst other factors, the Committee 
also considered the impact of the placing when adjudicating the 
personal performance multiplier for Executive Directors. The 
Committee is satisfied that the overall bonus outcomes detailed above 
are a fair reflection of each individual’s performance during the year.
2010 LTIP vesting (vested on performance to 12 April 2013)
Long-term incentive awards in 2010 were made under the 2005  
LTIP. For Mark Allan and Joe Lister, vesting of awards was dependent 
on two equally-weighted measures over a three-year performance 
period; actual net asset value (NAV) and TSR relative to the 
constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate (Super Sector) Index. For 
Richard Simpson, who was not an Executive Director at the time the 
awards were granted, an additional performance measure – net 
portfolio contribution (NPC) in 2012 – applied to one-third of the 
awards, with NAV and relative TSR also accounting for one-third of the 
award each. There were no retest provisions under any of the awards. 
Further details, including vesting schedules and performance against 
each of the metrics is provided the table below:

TSR element ran for three years from the date of grant, ending on 12 April 2013. To allow for comparability going forward, the Committee has 
elected to capture the vesting of the 2010 LTIP in the financial year ending 31 December 2012 for the purposes of the single total figure of 
remuneration, as follows:

Each of the LTIP awards shown above was granted on 13 April 2010. The market price of the shares on that date was 243 pence. The 
aggregate gain made on these exercises was £27 4,675 of which £122,094 related to the gain of the highest paid Director. The market  
price of the shares at 31 December 2012 was 276.3 pence and the range during the year was 164 pence to 287.4 pence. 
As mentioned above, the Company’s placing during the year had a small positive impact on incentive outcomes for 2013. Following careful 
consideration, the Committee decided that in the interests of simplicity and transparency, no adjustment should be made to the 2010 LTIP 
formulaic outcome as it is a fair reflection of the Company’s performance over the three-year performance period.
2011 LTIP vesting (vested on performance to 31 December 2013)
Awards in 201 1 were made under the New LTIP, consisting of the UNITE Group plc 201 1 Performance Share Plan and the UNITE Group plc 
201 1 Approved Employee Share Option Scheme. Vesting of the awards was dependent on three equally-weighted measures over a three-year 
performance period; NAV per share growth, net portfolio contribution (NPC) and TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350 Real Estate 
Supersector Index. There was no retest provision. Further details, including vesting schedules and performance against each of the metrics

vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, with the remaining one-third vesting after an additional holding period of one year. Richard 
Simpson and Richard Smith were granted awards under the 201 1 LTIP prior to their respective Board appointments and consequently all 
interests will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant in October 2014.

interests vesting (i.e. excluding the one-year holding period). As the market price on the date of vesting is unknown at the time of reporting, the 
value is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2013 of 397.2p. The actual value at vesting will be trued-up in the 
2014 Annual Report on Remuneration. Executives also became entitled to cash in lieu of the dividends payable on vested LTIP shares over the 
three-year performance period. These payments are included in the row entitled ‘Other’ in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 
77, and amounted to £24,167, £14,144, £6,071 and £6,513 for Mr Allan, Mr Lister, Mr Simpson and Mr Smith respectively.
Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration 
from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in 
remuneration for all employees.
The CEO’s remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefit and 
annual bonus. The pay for all other employees is calculated using the 
increase in the earnings of full-time employees for tax years 2012 and 
2013. The analysis excludes part-time employees and is based on a 
consistent set of employees, i.e. the same individuals appear in the 
2012 and 2013 populations. The decrease in taxable benefits for all 
employees primarily reflects a reduction in company car benefits  
(as more employees take up car allowances which are classified 
differently in place of company cars) and the shift to a more CO
2
 
efficient fleet.

The following graph charts the TSR of the Company and the FTSE 
350 Real Estate ‘Super Sector’ Index over the five year period from  
1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. Whilst there is no comparator 
index or group of companies that truly reflects the activities of the 
Group, the FTSE 350 Real Estate Supersector Index (the constituent 
members of which are all property holding and/or development 
companies or real estate investment trusts within the UK), was 
chosen as it reflects trends within the UK property market generally 
and tends to be the index against which analysts judge the 
performance of the Company. The table below details the Chief 
Executive’s ‘single figure’ remuneration over the same period.

1420-1 UNITE AR_2.Gov_v6.indd   82 02/04/2014   18:00 As in 2012, vesting of the LTIP awards is dependent on three equally-weighted measures over a three-year performance period; NAV per  
share growth, net portfolio contribution and TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Supersector Index. There is no retest provision.  
The performance range for NAV was reduced from 7- 13% to 6- 12% for the 2013 cycle as a result of lower development activity and a higher 
dividend pay-out ratio. The Committee considers that the targets applying under each of the performance measures are no less stretching than 
in previous years. Details of the vesting schedules are provided below:

Base salary
Market positioning of base salary is approached on an individual basis, taking account of advice received from the Committee’s independent 
advisors on the rates of salary for similar roles in selected groups of comparable companies and the individual performance and experience of 
each Executive. The aim is for base salary to be set with reference to the market median, dependent on the Committee’s view of individual and 
Group performance.
The Committee approved the following base salary increases with effect from 1 March 2014:
Executive Director
Base salary from 1 March 2013 to  
28 February 2014
Base salary from 1 March 2014 to

Executive Directors will continue to receive a pension contribution of 20% of salary or an equivalent cash allowance.
Performance Related Annual Bonus
The Performance Related Annual Bonus for the 2014 financial year will operate on the same basis as in 2013. The Committee has approved a 
maximum bonus opportunity for each Executive of 144% of salary, consisting of a maximum of 120% of salary under the ‘corporate’ element 
and a maximum individual multiplier of 1.2x.
For 2014, the ‘corporate’ element of the annual bonus will continue to be based on a combination of financial and non-financial measures, 
weighted 75% and 25% respectively. Proposed target levels have been set to be challenging relative to the 2014 business plan, although 
specific targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive at this time. It is the Committee’s current intention to disclose these targets 
retrospectively in the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees
In November 2013 the Board undertook its biennial review of Non-Executive Director fees. Following consideration of actual and proposed 
salary increases across the Group, the increase in time commitment resulting from the growth of the Company and indicative fee increases 
at sector and FTSE comparators, the Board determined that the basic fee should be increased from £41,000 p.a. to £43,000 p.a. and that 
additional fees should be increased by a similar rate. In the case of the Remuneration Committee Chair, it was determined that the time 
commitment and responsibilities warranted a fee increase to bring such fee in line with the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Committee, in 
considering similar factors, determined that the fee payable to the Chairman of the Board should be increased from £1 18,000 p.a. to £124,000 
p.a. A summary of the fee increases, which are effective 1 January 2014, is set out in the table below. Fee levels will be subject to annual 
review going forward.

In October 2013, UNITE Jersey Issuer Limited issued £90 million  
of convertible bonds guaranteed by the Company to contribute to the 
funding of the Group’s development pipeline. The convertible bonds 
have a coupon of 2.5% per annum and are convertible at the option  
of the holder at any time (subject to certain conditions) into fully paid 
ordinary shares of the Company. The initial conversion price has been 
set at 509.73 pence per ordinary share resulting in a requirement to 
issue up to 17,656,406 ordinary shares.
On the date of this report, the Company announced a Firm Placing 
and Placing and Open Offer of 24,500,000 ordinary shares of 25 
pence. This Firm Placing and Placing and Open Offer is anticipated  
to close on 24 March 2014 after which the enlarged share capital  
of the Company will be 201,158,479. 
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, as well as the 
powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out in the Company’s 
articles of association.
There are no restrictions on the transfer or voting rights of ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company (other than those which may  
be imposed by law from time to time or as set out in the Company’s 
articles of association).
In accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules,  
certain employees are required to seek approval to deal in the 
Company’s shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the transfers of securities and/or 
voting rights. No person holds securities in the Company carrying 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. Unless expressly 
specified to the contrary, the Company’s articles of association may 
be amended by special resolution of the shareholders.
Change of control
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a 
change of control. Outstanding rewards and options would normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions. Other than certain of the 
Group’s banking facilities, there are no other significant agreements  
to which the Company is a party that affect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. Nor are 
there any agreements between the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Following a change of control of the Company, the convertible bonds 
issued by UNITE Jersey Issuer Limited and referred to above (Share 
capital) become redeemable and/or convertible into ordinary shares 
of the Company (at the option of the holder).
The Directors have no authority to buy back the Company’s shares.
Details of proposals to be put to the annual general meeting in relation 
to the power of Directors to issue shares in the Company are set out 
under the heading ‘annual general meeting’.

Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of the Directors’ 
report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a 
Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting of the Company will be held at The Core, 40 
St Thomas Street, Bristol BS1 6JX at 9.30am on 15 May 201 4. Formal 
notice of the meeting is given on pages 135 to 138.
Resolution 1 4 proposes that KPMG LLP be appointed as the Company’s 
auditor, following a decision to wind down the Company’s current auditor, 
KPMG Audit Plc, as part of a KPMG internal reorganisation. Pursuant to 
section 5 19 of the Companies Act 2006, KPMG Audit Plc has informed 
the Company that it is not seeking reappointment and has provided a 
statutory statement of circumstances upon ceasing to hold office. In 
accordance with section 520 of the Companies Act 2006, a copy of  
this statement is set out below:
Dear Sirs
Statement to The UNITE Group plc (no. 03199160) on 
ceasing to hold office as auditors pursuant to section 
519 of the Companies Act 2006 
The circumstances connected with our ceasing to hold office are that 
our company, KPMG Audit Plc, has instigated an orderly wind down of 
business. KPMG LLP , an intermediate parent, will immediately be 
seeking appointment as statutory auditor. 
We request that any correspondence in relation to this statement be sent 
to our registered office, 15 Canada Square, London, E1 4 5GL, marked 
for the attention of the Audit Regulation Department. 
Y ours faithfully
KPMG Audit Plc
The Company understands this change is administrative in nature and 
will not have any impact on audit processes or timelines. The Company 
further understands that KPMG LLP and KPMG Audit Plc are both 
assured entities under the KPMG group insurance arrangements and 
the proposed change from KPMG Audit Plc to KPMG LLP will have no 
effect on any limit within the insurance cover available. Consequently, the 
Company believes that the proposed change does not adversely affect 
the interests of shareholders.
In addition to the other ordinary business of the meeting, Resolution  
16 will be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution to grant the Directors 
authority to allot shares in the Company, and grant rights to subscribe  
for or to convert any security into shares of the Company, up to an 
aggregate of nominal value of £16,763,206.58 (representing 
approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the Company  
as at 31 March 201 4). In accordance with guidelines issued by the 
Association of British Insurers, this resolution also grants the Directors 
authority to allot further equity securities up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £16,763,206.58, again representing approximately one  
third of the nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of  
the Company as at 31 March 201 4. This additional authority may  
only be applied to fully pre-emptive rights issues..
Resolution 1 7 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to authorise  
the Directors to allot equity securities for cash other than in accordance 
with statutory pre-emption rights (which require a company to offer all 
allotments for cash first to existing shareholders in proportion to their 
holdings), in respect of the allotment of shares in connection with  
any rights issue or other issue by way of rights and otherwise up to  
an aggregate nominal amount of £2,5 1 4,480.99 (representing 
approximately five per cent of the issued share capital of the  
Company as at 31 March 201 4).
The Board has no current intention of exercising either of the authorities 
conferred by the above resolutions. Unless revoked, varied or extended, 
those authorities will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general 
meeting of the Company or the date following 15 months from the 
passing of the resolutions, whichever is the earlier.
The Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 (the 
Shareholders’ Rights Regulations), increased the notice period for 
general meetings of the Company to 21 days unless shareholders 
approve a shorter notice period, which cannot be less than 1 4 clear  
days. At the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2013, 
shareholders authorised the calling of general meetings, other than 
an annual general meeting, on not less than 1 4 clear days’ notice. 
Resolution 18 seeks the approval of shareholders to renew the authority 
to be able to call general meetings (other than an annual general 
meeting) on 1 4 clear days’ notice. The flexibility offered by Resolution 18 
will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, the Directors 
consider this appropriate in relation to the business of the meeting and  
in the interests of the Company and shareholders as a whole. The 
Company undertakes to meet the requirements for electronic voting 
under the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations before calling a general 
meeting on 1 4 clear days’ notice. If given, the approval will be effective 
until the Company’s next annual general meeting, when it is intended 
that a similar resolution will be proposed.

1420-1 UNITE AR_2.Gov_v6.indd   89 02/04/2014   18:00 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect  
of the annual report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on 
the same basis.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their 
profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, and
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure its 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and corporate governance statement that comply with that law 
and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, the name of whom are set out on pages 52 and 
53, confirms that to the best of his or her knowledge:
• The Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy 
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
• The Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development  
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of The UNITE Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance 
Sheets, the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, the Consolidated and Company Statements  
of Cash Flows and the related notes. In our opinion:  
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended  
  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU)  
  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, and  
  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit were as follows.  
Valuation of investment properties and investment properties under development (£863.1 million) 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report and note 3.1for the accounting policy and financial disclosures.  
  The risk – Investment properties and investment properties under development are held at fair value in the Group’s 
financial statements, and at every period end the change in fair value is reflected in the income statement of the Group. 
The valuation models applied are complex and require consideration of the existing market conditions, estimates regarding 
rental income, occupancy and property management costs. Valuing investment properties under development can be 
further complicated by the need to forecast discounted cash flows with a deduction for costs to complete (which are likely 
to require significant judgement).  
  Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the competency of the external 
experts engaged by the Group to value the investment and development properties, in the context of their ability to 
generate a reliable estimate of the fair value. The assessment of the external experts included but was not limited to, 
assessing their professional qualifications, experience and independence from the Group. We met with all the external 
valuation experts to discuss their valuation methodology. We used our own valuation specialists to assist us in critically 
assessing the valuation methodology applied, and considered whether it is in line with accounting requirements and  
best practice. We challenged all key assumptions, including rental income, occupancy and property operating costs. 
Specifically, we performed our own assessment of these inputs and compared rental income to current tenancy contracts 
on a sample basis, occupancy to sales reports and property operating costs for a sample of properties through to actual 
costs for the year.  
In addition, for investment properties under development, we compared the costs to complete used in the valuations to internal 
budgets and business plans and considered the historical accuracy of such budgets and business plans.  
We assessed whether the Group’s disclosures (see note 3.1) in respect of the inputs into the valuations properly reflected the 
assumptions used and met the requirements of the relevant accounting standards. 
Deferred tax assets (£22.4 million) 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report and note 2.6 for the accounting policy and financial disclosures. 
  The risk – The Group has recognised deferred tax assets of £22.4 million in respect of tax losses considered to be 
recoverable against deferred tax liabilities and future taxable profits. In addition a deferred tax asset of £9.6 million has not 
been recognised due to the uncertainty of future taxable profits and the ability to offset losses against them. The estimate 
of future taxable profits requires judgement and interpretation of tax laws as well as estimating future profits. The 
recoverability of assets recognised could vary significantly if different assumptions are applied in estimating future taxable 
profits and the ability to utilise the tax losses. The risk is that the amount recognised on the balance sheet may be over- or 
under-estimated and any adjustment would directly affect the profit and the effective tax rate for the period. 
  Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, among others, testing the principles and integrity of the model 
used to forecast taxable profits, comparison of the key input assumptions (such as rental income, property operating costs, 
administration costs, capital expenditure) to business plans and considered the historical accuracy of such business plans. 
We used our own tax specialists to consider the appropriateness of the application of tax laws, the appropriateness of tax 
deductions and the ability to offset projected tax profits against the brought forward losses. We also considered whether 
the Group’s disclosures (see note 2.6) met the requirements of the relevant accounting standards.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £5 million. This has been determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group total assets (of which it represents 0.5%) which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for members 
of the Company in assessing the financial performance of the Group.  
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a 
value in excess of £0.25 million, in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
The Group consists of a number of components, all of which are accounted for at the Group’s head office in Bristol. The Group audit 
team performed the audit of the all these components at the Group level as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information.  
The audit was performed using the materiality level set out above.  
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:  
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006  
  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception  
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a 
material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.  
In particular, we are required to report to you if:  
  we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, or 
  the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us, or  
  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in

practice recommendations. 
We have grouped the notes to the financial statements under five main headings: 
• Results for the year, including segmental information, adjusted profits and adjusted NAV 
• Asset management 
• Funding

Notes to the financial statements 
100 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Section 1: Basis of preparation 
The financial statements consolidate those of The UNITE Group plc, (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
Group) and include the Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities. The parent company financial statements present information  
about the Company as a separate entity and not as a Group.  
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRS). On publishing the parent company 
financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of 
the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes. 
The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated  
financial statements.  
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 24 to 49. In addition, section 4 of these notes to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies  
and processes for managing its capital; details of its borrowings and interest rate swaps; and in note 5.3 its exposure to credit risk. 
The Group has prepared cash flow projections until the end of 2015. Following the significant level of financing activity that was 
completed during 2012 and 2013, the Group has significant levels of cash headroom. The Group has two facilities maturing in the 
second half of 2015 and plans to initiate discussions with banks about their renewal around twelve months before the maturity dates. 
The Group has historically maintained positive relationships with its lending banks and has always secured new facilities before maturity 
dates and remained within its covenant levels. The Group is in full compliance with its covenants at 31 December 2013 as set out on 
page 39. In order to manage future financial commitments, the Group operates a formal approval process, through its Major Investment 
Approvals Committee, to ensure appropriate review is undertaken before any land is acquired or build contracts are agreed. 
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  
The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Measurement convention 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, investment property under 
development, investments in subsidiaries, interest rate swaps and land and buildings included in property, plant and equipment all of 
which are stated at their fair value. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly,  
to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential 
voting rights that are presently exercisable are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-Group transactions, such as property 
disposals and management fees are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from 
transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s retained interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are 
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value  
of current assets or an impairment in value of fixed assets. 
Impact of accounting standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective 
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. Their adoption is 
not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated: 
  IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011), IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, 
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities are all 
mandatory for years commencing on or after 1 January 2014. These are part of a new suite of standards on consolidation 
and related standards, replacing the existing accounting for subsidiaries and joint ventures (now joint arrangements), and 
making limited amendments in relation to associates. 
  Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32 is mandatory for years commencing on or 
after 1 January 2014 and clarifies the offsetting criteria for assets and liabilities.  
  Continuing hedge accounting after derivative novations – Amendments to IAS 39 is effective for years commencing on or 
after 1 January 2014 and allows an entity not to discontinue hedge accounting where there has been a swap novation. 
 
This section lays out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting 
policy is specific to a particular note to the financial statements, the policy is described in the note to which it relates and has 
been clearly identified in a box.   Strategic report

Section 1: Basis of preparation continued 
Accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies.  
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.  
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets  
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised 
and in any future periods affected. 
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement of complexity are set out below and are explained in more detail in the related notes to 
the financial statements. 
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and 
in more detail in the related notes: 
  Valuation of investment property, investment property under development, completed property and properties under 
development (note 3.1) 
  Taxation (note 2.6) 
  Valuation of interest rate swaps (note 4.2). 
The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which are as follows: 
  Classification of joint venture vehicles (note 3.4).

2.1 Segmental information 
The Board of Directors monitor the business along two activity lines. The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2013 
and 31 December 2012 are Operations and Property.  
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties. The joint ventures  
are an integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.  
The Group’s properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom. The Board therefore does not consider that the Group has 
meaningful geographical segments.  
a) Operations 
The Operations business manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures. Its revenues are derived from 
rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures. NPC is the key indicator which is used by the Board to manage 
the Operations business. The segmental result is outlined below. 
2013 
Included in the UNITE total above is rental income of £19.7 million and property operating expenses of £6.4 million relating to sale and 
leaseback properties. 
* Operating lease rentals arise from properties which the Group has sold and is now leasing back. As these properties contribute to the Group’s rental 
income, the Group consider these lease costs to be a form of financing. 
  
 
This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group. On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining 
the Group’s results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and adjusted net asset value (NAV) per share.  
Net portfolio contribution (NPC) and NAV movement are the Group’s main key performance indicators. This reflects the way  
the business is managed and how the directors assess the performance of the Group. The Group’s adjusted earnings and  
net asset value are also aligned with the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) best practice recommendations.

2012 
Included in the UNITE total above is rental income of £18.5 million and property operating expenses of £5.5 million relating to sale and  
leaseback properties. 
* Operating lease rentals arise from properties which the Group has sold and is now leasing back. As these properties contribute to the Group’s rental 
income, the Group consider these lease costs to be a form of financing. 
b) Property 
The Group’s Property business undertakes the acquisition and development of properties. This included the manufacture and sale  
of modular building components in the first half of 2012 prior to the business closure, through UNITE Modular Solutions Limited, ‘UMS’. 
The Property segment’s revenue comprises revenue from development management fees earned from joint ventures; and the sale of 
modules to third parties and joint ventures, as set out in note 2.4. The Property segmental result is set out below.

2.2 Adjusted profit and EPS  
In addition to the IFRS reporting measures, the Group reports adjusted profit on the basis recommended for real estate companies by 
EPRA, the European Public Real Estate Association. 
a) EPRA earnings and reconciliation to IFRS 
EPRA earnings exclude movements relating to changes in values of investment properties and interest rate swaps, which are included in 
the profit reported under IFRS. In addition a further adjusted profit is shown below to demonstrate the non-recurring impact of the UCC 
promote fee recognised in 2013. The adjusted profit reconciles to the profit reported under IFRS as follows: 
* Within IFRS reported profit, there is a £0.7 million profit (2012: £7.6 million loss) relating to movements in the mark to market of ineffective interest 
rate swaps, this full loss can be seen in note 4.3. Part of this movement, £4.4 million (2012: £9.0 million) relates to actual interest payments made on 
these swaps and is considered to be a true operating cost of the Operations segment. It is therefore already included within Net Financing Costs in 
NPC (Operating segment result) in note 2.1a.  
** The minority interest share, or non-controlling interest, arises as a result of the Company not owning 100% of the share capital of one of its 
subsidiaries, USAF (Feeder) Guernsey Ltd. More detail is provided in note 3.4. 
Unallocated to segments includes share of joint venture amounts received from Landsbanki of £2.3 million (2012: £2.9 million), current 
tax charges of £0.4 million (2012: £0.4 million), deferred tax credit of £0.6 million (2012: £nil), contributions to the UNITE Foundation of  
£0.5 million (2012: £0.2 million) and share option fair value charges of £1.1 million (2012: £1.5 million).

2.2 Adjusted profit and EPS continued 
b) Earnings per share 
EPS is the amount of post-tax profits attributable to each share. Basic EPS is adjusted in line with EPRA guidelines in order to more 
accurately show the business performance of the Group in a consistent manner and to reflect how the business is managed and 
measured on a day to day basis. EPRA EPS and adjusted EPS are calculated using EPRA earnings and adjusted profit as set out above. 
The calculations of basic and adjusted EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013 are as follows: 
Movements in the weighted average number of shares have resulted from the placing in June 2013 and the issue of shares arising from 
the employee share based payment schemes.  
The placing comprised 16,000,000 shares and gave rise to proceeds of £51.2 million, £49.9 million net of issue costs. 
Excluded from the potential dilutive shares (share options) are 3,697,000 options in existence at 31 December 2013 (2012: 3,176,000) 
which do not affect the diluted weighted average number of shares. 
2.3 Adjusted net assets and NAV per share  
EPRA NAV excludes the mark to market valuation of swaps, deferred tax liabilities and recognises all properties at market value. This is 
the key performance measure that the Board uses to monitor and manage the performance of the Property segment.

2.4. Revenue  
The Group earns revenue from the following activities: 
The revenue above excludes the Group’s share of revenue from joint ventures; this can be seen in note 2.1a. 
Revenue has decreased because of the reduction in planned sales of completed property mitigated by an increase in rental income and

Accounting policies 
Revenue is recognised on the following bases: 
Rental income 
Rental income from property leased out under operating leases (comprising direct lets to students and leases to Universities and 
commercial tenants) is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives are 
sometimes granted on commercial units; these are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the term  
of the lease. 
Property sales 
Income relating to the sale of trading properties is recognised once contracts for sale have been unconditionally exchanged. 
Manufacturing revenue 
Revenue from the sale of modules and related services is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards  
of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. For modules this is on receipt of customer acceptance following manufacture and  
for related services as the service is provided.  
Management and promote fees 
Management and promote fees are recognised, in line with the management contracts, in the period to which they relate as services  
are provided. The Group can earn promote fees relative to criteria specified in the joint venture agreements.

2.6 Tax 
The Group has not paid any corporation tax in the recent past due to the availability of capital allowances, indexation and brought 
forward losses. However it does pay UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries 
(predominantly the investments in USAF). 
a) Tax – income statement 
The total taxation charge/(credit) in the income statement is analysed as follows: 
In order to understand how, in the income statement, a tax credit of £2.2 million arises on a profit before tax of £77.1 million, the taxation 
charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 
b) Tax – other comprehensive income 
Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling £0.3 million (2012: £0.8 million) has been recognised representing deferred 
tax. An analysis of this is included below in the deferred tax movement table.  
  
Accounting policies 
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the 
accounting treatment of the related transaction. The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable  
in respect of previous years. The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end. 
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and those for taxation purposes. Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not 
provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities. The deferred tax provision in respect of property assets is calculated on the basis that assets will not be held 
indefinitely and therefore takes account of available indexation. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

c) Tax – balance sheet 
The table below outlines the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) that are recognised in the balance sheet, together with their movements  
in the year: 
2013 
2012 
A deferred tax asset of £9.6 million (2012: £20.0 million) in respect of losses of £47.9 million (2012: £86.9 million) has not been 
recognised. Complexities in the Group structure mean these losses may be inaccessible and the Group is considering converting to REIT 
status in the medium term. Accordingly, the recognised deferred tax asset has been restricted to those losses which are likely be utilised 
in the next three years. 
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% (effective 1 April 2013) was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012. Further 
reductions to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. This 
will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2013 has been calculated based 
on the rates of 20% and 21% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Company 
Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary timing differences of £51.6 million (2012: £44.1 million) in respect of revaluation  
of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is probable that the temporary timing difference will not reverse in the  
foreseeable future.

Section 3: Asset management 
3.1 Wholly owned property assets 
The Group’s wholly owned property portfolio is held in four groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below. In the 
Group’s adjusted NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.  
i) Investment property (fixed assets)  
These are assets that the Group intends to hold for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation. The assets are held at fair 
value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement. 
ii) Investment property under development (fixed assets) 
These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to ‘Investment property’ on completion. 
iii) Completed properties (current assets) 
These are assets acquired by the Group with the intention to hold the assets for a short period prior to disposal to a joint venture or third 
parties. The Group continues to earn rental income and capital appreciation on these assets which are held at cost in the balance sheet. 
iv) Properties under development (current assets)  
These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to ‘Completed properties’ on completion. 
The Group also acquires land which it intends to develop. Land is held within inventories until planning permission is obtained, at which 
point it is transferred to investment property under development or properties under development.  
 
Valuation process 
The valuation of the properties are performed twice a year on the basis of valuation reports prepared by external, independent valuers, 
having an appropriate recognised professional qualification. The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal 
and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle and Messrs 
Knight Frank, Chartered Surveyors were the valuers in the years ending 31 December 2013 and 2012. 
The reports are based on both: 
  Information provided by the Group such as current rents, occupancy, operating costs, terms and conditions of leases and 
nomination agreements, capital expenditure, etc. This information is derived from the Group’s financial systems and is 
subject to the Group’s overall control environment. 
  Assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers – the assumptions are typically market related, such as yields and 
discount rates. These are based on their professional judgement and market observation. 
The information provided to the valuers – and the assumptions and the valuation models used by the valuers – are reviewed by the 
Property Board and the CFO. This includes a review of fair value movements over the period. 
  
 
The Group holds its property portfolio directly and through its joint ventures. The performance of the property portfolio whether 
wholly owned or in joint ventures is the key factor that drives adjusted net asset value (NAV), one of the Group’s key 
performance indicators. The following pages provide disclosures about the Group’s investments in property assets and joint 
ventures and their performance over the year. 
 
Accounting policies 
Properties held under operating leases are not included in assets, but the future payments due in respect of these properties are 
disclosed in note 4.6a. 
Investment property and investment property under development are held at fair value. 
Completed properties, properties under development and inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling 
expenses. All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure  
is capitalised.  
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts. 
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset. Capitalisation  
of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are  
being incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops  
if development activities are suspended. If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment  
loss is recognised. The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development 
purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate. During the year 
the average capitalisation rate used was 6.3% (2012: 5.9%).  Financial statements

The movements in the carrying value of the Group’s wholly owned property portfolio during the year ended 31 December 2012 were  
as follows: 
2012 
The fair value of the Group’s wholly owned property portfolio at the year ended 31 December 2012 is as follows: 
During 2012 properties with a carrying value of £263.6 million and a fair value of £313.3 million were transferred from completed 
property to investment property. This resulted in the recognition of £49.7 million of previously unrecognised valuation gains. 
Included within investment properties are £30.8 million (2012: £29.7 million) of assets held under a long leasehold and £11.3 million 
(2012: £12.7 million) of assets held under short leasehold.  
Total interest capitalised in investment and development properties at 31 December 2013 was £37.9 million (2012: £32.1 million)  
on a cumulative basis. Total internal costs relating to manufacturing, construction and development costs of Group properties 
amount to £48.1 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: £46.7 million) on a cumulative basis. 
Recurring fair value measurement 
All investment and development properties are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Whilst completed property and property 
under development are held at cost in the balance sheet, the Group discloses the fair value of these assets and includes them at fair 
value in adjusted NAV. Completed property and property under development fair value measurements are categorised as Level 3 in the 
fair value hierarchy and their fair value is measured using the same techniques as for investment properties and investment properties 
under development.

3.1 Wholly owned property assets continued 
The valuation technique for investment properties is a discounted cash flow using the following inputs: net rental income, estimated 
future costs, occupancy and property management costs. 
Where the asset is leased to a University, the valuations also reflect the length of the lease, the allocation of maintenance and insurance 
responsibilities between the Group and the lessee, and the market’s general perception of the lessee’s credit worthiness. 
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the capital value per bed derived from actual  
market transactions. 
For development properties, the fair value is usually calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property (using the 
discounted cash flow method) less estimated costs to completion.

3.1 Wholly owned property assets continued 
A decrease in net rental income, estimated future rents or occupancy will result in a decrease in the fair value, whereas a decrease in the 
discount rate (yield) or the estimated costs to complete will result in an increase in fair value. There are interrelationships between these 
rates as they are partially determined by market rate conditions. 
3.2 Inventories

3.3 Other non-current assets 
The Group’s other non-current assets can be analysed as follows: 
  
Accounting policies 
Property, plant and equipment 
Other than land and buildings; property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses  
(see below). Land and buildings are stated at fair value on the same basis as investment properties. Property, plant and equipment  
mainly comprise leasehold improvements at the Group’s head office and London office as well as computer hardware and software  
at these sites. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and 
equipment. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
  Leasehold 
improvements Shorter life of lease and economic life 
  Other assets  4-20 years 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets predominately comprise internally developed computer software which allows customers to book online and 
processes transactions within the sales cycle. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an 
appropriate proportion of overheads. Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense 
incurred. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 4 to 5 years being the estimated useful lives of the intangible  
assets, from the date they are available for use. Amortisation is charged to the income statement.

3.4 Investments in joint ventures (Group) 
The Group has four joint ventures: 
* Part of the Group’s interest is held through a subsidiary, USAF (Feeder) Guernsey Ltd, in which there is an external investor. A minority interest 
therefore occurs on consolidation of the Group’s results representing the external investor’s share of profits and assets relating to its investment  
in USAF. The ordinary shareholders of The UNITE Group plc are beneficially interested in 16.4% (2012: 16.4%) of USAF. 
Accounting policies 
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The 
consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Group’s share of 
total gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity basis. Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair 
value – the difference between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture. The implied 
discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment loan. 
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control; a significant degree  
of judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.

b) Movement in carrying value of the Group’s investments in joint ventures 
The carrying value of the Group’s investment in joint ventures has increased by £42.4 million during the year ended 31 December 2013 
(2012: £21.8 million), resulting in an overall carrying value of £237.2 million (2012: £194.8 million). The following table shows how the 
increase has been achieved.  
In addition to its equity shares, the Group has also provided interest free investment loans to some of the joint ventures. These were 
primarily provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties. As a result of being provided 
interest free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Group’s 
finance income. 
During the year three joint venture investment loans to USAF were transferred to investment in joint ventures following a change in the 
terms of these loans as a result of the refinancing within USAF. This also resulted in the accelerated unwinding of the discount on the 
joint venture interest free loans of £15.4 million in the income statement (note 4.3). This is offset in the income statement by a 
corresponding accelerated unwinding of discount through the share of joint venture profit of £15.4 million (note 3.4a).

c) Transactions with joint ventures 
The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.  
In addition, the Group is entitled to promote fees from USAF and UCC if the joint ventures outperform certain benchmarks. The Group 
receives an enhanced equity interest in the JVs as consideration for the promote fee. The Group has recognised the following 
management fees in its results for the year. 
Included in share of joint venture profit in the income statement is a share of joint venture property management fee costs of £0.6 million 
(2012: £0.5 million). On a see-through basis these costs are deducted from the property management fees shown above, plus an 
adjustment for the minority interest of £0.2 million (2012: £0.2 million). This results in the net fees included in NPC (note 2.1a) of  
£10.6 million (2012: £10.3 million). 
No properties have been sold to joint ventures in 2013. During 2012 the Group sold one property to USAF for £30.4 million and one 
property to LSAV for £45.2 million. The two properties were held on the balance sheet as completed property within current assets, the 
proceeds and carrying value of the properties is therefore recognised in revenue and cost of sales in the income statement and the cash 
flows in operating activities. The profits relating to sales and associated disposal costs and related cash flows are set out below: 
 
Included within cash flows from financing activities is £nil (2012: (£32.2 million)) relating to the repayment of non-current borrowings on 
disposal of properties to joint ventures. £nil (2012: (£9.9 million)) relates to USAF and £nil (2012: (£22.3 million)) relating to LSAV. 
UCC properties are partly funded by debt totalling £225.7 million (2012: £226.7 million) which equates to 57.9% (2012: 59.5%)  
of the market value of these properties. In 2012 the Group guaranteed its share, 30%, of this debt amounting to £68.0 million. This 
guarantee only took effect in the event that the joint venture was unable to repay the debt within nine months of it becoming due. The 
Group no longer guarantees any UCC debt. These guarantees were accounted for in accordance with IFRS 4.

OCB properties are partly funded by debt totalling £106.0 million (2012: £113.0 million) which equates to 61.0% (2012: 64.7%) of the 
market value of these properties. In 2012 the Group guaranteed one facility amounting to £50.0 million. The Group had a back to back 
guarantee from Oasis Capital Bank for £37.5 million. This guarantee only took effect in the event that the joint venture was unable to 
repay the debt within six months of it becoming due. The Group no longer guarantees any OCB debt. These guarantees were accounted 
for in accordance with IFRS 4. 
3.5 Investments in subsidiaries (Company) 
a) Carrying value of investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures 
The movements in the Company’s interest in unlisted subsidiaries and joint ventures during the year are as follows: 
The carrying value of investment in subsidiaries has been calculated using the equity attributable to the owners of the parent company 
from the consolidated balance sheet adjusted for the fair value of fixed rate loans and properties under development. This includes 
investment property, investment property under development and swaps at a fair value calculated by a third party expert. All investment 
properties and investment properties under development are classified as level 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been 
discussed on page 113. The fixed rate loans range between level 1 and level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been 
discussed further on page 123. 
In addition to the equity investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company has provided a loan with interest chargeable at 
6.125% to LDC (Holdings) plc. The carrying value of the loan to LDC (Holdings) plc was £90.0 million (2012: £90.0 million). A further 
loan of £89.9 million was provided to LDC (Holdings) plc in the year with interest chargeable at 5.0%. 
A full list of the Company’s subsidiaries is appended to the annual return. The Company’s principal subsidiaries and joint ventures are:  
* Held directly by the Company.

Section 4: Funding 
4.1 Borrowings 
The table below analyses the Group’s borrowings which comprise bank and other loans by when they fall due for payment: 
In addition to the borrowings currently drawn as shown above, the Group has available undrawn facilities of £58.2 million (2012: £34.9 
million). A further working capital facility of £20 million (2012: £20 million) is also available.  
A further £101 million (2012: £146 million) of facilities are available if certain conditions are met. Of this amount £73 million (2012: 
£75 million) is only available for rental properties and £15 million (2012: £41 million) for development properties. The remaining amount 
is available for investment or development.  
The carrying value of borrowings is considered to be approximate to fair value, except for the Group’s fixed rate loans carried at £211.0 
million (2012: £227.8 million) and the convertible bond carried at £80.7 million (2012: £nil). The convertible bond and £90.0 million 
(2012: £90.0 million) of the fixed rate loans are classified as level 1 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have a fair value of £188.5 
million (2012: £91.5 million).  
The remaining £119.5 million (2012: £137.8 million) of the fixed rate loans are classified as level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. 
The fair value of these fixed rate loans has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis 
of market expectations of future interest rates. The fair value of these loans is £116.7 million (2012: £145.7 million).  
Properties with a carrying value of £657.2 million (2012: £728.1 million) have been pledged as security against the Group’s drawn  
down borrowings.  
On 31 January 2014 the Group successfully secured a 10 year fixed-rate £124 million debt facility, which has been secured against 
four wholly owned properties at 50% loan-to-value. As part of this transaction the Group repaid £120.3 million of existing debt. This is 
comprised of amounts being due for payment in less than one year (£28.5 million), between one and two years (£54.1 million), and 
between two and five years (£37.7 million). 
 
  
 
The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and equity. 
The Group continuously monitors its financing arrangements to manage its gearing. Interest rate swaps are used to manage 
the Group’s risk to fluctuations in interest rate movements. 
The following pages provide disclosures about the Group’s funding position, including borrowings, gearing and hedging 
instruments; its exposure to market risks; and its capital management policies. 
 
Accounting policies 
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised  
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.  
On 10 October 2013 the Group issued a convertible bond. The unsecured instrument pays a coupon of 2.5% until 10 October 2018.  
In accordance with IFRS, the equity and debt components of the bond are accounted for separately and the fair value of the debt 
component has been determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond. As a result, £80.3 million was 
recognised as a liability in the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, £9.6 million, which represents the equity 
component, was credited to reserves. The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value is amortised through 
the income statement from the date of issue. Issue costs of £2.0 million were allocated between equity and debt and the element 
relating to the debt component is being amortised over the life of the bond. The issue costs apportioned to equity of £0.2 million are 
not amortised.

4.2 Interest rate swaps 
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations. In accordance with the Group’s 
treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes and only holds swaps which are considered 
to be commercially effective.  
The following table shows the fair value of interest rate swaps: 
The fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis 
of market expectations of future interest rates, representing level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. The IFRS 13 level categorisation 
relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values. The classifications range from level 1 
where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have 
comparable market data.  
4.3 Net financing costs 
The Group’s overall average cost of debt as at 31 December 2013 is 5.1% (2012: 5.5%). The average cost of the Group’s investment 
debt at 31 December 2013 is 5.1% (2012: 5.5%). The overall average cost of debt on a see-through basis is 4.7% (2012: 5.5%). 
Accounting policies 
Interest rate swaps are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark to market movements recognised in the income 
statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.  
Hedge accounting, as defined in IFRS, is when the interest rate swap is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the  
variability in cash flows attributable to the interest risk of borrowings. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate 
swap is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes 
in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group only applies hedge accounting when 
the hedge is expected to be highly effective. 
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative  
gain or loss at that point remains in equity with any subsequent movements in fair value taken to the income statement. If the hedged 
transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement 
immediately. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.

4.4 Gearing 
The Group’s adjusted gearing ratio is a key indicator that the Group uses to manage its indebtedness. Adjusted net asset value (NAV)  
and adjusted net debt are used to calculate adjusted gearing. Adjusted net debt excludes mark to market of interest rate swaps as  
shown below. 
The Group’s gearing ratios are calculated as follows: 
4.5 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks – primarily interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.  
The Group’s treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects  
on the Group’s financial performance. Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. 
a) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by significant changes in interest rates. Borrowings issued at or swapped  
to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is separated into two main areas: 
i) Development and refinancing 
The Group had specific development borrowings of £17.5 million as at 31 December 2013 (2012: £nil). As at 31 December 2013 all 
Group specific development borrowings were unhedged. The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the 
current low interest rate environment. 
The Group’s principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer-term interest rates  
which affect the amount of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion. Significant adverse movements undermine  
the Group’s ability to release equity from its developments. 
The Group’s policy also allows this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps.

4.5 Financial risk factors continued 
a) Interest rate risk continued 
ii) Medium and long-term finance 
The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under both floating and fixed rate arrangements. The majority of this floating 
debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting 
under IAS 39. During 2013, the Group’s policy guideline has been to hedge in excess of 75% of the Group’s exposure for terms of 
approximately 2-10 years. 
At 31 December 2013, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 84% (2012: 88%) of the Group’s medium and long-term investment 
borrowing was held at fixed rates. Excluding the £133 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 4.7% 
(2012: 5.5%) for an average period of 7 years (2012: 9 years), including these swaps the average rate is 4.1%.  
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2013 against £133 million (2012: £258 million) of the Group’s borrowings.  
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are as follows: 
During the year, if interest rates had increased/decreased by 1%, pre-tax profit for the year would have been £0.7 million (2012: 
£1.2 million) lower/higher.  
b) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. For development activities, the 
Group has a policy to inject substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the 
specific facility for the development. The funding requirements of each scheme are therefore substantially ‘ring fenced’ and secured 
at the outset of works. 
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and interest rate swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the period 
remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows (including 
interest), so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet. 
2013 
2012 
During the year the Group issued £89.9 million of convertible bonds. The bonds have a maturity date of 10 October 2018. The 
bondholders may exercise the Conversion Right in certain circumstances but this is contingent on a number of factors and therefore  
the bonds are shown to maturity in the above disclosure.

c) Covenant compliance 
Many of the Group’s funding facilities carry covenants. The Group monitors its covenant position and the headroom available on an 
ongoing basis. At 31 December 2013, the Group was in full compliance with all of its borrowing covenants. The Group is able to use 
available cash to reduce debt to increase headroom on its loan-to-value (LTV) covenants. The covenant headroom position is outlined 
below and assumes that the Group is able to use a mixture of available cash and add additional property to banks’ security pools. 
* Calculated on the basis that available cash is used to reduce debt and available property can be used as additional security. 
4.6 Operating leases 
a) Payable 
The total future minimum lease rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases fall due for repayment as follows: 
These leases primarily relate to properties which the Group has sold and leased back and on which rental income is earned. The leases 
are generally for periods between 17 and 25 years and subject to annual RPI-based rent review. Two properties are subject to a fixed 
annual rent increase of 2%. The total operating lease expenditure incurred during the year was £15.0 million (2012: £15.3 million) 
b) Receivable 
The Group accounts for its tenancy contracts offered to commercial and individual tenants as operating leases. The future minimum 
lease payments receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

Accounting policies 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. Where the property 
interest under an operating lease is classified as an investment property, the property interest is accounted for as if it were a finance 
lease and the fair value model is used for the asset recognised.

4.7 Capital management 
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity and adjusted net debt, including cash held on deposit. The Group’s 
equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity. The components and calculation of 
adjusted net debt are set out in note 4.4. Capital is managed so as to continue as a going concern and to promote the long-term success 
of the business, and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders and joint venture partners.  
The Group uses a number of key metrics to manage its capital structure: 
  Adjusted net debt (note 4.4) 
  Adjusted gearing (note 4.4) 
  See-through LTV (note 2.3a) 
  Weighted average cost of investment debt (note 4.5aii). 
In order to manage levels of adjusted gearing over the medium term, the Group seeks to deliver NAV growth and to dispose of non-core 
property assets in order to offset capital that is committed to development activity. £13 million of non-core assets were sold in 2013 and 
a further £77.1 million of non-core property disposals are targeted by December 2014. The Group targets new developments with a 
yield on cost of approximately 9%. The Group does not commit to developing new sites until sufficient equity and funding to fulfil the full 
cost of the development is secure. 
The Board monitors the ability of the Group to pay dividends out of available cash and distributable profits. The Operations segment 
generated cash of £23.2 million (2012: £17.2 million) during the year, thereby covering the proposed dividend of £8.5 million, 2.7 times 
(2012: £6.4 million, 2.7 times). 
4.8 Equity 
The Company’s issued share capital has increased during the year as follows: 
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share  
at meetings of the Company. All shares rank equally with regard to the Company’s residual assets. 
On 13 June 2013 the Group completed a share placing of 16,000,000 shares, which gave rise to proceeds of £51.2 million, £49.9 
million net of issue costs. 
The Group is in the process of raising gross proceeds of £100.5 million through the issue of 24,500,000 shares through a Placing and 
Open Offer, at a price of 410 pence per share.  
4.9 Dividends 
During the year, the Company declared and paid an interim dividend of £2.8 million (2012: £1.6 million) and paid a £4.7 million final 
dividend relating to the year ended 31 December 2012 (2011: £2.0 million).  
After the year end, the Directors proposed a final dividend per share of 3.2 pence (2012: 3 pence), bringing the total dividend per share 
for the year to 4.8 pence (2012: 4 pence). No provision has been made in relation to this dividend. 
  
Accounting policies 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business 
combination, are shown as a deduction, net of tax, in equity from the proceeds. Share issue costs incurred directly in connection  
with a business combination are deducted from the proceeds of the issue.

Section 5: Working capital 
5.1 Cash 
The Group’s cash position at 31 December 2013 was £43.2 million (2012: £75.4 million).  
At 31 December 2013 the Company had an overdraft of £4.9 million (2012: £1.2 million). 
The Group’s cash balances include £13.4 million (2012: £12.1 million) whose use at the balance sheet date is restricted by funding 
agreements to pay operating costs and loan interest relating to specific properties. 
The Group generates cash from its operating activities as follows: 
Cash flows consist of the following segmental cash inflows/(outflows): Operations £23.2 million (2012: £17.2 million), property  
(£94.0 million) (2012: £48.3 million) and unallocated £38.6 million (2012: (£6.9 million)). The unallocated amount includes Group 
dividends (£7.5 million) (2012: (£3.6 million)), LSAV set-up costs £nil (2012: (£1.3 million)), own shares purchased £nil (2012: 
(£1.3 million)), tax payable of (£0.7 million) (2012: (£0.9 million)), investment in JVs (£11.8 million) (2012: £nil), contributions to  
the UNITE Foundation (£0.5 million) (2012: £nil) and amounts received from shares issued £59 million (2012: £0.2 million). 
  
 
This section focuses on how the Group generates its operating cash flows. Careful management of working capital is vital to 
ensure that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.  
On the following pages you will find disclosures around the Group’s cash position and how cash is generated from the Group’s 
trading activities, and disclosures around trade receivables and payables. 
 
Accounting policies 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that  
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts  
that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and  
cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

5.2 Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows, all trade and other receivables are current. 
The Group offers tenancy contracts to commercial (Universities and retail unit tenants) and individual tenants based on the academic 
year. The Group monitors and manages the recoverability of its receivables based on the academic year to which the amounts relate. 
Rental income is payable immediately, therefore all receivables relating to tenants are past the payment due date. 
2013 
2012 
Amounts receivable from joint ventures are not past due or impaired. 
  
Accounting policies 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at the amount invoiced to the customer (fair value) and subsequently at the amounts 
considered recoverable (amortised cost). Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion  
of the Board, be collected. These estimates include such factors as historical experience and industry specific factors. A provision  
for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due. The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.

5.2 Trade and other receivables continued 
Movements in the Group’s provision for impairment of trade receivables can be shown as follows: 
5.3 Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. It arises principally from the Group’s cash balances, the Group’s receivables from customers and joint ventures and loans 
provided to the Group’s joint ventures.  
At the year end, the Group’s exposure to credit risk was as follows: 
a) Cash 
The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash. Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon 
long-term ratings published by credit rating agencies and credit default swap rates. 
b) Trade receivables 
The Group’s customers can be split into three groups – (i) students (individuals), (ii) commercial organisations including Universities and 
(iii) manufacturing customers. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the characteristics of each customer. The Group holds 
tenant deposits of £8.1 million (2012: £7.9 million) as collateral against individual customers.  
c) Joint ventures 
Amounts receivable from joint ventures fall into two categories – working capital balances and investment loans.  
5.4 Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables due within one year can be analysed as follows: 
Other payable and accrued expenses include £8.1 million (2012: £7.9 million) in relation to customer deposits. These will be returned  
at the end of the tenancy subject to the condition of the accommodation and payment of any outstanding amounts. Deferred income 
relates to rental income that has been collected in advance of it being recognised as revenue.

1420-1 UNITE AR_4.Back_v4.indd   136 02/04/2014   17:58 2.  A member of the Company who is entitled to attend, speak and vote at the meeting and who is unable or does not wish to attend the 
meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights to attend and to speak and vote on his/her behalf at the 
meeting. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares (so 
a member must have more than one share to be able to appoint more than one proxy). A proxy need not be a member of the Company but 
must attend the meeting to represent his/her appointing member. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a member from attending in person 
and voting at the meeting although voting in person at the meeting will terminate a member’s proxy appointment. A proxy must vote in 
accordance with any instructions given by the member by whom the proxy is appointed. A form of proxy which may be used to make such 
appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes 
and the notes to the proxy form.
3. To be valid, any form of proxy, and the original or duly certified copy of the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is 
signed or authenticated, must be received by hand or by post at Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, 
Bristol BS99 6ZY, no later than 9.30am on 13 May 2014.
4. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the 
meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by following the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other 
CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider, should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
5.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy 
Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (Euroclear) specifications, and must 
contain the information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it 
constitutes the appointment of a proxy, the revocation of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed 
proxy must, in order to be a valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent (CREST ID 3RA50) by the latest time for 
receipt of proxy appointments specified in note 3 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by 
the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message 
by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST 
should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
6.  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers, should note that Euroclear does not make 
available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation  
to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a 
CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST 
system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system 
and timings.
7.  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended).
8. If you would like to submit your proxy vote via the internet, you can do so by accessing our registrar’s website (www.eproxyappointment.
com). You will require the control number, your unique PIN (which will expire at the end of the voting period) and your Shareholder 
Reference Number (SRN), printed on the proxy card, in order to log in and submit your proxy vote electronically. You can access this site 
from any internet enabled PC. If you submit your proxy via the internet it should reach the registrar by 9.30am on 13 May 2014. Should you 
complete your proxy form electronically and then post a hard copy, the form that arrives last will be counted to the exclusion of instructions 
received earlier, whether electronic or posted. Please refer to the terms and conditions of the service on the website.
9. In the case of joint holders of shares, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted 
by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the 
Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
10.  If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of the same shares, the appointment received last before the latest time for 
the receipt of proxies will take precedence..
1 1.  Any person to whom this notice has been sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information rights (a 
Nominated Person) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be 
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or 
does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise 
of voting rights.
12. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies above does not apply to Nominated Persons. These 
rights can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.

publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (a) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report 
and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting; or (b) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company 
ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the 
Act. The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 
527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward 
the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which 
may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Act to publish on  
a website.
19. In accordance with section 338 of the Act, a member or members of the Company may (provided that the criteria set out in section 338(3) 
of the Act are met) require the Company to give to members notice of a resolution which may properly be moved and is intended to be 
moved at the meeting, provided that: (a) the resolution must not be, if passed, ineffective (whether by reason of inconsistency with any 
enactment or the Company’s constitution or otherwise); and (b) the resolution must not be defamatory of any person, frivolous or vexatious.

resolution of which notice is to be given and must be received by the Company not later than six weeks before the meeting, or, if later, the 
time at which notice is given of the meeting. (In the foregoing sentence, the terms ‘hard copy form’, ‘electronic form’ and ‘authenticated’ 
bear their respective meanings set out in the Act in relation to a communication, or a document or information sent or supplied,  
to a company.)
20. In accordance with section 338A of the Act, a member or members of the Company may (provided that the criteria set out in section 
338A(3) of the Act are met) require the Company to include in the business to be dealt with at the meeting a matter (other than a 
proposed resolution) which may properly be included in the business of the meeting, provided that the matter is not defamatory of  
any person, frivolous or vexatious. A request may be in hard copy form or electronic form, must identify the matter to be included in the

making it and must be received by the Company not later than six weeks before the meeting, or, if later, the time at which notice is given of

Chairman’s statement
In the year to 31 March 2010 operating profit was 15.2% 
lower at £19.5 million (2009: £23.0 million) with basic 
underlying earnings per share
1
 19.5% lower at 32.2p 
(2009: 40.0p). Statutory earnings per share decreased 
8.7% to 33.4p (2009: 36.6p).
The Group has maintained its track record of a high rate of 
profit to cash conversion with positive operating cash flow 
of £27.0 million (2009: £12.3 million) leading to a closing 
net funds balance of £72.3 million (2009: £55.5 million).
Order intake was significantly affected by weakness in a 
number of our end markets, falling by 44% to £99.0 million 
(2009: £177.6 million), resulting in a closing order book of 
£142.1 million at year end (2009: £260.4 million).
We are continuing to see the benefits of our margin 
improvement strategy. The commitment to margin 
performance through operational efficiency has enabled 
us to maintain operating margins at 9.1% despite lower 
revenues. We continue to pursue operational improvements 
and manage our cost base effectively and have reduced 
headcount by 17% since the start of 2009.
We have increased the pace of investment in expanding 
our technology portfolio through increased research and 
development expenditure and two strategic acquisitions 
during the year. As we move forward, the Group has a 
strong platform to drive growth through both organic 
development and value added acquisitions.
The installed base of Hamworthy equipment continues to 
grow and with a greater management focus on this part 
of the business this provides the basis for a resilient and 
growing aftersales business across all divisions.
“We have increased the pace  
of investment in expanding our 
technology portfolio. Despite  
short-term market uncertainties, 
the Group has a strong platform 
to drive long-term growth 
both organically and through 
value-added acquisitions.”
  Gordon Page CBE DL 
Chairman

movements in derivatives
I am pleased to report on another strong set of trading results for Hamworthy, 
despite ongoing challenges in our markets. We have, however, maintained 
our operating margins on reduced revenue and once again remained highly 
cash generative. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts Additional information
5 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2010
Company overview Chairman’s statement
We expect the shipbuilding market to remain challenging 
for some time and it is difficult to predict when markets 
will improve. We therefore continue to focus on delivering 
earnings through both growth in adjacent markets and 
control of our cost base. We are developing our technology 
pipeline of new products through both organic and 
acquisitive investment. The Group has a strong balance 
sheet and a range of long-term growth opportunities and 
despite short-term market uncertainties, the board looks 
forward with confidence.
We therefore remain committed to our progressive dividend 
policy and your directors are recommending a final dividend 
of 5.97p which, if approved, would represent a 5.0% 
increase in the total dividend declared in respect of the year 
to 9.17p per share (2009: 8.73p). Subject to shareholders’ 
approval the final dividend will be paid on 22 July 2010 to 
all shareholders on the register on 18 June 2010. 
On behalf of the board I thank all of our employees for their 
contributions to another year of significant achievement. 
Our employees play a critical role in the Group’s success 
and we recognise that this will be particularly so in meeting 
the challenges ahead. We remain committed to recruiting, 
retaining and developing the best people.

6 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2010
Chief Executive’s review
Revenues were underpinned by both a robust order book 
as we entered the year and continued solid performance 
from our Aftersales business through the period. 
Nevertheless revenues were impacted by the weakness in 
our end markets and decreased by 15.2% to £214.3 million 
(2009: £252.8 million). The beneficial effect of exchange 
rate movement on translation was £10.9 million of 
revenues. On a constant currency basis and excluding 
acquisitions made during the year revenues decreased 
by 20.1%. 
Operating profit decreased in line with revenue by 15.2% to 
£19.5 million (2009: £23.0 million). On a constant currency 
basis and excluding acquisitions made during the year 
operating profit decreased by 13.4%.
As a result of our strategic drive for margin improvement 
through operational excellence and swift actions to 
reduce costs where necessary, we maintained a healthy 
operating margin of 9.1% (2009: 9.1%) whilst increasing 
our investment in research and development by 33.7%. 
The Pump Systems business again performed strongly with 
increased margins compared to the previous year, offsetting 
lower margins in the Gas Systems business.
Order intake was significantly impacted by the weakness in 
our end markets, in particular for newbuild projects in both 
the marine and offshore segments. As a result total order 
intake fell by 44.3% to £99.0 million (2009: £177.6 million).
The performance of individual businesses is reviewed 
in the divisional review on pages 16 to 23. Aftersales 
activities across the Group continued to perform well 
with order intake increasing by 2.6% to £36.8 million 
(2009: £35.9 million) and revenue increasing by 2.8% 
to £37.3 million (2009: £36.3 million). The constituent 
parts of the Aftersales revenue are included in the 
divisional revenues.
“As a result of our strategic drive 
for margin improvement we 
maintained a healthy operating 
margin of 9.1%, whilst increasing 
our investment in Research 
and Development.”
  Joe Oatley 
Chief Executive
The Group has faced extremely challenging market conditions throughout the year 
and the robust financial performance is both a reflection of the strength of our 
business model and a credit to our employees who have been able to continue 
to develop the business despite these difficult markets. Business review Governance Accounts Additional information

Company overview
Business review Chief Executive’s review
Strategy 
We have continued to make good progress on the 
implementation of each of the key elements of our strategy:
Balanced business in long-term growth markets
We are expanding the business into related markets outside 
the marine newbuild segment that has been the historical 
core of the Group. In so doing we are seeking to achieve 
a greater sectoral balance to the Group and the sustained 
weakness in the new shipbuilding market has served to 
confirm the importance of this strategy. We target markets 
that exhibit strong long-term growth prospects with our main 
focus for expansion being upstream oil & gas, aftersales and 
opportunities driven by the need to meet new environmental 
legislation in the marine and offshore markets. We have 
expanded our technology offering in both the upstream oil 
& gas and environmental markets during the year both by 
acquisition and organic development. We have continued 
to develop our Aftersales business and strengthened the 
Group executive committee with the recruitment of a Group 
Aftersales Director to lead this business across all divisions. 
Whilst sales to the marine newbuild market fell by 27% 
compared to the prior year, sales to markets outside new 
shipbuilding remained at the same level and now represent 
50% of total Group sales (2009: 42%).
Leadership through market-led innovation
We seek to achieve leading market positions in our chosen 
sectors and to support this we continue to increase our 
investment in research and development across the Group. 
This investment focuses on not only the development of 
new products but also the improvement of our existing 
products as both are key to the long-term success of the 
business. In the period, investment in internally-funded 
research and development grew by 33.7% to £3.9 million. 
Every division increased research and development expenditure 
as a proportion of sales and we have continued to invest 
in the technologies brought into the Group through 
acquisition over the last year. 
Margin improvement through operational excellence
Operating margins, cost efficiency and operational excellence 
remain a key focus. Despite lower turnover and an increase 
in research and development expenditure, Group operating 
margin remained at 9.1%. Good progress was made during 
the year in improving our operational effectiveness, in 
particular in procurement where we have strengthened our 
low-cost sourcing team located in China and introduced 
a group-wide category management system for our key 
components and materials. This will enable us to realise the 
benefits of our scale in procurement whilst maintaining the 
flexibility of our decentralised operating structure. 
 
We have continued our process of moving operations 
from European countries to our manufacturing locations 
in Asia where they are both closer to our main customer 
base and enjoy lower costs. During the year we transferred 
the manufacture of the Dolphin range of pumps from the 
UK to our plant in Singapore where it has been integrated 
with the existing centrifugal pumps manufacturing facility. 
We established the capability for order processing and 
contract management in our facility in China to enable the 
transfer of these activities from our Inert Gas business in 
Norway which is planned for completion during 2010.
We achieved the milestone of securing the land for a 
new 15,000m
2
 manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, 
to replace our existing plant in this region. Construction 
work is now well underway with production scheduled to 
commence at the new site during the summer of 2010. 
This investment cost less the compensation for the release 
of the existing site is expected to result in a net addition 
to tangible fixed assets of £3.8 million when complete. 
In the year to 31 March 2010 the Group has paid out 
a net amount of £1.1 million. 
In response to the weakness in our end markets, we 
developed a group-wide plan in January 2009 that set 
out detailed cost reduction actions specific to each of 
our businesses. Since each of our businesses has differing 
market exposure and order book coverage the timing and 
scale of these cost reduction actions varies across the Group. 
In addition to the headcount reductions carried out in 
March last year in our Gas Systems business in Norway and 
Water Systems business in Germany, we have taken further 
steps to reduce costs in all four of our divisions during the 
last year. Since January 2009, we have reduced employee 
numbers across the Group by 17%, with the majority of this 
being carried out in the last financial year. In all cases we 
have been careful to ensure that we achieve our targeted 
cost reduction whilst maintaining our core capabilities. 
We have maintained our programme of both capital and 
research and development investment which are key drivers 
for our future growth.
These collective cost reduction actions and operational 
efficiency measures will help to support our margins against 
any pricing pressures emerging as a consequence of the 
current economic climate.  Business review

Chief Executive’s review (continued)
Strategy (continued)
Strategic acquisitions
We seek to complement our organic development with 
strategic acquisitions, both to expand our technology base 
and to strengthen our market positions. During the year 
we completed two acquisitions. On 29 September 2009 
we acquired the business and assets of Krystallon Limited. 
Krystallon Limited has developed a leading technology 
for systems to address the emerging market for marine 
sulphur emissions reduction. On 30 September 2009 
we also completed the acquisition of the Technology & 
Products division of Aibel AS. This business provides leading 
technologies for the upstream oil & gas industry and 
expands the Group’s presence in this target market.
We continue to be active in the search for strategic bolt-on 
acquisitions and, supported by our strong balance sheet, 
expect that these will continue to form an important part 
of the development of the Group in the years ahead. 
Health, safety and environment
We have invested in a group-wide commitment to 
improving our safety culture and I am delighted to be able 
to report good progress on our goal to eliminate injuries 
by continually seeking safer workplaces, processes and 
behaviour. We record both lost-time accidents and near 
misses where a potentially unsafe event occurred but no 
injury was sustained. We have implemented a process of 
reporting and sharing lessons learned from both accidents 
and near misses around the Group and thus prevent 
recurrences. As a result of these efforts, we have reduced 
the rate of lost-time accidents by 51% and the number of 
days lost due to accidents from 264 to 85.  
 
 
We are very conscious of the environmental impact that 
our activities may have on the communities in which we 
operate and we constantly strive to minimise the effect 
of this. The Group’s policy of gaining accreditation under 
the ISO 14001 environmental standard at all our principal 
sites was achieved during the year. Furthermore, many of 
our products have a direct environmental benefit and they 
are often designed to ensure that our customers can meet 
relevant environmental legislation.
Employees
We recognise that this has been a difficult year for many 
of our employees given the reduced headcount across all 
our operations. This has been handled in as professional 
and sensitive a way as possible and it is credit to all of our 
people that our operations have not suffered from any 
disruption whilst these reductions have been implemented. 
Where possible we have sought to control costs through 
temporary layoffs and unpaid leave in order to minimise 
the effects on individuals.
We remain committed to the development of our people 
and have introduced this year the Hamworthy Leadership 
Development Programme which will provide a foundation 
for the development of our leaders and managers of 
the future.
It is with great sadness that I inform you that on 1 June 2009 
a Hamworthy employee tragically lost her life when Air France 
flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro was lost at sea. Laura Rahal 
worked for our Gas Systems business in Norway and is very 
much missed by her colleagues and family.
We have invested in a group-wide commitment to 
improving our safety culture and I am delighted to be able 
to report good progress on our goal to eliminate injuries 
by continually seeking safer workplaces, processes 
and behaviour.  Business review Governance Accounts Additional information

Markets
The Group strategy is to target markets that have long-term 
growth characteristics driven, in particular, by increasing 
environmental legislation and the need for production 
and transportation of oil & gas. However, a number of 
our market segments do show shorter-term variability and 
have been adversely affected by the global economic crisis. 
The new shipbuilding market has been particularly weak 
with very low levels of new vessel ordering since October 
2008. Whilst we have seen some increase in enquiry 
levels from parts of the new shipbuilding market in recent 
months, particularly from the cruise ship and LPG carrier 
segments, these have not yet translated into an increase 
in the rate of order intake.
Contracting of new FPSO projects for the offshore market 
has also been very low in historical terms, partly due to 
expectations of deflation in construction costs for these 
projects. Construction costs for offshore projects have 
now fallen and with oil prices stable at a level supportive 
of deepwater offshore investment, we are starting to see 
offshore projects passing final investment decisions and 
moving ahead. Enquiry levels from this sector remain high.
From a geographical perspective, the Brazilian market 
represents a significant growth opportunity for the Group 
driven by the local investment plans both for offshore 
vessels and supporting oil tankers and gas carriers. 
The Group is currently bidding on a number of contracts 
to supply equipment onto all of these vessel types.
Demand for our Aftersales products and services has been 
steady throughout the year despite falling freight rates and 
lower than normal vessel utilisation. The field population 
of Hamworthy equipment continues to grow, providing a 
solid underpin for the demand for our aftermarket products 
and services.
Outlook
As expected, order intake for original equipment has 
been subdued throughout the year and as a result we 
enter the new financial year with a reduced order book 
compared to recent years. Nevertheless the current order 
book of £142.1 million provides good visibility for the year 
ahead. In addition our Aftersales business continues to 
perform well. The board is therefore confident of meeting 
expectations for the financial year ending 31 March 2011.
We expect that we will continue to manage costs to 
reflect lower activity levels and this, combined with our 
commitment to operational excellence, will help to support 
margins in this difficult economic environment.
Our markets for original equipment, and in particular the new 
shipbuilding market, continue to be challenging. Whilst we 
have seen some improvement in ship ordering activity in the 
last few months, it is too early to say when market conditions 
will return to more normal levels and when this will translate 
into an increase in the rate of ordering of original equipment 
of the types supplied by Hamworthy. The underlying 
macroeconomics driving an increase in demand from the 
upstream oil & gas sector are strong and we expect that this 
will drive a recovery in this market, although the timing of any 
upturn remains difficult to predict.
The development of some of the new environmental market 
opportunities such as ballast water treatment and exhaust 
gas cleaning is driven by a defined legislative timetable 
and these developing markets are expected to provide 
substantial opportunity for growth in the medium to long

Progress on  
our strategy
During the year we have made  
significant progress on achieving  
our strategic objectives.
Margin improvement
• Maintained return on sales at 9.1% on lower turnover and  
increased investment in R&D
• Introduced group-wide Category Management Process in procurement
• Strengthened low cost sourcing team in China
• Established contract engineering and sales order processing  
in China for our Inert Gas products
Strategy – delivering long-term growth
Demand for energy production 
and consumption
Demand for energy continues to grow 
and both oil & gas will provide a key 
component of the world’s energy 
demands for the foreseeable future. 
Significant investment is required in 
developing new production capacity, 
simply to replace the decline from existing 
fields, driving demand for Hamworthy’s 
products in the offshore sector. The 
dislocation between where oil & gas 
in produced and where it is consumed 
means that continued investment in 
transport infrastructure will be required 
driving long-term demand for the Group’s 
products in both oil & gas shipping and 
other parts of the LNG supply chain.
Increasing environmental 
legislation and awareness
Environmental legislation is a key 
demand driver behind many of the 
Group’s products. This ranges from 
water systems, where new international 
regulations require all ships to be 
fitted with a compliant sewage 
treatment plant, to fuel gas systems 
that allow ships to run cleaner-burning 
powered engines and thus operate in 
environmentally sensitive areas.
Last year, over 30% of the Group’s 
revenues originated from environmental 
markets and technologies and we expect 
this to increase in the years to come.
A balanced business in  
long-term growth markets
We aim to invest in a range of growth 
opportunities in the marine, upstream 
oil & gas and service markets to insulate 
shareholders from volatility in earnings.
Leadership through  
market-led innovation
We seek to be leaders in our chosen 
sectors through investment in 
technologies, developing solutions 
to meet new market opportunities 
and deliver strong organic growth.
Operational excellence  
and a flexible cost base
We will achieve long-term margin 
improvement through a focus on 
operational efficiency and effectiveness. 
We outsource lower added-value parts 
of the manufacturing chain, maintaining 
a flexible cost base and minimising 
invested capital. 
Strategic acquisitions
We will acquire strategic bolt-on 
businesses to extend the technology 
base and market positions of our 
existing businesses.
Global support,  
24 hours a day
Our marine and oil & gas customers are 
international, and so are we. We are 
established in key locations around the 
world to ensure we can provide support 
when and where it is needed.
Market leader
We have market-leading positions in our 
key markets which gives us the strength 
to support our customers and invest 
for the future. Our brand has been 
recognised and respected for quality 
and reliability for almost a century. 
Hamworthy know-how
We have a reputation for deep 
understanding of both the technical and 
commercial issues in our markets; that’s 
why we are our customers’ first choice. 
We continue to invest to ensure that we 
are at the technological forefront in our 
chosen markets. 
Customer relationships
We work in partnership with our 
customers to deliver solutions that ensure 
their products work reliably and safely in 
the harshest environments.

Business review Strategy
With a broader range of new growth opportunities
Flare gas recovery
The World Bank has identified the recovery of gas currently flared 
or vented by the oil industry as one of the key ways to meet the 
world’s increasing demand for fossil fuel energy whilst reducing 
harmful emissions. It is estimated that gas lost through flaring 
around the world equates to around 25% of the natural gas 
consumed by Europe alone. Hamworthy provides technology 
to safely capture and handle this flare gas. 
Ballast water treatment
The environmental impact of transporting invasive biological species 
throughout the world in ships’ ballast water can be dramatic. New 
legislation introduced by the International Maritime Organization 
restricts the transportation of invasive aquatic species in ballast water. 
Hamworthy provides cost-effective technology to manage and treat 
ballast water, helping ship owners and operators both comply with 
the legislation and protect the marine environment. 
Offshore pumping systems
To maintain current production levels, significant new oil 
reserves need to be discovered over the next 20 years. Access 
to easy-to-reach oil will decline and new fields will increasingly 
be developed in offshore deepwater environments. Hamworthy 
is expanding its range of pumps and pumping systems for this 
demanding and harsh environment. 
Exhaust gas cleaning
Sulphur oxides and particulate matter emitted into the 
atmosphere contribute to acid rain and wide-ranging health 
problems. Exhaust scrubbing is recognised as an effective way of 
reducing these pollutants. Legislation is already in place to limit 
sulphur emissions, and further restrictions will come. Hamworthy 
has the technology to allow ship owners and operators to meet 
current and future legislation and protect the environment.
Growing our technology pipeline
• Extended the range of technology in the Group through  
both organic and acquisitive investment
• Significant developments underway in ballast water 
treatment, exhaust gas cleaning, enhanced oil/water 
separation and offshore process pumps 
Expanding in adjacent markets
• Focus is on growing in the upstream oil & gas, aftersales 
and environmental markets
• Continued development of the Aftersales business with 
long-term supply agreements and new training products
• Extended our offering in the upstream oil & gas market 
through the products and know-how acquired from Aibel AS
• Successful completion of first-of-type deepwell process

Financial review
Basis of reporting
The Group financial statements in this report have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted for use in the 
EU, together with the associated International Financial 
Reporting Interpretation Council (“IFRIC”) interpretations 
and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
entities reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements of the parent company have been 
presented in accordance with UK GAAP .
Accounting policies
The Group has reviewed its accounting policies in accordance 
with IAS 8 and determined that they are appropriate for the 
Group and have been consistently applied.
Acquisitions
On 29 September 2009 the Group acquired the business 
and assets of Krystallon Limited for an initial cash 
consideration, excluding acquisition transaction costs, 
of £0.95 million payable immediately plus £0.85 million 
payable upon satisfactory completion of an internal 
testing programme. Further amounts may become payable 
dependent on financial performance in the periods up 
to 31 March 2015. The directors’ best estimate of the 
amount likely to be paid is £3.0 million at present day value 
and this is recognised as performance-related contingent 
deferred consideration. Krystallon is a leading supplier of 
cost-effective systems to address the emerging market for 
marine exhaust sulphur emissions reduction. 
On 30 September 2009 the Group completed the acquisition 
of the Technology and Products division of Aibel AS. This 
was acquired for an initial cash consideration, excluding 
acquisition transaction costs, of £3.7 million paid on 
completion with a further sum, estimated by the directors 
to be £0.4 million, payable upon the final agreement of 
net assets acquired. Further amounts of a maximum of 
£2.1 million could become payable dependent on order 
intake in the period to 31 December 2010. However, the 
directors’ best estimate of the likely further amount payable 
is £nil. This business supplies leading technologies to the 
offshore oil & gas market that are used to increase the 
efficiency of oil production and ensure the safe handling 
of oil & gas cargoes on offshore production vessels.
In both these transactions, the total consideration has 
been allocated as between the fair value of tangible and 
intangible net assets acquired and goodwill as set out in 
note 34 to the financial statements. 
Results overview
The Group has delivered a solid financial performance 
within very challenging market conditions. Revenue fell 
15.2% to £214.3 million (2009: £252.8 million). Operating 
profit fell by 15.2% to £19.5 million (2009: £23.0 million), 
maintaining Group operating margins at the same level as 
the prior year of 9.1%. This performance has been achieved 
despite a considerable rise in expenditure on research 
and development from £2.9 million in the prior year to 
£3.9 million. This increased development activity is most 
evident within the acquired businesses of Greenship BV 
and Krystallon in developing systems aimed at meeting 
environmentally driven legislation for the treatment of 
ballast water and ships’ exhaust sulphur emissions. The 
Group capitalises research and development expenditure 
where required to do so under IAS 38. One of the criteria 
for capitalisation set out in that accounting standard is the 
demonstration of the technical feasibility of completing 
“The Group has maintained its focus 
on cash generation and achieved 
a high rate of profit to cash 
conversion.”

Business review Financial review
the intangible asset. The directors consider that meeting 
the criteria can only be demonstrated when the developed 
product is fully tested and, where required, regulatory body 
approvals are received. It is likely therefore that research 
and development projects will have the majority of their 
budgeted costs expended by the time that criteria is met.
The Group generated 73% (2009: 76%) of its operating 
profits before central costs in reporting currencies other 
than sterling, the most significant being euro, Danish 
kroner, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollars and Chinese 
renminbi. The weighted average rate for these currencies 
has strengthened by 5.7% compared to the prior year which 
had the effect of increasing sterling consolidated revenue 
by £10.9 million and operating profits by £1.2 million. 
On a constant currency basis revenue decreased by 19.5% 
and operating profits decreased by 20.5%.
Underlying profit before taxation, excluding gains and 
losses on fair value movements in derivatives, fell 18.9% to 
£19.9 million (2009: £24.5 million) or 23.8% on a constant 
currency basis. The fall in global interest rates affected all 
of the Group’s principal currencies with the effect that net 
interest income fell to £0.4 million (2009: £1.6 million). 
This was despite average net cash balances held through 
the year being 15.4% above the prior year.
The Group’s undelivered order book decreased from 
£260.4 million to £142.1 million.
Taxation
The tax charge of £5.6 million (2009: £5.8 million) 
represents an effective rate of 27.0% (2009 26.0%). 
The Group generates taxable profits in a number of 
jurisdictions where the rate of corporation tax is lower than 
the UK. The most notable differences are in China and 
Singapore. The net effect of these lower foreign tax rates is 
equivalent to 3.4% of the profit before taxation. Note 12 to 
the financial statements provides details of the tax charge. 
Earnings per share
Basic underlying earnings per share, calculated to exclude 
the gain or loss on fair value movements in derivatives, 
fell by 19.5% from 40.0p per share to 32.2p per share. 
On a constant currency basis the decrease would have 
been 24.4%. On a statutory basis, basic earnings per share 
fell 8.7% to 33.4p (2009: 36.6p). Note 14 to the financial 
statements provides details of these calculations and those 
of the measures of diluted earnings per share for the period.
Dividend
The board is recommending a final ordinary dividend of 
5.97p per share. If approved by shareholders this would 
result in a total dividend declared in respect of the year of 
9.17p per share when added to the interim dividend of 
3.20p per share paid in December 2009.
Financing, cash flow and treasury
Through this period of challenging market conditions and 
decreased revenues the Group’s businesses have maintained 
their focus on cash flows and the control of working capital. 
This combines with the Group’s strategy of maintaining 
a low fixed cost base thus helping to minimise the 
requirement for investment in capital assets. The conversion 
of Group profits to cash flow is a key financial performance 
indicator, as discussed within the KPI commentary on 
page 25. This is monitored over a revolving three-year 
period given the Group’s combination of regular cash flows 
in businesses with smaller unit cost equipment supply and 
greater volatility within larger contract businesses.

Financial review (continued)
Financing, cash flow and treasury (continued)
A summary of cash flows and the change in net funds is set 
out above. Operating cash flow amounted to £27.0 million 
(2009: £12.3 million) which is a conversion rate of 139% 
of operating profit. The conversion rate over a three-year 
average is 100%. The net funds position at the year end was 
£72.3 million (2009: £55.5 million). Further detail relating 
to the cash flows and movements in net funds of the Group 
is given in the consolidated cash flow statement on page 45 
and in notes 29 and 30 to the financial statements.
All businesses are responsible for the management of 
local cash and working capital requirements. The principal 
operating companies participate in a cash pooling 
arrangement under which surplus cash is transferred to a 
central treasury function which manages the most efficient 
use of funds across the Group. The Group has historically 
hedged part of the interest rate exposure on its term debt. 
At 31 March 2010 that exposure relates to a term loan 
held in the Group’s German subsidiary with an outstanding 
balance of £0.7 million and on which the interest rate 
exposure is fully hedged to a fixed rate of 3.35%.
The Group’s businesses are global and each can contract 
in several currencies. The Group’s policy is to hedge all 
currency transaction exposures at the time of entering into 
the contractual commitment back to the relevant contracting 
business’ local currency. The significant majority of this 
hedging is operated through the central treasury function. 
The Group’s principal operating businesses reconcile their 
currency exposures and related hedges and report them 
to the treasury function as part of their financial reporting 
routines. The Group intends that its hedging procedures 
qualify for hedge reserve accounting as far as is practical to 
do so. This will result in any gain or loss volatility of hedge 
derivatives initially being recorded in a separate component 
of equity and not through the statement of comprehensive 
income. Where hedging products do not so qualify the 
gains or losses relating to movements in fair values of 
the derivative product are recorded in the statement of 
 
comprehensive income. This occurred during the financial 
year ended 31 March 2009 and the financial year ended 
31 March 2010 and the effect was adjusted in arriving at 
underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per 
share as shown in the statement of comprehensive income 
and detailed in note 14 to the financial statements.
The Group’s primary banking and finance facility is 
provided by Barclays Bank plc. This comprises a £60 million 
facility for bonds, guarantees and indemnities committed 
to 30 June 2012. This is capable of being increased to 
£80 million dependent upon the prevailing levels of 
mark-to-market of the Group’s extant foreign exchange 
hedges. Barclays Bank also provides the majority of 
the Group’s foreign exchange hedging through an 
uncommitted facility dated 25 March 2009. In addition 
the Group has further foreign exchange and treasury 
facilities held centrally with Royal Bank of Scotland plc and 
directly by its subsidiaries with local banks. The Group has 
not breached any covenant within its banking facilities 
during the year.
Going concern
The Group’s activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future performance are included in this business 
review on pages 6 to 29. The principal financial risks are set 
out below and non-financial risks are set out on page 24. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are all described within this 
financial review. Notes 23 and 31 of the financial statements 
set out the Group’s objectives and procedures for managing 
capital, financial, foreign currency and liquidity risk.
The Group has available to it considerable financial 
resources including its own net funds which were 
£72.3 million at 31 March 2010 and its committed banking 
facilities. The Group’s banking covenants have all been met 
comfortably during the past year and the expectation is that 
this will continue.

Company overview
Business review Financial review
 
The order book at 31 March 2010, although decreased from 
the prior year end, represented 66% of revenue in the last 
financial year and the Group’s businesses have relationships 
and cost bases in diverse geographic areas. The Group’s 
aftersales business has seen no reduction in its demand 
levels over the last twelve months.
Whilst the current volatility in financial markets has created 
general uncertainty in respect of the current economic 
outlook, the longer term nature of the Group’s business, 
taken together with its forward order book, provide a 
satisfactory level of confidence to the board in trading 
during the year ahead. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources and business demand drivers to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
No material uncertainties related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the 
Company to continue as a going concern have been 
identified by the directors. Thus they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements. 
Risks
The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties 
which could have a material impact on its long term 
performance. The directors have identified those which 
they regard as being the principal risks. Those of a financial 
nature are set out below with strategic and operational risks 
being set out on page 24.
Exposure to multi currency markets
The Group operates globally with contracts taken in various 
currencies and the majority of its earnings being generated 
outside the UK. Changes in global currency rates can 
result in changes to expected earnings and cash flows and 
movements in net asset values if unhedged and affect the 
competitive position of operating businesses. 
The Group’s policy is to fully hedge transactional currency 
exposure back to the reporting currency of the operating 
unit where practicable. Operating subsidiaries report 
these exposures as they arise and arrange hedging cover 
through the Group’s central treasury function. Competitively 
the Group has cost bases in various currencies which 
limits exposure to any one particular currency relative 
to competitors.
Counterparty failure
The Group contracts globally with both customers and 
suppliers whose performance and financial viability could 
have a material impact on the Group’s earnings. The failure 
of a key supplier or customer to meet its obligations to 
the Group could result in exposure to financial liabilities or 
impairment of the value of assets. The Group’s businesses 
regularly assess customer credit risk and payment terms are 
set accordingly including the use of bank instruments and 
credit insurance. Supplier performance is similarly monitored 
and, where possible, diversity of supply is integrated into 
product design.

Company overview
Business review Divisional review – Pump Systems
Order intake was 43.8% below 2009 at £30.6 million 
(2009: £54.4 million) as new project initiation has been 
delayed across all the key markets, both new shipbuilding 
and the offshore sector. Both the tanker and gas carrier 
newbuild markets remain subdued despite a slight 
improvement in freight rates in the latter part of the 
year. Despite this the Pump Systems business continued 
to win significant orders. Hamworthy signed a contract 
for the engine room pumps and pump room systems for 
five 30,000 dwt product carriers being built at Zhejiang 
Chenye Shipbuilding Co Ltd near Shanghai for Pertamina, 
the Indonesian state-owned oil and gas company, and an 
order was also signed with the same owner for deepwell 
cargo pumps for an LPG carrier. Orders for two 40,000 dwt 
product oil carriers with all electric pump room systems 
were received from China Ship Building Corporation.
The offshore market, particularly the FPSO segment has 
witnessed significant project initiation delays over the 
past year. Despite these delays, the centrifugal pump 
business has continued to secure contracts on a number 
of offshore projects including engine room pumps for three 
semi-submersibles at Jurong shipyard, drill ships at STX and 
Keppel Fels and an FPSO for Sevan Marine at Cosco Nantong 
shipyard. There is now some evidence that this market 
is improving with a number of offshore projects being 
contracted in the last quarter of the period.
Revenue fell by 8.9% to £76.9 million (2009: £84.4 million) 
as a reduction in volumes of deepwell pumps into the gas 
carrier market was partly offset by growth in volumes of 
both pump room systems for tankers and engine room 
pumps for offshore vessels.
Hamworthy successfully delivered its first deepwell process 
pumps for the offshore industry for installation onboard 
Total’s Pazflor FPSO. This delivery marks a strategically 
important milestone for the business in expanding its 
pump portfolio in the technically stringent offshore 
process market.
The business also delivered a total of 19 pump room 
systems during the period including three ship sets for the 
Petrobras Suezmax crude oil tankers being constructed in 
Brazil. There were over 14 engine room pump sets delivered 
for drillships and semi-submersible rigs and a similar number 
of external fire-fighting systems for offshore support vessels 
including the first deliveries of our new high volume and 
high pressure CBF-300 end suction pump developed for 
this application. The division delivered deepwell pumps for 
twelve chemical tankers at Mawei shipyard in China, three 
LPG tankers at HHI and five multigas tankers for LNG/LEG/
LPG. Aftersales activity continues to be buoyant and remains 
an important element of the business.
Operating margins were exceptionally strong, increasing to 
16.1% (2009: 14.8%) as the business benefited from the 
combined effect of its strategy to focus its engine room 
pumps on the higher value offshore segment, operational 
efficiency improvements and lower material prices.
Hamworthy’s main facility in Singapore is currently being 
expanded with completion scheduled for September 2010. 
This expansion will provide significantly improved finished 
goods handling facilities and allow the existing activities 
in Singapore that are spread across two locations to be 
consolidated onto a single site to increase efficiency and 
reduce overhead costs. The transfer of the Dolphin pump 
range from the UK facility to Singapore was completed 
where it has been integrated with the centrifugal pump 
manufacturing facility, both reducing the manufacturing 
cost of this product and improving lead times.
Investment in research and development continued and the 
division has made good progress on key projects with the 
main focus being on expanding our range of pumps offered 
to the offshore market. A range of API-610 compliant 
deepwell process pumps for FPSO applications is close to 
completion and will be released for sale in the coming year 
alongside deepwell sea water lift pumps and cargo pumps 
already offered to the offshore market.

Company overview
Business review Divisional review – Gas Systems
As expected both the gas carrier and LNG regasification 
markets remained restrained throughout the year with very 
little new order activity in either segment. As a result, order 
intake was very low at £14.5 million (2009: £45.7 million).
The smaller LPG segment is showing some early signs of 
recovery with a number of new vessel contracts being 
placed towards the end of the year. Despite the market 
weakness, Hamworthy was successful in securing its first 
cargo handling system contract for a small 5,000m
3
 fully 
pressurised LPG carrier vessel to be built in China for the 
Indonesian state-owned company, Pertamina.
Revenues fell by 31.2% to £57.6 million (2009: £83.7 million) 
as the low level of order intake impacted activity levels 
for all products.
Hamworthy successfully completed the remaining deliveries 
of LNG reliquefaction systems to all 31 Q-Flex LNG carriers. 
These large 215,000m
3
 vessels are used to transport LNG 
from Qatar to destinations around the world. Over the 
past twelve months LNG production capacity in Qatar 
has increased by 65% leading to an increase in demand 
for these vessels. The business also delivered several LPG 
cargo handling and reliquefaction systems to HHI in Korea 
and LNG fuel gas systems to two Ro-Ro vessels under 
construction for Sea Cargo in India.
Hamworthy’s pioneering floating LNG regasification 
technology entered into service onboard Golar LNG’s 
138,000m
3
 FSRU Golar Winter and successfully completed 
its regasification testing. This is a major achievement in 
bringing new technology to the market. Chartered by 
Petrobas, Golar Winter is part of an LNG import project 
in Guanabara Bay, Brazil. LNG carriers will tranship their 
cargoes to the FSRU moored to a pier at the terminal and 
then send gas to the onshore gas grid. Hamworthy also 
successfully delivered its second LNG regasification skid 
for the Neptune project located offshore Boston, US.
Operating margins decreased to 4.2% (2009: 4.4%) as a 
result of lower volumes and both integration and research 
and development costs associated with the business 
acquired from Aibel AS. In addition to those reductions 
made in March 2009, the business reduced headcount 
by a further 22% in order to match lower activity levels. 
In carrying out this restructuring the business has been 
careful to preserve key capability in order to be prepared 
for the market upturn when this arises.
The acquisition of the Technology & Products division of 
Aibel AS was successfully completed on 30 September 2009. 
This business provides leading, patented technologies used 
to increase the efficiency of oil production and to ensure the 
safe and environmentally-friendly handling of oil and gas 
during production. The business is now integrated into the 
Gas Systems division and represents continued progress in 
expanding the Group’s technology and market position in 
the offshore sector.
With this acquisition, Hamworthy has now established a 
unique position in the market to offer a range of technical 
solutions that enable our oil & gas customers to eliminate 
continuous flaring. A flare is the most visible sign of wasted 
resources and pollution from oil, gas and petrochemical 
plants. During the year we delivered such systems to 
customers in Qatar, US and the North Sea.
The division has continued to invest in new product 
development both for the LNG and LPG product ranges 
and in the newly-acquired Technology & Products business.
A new patented LPG reliquefaction solution has been 
developed that will simplify the reliquefaction system 
onboard LPG carriers whilst giving increased operational 
flexibility and reduced cargo loading time.
Development activities for the Technology & Products 
business focused on extending the range of products for the 
upstream oil and water separation market. The development 
of two new products were completed at the end of the year: 
the VIEC-LW that allows operators to achieve more efficient 
and more compact separation solutions and the i-Phase 
sensor that provides customers with accurate information 
regarding the oil/water interface in the separator.

Company overview
Business review Divisional review – Water Systems
Order intake fell by 31.7% to £36.8 million (2009: 
£53.9 million) largely due to weakness in the newbuild 
cruise ship market. Following a significant period of 
inactivity in the ordering of new cruise ships, activity 
resumed in December 2009 when Carnival Cruise Lines 
placed an order with Fincantieri shipyard in Italy. Hamworthy 
was successful in winning the contract to supply freshwater 
generating equipment for this new project. Both European 
and Far Eastern shipyards have been active in promoting 
a resurgence in cruise shipbuilding with prospects at 
advanced stages.
The retrofit market for upgrading cruise ship waste 
treatment systems has remained robust and the business 
received two significant such orders in the period, one for a 
leading US cruise operator following successful delivery and 
installation of a system for a sister ship in July 2009 and a 
similar contract for the P&O vessel, Ocean Village.
Hamworthy continued to grow market share in the broader 
marine market with its range of standard sewage treatment 
systems where demand has been driven by the introduction 
of stricter International Maritime Organization waste water 
discharge standards from 1 January 2010. In December 2009 
the business received China Classification Society Type Approval 
for this new sewage treatment plant, the only non-Chinese 
supplier to be awarded this approval thus strengthening its 
position in the world’s largest shipbuilding nation.
The high pressure air compressor business has seen positive 
order intake for rig tensioning compressors during the 
year, reflecting the ongoing strength in this part of the 
offshore market.
Revenue fell by 9.0% to £53.1 million (2009: £58.4 million) 
as a sharp fall in volumes of freshwater generator plant 
for the cruise ship market was partially offset by growth 
in volumes for advanced waste water treatment plant, 
in particular for the retrofit market.
Operating margins decreased slightly to 11.9% 
(2009: 13.2%) due to an increase in investment in 
research and development partially offset by improvements 
in operating efficiency in particular in the delivery of larger 
advanced waste water treatment projects.
In response to lower levels of order intake the business 
continued to reduce headcount across all of its operations. 
In addition to the reductions made in its German operation 
at the end of the previous financial year, headcount 
was reduced by 12% in the UK operation and further 
cost reductions were implemented in Germany through 
the short time working arrangement provided by the 
German government.
The business increased its investment in research and 
development with a particular emphasis on commercialising 
the ballast water technology acquired with the Greenship 
BV business last year. Hamworthy Greenship’s SEDINOX 
ballast water system received IMO Final Approval in July 
2009 and a full programme of testing is currently underway 
to achieve full IMO Type Approval. Interest for this new 
product has been high and we have received good levels of 
ship owner and shipyard enquiries ahead of implementation 
of the legislation by IMO member countries, expected 
during 2011.
In response to demand from the cruise ship market, 
Hamworthy developed a new Reverse Osmosis (“RO”) 
freshwater generator to complement its Multi Stage 
Flash Evaporator range. The RO unit allows freshwater 
to be generated when waste heat is not available from 
the ship’s engines. Prototype testing of the RO unit was 
successfully completed with assistance from German ship 
owner Hamburg Sud and is now available to the market. 
The system is also being offered to the offshore and 
land-based markets.

Company overview
Business review Divisional review – Inert Gas Systems
Order intake was affected by the slowdown in both the 
marine and offshore newbuild markets and fell by 27.5% 
to £17.1 million (2009: £23.6 million).
Despite conditions in the oil tanker market remaining 
subdued, Hamworthy secured a number of significant 
orders during the period. Of particular note was an 
order for ten large nitrogen generation systems worth 
over £6 million from SLS shipyard building for United 
Arab Chemical Carriers. Hamworthy was also successful 
in securing a range of orders for inert gas systems from 
Chinese shipyards for both domestic and European owners, 
continuing its previous success in China. 
The offshore market remains a key focus for the Inert Gas 
Systems business and it has witnessed an increase in activity in 
this market in recent months. A number of new prospects have 
emerged and the business is now targeting new segments of 
the market including systems for FPSO conversions. However, 
whilst a number of owners have placed contracts for new 
FPSOs, no major prospects have yet reached a stage of issuing 
contracts for inert gas original equipment. 
Order intake was particularly strong for the division’s aftersales 
products and services, continuing the growth pattern of 
recent years. Several new initiatives have been put in place 
to target future growth, amongst which long-term service 
agreements and training products are the most significant. 
Hamworthy’s new inert gas test plant which was installed 
in 2008 has facilitated training for ships’ crews, providing 
an additional source of revenue growth for aftersales.
Revenue was substantially unchanged from the prior year 
at £26.7 million (2009: £26.4 million) with the impact of 
the low order intake being mitigated by a substantial order 
book as the business entered the year. The business achieved 
a number of successful deliveries into the offshore sector 
during the period. These include systems for the USAN FPSO 
under construction at Hyundai Heavy Industries and the 
Pazflor FPSO project at Daewoo Shipbuilding & Engineering. 
Both deliveries continue a series of successful offshore 
deliveries for Total projects. Hamworthy also delivered 
an inert gas system to Modec for BP’s PSVM FPSO and 
both received and delivered a retrofit order for an inert 
gas system for installation onboard the P33 FPSO under 
operation by Petrobras of Brazil. 
Operating margins were 2.7% lower at 4.0% as increased 
research and development investment was partly offset by 
operational efficiency savings. Research and development 
investment was focused on value engineering projects for 
the existing product range and commercialising the exhaust 
gas cleaning technology acquired from Krystallon. The 
business continued to gain further benefit from moving the 
manufacture of its more sophisticated components from 
Norway to China. The transfer of contract management and 
order processing functions for marine products commenced 
during the year and will be completed in 2010. 
In September 2009 Hamworthy acquired Krystallon, 
a leading supplier of ships’ exhaust gas cleaning systems. 
Krystallon’s technology provides a cost-effective means of 
complying with the International Maritime Organization’s 
regulations for the reduction of SOx emissions from 
engines and boilers. Using seawater to remove both 
SOx and particulates from the emissions, the scrubber 
technology is well suited for marine installations and also 
presents opportunities for onshore applications near to a 
source of seawater such as in smaller scale power stations. 
The business has been successfully integrated with the 
traditional inert gas activity in Norway, further strengthening 
the market leadership position already established by 
Krystallon. As regulatory deadlines for emissions control 
draw closer and new geographical territories seek 
emissions control status, interest from ship owners is 
growing significantly. Hamworthy Krystallon’s scrubber 
product qualified as a US Environmental Protection Agency 
“Emerging Technology”, the first non-North American-based 
company to be awarded the accreditation.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Contract or product failure
The Group’s businesses contract for the supply of complex, 
highly technical and in many cases individually high value 
systems. Contracts may be long term in nature and involve 
multi-currency transactions. The delivered systems can be 
mission critical to the end user. Failure of a Group business 
in the delivery of its contractual commitments or subsequent 
failure of the product could expose the Group to unforeseen 
losses. The Group’s design, engineering and supply chain 
processes are designed to meet high quality and reliability 
standards. The businesses invest in the training of project 
personnel and conduct regular reviews of contract costs 
and progress.
Competition
The Group’s businesses compete with large well-established 
global companies, local companies and low-cost equipment 
and service providers. They do so on the basis of technical 
expertise, price, timeliness of delivery, previous experience 
and reputation for quality and reliability. To remain 
competitive the Group invests in its product development, 
manufacturing capabilities, sourcing and supply chain 
management and market access. The Group’s strategic 
objective is to hold leading market positions in its targeted 
market segments.
Market trends
50% of the Group’s revenue in the year to 31 March 2010 
came from the new shipbuilding market (2009: 58%). 
In aggregate, this market is highly cyclical and this can 
result in volatility in consolidated earnings and cash flows. 
The Group’s strategy is to target a balance of niche markets 
both within specialist ship types and outside the new 
shipbuilding cycle. Increasingly the Group is targeting the 
offshore, aftersales and retrofit markets. The share of the 
Group’s order intake from the new shipbuilding market 
was reduced to 34% during the year.
Uncertainty on timing of order placements
Several of the Group’s businesses supply equipment and 
services into large bespoke projects the exact timing of order 
placement for which can be difficult to accurately predict. 
This can result in volatility in cash flows and demand on 
resources. The Group aims to maintain a low fixed cost 
base flexible enough to accommodate this volatility. It has 
taken certain actions during the last financial year to reduce 
costs in businesses most exposed to demand volatility whilst 
maintaining core capabilities.
Acquisitions
Hamworthy continues to seek acquisition opportunities as part 
of its growth strategy. There is a risk that such acquisitions 
do not realise their expected benefits. Acquisition targets are 
assessed against the businesses’ development objectives and 
are subject to due diligence processes. The Group’s senior 
management have developed a robust integration planning 
and management process that is applied to all acquired 
businesses. The directors expect those businesses acquired 
recently to deliver the benefits originally projected for them. 
Ethics
Shortcomings in the standard by which the Group 
conducts business could lead to reputational damage, 
breach of contract or laws and financial penalty. The Group 
is committed to the highest standards of business ethics 
and has developed a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
to ensure it carries out business fairly, honestly and 
transparently. Further details are provided in the corporate 
social responsibility report on page 26.
IT security
The Group’s businesses rely extensively on access to 
electronic data, communication in electronic form and IT 
systems to manage business processes. Corruption or loss of 
this data or system access could have a detrimental effect on 
operational effectiveness and a business’ ability to comply 
with its supply obligations. The Group has a global policy on 
the back up of all business critical data, system access and 
integrity and adherence is monitored via internal auditing.
The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which could 
have a material impact on its long-term development and performance. 
The directors have identified the following as being the principal strategic 
and operational risks. In addition those risks of a financial nature are set 
out in the financial review on page 15.  Business review Governance Accounts Additional information

The Group aims to deliver long-term growth 
in shareholder value through the aggregated 
effect of its core strategies and earnings per 
share is a key indicator of this. It is also used 
as a key measure in determining vesting 
of awards under the Group’s long-term 
incentive plans to exclude gains or losses on 
fair value movements in derivatives as set out 
in note 14 to the financial statements. 
The Group aims to maintain a low fixed 
cost base, minimising the level of fixed and 
working capital required to support the 
business operations. The Group’s larger 
contracting businesses have volatile cash 
flows and this measure of the ratio of cash 
per share to earnings per share is therefore 
calculated over a rolling three year period.
Revenue visibility from the forward order 
book is both an indicator of future potential 
and allows the Group’s businesses to make 
better informed planning decisions. This 
ratio is calculated as total forward order 
book expressed as a multiple of the previous 
year’s revenue.
Developing innovative solutions to meet 
customer needs is critical to maintaining 
market leadership in the Group’s targeted 
market segments and achieving growth in 
emerging markets. The Group is therefore 
committed to ensuring that sufficient 
investment is made in research and 
development to achieve these aims.
One of the Group’s key strategic objectives 
is to increase business operating margins 
through improved operational efficiency. 
Operating margins are calculated 
as operating profits expressed as 
a percentage of revenue.
The Group is committed to continuous 
improvement of its safety performance and 
has now included the accident rate as one 
of its key performance indicators. Accident 
rate is defined as the number of reportable 
accidents which result in an absence 
of greater than three days per 100,000 
employees. The Group does not have the 
historic comparative data prior to 2008.

Our communities
The Group seeks to contribute to the communities in which 
it operates both directly and through the encouragement of 
participation by employees.
The single largest social impact is the wealth created within 
communities both economical and in development of skill 
sets and knowledge.
The Group contributes directly to charities with donations 
totalling £5,150 during the year of which £2,450 was to UK 
charities. In addition, employees give time to social causes 
which is often provided during Company working periods. 
Employee time contributed during the year is estimated 
at £20,000 with employees participating in activities such 
as educational support, social benefit projects and charity 
management. The Group made no political donations 
during the year.
The Group’s Charity Policy specifies the nature of those 
causes that the Group will support as being for the 
benefit of sick, disabled or underprivileged persons or for 
special educational causes particularly involving children 
and with links to the communities in which Hamworthy 
businesses operate.
We are very conscious of the environmental impact that our 
activities may have on the communities in which we operate 
and we constantly strive to minimise the effect of this. Business review Governance Accounts Additional information

Directors’ remuneration report
Governance	 	
AIM companies are not required to prepare a formal remuneration report in accordance with Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006 or the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. However, in line with best practice, the Company has prepared this report in order to enable 
a better understanding of directors’ remuneration. The information included in this report is unaudited except where indicated.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive directors and its members are James Wilding (chairman), 
Gordon Page and Alan Frost. The committee also consults with the Chief Executive. It meets at least twice each year and has delegated 
responsibility for making recommendations to the board regarding the remuneration and other benefits of the executive directors and senior 
executives. The full terms of reference of the committee are available on the Company’s website or on request from the Company Secretary. 
The committee has access to external remuneration data and professional advice. Following the full review of the Group’s executive 
remuneration structure in 2007, a further general review was undertaken during the year, in both instances with assistance from Kepler 
Associates. Kepler Associates do not undertake any other work for the Group. During the year ended 31 March 2010 the committee also 
reviewed the Group’s long-term incentive plans and concluded that it would continue to retain the existing structure. 
Remuneration policy 
The board’s policy is to recruit, motivate and retain senior executives of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive but responsible 
salary and benefit packages. A significant proportion of executive remuneration is performance related, both short-term and long-term. 
This includes participation in share incentive schemes which are closely aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The remuneration packages for executive directors comprise the following main elements:
• basic annual salary;
• annual bonus payments in respect of the performance of the individual and the Group calculated as a percentage of salary;
• share-based long-term incentives via participation in the Company’s Share Option Plan and Share Matching Plan; 
• retirement benefits under the Company’s defined contribution pension scheme; and
• other benefits.
The board’s intention is to combine appropriate levels of fixed pay with incentive schemes that provide executives with the ability to earn 
above median levels for true out-performance and which encourage executive co-investment in the Company’s shares.
Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed by the committee annually to take effect on 1 April. In setting basic salaries the committee assesses individual 
responsibilities, experience and performance and considers external market data. The most recent review has decided to leave basic salaries of 
executive directors and senior Group executives unchanged at 1 April 2010 except for a small number of corrections which were felt necessary 
against market comparators. The committee believes this demonstrates leadership consistent with the Group’s aim to deliver value to shareholders.
In particular, a review performed by the committee’s independent advisers, Kepler Associates, has indicated that Joe Oatley’s salary was 
in the lower quartile compared to that of the CEOs of similar companies (based on a review of pay at companies operating in the same 
business sectors as Hamworthy and of similar size to Hamworthy). Given the significant gap to market median, the committee has decided 
to increase Mr Oatley’s basic salary to market median in stages over the next two years commencing 1 April 2010. In light of the current 
challenging market conditions and the need for cost control across the business, Mr Oatley has elected to defer his salary increase for the 
year commencing 1 April 2010.
Annual bonus payments
Executive directors participate in the annual cash bonus scheme under which bonuses of between 0% and 100% of basic salary are payable. 
Bonuses are awarded following consideration of the performance of the Group, achievement of profit and cash targets and the individual’s 
contribution to that performance. The principles of this scheme also apply to annual bonuses payable to the Group’s senior executives. 
Where an executive has specific responsibility for a division or subsidiary in the Group, the performance of that business unit is considered 
along with the Group performance.
Long-term incentives
The Company operates long-term incentives for executive directors and senior executive managers in the form of the Share Option Plan and 
a complementary co-investment Share Matching Plan. These plans aim to encourage participants to contribute to the performance of the 
Company and to participate in the Company’s success along with other shareholders. 
It is intention of the board to grant share options to reward performance and align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. 
Share options are granted at the discretion of the committee. 
Exercise of options is subject to the committee’s performance criteria set at the time of the original award. For awards made since 
31 March 2007, vesting has been conditional on an equally weighted measure of earnings per share growth and total shareholder return 
(“TSR”). The minimum performance for any vesting is an earnings per share growth of CPI plus 5% and a TSR equal to the average of the 
UK Industrial Engineering and Oil and Gas indices over a three-year period. The percentage vesting rises from 25% to 100% in proportion to 
increases in these two performance measures up to earnings per share growth of CPI plus 20% and TSR of 115% of the above indices. Details 
of options held by the executive directors under the plan are given in the tables on page 35.
The Share Matching Plan is designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of the Company’s shares. Participation is by the invitation 
of the committee to executive directors and senior executive managers at the time of an award made under the Share Option Plan. Awards 
of matching shares are made to participants on the basis of one matching share for each share already owned or for every two vested but 
unexercised share options held. Vesting of awards is subject to retention of the participant’s initial qualifying holding over a three-year period 
and the meeting of performance criteria over that period. The percentage of awards vesting at the end of the three years is calculated by 
reference to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. The percentage rises proportionally from 25% for earnings per share 
growth of CPI plus 5% to 100% for earnings per share growth of CPI plus 20%. Details of options and awards held by executive directors 
under the two plans are given in the tables on page 35. Governance

Directors’ remuneration report (continued)
Retirement and other benefits
The executive directors are members of the Hamworthy Pension Scheme, a UK defined contribution scheme. The scheme provides for pension 
benefits payable on retirement and for a lump sum benefit payable to dependants in the event of death in service. 
The executive directors receive private healthcare insurance and allowances in lieu of company cars and fuel.
Service contracts
Service agreements for executive directors are for no fixed term and are terminable on twelve months’ notice from the Company or six months’ 
notice from the director. There are no provisions for compensation in the event of early termination. Should such an occasion arise, the Company 
will have due regard to all relevant circumstances including the obligation of the departing director to mitigate any loss which may be suffered.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, nor do they participate in any share option plan, long-term incentive plan or 
pension scheme. Gordon Page, Alan Frost and James Wilding have each been appointed under letters of engagement which commenced on 
21 July 2004 and which can be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice. Fees payable under the terms of their appointments 
are shown in the table below. 
Consistent with the general approach to the review of executive salaries, fees payable to non-executive directors again remained unchanged 
in the review effective 1 April 2010.
External appointments
It is the Company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold external appointments and to receive payment therefrom provided such 
appointments are agreed by the board in advance. During the year no executive director was a director of another public company.

Corporate governance
The Company is listed on AIM. Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the “Code”) that was issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 2008, the board has nevertheless resolved to do so having 
regard to the size and specific requirements of the Company. Accordingly it does not seek to comply with provisions D.1.1 and D.1.2 which 
deal with communication between major shareholders and non-executive directors including the Chairman.
The board
The Company has appointed non-executive directors to bring an independent view to the board and to provide a balance to the executive 
directors. The board of directors comprises two executive directors and three non-executive directors, one of whom is the Chairman, 
Gordon Page, and another is the senior independent director, Alan Frost.
The board considers that each of the non-executive directors is independent within the meaning of the Code.
The Chairman meets with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present at least once each year.
The board meets every two months and in advance of each regular meeting, receives a board pack with the information necessary for it to 
discharge its duties. These packs include financial data, reporting on health and safety, controls and risk assessments and detailed individual 
reports from each executive director. The board has responsibility for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets, 
major items of expenditure, acquisitions, and the directors’ report and annual and interim financial statements.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and are able to take professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against directors as well as against material loss or claims 
against the Group, and reviews the adequacy of cover regularly. The Company has also entered an agreement with each of its directors 
whereby the director is indemnified against certain liabilities to third parties which might be incurred in the course of carrying out his duties 
as a director. These arrangements constitute a qualifying third-party indemnity provision for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006.
There is a formal schedule of matters, decisions on which are reserved to the board. There is also a schedule of the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Both schedules are reviewed by the board at least annually.
During 2008, the board carried out a formal assessment of its performance and effectiveness using the services of an outside consultant 
(Edis-Bates Associates). As a result, a number of process improvements were introduced to the conduct of the board and its committees, 
and further actions are planned. It is intended to repeat this exercise during the forthcoming financial year.
Board committees
The board has established three committees: audit, remuneration and nominations. Each has written terms of delegated responsibilities and 
each is chaired by a different non-executive director. The Company Secretary is secretary to each committee. A copy of each committee’s 
terms of reference can be found at the Company’s website www.hamworthy.com. 
Audit committee
The audit committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost and James Wilding and is chaired by Alan Frost. It meets at least three times a year 
with attendance from the external auditors and internal personnel as required. The committee is responsible for: 
• ensuring that the appropriate financial reporting procedures are properly maintained and reported on;
• meeting the auditors and reviewing their reports relating to the Group’s accounts and internal control systems;
• reviewing and monitoring the independence of the external auditor and the objectives and effectiveness of the audit process;
• receiving and reviewing all internal operational review reports; and
• reviewing arrangements by which staff may in confidence raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 
otherwise and receiving and dealing with matters reported under the Group’s whistleblowing policy. 
During the year to 31 March 2010, the Group has established an internal audit function and strengthened the head office finance team. 
The internal audit function has written terms of reference, reports independently to the audit committee and has access to the Chief 
Executive. It has responsibility for a programme of reviews to cover all businesses in the Group on a rolling basis and with agreed scope 
of work. In addition, the head office finance team, led by the Group’s Finance Director, undertakes a programme of operational reviews 
at the Group’s businesses which includes internal control implementation. Both the internal audit and operational review programmes are 
integrated with the risk assessment process. 
The external auditor has carried out non-audit services to the Group during the year. The committee has considered the effect of this work 
on the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. Having regard to the scale and nature of these services, the committee has 
concluded that the auditors’ objectivity and independence are not impaired.
The committee has considered the likelihood of a withdrawal of the auditors from the market and noted that there are no contractual 
obligations to restrict the choice of external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors the committee reviewed:
• the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity;
• the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and any variations therefrom;
• the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
• the content of the external auditors’ reporting on internal control.
Following the above, the committee has recommended to the board that Deloitte LLP are re-appointed. Company overview Business review Accounts Additional information

Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost and James Wilding and is chaired by James Wilding. It meets at least 
twice a year and is responsible for reviewing the performance of the executive directors and other senior executives and for determining 
appropriate levels of remuneration. The Chief Executive is invited to participate in the committee’s deliberations on all matters except 
consideration of his own compensation. The committee’s report is set out on pages 33 to 35.
Nominations committee
The nominations committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost, James Wilding and Joe Oatley and is chaired by Gordon Page. 
The committee reviews the size, structure and composition of the board and makes recommendations on changes, as appropriate.

Internal control and risk management
The Group operates a system of internal control and intends to develop and review that system in accordance with the guidance published 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The internal control system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
It can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The board operates a formal process of risk assessment and reporting. Each major business unit carries out formal risk assessments annually 
and regularly updates these during the year. The assessments are carried out using, where appropriate, a standard categorisation of risk. 
Reports on the assessments and mitigation actions of all significant risks are provided to the board.
The Group operates an internal audit function, details of which are provided in the audit committee section of this report.
The board recognises that an essential part of its responsibility is the effective safeguarding of assets, the proper recognition of liabilities and 
the accurate reporting of results. The Group has a comprehensive system for regular reporting to the board. This includes an annual planning 
and budgeting system with budgets approved by the board. The financial reporting system compares against budget and prior year and 
reconsiders its financial year forecast on a monthly basis.
The board has established a formal policy of authorisation setting out matters which require its express approval and certain authorities 
delegated to the executive directors.
The Group operates in a multi-currency environment and is exposed to a number of foreign currency risks. The board has set a policy for 
the management and reporting of those risks and this is set out in more detail in the financial review on page 15 and in note 31 to the 
financial statements.
The Company has established a policy and share dealing code relating to dealing in the Company’s shares by directors, employees and 
connected persons.
In 2009 Hamworthy issued a group-wide Code of Ethics and Business Conduct with which all employees are required to comply. Monitoring 
of compliance is included within the internal audit programme.
The Company’s policy with regard to whistleblowing and health and safety is included in the corporate social responsibility report on pages 
26 to 29. The board of directors’ consideration of the adequacy of the Group’s resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future is set out on page 14. Governance

The names of the current directors, together with brief biographical details, are shown on pages 30 and 31. All directors served throughout 
the year and to the date of signing the financial statements.

None of the directors had a material interest in any contract of significance to which the Company, or its subsidiaries, was a party during the 
financial year. There were no contractual relationships between the non-executive directors and companies with which they are connected 
and the Hamworthy plc Group.
Other than the interests of directors disclosed in the directors’ remuneration report, the Company had been notified at 2 June 2010 of the 
following substantial interests in the Company’s issued ordinary share capital:

report on pages 33 to 35. The Company has made qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its directors which remain 
in force at the date of this report.
Financial instruments
The Group holds and utilises financial instruments in the management of its operations. It is the policy of the Group that no trading in financial 
instruments shall be undertaken. The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments relate to interest rates, liquidity risk and foreign exchange 
risk. The board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are set out in note 31 to the financial statements.
Research and development
During the year the Group expensed to the consolidated income statement, net of amounts capitalised to and amortised from intangible 
assets, £3,894,000 (2009: £2,913,000) in respect of research and development on marine and offshore products and systems.
Corporate social responsibility
Details of the Group’s policies on employment, environmental, health and safety, ethics, creditor payments, political donations and charitable 
payments are contained in the corporate responsibility report on pages 26 to 29.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors are required by the IAS Regulations 
to prepare the Group financial statement under IFRS as adopted by the European Union and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law. The financial statements are also required by law to 
be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s “Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. However, directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Governance

Disclosure of information to the auditors
In the case of each of the persons who are directors of the Company at the date when this report is approved:
(a) so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
(b) each of the directors has taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information (as defined) and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
This information is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company will take place at the Hytes Suite, Harbour Heights Hotel, Haven Road, Poole BH13 7LW 
on 15 July 2010 at 2.00pm. Full details of the resolutions to be put to the meeting are given in the notice of AGM to be found at pages 86 
and 87 of this annual report.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the 
year are shown in note 26 to the financial statements. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions either on the size of a holding 
or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.
Details of employee share schemes are also set out in note 26 to the financial statements. No person has any special rights of control over 
the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Acts 
and related legislation and observance of the Combined Code. New Articles of Association were adopted by the Company on 16 July 2009. 
The Articles may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
An ordinary resolution will be put to the shareholders at the AGM to renew the directors’ authority to issue and allot ordinary shares. 
The nominal value of ordinary shares to which this authority will be limited is £729,482.
A special resolution will also be put to the shareholders at the AGM which renews the authority of the directors to allot ordinary shares 
without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This authority is limited to 5% of the issued 
share capital.
The Companies Act 2006 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by the members in 
general meeting. A special resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM to authorise the Company to purchase up to 5% of the issued 
share capital at a maximum price 5% above the average middle-market quotation according to the London Stock Exchange for the five days 
preceding any purchase.
In all cases the above resolutions will expire at the earlier of the next AGM in 2011 or 15 months after the date of the resolutions.
Auditors
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.

Independent auditors’ report
to	 the	 members	 of	 Hamworthy	 plc
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2010 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the 
consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s (“APB’s”) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2010 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2010 and on the 
information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Notes
The maintenance and integrity of the Hamworthy plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does 
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to 
the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010
1. General information
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Hamworthy plc, a public limited company registered and domiciled in 
the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries (the “Group”). The address of the registered office is Fleets Corner, Poole BH17 0JT. The nature of the 
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out on page 53.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
2. Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted. 
Standards affecting presentation and disclosure
IAS 1 (revised 2007)  Presentation of Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) – introduces 
changes to the titles of the main financial statements, although their usage is not required, and the incorporation of 
a statement of changes in equity in to the main financial statements. In addition, the revised Standard requires the 
presentation of a third balance sheet in respect of changes in accounting policies which are applied retrospectively 
on adoption of new policies which require retrospective changes.
IFRS 8  Operating Segments (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) – a disclosure Standard but not 
one that has resulted in a redesignation of the Group’s reportable segments (see note 6). As the changes have not 
impacted on the figures in the balance sheet at 31 March 2008 nor the presentation of the segments, this has not 
been reproduced.
Amendments to IFRS 7  Financial Instruments: Disclosures (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The amendments 
to IFRS 7 expand the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk. The Group has 
elected not to provide comparative information for these expanded disclosures in the current year in accordance 
with the transitional reliefs offered in these amendments.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any 
significant impact on the accounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and 
arrangements. 
Amendment to IFRS 2  Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations. The amendments clarify the definition of vesting

Accounting standards not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following relevant Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU):
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
IFRS 3 (revised 2008)  Business Combinations (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009) – the main anticipated impact is 
the requirement that all acquisition-related costs are to be expensed and will therefore no longer form part of the 
cost of the investment. In addition, changes to contingent consideration after initial recognition at fair value will 
generally be recognised through the income statement rather than as an adjustment to goodwill.
IAS 27 (revised 2008)  Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009).
Amendments to IAS 39  Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items (effective for periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2009). The amendments provide clarification on two aspects of hedge accounting: identifying inflation 
as a hedged risk or portion; and hedging with options.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013) 
– replacement of IFRS 7 and IAS 39.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement – effective from 1 January 2011.
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners – effective from 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments – effective from 1 July 2010.
With the exception of IFRS 3 (revised 2008) for acquisition-related costs and the change in treatment of contingent consideration, the 
directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group except for additional disclosures when the relevant standards come into effect.
3. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and 
therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of derivative contracts and 
retirement benefit obligations which are held at fair value. A summary of the more important Group accounting policies, which have been 
applied consistently across the Group, is set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements represent a consolidation of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (the “Group”) as at the balance sheet 
date and for the year then ended. Subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from, or up to, the date upon which control passed, being the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee entity so 
as to obtain benefits from its activities. This is considered to be the effective date of acquisition or disposal, as appropriate. The subsidiaries 
included in the consolidated accounts and the shareholdings in those subsidiaries are listed in note 6 of the Hamworthy plc Company 
accounts on page 83. 
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within 
equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the Company shareholders’ equity.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those 
used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over fair values 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the 
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, and excluding inter-company sales.
Sales of goods and services are recognised when goods are delivered or services rendered and title has passed. For bill and hold arrangements, 
revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, typically on formal acceptance. Revenue 
from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction contracts (see below). Accounts

for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is measured using a matrix of indicators applicable to the contract 
including costs incurred, man hours expended, deliveries made and engineering work completed. Variations in contract work, claims and 
incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. Where the outcome of a construction contract 
cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be 
recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract costs 
will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Operating segments
For reporting purposes, the results of the Group are allocated between four reporting product groups. These operate in specific product and 
market areas and are described in note 6. The Group accounting policies are applied consistently across the four divisions. Head office costs 
are shown separately.
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentational currency of the parent company is UK pounds sterling. Group companies use their local currency as their 
functional currency. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, with any gains or losses being included in net profit or loss for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are 
dealt with through the Group’s reserves, until such time as the subsidiary is sold, whereupon the cumulative exchange differences relating 
to the net investment in that foreign subsidiary are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal in the income statement. However, 
cumulative exchange differences arising prior to 1 April 2005 remain in equity as permitted by IFRS 1.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see below for details of 
the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies, approved by the board of directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives.
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
any gains or losses on re-measurement are immediately recognised in the income statement. Where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge 
accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss will initially be recorded in a separate component of equity (“Hedging Reserve”).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged 
and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing 
is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that is 
either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. The associated cumulative gain or loss is 
removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the 
income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs, at which point it is recycled to the income statement. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Derivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally forward foreign exchange transactions and interest rate swaps.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or 
losses reported in the income statement.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Allowances for irrecoverable amounts are made when there is evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the amount due. 
The impairment recorded is the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the estimated future cash flows. Any impairment 
required is recorded in the income statement in administrative expenses. Company overview Business review Governance Additional information
49 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2010
Accounts
Accounts	 Notes	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements
Trade payables
Trade payables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value. 
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation in respect of a past event and it is probable that 
settlement will be required of an amount that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the Group’s liability. The estimate is discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which 
they are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the item, including the costs of acquiring or constructing the asset and costs incurred subsequently to 
add to, or enhance, the asset. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets other than land and assets under construction, at rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life at 
the following annual rates:
Freehold land nil 
Leasehold land the shorter of 20 years or the lease term 
Freehold buildings 2% – 5% 
Leasehold buildings 2% – 10% or over the life of the lease, if different 
Plant and equipment  20% – 33% 
Assets under construction  nil
Depreciation on assets under construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted where necessary. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 2005 has been 
retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under 
UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or where there are indications that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
on a pro-rata basis.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS has been eliminated through reserves on transition.
Research and development expenditure – internally generated
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are written off as incurred unless it can be demonstrated that the following conditions for capitalisation, in accordance 
with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), are met:
• the development costs are separately identifiable;
• the development costs can be measured reliably;
• management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and commercial viability of the project; and
• it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits.
Any subsequent costs are capitalised as intangible assets until the intangible asset is readily available for production, and amortised on 
a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group, other than goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised over the asset’s estimated useful life on a straight-line basis as follows:
Software three to five years 
Development costs  three years 
Customer contracts  one to three years 
Customer relationships  life of the customer relationship – typically ten years 
Technology-based assets life of the product – typically ten years Accounts

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of fixed tangible assets and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
to determine the extent of any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. Value in use is calculated using cash flow projections for the asset (or group of assets where cash flows are not identifiable for specific 
assets) discounted at the Group’s cost of capital.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the income statement, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before finance income or finance expense. 
Retirement benefit costs
The Company provides pension arrangements to the majority of full-time UK employees through a money purchase (defined contribution) 
scheme, and similar schemes exist across other countries in which the Group operates, except Norway and Germany. Contributions and 
pension costs are based on pensionable salary and are charged as an expense as they fall due. The Group has no further payment obligations 
once the contributions have been paid.
Employees in Norway and Germany participate in funded defined benefit pension plans. The cost of benefits accruing during the year 
in respect of current and past service is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method and is charged against operating profit. 
The expected return on the scheme’s assets and the change in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities arising from the passage of time 
are included in other finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The balance sheet includes the surplus/deficit in the scheme, taking assets at their year-end market values and liabilities at their actuarially 
calculated values discounted at year-end AA corporate bond interest rates.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the 
Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs 
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the 
FIFO method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Taxation including deferred tax
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. In principle, deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets or liabilities in a transaction that affect neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
Share-based payment
The Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans through two share option schemes. The fair value of options awarded 
is calculated at the time of grant and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an 
estimate of the number of options that will actually vest. The Group has adopted a Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options. 
The Group has also introduced a complimentary co-investment Share Matching Plan, details of which are given in note 26. The fair value of 
these matching shares are calculated at the date of award based upon the market value of the issued shares and are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number of options that will actually vest.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the same period in which they are fully authorised. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements, and the preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Revenue and margin recognition for long-term contracts
The Group derives revenue and margin from long-term contracts, most of which are normally fixed-price and which may extend for a 
significant period of time. While long-term contracts are in progress, revenue is recognised based on their expected profitability and extent of 
completion. Profit is only taken once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably, however unforeseen future events may adversely 
impact the accuracy of those estimates. Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is 
recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Further details are given in note 19.
Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes that provide benefits to a number of current and former employees. The value of the 
deficit is particularly sensitive to the market value of the scheme’s assets, and its liabilities are particularly sensitive to discount rates and 
actuarial assumptions related to mortality. Further details are given in note 28.
Current and deferred taxation
Legislation related to taxation is complex and its impact on the Group may be uncertain. In preparing the Group’s financial statements, 
management estimates its taxation liability having taken appropriate professional advice. Determination of an agreed amount of taxation 
payable may take several years, and the final amounts paid may differ from the liabilities recorded in these financial statements.
The recognition of assets and liabilities related to deferred taxation also requires the exercise of management judgement, in particular the 
extent to which assets should be recognised.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected 
future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows. Further details are given in note 16. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2010 was £17,133,000 (2009: £13,458,000).
Provisions for contract liabilities
The Group makes provision for liabilities related to contracts, including claims made against the Group by a contracting party, in accordance 
with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. At each balance sheet date the Group recognises such liabilities at the 
directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the liability. Further details are given in note 24.
Fair value of derivatives
The directors use their judgement in selecting appropriate valuation techniques for financial instruments. Valuation techniques commonly 
used by market practitioners are applied. Further details are given in note 31.
Financial risk management 
Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. These risks 
are managed centrally by the Group’s treasury function in accordance with board-approved objectives, policies and authorities. There are 
internal review procedures to ensure local compliance.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
business review on pages 6 to 29. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review on pages 12 to 15. In addition, these notes include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital and its financial risk management objectives. Details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk are set out in note 31.
The Group has available to it considerable financial resources, including its own net funds which were £72.3 million at 31 March 2010 and 
its committed banking facilities. The Group’s banking covenants have all been met comfortably during the past year and the expectation is 
that this will continue. 
The order book at 31 March 2010, although decreased from the prior year end, represented 66% of revenue in the last financial year and the 
Group’s businesses have relationships and cost bases in diverse geographic areas. The Group’s Aftersales business has seen no reduction in its 
demand levels over the last twelve months.
Whilst the current volatility in financial markets has created general uncertainty in respect of the current economic outlook, the longer-term 
nature of the Group’s business, taken together with its forward order book, provide a satisfactory level of confidence to the board in trading 
during the year ahead. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources and business demand drivers to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. No material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about the ability 
of the Company to continue as a going concern have been identified by the directors. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the financial statements.  Accounts

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Financial risk management (continued) 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions. The principal exposures arise 
in respect of variations in the cross rates between sterling, euro, US dollar, Singapore dollar, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The Group 
seeks to hedge all its transactional currency exposures through the use of forward currency contracts. The Group does not hedge balance 
sheet or income and expenditure translation exposures arising on consolidation, or undertake trading in financial instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its term loan borrowings which are detailed in note 31. 
Approximately 60% of borrowings at 31 March 2010 are subject to interest rate swap arrangements which have the effect of fixing interest 
rates at 3.35% p.a. for the term of the loan.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s cash flows and funds are managed in a central treasury function under a cash pooling structure. The Group maintains the most 
appropriate mix of short-, medium- and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders. Details of available facilities are set out in note 23.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a number of companies across the world. 
Policies are maintained to ensure that the Group makes sales to customers with appropriate credit history. Letters of credit or other 
appropriate instruments are put in place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary.
The Group is also subject to credit risk on counterparties to its liquid funds and its derivative financial instruments which it controls by only 
dealing with highly-rated counterparties. The ratings are regularly monitored.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return 
to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity structure. The capital structure of the Group consists of borrowings 
(disclosed in note 23), cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves 
and retained earnings as disclosed in note 26 and the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The Group balances its overall capital 
structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues, and the use of debt facilities.
Details of the Group’s policy regarding employee share ownership and the Group’s share option programme can be found in the directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 33 to 35.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market through an employee benefit trust, and these own shares are intended 
to be used for issuing shares under the Group’s Share Co-investment Incentive Plan. The timing of these purchases is at the discretion of the 
trustees. The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are 
subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
5. Revenue 
The analysis of the Group’s revenue is as follows:
      2010 2009
      £’000 £’000
Sale of goods and services     134,404 159,367
Revenue from construction contracts     79,926 93,467
      214,330 252,834
Finance income     1,392 2,171
      215,722 255,005
Group service revenue is assessed as being incidental to sales of goods and is not considered to be a material component of revenue.

6. Business and geographical segments
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 April 2009. This requires operating segments to be identified on the 
basis of internal reporting that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive and the executive board to allocate resources to the segments and 
to assess their performance. This contrasts with the previous standard, IAS 14 Segmental Reporting, which required the identification of two 
specific sets of segments – business and geographical.
Operating segments
For management purposes, the Group is organised into four operating divisions – Pump Systems, Gas Systems, Water Systems and Inert Gas 
Systems. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its segment information.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows:
• the Pump Systems business designs and manufactures a broad range of centrifugal and long-shaft deepwell pumps, selling to the marine 
and offshore markets. Hamworthy has market-leading positions in a number of segments within these markets including cargo pumps 
for liquefied gas carriers and engine room pumps for the offshore market. The business has three facilities based in Denmark, Singapore 
and the UK;
• the Gas Systems business provides a range of liquefaction and regasification systems to the LNG and LPG markets. The business has 
a leading position in the larger LPG and LNG carrier segment for reliquefaction systems and the relatively new market for floating 
regasification systems. The recent acquisition of the Technology & Products business of Aibel AS has extended the business’ range 
of products for the upstream oil & gas market;
• the Water Systems business is the market leader in waste water treatment systems for the cruise ship and commercial marine markets 
and freshwater generation systems for the cruise ship market. The business also supplies steam condensers to the small-scale power 
station market and high-pressure air compressors to the niche offshore drill rig and CNG markets. The business has operations in the UK, 
Germany and China; and
• Hamworthy is a market leader in inert gas systems for the marine and offshore markets. The systems are used to allow safe offloading 
of oil and gas cargoes from oil tankers, gas carriers and FPSOs in line with international safety legislation. With the recent acquisition 
of Krystallon, Hamworthy has established a leading position in the developing environmental market of marine exhaust gas sulphur

Unrealised gains or losses arise due to movements in fair value on derivative instruments used for foreign exchange hedging but deemed 
to be ineffective under IFRS hedge accounting rules. The gain in the current year and loss in the prior year relates primarily to a specific 
option derivative whose structure does not qualify for hedge accounting but does nonetheless represent a commercially effective 
hedging instrument.

The directors propose the payment of a final dividend of 5.97p per share, amounting to £2,701,176 in respect of the year to 31 March 2010 
(2009: 5.68p per share, amounting to £2,579,308). The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. If authorised, it will be paid on 22 July 2010 to shareholders 
who are on the register of members as at 18 June 2010.
14. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares where, on options granted, exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year. 
Those options granted which were not dilutive are shown in note 26 on page 67.
The measures of underlying earnings per share are calculated using earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders, adjusted to eliminate the 
mark-to-market of currency derivatives as adjusted throughout these financial statements for underlying earnings.
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:
  Year ended 31 March 2010  Year ended 31 March 2009

The impairment loss on software and certain tangible assets is in respect of under-utilised assets in the Gas Systems division following its 
restructuring programme.
Values ascribed to development costs represent the directly attributable costs of internally-generated development knowledge from the point 
at which an individual project meets the requirements for capitalisation until it is available for utilisation in the business. This is invariably a 
relatively short period of time, resulting in minimal costs being incurred that qualify for capitalisation.
Technology-based assets and customer contracts are recognised at fair value to purchase or acquire and are amortised over their estimated 
useful lives. Fair values of acquired intangible fixed assets have been assessed by reference to the future estimated cash flows arising from 
the application of assets, discounted at an appropriate rate to present value, or by reference to the amount that would have been paid in 
an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Software and development costs are recognised at cost.
The values ascribed to the assets of Greenship BV, acquired in March 2009, were provisional and therefore adjustments have been made to 
these assets in the current period. Accounts

Hamworthy Krystallon Ltd     1,254 —
Hamworthy Technology & Products AS     2,225 —
      17,133 13,458
For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations. 
No impairment charge was required in the year (2009: £nil) and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date was £nil (2009: £nil). 
The key assumptions used in the calculations were:
• the forecast operating cash flows for the next five years based on approved budgets and plans. These budgets and plans are based on 
past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU, taking into account the current economic climate and 
forecast assumptions around the relevant product markets;
• an estimate of the long-term effective tax rate for the CGU of 28%; and
• an estimate of the long-term growth rate for the CGU of 0%.
The resulting cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 15.3% (2009: 15.3%).
Sensitivity analysis has determined that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used will result in significant impairment 
and that there is sufficient headroom in all of the key assumptions before the carrying value becomes impaired. For instance, the discount 
rate would have to more than double to result in an impairment charge for any of the four largest CGUs that comprise nearly 75% of the 
goodwill carrying value.

The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a number of companies across the world. 
Policies are maintained to ensure that the Group enters in to sales contracts with customers that are tailored to their respective credit 
rating. Advance payments, payments on delivery, letters of credit or other appropriate instruments are used to manage and reduce credit 
risk as appropriate. The credit quality of the Group’s trade receivables is considered by management to be very good as a high proportion 
of customers are large global companies with whom the Group trades on a long-term basis. This is further evidenced by the low rates of 
impairment provided and amounts written off.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 44 days. No interest is charged on the receivables balances. The Group does not hold 
any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances nor does it have the legal right of offset with any amounts owed by the 
Group to the receivables counterparty.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. At the reporting date the principal financial assets were:

At 31 March 2010 the Group held committed revolving credit facilities of £60 million for documentary credits, guarantees and ancillaries 
(2009: £60 million) at Barclays Bank plc. This facility provides for the limit to rise to £80 million upon meeting certain reductions in the 
mark-to-market amounts of the Group’s extant foreign exchange hedging instruments. In addition, the Group has uncommitted overdraft 
and ancillary facilities of £3.0 million (2009: £2.5 million) held with Den Danske Bank AS, a term loan of £0.71 million (2009: £0.85 million) 
with Dresdner Bank AG and overdraft and ancillary facilities totalling £10.7 million (2009: £12.5 million) with Dresdner Bank AG, 
HSH Nordbank AG and DBV-Winterthur.
All facilities with Barclays Bank plc are secured by a fixed charge over the Group’s assets under the terms of a debenture. The term loan held 
with Dresdner Bank AG is secured by a mortgage over freehold property owned by Hamworthy Serck Como GmbH. Interest is charged at 
LIBOR plus a margin but is then hedged to a fixed rate of 3.35%. The Dresdner Bank loan is being repaid by variable instalments until 2018.
Of the Group’s borrowings, £0.7 million is denominated in euros and £0.5 million is denominated in Danish kroner (2009: £1.2 million euro; 
£0.5 million Danish kroner). All other borrowings are denominated in sterling.

Warranties are routinely given to customers in respect of certain products. Any costs in meeting claims, for which the warranty provision 
has been established, are expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date. Contract provisions are made where, based 
upon management’s best estimate, the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are less than the cost of meeting those contract 
obligations. The periods over which these are expected to unwind varies by contract but are expected to unwind between 2011 and 2012.
Redundancy provisions of £939,000 (2009: £837,000) relate to the estimated costs of restructuring certain of the Group’s activities. 
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred in the year ended 31 March 2011. Employment provisions are local statutory employment 
provisions required in certain overseas jurisdictions payable when employees leave the Group. Accounts

profit streams against which these losses may be offset. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

remaining contractual life of 8.1 years (2009: 8.4 years). During the year options were granted on 7 July 2009 with an estimated fair value 
of 64p per share and £335,125 in aggregate, on 11 September 2009 with an estimated fair value of 83p per share and £5,250 in aggregate 
and on 8 February 2010 with an estimated fair value of 83p per share and £13,125 in aggregate. In the prior year options were granted on 
23 June 2008 with an estimated fair value of 138p per share and £305,127 in aggregate.
There were no options exercised in the current year. In respect of options exercised during the prior year, the weighted average share price at the 
date of exercise was 536.2p per share.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows:  
      2010 2009
Weighted average share price     418p 515p

Expected life     3.5 years 3.5 years
Risk-free rate     4.13% 5.19%
Expected dividend yield     1.74% 1.77%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the actual volatility of the Group’s share price since flotation in July 2004. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £284,000 and £394,000 related to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions in 2010 and 
2009 respectively.
Matching shares
Hamworthy plc operates a complimentary co-investment Share Matching Plan, designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of 
Hamworthy shares by relevant personnel. Participation is by invitation of the remuneration committee on grant award and is expected to be 
the executive managers of the Group. Participants are awarded matching ordinary shares in Hamworthy plc, up to a limit related to basic 
annual salary, in the ratio of:
• one for every one share already beneficially owned; and
• one for every two vested but unexercised share options held.
Further details are given in the directors’ remuneration report on page 33. The number of shares acquired by the trust during the 
year was £nil (2009: 97,973 at a total cost of £398,000). The number of shares held by the trust at 31 March 2010 was 164,523 
(31 March 2009: 164,523).

At the balance sheet date the Group had outstanding commitments for minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating 
leases, which expire as follows:
  Land and buildings  Plant and machinery
    2010 2009 2010 2009
    £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

Expiring after five years   — 424 — —
    6,761 7,030 333 450
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and operating machinery. Leases are 
typically negotiated for an average period of three years in the case of plant and machinery, five years in the case of buildings and with 
a lease of land in Singapore for 30 years.
28. Retirement benefit schemes 
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes in Norway. The most recent valuations of plan assets and the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation were carried out as at 31 March 2010 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 
    At 31 March
      2010 2009
Discount rate     4.50% 3.80%
Rate of increase in salaries     4.50% 4.25%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment     1.40% 2.00%
Expected return on scheme assets     5.70% 5.80%
Inflation assumption     2.25% 2.25%
Average life expectancy:
 Male     84.7 years 84.7 years
 Female     87.1 years 87.1 years
The mortality assumptions used were the K2005 mortality tables, commonly used in many Norwegian pension scheme valuations.
The sensitivity of the principal assumption of the discount rate used to measure the scheme liabilities is as follows:
Discount rate – decrease by 0.5% to 4.0% scheme liabilities increase by £0.91 million (6.9%) 
Discount rate – increase by 0.5% to 5.0% scheme liabilities decrease by £0.74 million (5.7%)
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Germany through Hamworthy Serck Como GmbH. A valuation of plan 
assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out as at 31 March 2010 by an independent qualified actuary. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected 
unit credit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were:  
    At 31 March
      2010 2009
Discount rate     4.80% 5.70%
Rate of increase in salaries     n/a 3.00%

Expected return on scheme assets     4.00% 4.00%
Inflation assumption     2.00% 2.00%
The mortality assumptions used were in accordance with the “Richttafeln 2005 G” reference tables published by Dr. Klaus Heubeck.
The sensitivity of the principal assumption of the discount rate used to measure the scheme liabilities is as follows:
Discount rate – decrease by 0.5% to 4.30% scheme liabilities increase by £0.15 million (9.4%) 
Discount rate – increase by 0.5% to 5.30% scheme liabilities decrease by £0.15 million (9.4%) Accounts

Of the charge for the year, £1,975,000 (2009: £1,257,000) has been included in administrative expenses.
The expected rates of return are determined by reference to relevant published indices. The overall expected rate of return is calculated 
by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balances in the schemes’ investment portfolios. The actual return on 
scheme assets was a gain of £302,000 (2009: loss of £128,000). 
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows:
      2010 2009

The assets of the Norwegian schemes are invested through an insurance company which was unable to provide an accurate breakdown of the 
assets into differing classes. The asset of the German scheme is a prepaid life assurance policy maturing on the retirement date of members.

31. Financial instruments
The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk. The board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below:
Interest risk and sensitivity
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, term loans and overdraft facilities held by subsidiaries. The Group’s 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its cash resources which are invested at variable rates. Its borrowings 
under a term loan facility are subject to an interest rate swap agreement which has the effect of fixing the interest payable at 3.35% per 
annum for the term of the loan. A 10% increase in interest rates throughout the year would have increased profit after tax by £0.1 million 
(2009: £0.1 million) with an equal but opposite effect for a fall in interest rates, all other variables remaining constant.
Liquidity risk
The Group has a strong cash flow and funds generated from operations are managed in a central treasury function under a cash pooling 
structure. The Group maintains the most appropriate mix of short-, medium- and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities

Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
The currencies most important to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were those which are typically linked by monetary 
policy at fixed exchange rates to the euro as well as US dollars, sterling, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollars and Chinese renminbi. The 
Group seeks to hedge all its transactional currency exposures arising from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than 
the unit’s functional currency through the use of forward contracts. The notional value of forward exchange contracts in the Group’s main 
operating currencies at the balance sheet date were as follows:
   USD EUR  NOK SGD DKK 
2010  ‘000 ‘000 ‘000 ‘000 ‘000

The Group does not hedge balance sheet translation exposures and therefore any foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these 
assets and liabilities on consolidation are taken to the Group reserves.
The Group’s operating units hold monetary assets and monetary liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the operating 
currency of the operating unit involved. These balances are retranslated at the balance sheet date. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency 
risk for these balances for its most important currencies at the balance sheet date was as follows

Sensitivity analysis  
A 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies at 31 March would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit by the amounts 
shown below, assuming all other variables remained constant:
  Equity  Profit after taxation
    2010 2009 2010 2009
    £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
US dollar   (98) (87) (6) 11

Singapore dollar   (1,789) (1,401) (476) (264)
Chinese renminbi   (860) (702) (116) (141)
An equal but opposite effect would have been the impact of a 10% weakening of sterling.
Credit risk
Exposure to credit risk
The principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit 
ratings awarded by international credit rating agencies and these ratings are constantly monitored and are currently all rated at S&P A rating 
or above.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk on trade and other receivables is set out in note 20.
Derivatives and financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade 
debtors and trade creditors that arise from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s 
operations. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the policy of the Group that no trading in financial instruments shall 
be undertaken.
Interest rate swap
The Group’s borrowings under a term loan facility are subject to an interest rate swap agreement which has the effect of fixing the interest 
payable at 3.35% per annum for the term of the loan.
Currency derivatives
Currency derivatives are used to hedge future transactions and cash flows, and the Group’s resultant exposure to movements in foreign 
exchange rates. These are primarily in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and options, and are denominated in the currencies 
of the Group’s principal operating markets. At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange 
contracts to which the Group is committed, based upon contractual undiscounted cash flows, are as follows:
      2010 2009
      £’000 £’000
Foreign currency options     — 35,356
Commodity swaps     514 —
Forward foreign exchange contracts     143,494 269,083
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. The change in fair values of effective hedges amounted to a gain of £11,467,000 (2009: loss 
of £19,519,000). The Group recognised total gains of £762,000 (2009: £2,193,000) related to ineffective hedging transactions.

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments grouped into levels 1 to 3 based upon the degree to which the fair value 
is observable:
• level 1 – fair values are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2 – fair values are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• level 3 – fair values are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

32. Ultimate parent company
The ultimate parent company of the Group is Hamworthy plc. There were no shareholders with overall control of the Company as at 
31 March 2010 or 31 March 2009.
33. Contingent liabilities
At 31 March 2010 contingent liabilities exist in respect of bank guarantees in relation to performance bonds totalling £24,493,000 
(2009: £26,827,000). All of these guarantees mature within two years from the balance sheet date. As the conditions of these guarantees 
are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability provision has been made at the year end.
The Group routinely enters into a range of contractual arrangements in the ordinary course of events which can give rise to claims or 
potential litigation against Group companies. It is the Group’s policy to make specific provisions at the balance sheet date for all liabilities 
including warranty costs and guarantees which, in the opinion of the directors, are expected to result in a significant loss. The directors have 
reviewed the open claims and pending litigation against the Group at the year end and concluded that no material unprovided loss is likely 
to accrue to the Group from any such unprovided claims.
34. Acquisition of subsidiaries
On 29 September 2009 the Group acquired the business and assets of Krystallon Limited for an initial cash consideration of £0.95 million 
payable immediately plus £0.85 million payable upon satisfactory completion of an internal testing programme. Further payments may 
become due dependent on future profit performance up to the period ending 31 March 2015. The directors’ best estimate of the amount 
likely to be paid is £3.0 million and this is recognised as performance-related contingent deferred consideration.
Based in the UK, Krystallon is a leading supplier of marine exhaust sulphur emissions reduction technology. Krystallon’s technology 
provides a cost-effective means of complying with the International Maritime Organization’s regulations for the reduction of marine 
exhaust gas emissions.
On 30 September 2009 the Group acquired the business and assets of the Technology & Products division of Aibel AS. This was acquired for 
an initial cash consideration of £3.7 million paid on completion with a further sum payable upon the final agreement of net assets acquired 
(currently expected to be £0.4 million) and an additional amount of up to £2.1 million payable upon achievement of certain performance 
criteria over the next two years. The directors’ best estimate of the additional amount likely to be paid is £nil.
The Technology & Products business provides leading technologies to the offshore oil & gas market that are used to increase the efficiency 
of oil production and ensure the safe handling of cargoes.
Both transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting, with the assets being acquired by Hamworthy plc and 
two new subsidiaries within the Group, Hamworthy Krystallon Limited and Hamworthy Technology & Products AS.

Accounts	 Notes	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Aibel Technology and Products is attributable to the anticipated future operating synergies derived 
from integration in to the Group and the anticipated future profits resulting from access to new markets. The goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of Krystallon Limited is attributable to the anticipated future profits resulting from access to new markets.
Hamworthy Technology & Products AS contributed £4,100,000 to revenue and a loss of £1,200,000 to the Group’s profit before tax for the 
period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. Hamworthy Krystallon Limited contributed £nil to revenue and a loss of 
£421,000 to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of the Technology & Products business had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the 
period would have been £217,448,000. Due to the lack of reliable data it has not been possible to determine with reasonable accuracy 
the impact on the business cost base had it been absorbed in to the Hamworthy Group from 1 April 2009 and therefore the impact on the 
Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent cannot be quantified.
If the acquisition of Krystallon Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have 
been £214,330,000 and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £14,791,000.
35. Related party transactions
Transactions between Group undertakings, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

Independent auditors’ report
to	 the	 members	 of	 Hamworthy	 plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2010 which comprise the 
parent company balance sheet, the parent company statement of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes 1 to 16. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (“APB’s”) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2010;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2010.

Notes
The maintenance and integrity of the Hamworthy plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does 
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to 
the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Accounting policies
Statement of accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and, except for changes 
noted below, the preceding period, is set out below.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets 
at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life at the 
following annual rates:
Plant, machinery and equipment 20% – 33%
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. 
Taxation
Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at 
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences 
can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on 
a non-discounted basis.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Pension scheme arrangements
The Company provides pension arrangements to the majority of full-time UK employees through a money purchase scheme, operated by 
Barnett Waddingham LLP . Contributions and pension costs are based on pensionable salary and are recorded in the period in which they fall.
Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or at a contracted 
rate if applicable. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an 
exchange gain/loss in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of swap agreements are recognised in the interest payable/receivable charge/credit on an accruals 
basis. The interest differential amounts due to/from the counterparty on such agreements are accrued until the settlement date and are 
recognised as an adjustment to interest expense.
Share-based payment
The Company operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans through two share option schemes. The fair value of options awarded 
is calculated at the time of grant and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate 
of the number of options that will actually vest. The Group has adopted a Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options. The 
Company also participates in the Group’s complimentary co-investment Share Matching Plan, details of which are given in note 26 to the 
Group financial statements. The fair value of these matching shares is calculated at the date of award based upon the market value of the 
issued shares and are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number 
of options that will actually vest.
Related party transactions and cash flow statement
The Company is the ultimate parent undertaking of the Hamworthy Group and is therefore included in the consolidated financial statements 
of that Group, which are publicly available. Consequently the Company has taken advantage of the exemptions from preparing a cash flow 
statement under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 (Revised 1996): Cash Flow Statements, and the exemptions under Financial 
Reporting Standard 8: Related Party Disclosures relating to the disclosure of transactions with other Group companies. Company overview Business review Governance Additional information

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
Company’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings at the date of acquisition, and is 
capitalised and written off on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life. Provision is made for impairment.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Company, other than goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised over the asset’s estimated useful life on a straight-line basis as follows:
Technology-based assets life of the product – typically ten years

Additional	 information	 Notice	 of	 Annual	 General	 Meeting
Notes
1. A form of proxy is enclosed for use by shareholders and, if appropriate, must be deposited with the Company’s registrars, 
Capita Registrars (PXS), The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4TU, not less than 48 hours before the time of the Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”). Appointment of a proxy does not preclude a shareholder from attending the AGM and voting in person.
2. A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the Company) to 
attend and speak at the AGM and to vote on his or her behalf whether by show of hands or on a poll. A member can appoint more 
than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed by a separate form of proxy and to exercise the rights 
attaching to different shares held by him or her. In order to be valid, an appointment of proxy (together with any authority under which 
it is executed or a copy of the authority certified notarially) must be returned by one of the following methods:
• in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand to the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars (PXS), The Registry, 34 Beckenham 
Road, Beckenham BR3 4TU; or
• in the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the procedures set 
out below;
and in each case must be received by the Company not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the 
AGM and any adjournment thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST 
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment, or instruction, made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (“EUI”) specifications and must contain 
the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST manual. The message, regardless of whether it relates to the 
appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given previously to the appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be 
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA 10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in 
the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to 
the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the 
manner described by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 
35(5) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings 
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy instructions. It is therefore the responsibility of the CREST 
member concerned to take (or, if a CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure 
that the message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where 
applicable their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
3. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, in order to be able to attend and vote at the AGM or 
any adjourned meeting (and also for the purpose of calculating how many votes a person may cast), a person must have his/her name 
entered on the register of members of the Company by 6.00pm on 13 July 2010 (or 6.00pm on the date two days before any adjourned 
meeting). Changes to entries on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend or vote at the meeting.
4. The following documents are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on any 
weekday and will be available at the place of the AGM from at least 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the meeting:
(a) directors’ service contracts
5. Any electronic communication received by the Company, including the lodgement of an electronic proxy form, that is found to contain 
any virus will not be accepted.
6. A map showing the location of the Harbour Heights Hotel can be found at the Company’s website, www.hamworthy.com/agmmap

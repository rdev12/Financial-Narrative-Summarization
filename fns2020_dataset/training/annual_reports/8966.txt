Overview
The year to 30 June 2013 has been 
one of K3’s toughest and the results 
r eflec t	the	challenges	of	w eak	mar kets ,	
especially	r etail ,	and	our	sig nifican t	
programme of investment to deliver a 
major	new	M icr osof t - c er tified	D ynamics	
AX solution, Gemstone, for the retail 
mar ket.	 W e	r emain	v er y	ex cit ed	about	
the sales potential of Gemstone, both 
in	the	UK	and	thr ough	our	in t er na tional	
reseller channel. 
W hile 	 the 	 Gr oup ’ s 	 financial 	 r esults 	 ar e

y ear 	 ended 	 v er y 	 enc our ag ingly . 	 I n	
par ticular , 	 ha ving 	 made 	 the 	 first 	 r elease	
of Gemstone functionality in the second 
half, we secured a number of initial 
or ders 	 with 	 some 	 high 	 pr ofile 	 r etailers	
and we now have a growing base of 
blue chip retail customers who will be 
v aluable 	 r ef er enc e 	 sit es 	 f or 	 Gemst one . 	 I n	
addition 	 t o 	 capitalised 	 c osts 	 of 	 £1.45m,	
our investment in Gemstone, including 
sales, deployment and support teams, 
amounted to £2.2m over the year. We will 
be 	 mak ing 	 fur ther 	 r eleases 	 of 	 Gemst one	
functionality later in 2013, with full 
product completion expected around 
mid 	 2014. 	 T her e 	 is 	 a 	 str ong 	 pipeline 	 of	
interest and we are very encouraged 
about the opportunities. More generally, 
there are signs that retailers are returning 
to spending on technology. This is also 
illustr a t ed 	 in 	 the 	 marked 	 upturn 	 in 	 new	
wins 	 t o w ar ds 	 the 	 close 	 of 	 the 	 financial	
y ear 	 f or 	 our 	 established 	 M icr osof t 	 NA V	
retail solution. The total value of the 
major new order wins secured in the year 
across the Group was £11.56m (2012: 
£12.94m), 	 with 	 some 	 70% 	 b y 	 v alue ,	
£8.13m, signed in the second half. This 
included 	 £4.2m 	 of 	 r etail 	 or ders 	 in 	 the	
f our th 	 quar t er , 	 which 	 will 	 benefit 	 the	
M icr osof t 	 UK 	 Division ’ s 	 per f ormanc e 	 in	
the 	 new 	 financial 	 y ear .	
Our investment in our Managed Services 
Division 	 also 	 c on tinued 	 o v er 	 the 	 y ear	
and is now substantially concluded. 
We completed the development of our 
hosting platforms and now also offer a 
range of hosting services to cater for the 
needs of both smaller and large global 
customers. The long term opportunity 
to build substantial recurring revenues 
from this activity remains and we expect 
any upturn in demand across our other 
Divisions , 	 especially 	 M icr osof t 	 UK , 	 t o	
benefit 	 the 	 Division.	
Our	SY SPRO	and	Sage	Division	
continued to generate high levels of 
recurring income and cash, and our 
SY SPRO	ac tivities	deliv er ed	a	v er y	
encouraging performance. A new 
r elease	of	SY SPRO	and	Sage ’ s	X3	pr oduc t	
should help to stimulate growth in the 
new	financial	y ear .	
A major strength of the business 
remains its high levels of recurring 
revenues, from licence renewals and 
support contracts, and K3 generated 
appr o xima t ely	£34.54m	of	r ecur r ing

Financial Results
Revenues for the year ended 30 June 
2013 	 declined 	 b y 	 7% 	 t o 	 £63.51m 	 (2012:	
£67.96m), 	 lar gely 	 r eflecting 	 the 	 w eak

As expected, the Group incurred

of £2.2m in building our Gemstone 
sales, deployment and support teams in 
anticipation of demand that, late in the 
year, started to be realised.
We incurred exceptional costs of £0.73m

restructuring of the acquisitions we 
made in prior years.

W e	made	the	first	c ommer cial	r elease	of

important reference sites which helped

T he 	 Micr osoft 	 UK 	 Division ’ s 	 disappoin ting	
results for the year reflect the 
combination of very tough conditions in 
the retail sector and the impact of Project 
G emst one . 	 T he 	 first 	 half 	 w as 	 sev er ely

we signed 59 major new orders, worth 
£6.5m (2012: 28 deals, £6.7m) but more 
sig nifican tly 	 £4.2m 	 of 	 these 	 deals 	 w er e 	
ag r eed 	 in 	 the 	 final 	 quar t er 	 of 	 the 	 y ear 	
and 	 included 	 14 	 major 	 or ders 	 in 	 UK 	 R etail	
which 	 will 	 help 	 t o 	 under pin 	 a 	 sig nifican t 	
impr o v emen t 	 in 	 2014.	
Revenues decreased to £18.86m (2012: 
£24.92m),	and	the	adjust ed	loss	fr om	
operations

	w as	£1.66m	(2012:	pr ofit	
of £2.22m). The loss in the second half 
r educ ed	t o	£0.40m	against	£1.26m	
in	the	first	half ,	sho wing	a	sig nifican t	
turnaround. Margins for the twelve 
mon ths	 f ell	 b y	 9%	 t o	 44%	 r eflec ting	 both	
low level of services revenues in the year 
(the result of expected deals not signing) 
and our investment in the delivery 
resource. Recurring income decreased 
b y	£1.87m	(18%)	which	mainly	r eflec t ed	
some customers reducing spend on 
product support and fewer multi-year 
deals arising on new business.
As mentioned earlier, our new AX retail 
solution, Gemstone, now has customer 
reference sites, and £1.0m of the £5.0m 
new Retail business wins signed in the 
year were for AX solutions based on 
Gemstone functionality. A number of 
these orders were just for the initial 
phases of the implementation of 
Gemstone but, as further phases are 
taken,	w e	expec t	these	wins	t o	gener a t e	
approximately £8.0m of additional 
revenues.
The major part of the £5m of new Retail 
business wins were for our established 
NA V	r etail	solution,	which	is	tar get ed	a t	
medium-sized retailers who want a fully 
integrated multi-channel solution. This 
uptur n	in	demand	f or	our	NA V	solution	
is most encouraging. As most of the new 
business wins came late in the year, they 
had little impact on services income, but 
will	benefit	2014	mar kedly .
T he 	 Division ’ s 	 pr ospect 	 pipeline 	 cur r en tly	
stands at approximately £38.0m (2012: 
£21.0m) with the large majority focused 
on our Gemstone AX solution. We are 
encouraged by signs that retailers 
ar e 	 sho wing 	 mor e 	 c onfidenc e 	 about 	
investing in technology than has been 
previously apparent although it should 
be noted that customers are choosing to 
spend in stages.
T he	smaller	units	in	the	Division	sell	a	
mix tur e	of	non-r etail	NA V ,	non-r etail	
AX and legacy products. These units 
generated revenue of £6.96m (2012:

£0.21m),	and	closed	45	deals	w or th	
£1.50m (2012: 21 deals at £0.76m).
W hile	the	Division ’ s	r esults	this	y ear	
are disappointing, the improved 
or der	in take	will	r esult	in	a	mar ked	
improvement in its performance in 
the	new	financial	y ear .	K3	is	alr eady

medium sized retailers. We believe that 
our investment in Gemstone will help us 
bec ome	as	suc c essful	with	D ynamics	A X,

Cautionary statement
This business review has been prepared 
for shareholders to provide them with 
additional information to assess the 
company’s strategies and the potential 
for 	 those 	 stra tegies 	 to 	 succeed. 	 I t	
should be noted that the business 
review 	 con tains 	 cer tain 	 for w ard 	 look ing	
statements. These statements are made 
by the directors in good faith, based on 
the information available to them up to 
the time of the approval of this report. 
Accordingly, all these statements 
should be treated with caution, due to 
the inherent uncertainties, including 
both 	 economic 	 and 	 business 	 r isk	
factors, underlying any such forward 
look ing 	 infor ma tion.
Principal risks and uncertainties
T her e	ar e	a	number	of	pot en tial	r isks	
and uncertainties, which could have 
a material impact on the Group’s 
performance and could cause actual 
results to differ materially from expected 
and	hist or ical	r esults .	 T he	Gr oup ’ s	r isk	
management policies and procedures to 
deal	with	oper a tional	r isk	ar e	included	in	
the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 19 to 20. The principal business 
r isks	which	the	Gr oup	fac es	can	be	
categorised as follows: 
Strategic
Changes in the business environment 
influence the Group’s development 
in terms of the strategies which it 
pursues and the products and services 
it offers. These changes may stem 
fr om	mar ket	c ompetition	or	ec onomic	
and technological advancement. The 
directors regularly review the Group’s 
str a t eg ic	pr og r ess	and	obtain	mar ket	
information to assist in strategic 
decisions around products, competitors 
and potential acquisitions. We recognise 
tha t	ac quisitions	ha v e	pla y ed	a	key	
role in the growth of the business as 
illustrated by the major acquisitions 
made since 2003, and may do so in 
the future. We are expanding into the 
emerging technologies of “hosted 
applica tions ” 	and	 “ cloud	c omputing ” .	
We also recognise that the ability 
to integrate acquisitions and derive 
syner g ies	is	key	and ,	t o	this	end ,	w e	ha v e	
a strong central management team to 
ensure that strategic objectives and 
targets are reached. 
We see the ownership of intellectual 
property as being critical to the future 
of the business, both in terms of full 
systems and innovative add-ons to third 
party products. We see the development 
of	our	R etail	sof t w ar e	IP	in t o	the	
D ynamics	A X	pr oduc t	set	(P r ojec t	
G emst one)	as	being	a	key	str a t eg ic	
business driver over the next year. 
Dur ing	the	pr ior	y ear ,	f ollo wing	an	
approach from K3’s largest shareholder, 
Mr PJ Claesson, regarding a possible 
offer for the Company, we announced 
that the Company had received a 
number of indicative proposals and 
had commenced a formal sale process. 
This process ended on 17 September 
2012 as the Board did not believe the 
proposals received were at a level that 
would be acceptable to shareholders 
and the proposals were therefore not 
recommendable by the Board.

Business environment
The Group’s customer base is 
mainly in the retail, distribution and 
manufacturing sectors, primarily in 
the	Unit ed	K ingdom	and	E ur ope .	 T he	
environment in which the Group offers 
its products and services is, therefore, 
dependent on the economic and other 
circumstances affecting these business 
sectors including competitor behaviour. 
Over the years we have developed 
a creative, innovative, competitive 
culture and a reputation for advanced 
functionality and product quality. The 
Gr oup	has	made	sig nifican t	in v estmen t	
in	its	libr ar y	of	IP	which	pr ot ec ts	the	
business from competition and increases 
the barrier to entry in our specialists 
mar kets .	 T his	has	enabled	the	Gr oup	t o	
build high levels of predictable income 
from its existing customer base, both in 
the	UK	and	in	its	o v erseas	mar kets .	
Relationships
T he	Gr oup	benefits	fr om	a	number	of	
close commercial relationships with 
key	suppliers	and	cust omers .	Damage	
to or loss of these relationships could 
have a direct and detrimental effect 
on	the	Gr oup ’ s	r esults .	 T he	key	Gr oup	
supplier relationships are secured by 
commercial agreements lasting for up 
to 8 years and management participate 
in regular product and strategy reviews 
with the supplier. On an annual basis 
our customers commit to maintenance 
and support agreements that facilitate 
availability of product upgrades and 
business support.
Delivery
Our products and services operate in 
business critical areas for our customers 
and any failure to meet contractual 
commitments and client expectations 
could damage our reputation and 
impac t	upon	our	financial	position.	
T o	mitiga t e	this	r isk	w e	monit or	our

Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Board recognises its responsibility to 
present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the group’s position 
and prospects, both within its half year 
and	annual	financial	sta t emen ts	and	in	
other price-sensitive public reports. The 
statement of the directors’ responsibility 
in	pr epar ing	the	financial	sta t emen ts	is	
made on page 25.
Going concern
Af ter 	 mak ing 	 enquir ies, 	 the 	 direc tors	
have formed a judgement, at the time 
of 	 approving 	 the 	 financial 	 sta temen ts, 	
that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason 
the directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
financial 	 sta temen ts.
Internal control
The Board recognises its ultimate 
accountability for maintaining an 
effective system of internal control which 
is appropriate in relation to both the 
scope and nature of the group’s activities. 
The system covers all controls including:
•	 financial;
•	 oper a tional;
•	 c omplianc e;	and
•	 r isk	managemen t.
T he	r esponsibilit y	f or	manag ing	r isks	on	
a day to day basis lies with the executive 
dir ec t ors .	 T he	pr inciple	business	r isks	
and	the	ac tions	t o	mitiga t e	the	r isks	
are included in the Financial Review on 
pages	15	and	16.	D etails	of	oper a tional	
r isks	ar e	included	belo w .
Operational
T hese	r isks ,	which	ar e	inher en t	in	all	
business activities, are those which 
mainly result from the potential 
br eakdo wn	of	individual	business	units	
or the group’s control of its human, 
physical and operating resources. The 
pot en tial	financial	or	r eputa tional	loss	
arising from failures in internal controls, 
flaws or malfunctions in computer 
systems and poor product design or 
delivery all fall within this category.
There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
the 	 sig nifican t 	 issues 	 fac ed 	 b y 	 the 	 g r oup 	
which has been in place throughout the 
per iod 	 and 	 up 	 t o 	 16 	 Sept ember 	 2013. 	 I t	
has been regularly reviewed by the Board 
and it accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The Board and senior management have 
a clear and consistent understanding of 
the	key	r isks	facing	the	business .	 W hilst	
they recognise that it is not possible 
t o	elimina t e	r isk	c omplet ely ,	they	ha v e	
established an infrastructure of controls, 
systems, staff and processes which 
aim	t o	minimise	the	likelihood	of	r isks	
occurring or reduce the impact should 
they	do	so .	 T he	key	elemen ts	of	this	
infrastructure which enable the Board to 
review the effectiveness of the system of 
internal controls are as follows:
•	 establishmen t	of	a	f or mal	
management structure, including the 
specifica tion	of	ma tt ers	r eser v ed	f or	
decision	b y	the	B oar d;
•	 setting	and	r eviewing	the	str a t eg ic	
objec tiv es	of	the	g r oup;
•	 B oar d	in v olv emen t	in	the	setting	and	
r eview	of	the	annual	budget;
•	 the	r egular	r eview	of	the	g r oup ’ s	
performance compared with budget 
and	f or ecasts;
•	 pr e	and	post	in v estmen t	appr aisal	of	
capital	expenditur e;
•	 in t eg r it y	and	c ompet enc e	of	
personnel as part of the control 
en vir onmen t;	and	
•	 g r oup	r epor ting	instruc tions	and	
procedures including delegation of 
authority and authorisation levels, 
segregation of duties and other 
control procedures, and standardised 
accounting policies. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013

The Board and senior management are 
a w ar e 	 tha t 	 an y 	 sig nifican t 	 oper a tional 	
matters which raise cause for concern 
may have arisen because of or give rise to 
material internal control issues. There is 
a process in place whereby any member 
of management who becomes aware of 
an internal control issue can bring this to 
the 	 a tt en tion 	 of 	 the 	 Chief 	 F inanc e 	 O ffic er . 	
There were no such issues raised during 
the period under review.
T he 	 B oar d 	 ack no wledges 	 its 	 r esponsibility	
for the group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Board is committed to operating 
comprehensive processes to manage 
the 	 key 	 r isks 	 which 	 fac e 	 the 	 business .	
T hey 	 ha v e 	 established 	 a 	 fr amew or k 	 of	
policies, systems and procedures to 
ensure that the nature and extent of 
the 	 r isk 	 under taken 	 is 	 c ommensur a t e	
with the commercial returns and, where 
nec essar y , 	 t o 	 ensur e 	 pruden t 	 r isk -tak ing	
to protect shareholder value. Such a 
system is designed to manage rather 
than 	 elimina t e 	 the 	 r isk 	 of 	 failur e 	 t o	
achieve business objectives and can 
provide only reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises the 
Chairman, Mr TA Milne, and the non-
executive director, Mr PJ Claesson, 
and is chaired by the Chairman. The 
committee met twice during the year. 
Following his appointment in July 2013, 
M r	P	C ookson	has	been	appoin t ed	t o	
the Audit Committee. The role of the 
Audit Committee is to consider the 
appointment of the auditors, audit fees, 
sc ope	of	audit	w or k	and	an y	r esultan t	
findings .	I t	r eview s	ex t er nal	audit

appr o v al .	 T he	Chief	Ex ecutiv e ,	Chief	
F inanc e	O ffic er	and	ex t er nal	audit ors	
attend meetings of the Audit Committee 
by invitation. The committee is also 
required to review the effectiveness of 
the group’s internal control systems, to 
review the group’s statement on internal 
control systems prior to endorsement by 
the Board and to consider, from time to 
time ,	the	need	f or	a	 “ r isk	sub - c ommitt ee ” 	
to assist in monitoring the group’s 
in t er nal	c on tr ol	sy st ems .	I ts	t er ms	of	
reference are available upon request and 
are placed on the company’s website.
The Audit Committee considers and 
determines relevant action in respect 
of any control issues raised by the 
auditors. Given the size of the group and 
the close day to day control exercised 
by the executive directors and senior 
management, no formal internal audit 
department is considered necessary.
Relations with shareholders
T he	c ompan y	seeks	t o	main tain	good	
communication with shareholders. The 
ex ecutiv e	dir ec t ors	make	pr esen ta tions	
to institutional shareholders covering 
the interim and full year results. Whilst 
most shareholder contact is with the 
executive directors, the Chairman 
and the non-executive director are 
available to meet major shareholders if 
requested to do so. The views of major 
shareholders are obtained through 
direct face-to-face contact and analysts’ 
or	br okers	br iefings .	
The Board considers the AGM to be an 
important opportunity to communicate 
with shareholders and encourages their 
participation. The company despatches 
the notice of AGM, with explanatory 
notes describing items of special 
business ,	a t	least	21	w or k ing	da y s	
before the meeting. All shareholders 
have the opportunity formally or 
informally to put questions to the 
company’s AGMs. All directors attend 
the AGM and the Chairman of the 
A udit,	R emuner a tion	and	Nomina tions	
Committees is available to answer 
questions from shareholders. At each 
AGM the Chairman advises shareholders 
of the proxy voting details on each of 
the resolutions which is dealt with on a 
show of hands. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013

Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code

given considerable attention to the 
provisions set out therein. The group 
has not complied with all provisions

is	ar r anged .	I t	is	the	polic y	of	the	g r oup	
that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons 
should, as far as possible, be identical 
with that of other employees.

the environment through its day to day 
activities 	 and 	 thr ough 	 its 	 wider 	 netw or k.

the protection of the environment and 
the group’s environmental policy aims 
to raise awareness of environmental 
matters and to establish standards. 
The group’s intention is to establish 
a 	 paper less 	 w or k ing 	 en vir onmen t	
wherever appropriate. This is supported 
through the automation of a number of 
internal management and administrative 
processes such as timesheets and 
performance appraisals. The group also 
encourages staff to minimise unnecessary 
travel by using web exchange, telephone 
c onf er encing 	 and 	 w or k ing 	 fr om 	 home 	 in	
appropriate circumstances.

Principles of consolidation
T he 	 c onsolida t ed 	 financial 	 sta t emen ts 	 pr esen t 	 the 	 r esults 	 of 	 the 	 c ompan y 	 and 	 its 	 subsidiar ies 	 (“the 	 g r oup ”) 	 as 	 if 	 they 	 f or med 	 a 	 single

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control exists when the group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern 
the	financial	and	oper a ting	policies	of	an	en tit y	so	as	t o	obtain	benefits	fr om	its	ac tivities .	I n	assessing	c on tr ol ,	pot en tial	v oting

Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ assets and 
liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired in the period are included in the income statement from the date on which control is obtained. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the 
assets ,	including	an y	in tang ible	assets	iden tified ,	liabilities	and	c on tingen t	liabilities	ac quir ed .	G oodwill	is	not	amor tised	but

mar ket	v alue	of	equit y	a t	the	da t e	of	c ompletion,	and	the	fair	v alue	of	c on tingen t	c onsider a tion	is	based	upon	the	pr esen t	v alue	
of the expected future cashflows based on whether the directors believe performance conditions will be met and thus the extent 
to which further consideration will be payable. 
A s	per mitt ed	b y	IFRS	1,	goodwill	ar ising	on	ac quisitions	bef or e	1	Januar y	2006	(da t e	of	tr ansition	t o	IFRS)	has	been	fr o z en	a t

The group performs its impairment reviews at the cash-generating unit level. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On	disposal	of	a	subsidiar y ,	the	a ttr ibutable	net	book	v alue	of	goodwill	is	included	in	the	det er mina tion	of	the	pr ofit	or	loss

higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (effectively the expected cash to be generated from using the asset in 
the business)), the asset is written down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
asset ’ s	cash- gener a ting	unit	(i.e .	the	lo w est	g r oup	of	assets	in	which	the	asset	belongs	f or	which	ther e	ar e	separ able	iden tifiable

differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are similarly recognised immediately in the 
income statement except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in 
which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.

entered into forward currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency cash flows, the group adopts hedge accounting for 
these transactions.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on

at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates certain derivatives as either:
•	 Hedges	of	in t er est	r a t e	and	f or eig n	cur r enc y	cash	flo w	r isk	associa t ed	with	a	r ec og nised	asset	or	liabilit y	or	a	highly	pr obable

•	 Hedges	of	a	net	in v estmen t	in	a	f or eig n	oper a tion	(net	in v estmen t	hedge).
The group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as

assessment, both at hedge inception and on an on-going basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.

Hedge accounting (continued)
The fair values of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 20. Movements on the hedging reserve 
in shareholders’ equity are shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The full fair value of a hedging 
der iv a tiv e	is	classified	as	a	non- cur r en t	asset	or	liabilit y	if	the	r emaining	hedged	it em	is	mor e	than	12	mon ths ,	and	as	a	cur r en t	
asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity 
are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a 
liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects 
net	pr ofit	or	loss .
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation 
Where the group has foreign currency borrowings to hedge changes in the net investment of foreign operations arising from 
movements in the forward exchange rate, to the extent that the hedge is effective, gains and losses arising on the foreign 
currency borrowings are recognised directly in equity. The ineffective portion of such hedges is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.

useful lives. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. 
Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant 
proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease. The capital 
element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction

1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the 
preceding period.
Basis of accounting
T he	financial	sta t emen ts	ha v e	been	pr epar ed	under	the	hist or ical	c ost	c on v en tion	and	in	ac c or danc e	with	applicable	Unit ed	
Kingdom accounting standards.
Intangible assets – goodwill
T he	g r oup	has	pr eviously	hiv ed	up	the	tr ade	and	assets	of	a	subsidiar y	under tak ing	in t o	the	par en t	under tak ing	a t	book	
value. This results in the investment in a subsidiary which has no trade and hence provision would normally be made against 
tha t	in v estmen t	under	UK	GAAP .	 T he	c ompan y	has	ho w ev er	tr ansf er r ed	an	amoun t	equal	t o	the	ac c oun ting	impair men t	fr om	
investments to goodwill. The Board feels that this more accurately reflects the fact that in substance there has been no loss of 
v alue	t o	the	c ompan y .	Had	the	in v estmen t	been	wr itt en	do wn	in	str ic t	ac c or danc e	with	UK	GAAP ,	this	w ould	ha v e	r esult ed	in	a	
pr o vision,	in	the	par en t	under tak ing	only ,	of	£221,000	(2012:	£883,000)	which	is	no w	being	amor tised	o v er	the	r emaining	useful	
ec onomic	lif e	of	fiv e	y ears .
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of trade and assets is the difference between the value of the consideration paid and the 
v alue	of	the	net	assets	ac quir ed .	I t	is	amor tised	o v er	the	per iod	dur ing	which	the	c ompan y	is	expec t ed	t o	benefit,	which	is	
between 9 to 10 years. Provision is made for any impairment.
Intangible assets – research and development
R esear ch	expenditur e	is	wr itt en	off	as	incur r ed .	D ev elopmen t	expenditur e	is	also	wr itt en	off ,	ex c ept	wher e	the	dir ec t ors	ar e	
sa tisfied	as	t o	the	t echnical ,	c ommer cial	and	financial	viabilit y	of	individual	pr ojec ts .	I n	such	cases ,	the	iden tifiable	expenditur e	is	
def er r ed	and	amor tised	o v er	the	per iod	dur ing	which	the	c ompan y	is	expec t ed	t o	benefit.	 T his	per iod	is	bet w een	thr ee	and	six	
years. Provision is made for any impairment. The directors do not consider the capitalised development costs are a realised loss as 
their	car r y	f or w ar d	is	justifiable	under	the	pr o visions	of	SSAP	13.
Tangible fixed assets
T angible 	 fix ed 	 assets 	 are 	 sta ted 	 a t 	 cost, 	 net 	 of 	 deprecia tion 	 and 	 any 	 provision 	 for 	 impair men t. 	 D eprecia tion 	 is 	 provided 	 on 	 all 	
tangible 	 fix ed 	 assets, 	 a t 	 r a tes 	 calcula ted 	 to 	 wr ite 	 off 	 the 	 cost 	 of 	 each 	 asset 	 on 	 a 	 straigh t-line 	 basis 	 over 	 its 	 expec ted 	 useful 	 life, 	
as follows:
Leasehold improvements Period of lease
P lan t	and	machiner y ,	offic e	equipmen t	and	fix tur es	 20-33%	per	annum
M ot or	v ehicles	 25%	per	annum
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill
T he	need	f or	an y	fix ed	asset	impair men t	wr it e - do wn	is	assessed	b y	c ompar ison	of	the	car r ying	v alue	of	the	asset	against	the

Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment except for foreign currency investments where the 
company has applied net investment hedging. Where net investment hedging is applied, the revaluation is recorded in reserves. 
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is 
measured either by reference to the nominal value or the fair value of the shares where appropriate. Any premium is ignored 
when the nominal value is used.
Taxation
C ur r en t	tax,	including	UK	c or por a tion	tax,	is	pr o vided	a t	the	amoun ts	expec t ed	t o	be	paid	(or	r ec o v er ed)	using	the	tax	r a t es	and	
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
D ef er r ed	tax	is	r ec og nised	in	r espec t	of	all	timing	diff er enc es	tha t	ha v e	or ig ina t ed	but	not	r ev ersed	a t	the	balanc e	sheet	da t e	
where transactions or events that resulted in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future

those	in	which	they	ar e	r ec og nised	in	the	financial	sta t emen ts .
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can	be	r egar ded	as	mor e	likely	than	not	tha t	ther e	will	be	suitable	taxable	pr ofits	fr om	which	the	futur e	r ev ersal	of	the	under lying	
timing differences can be deducted.

expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
D ef er r ed	tax	is	measur ed	on	a	non- disc oun t ed	basis .
Turnover
Turnover is calculated net of value added tax and represents the total amount receivable by the company in respect of the sale 
of software licences, customised software, hardware and fees derived from installation, consultancy, training and support.

Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward 
contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the 
rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Where the company enters into foreign currency borrowings to hedge changes in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries 
arising from movements in the forward exchange rate, gains and losses arising on the foreign currency borrowings are 
recognised directly in equity.

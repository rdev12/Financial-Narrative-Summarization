foreign  exchange  instruments  to  manage  this  risk.  At  March  31  2010
the  Group  had  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts  in  place  to  sell
US$9.0  million  (2009:  US$9.0  million)  at  an  average  rate  of  US$1.60
(2008: US$1.48) into Sterling. The Board has a policy to continually

Payment policy
The Group pays in accordance with agreed payment terms. The Company does not have any trade creditors.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the European Union and applicable law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
—  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
—  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
— state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
—  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.

Corporate governance
Introduction
The Board is committed to achieving good standards of corporate governance. Although under the rules of AIM the Group is not 
required to comply with the Combined Code, the Directors intend to comply so far as reasonably practicable for a company of 
ACM’s size and nature. Where full compliance is not appropriate due to the Company’s size and/or nature, the Directors will refer 
to guidance for AIM listed companies issued by the Quoted Companies Alliance.
Board of Directors
The Board consists of three executive and three non-executive Directors, a composition which the Board believes is best suited 
to the continued success of the Group. 
The Board is responsible for establishing the strategic direction of the Group and monitoring the Group’s performance against its 
business plan. It is also responsible for leading and controlling the Group and in particular for formulating, reviewing and approving 
the Group’s strategy, budget, major items of capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals. Regular meetings are held and all 
necessary information is supplied on a timely basis to enable the Board to discharge its duties effectively. Additionally, special meetings 
take place, or other arrangements are made when Board decisions are required in advance of the regular meetings. 
It is the Company’s policy that Directors are re-elected by shareholders and the Company’s Articles of Association require one third 
to retire by rotation. 
Board committees
The Board has a remuneration committee, an audit committee and a nomination committee. Each of these committees consist of the 
three non-executive Directors and are chaired by Peter Sechiari. The Board also has a compliance committee consisting of Peter Sechiari 
and Ian Hartley.
The remuneration committee is discussed within the Directors’ remuneration report on page 15.
The audit committee meets whenever there is business to discuss and meets at least twice each year. The audit committee is responsible 
for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored, controlled and reported on. It also meets with the auditor 
without executive Directors being present and reviews reports from the auditor relating to accounts and internal control systems.
The nomination committee has responsibility for making recommendations on the appointment of additional Directors to the Board 
and the appointment of members of the Company’s senior management team. It meets at least twice a year. 
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control. Although no system can provide absolute assurance against misstatement 
or loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance. The Board is also responsible for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the system.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue its business for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Shareholder relations
The Board places significant importance on maintaining good communications with its shareholders. This includes meetings 
with shareholders and analysts as appropriate. Shareholders are also invited to the Company’s AGM, where questions are taken. 
The Company also uses its Annual Report and Accounts, Interim statement and website (www.acmshippinggroup.com) to provide 
further information to shareholders.  15 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010

Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists of the three non-executive Directors: Peter Sechiari (as Chairman), David Cobb, and Timothy Chadwick. 
The committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required. The remuneration committee considers all material elements 
of remuneration policy, including remuneration and incentives of executive Directors and senior management (including pension rights 
and compensation payments) with reference to independent remuneration research and professional advice. The Board is responsible 
for implementing the recommendations and agreeing the remuneration packages for individual Directors. The remuneration committee 
is also responsible for making recommendations for grants of options under share option and incentivisation schemes. No Director is able 
to participate in discussions relating to his own terms and conditions of remuneration. Non-executive Directors’ and the Chairman’s 
fees are determined by the full Board on the advice of the remuneration committee.

Annual bonus
In order to attract and retain the highest calibre of employees, a significant proportion of remuneration packages of executive Directors 
and senior management are geared towards an annual bonus. The Group adopts an industry standard bonus model whereby proportions 
of revenue and profit are distributed to senior employees as bonuses. The individual allocation of this bonus between the Directors and 
senior employees is discretionary. This discretion is exercised by the remuneration committee upon the recommendation of senior executives.
Pension contributions
The Company makes pension contributions on behalf of its executive Directors. James Gundy is a member of the Group’s defined 
benefit scheme. Ian Hartley is a member of the Group’s stakeholder scheme. John Plumbe and the non-executive Directors do not 
participate in the Group’s pension schemes.

with a notice period of six months after an initial one year term. 16 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of ACM Shipping Group plc
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (“the financial statements”) of ACM Shipping Group plc for 
the year ended 31 March 2010 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the balance sheets, the statements of changes in equity, the cash flow statements, and the related notes. We have also 
audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union and as regards the parent company financial statements as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 13, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of:
—  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
— the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
— the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
—  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2010 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
—  the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; 
—  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
—  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 17 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010
Year in review Financial statements Corporate governance Notice of AGM
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
—  the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
—  the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
—  adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; 
—  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; 
—  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
—  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

The share-based payment reserve represents the fair value of share options which have been granted.
The merger reserve arose when the shares of ACM Shipping Limited were exchanged for shares in ACM Shipping Group plc. 
Since the members and their rights were unchanged the transfer of ownership was accounted for in accordance with the principles 
of merger accounting.

Year in review Financial statements Corporate governance Notice of AGM
Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2010
1. Accounting policies 
(a) Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act and those European Union endorsed IFRS 
and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective or issued and early adopted as at the time of preparing these statements (July 2010). 
The policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as noted below.
No separate profit and loss account is presented for the parent company as provided by Section 408, Companies Act 2006. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ACM Shipping Group plc and its subsidiary and associated 
undertakings and joint venture arrangements.
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow and can be reliably measured. Revenue 
is recognised when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission. This is generally the point at which there is completion 
of contractual terms between the principles of a transaction. Time charter revenue is recognised on a monthly basis.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation 
is provided on a straight line basis over the expected economic life of that asset as follows:
Leasehold improvements –  seven years 
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment – two to five years
(e) Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged 
against profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
(f) Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and recognises the pension liability in the Group balance sheet. The liability is the 
present value of the accrued defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme’s assets. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is measured using the projected unit method and discounted at an AA 
corporate bond rate. Assets are valued at market value. The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses via the statement 
of recognised comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. 
The Company also contributes to defined contribution schemes. Contributions to these schemes have been charged against profit 
as they fall due. 
(g) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
(h) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. 
At each balance sheet, monetary assets and liabilities are converted at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date with any 
gain or loss being included in the income statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas operations are converted at the balance sheet rate while the income statement 
is translated at the average rate for the year. Any exchange gain or loss arising on consolidation is charged to reserves. 24 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010
Notes to the financial statements continued
year ended 31 March 2010
1. Accounting policies continued
(i) Joint ventures
The Group’s investment and share of the profits or losses of the joint ventures are included in the financial statements using the 
equity method.
(j) Investments
All investments are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
(k) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets (including any identifiable intangible assets) acquired. 
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is recognised 
as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. On the disposal of a business, goodwill 
relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(l) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of 
acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment. The amortisation of the carrying value of the capitalised 
forward order book and customer relationships is charged to the income statement over an estimated useful life determined by either 
the expected due dates for future income in the case of forward order books or the expected duration of customer relationships. 
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that they may 
be impaired. The estimated useful life of the items in the forward order book is generally three to four years and for the customer 
relationships is ten years.
(m) Share‑based payments
The Company awards employees bonuses in the form of share options and long-term incentive plan share awards, on a discretionary 
basis from time to time. The options and awards are normally subject to vesting conditions and, where it is considered likely that the 
conditions will be met, their fair value is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in other reserves 
over the vesting period. The cash proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium. 
(n) Financial instruments
Classification
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) 
only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial 
assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by 
the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital 
and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
The Company’s share capital is treated as equity.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated 
with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 25 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010

(n) Financial instruments continued
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at nominal value.
Forward contracts
The Company uses forward contracts for foreign currency and accounts for these using hedge accounting.
(o) Own shares held by ESOP trust
Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are treated as being those of the Group and are therefore reflected in the Group’s 
financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
(p) Adopted IFRS not yet applied
The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
beginning 1 April 2009:
—  IAS 1 (revised), Presentation of financial statements has resulted in the statement of recognised income and expense being 
renamed the statement of comprehensive income and the introduction of the statement of changes in equity as a primary 
statement. The Group has chosen to present two statements, an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income. 
—  IFRS 2 (amendment), Share-based payment deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. The amendment does not have 
a material impact on the Group or Company’s financial statements.
—  IFRIC 16, Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. This has not had any impact on the Group. 
The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are also mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
beginning 1 April 2009 but are not currently relevant for the Group:
—  IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programmes.
—  IFRIC 15, Agreements for the construction of real estate.
—  IAS 39 (amendment), Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement. 
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial 
year beginning 1 April 2009 and have not been early adopted:
—  IFRS 3 (revised), Business combinations and consequential amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and separate financial statements.
—  IAS 28, Investments in associates and IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures, effective prospectively to business combinations for which 
the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Management 
is assessing the impact of the new requirements regarding acquisition accounting, consolidation and associates on the Group. 
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial 
year beginning 1 April 2009 and are not currently relevant to the Group:
—  IFRIC 17, Distributions of non-cash assets to owners, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This is not currently 
applicable to the Group, as it has not made any non-cash distributions.
—  IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers, effective from 1 July 2009. This is not relevant to the Group, as it has not received 
any assets from customers.
—  IFRIC 19, Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity investments. This is not relevant to the Group as no equity instruments have 
been issued to extinguish any financial liabilities.
—  IFRS 9, Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010. Earlier application is permitted 
but will not be taken.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on these 
financial statements. 26 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010

2. Segmental reporting
The Group operates in one business sector and does not report internally any segmental information other than revenue streams. As a result 
no additional business sector information is provided. Business is the Group’s primary reporting segment. Geographical information is not 
produced and is not readily available. In view of management, the cost of developing this information would be excessive.

All amortisation charges in the year have been charged through administrative expenses. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units which are tested for impairment at least annually. The recoverable amount has been 
determined based on a value in use calculation using risk-adjusted cash flow projections based on financial budgets prepared by 
the Group. The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are:
—  the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 12%. This is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted 
to reflect market assessment of specific risks associated with the segment cash flows;
—  the period over which cash flows are projected based on financial budgets approved by the Board is one year; and
—  the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the budget period is 3%.
Management believes that it is unlikely that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying value 
of any of the cash-generating units to exceed its recoverable amount. 32 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010

17. ESOP reserve 
The ESOP reserve in Group represents 500,000 shares (2009: nil) held by ACM Shipping Limited Employee Share Ownership Plan. The shares 
are stated at cost. The market value of these shares at 31 March 2010 was £950,000 (2009: £nil).
18. Share‑based payments 
The Enterprise Management Incentive (“EMI”) scheme, Sharesave scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) have been set up to 
provide executives and employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. 
Under the LTIP, 50,000 shares were awarded to an employee during the year. The employee paid one pence per share for the LTIPs 
which vest 50% after three years, 25% after four years and 25% after five years subject only to the employee remaining with the Group. 
No share options were granted under either the EMI scheme or the Sharesave scheme during the year.

18. Share‑based payments continued
Share‑based payment expense
The total charge in the consolidated income statement for the year with regard to these awards is £394,000 (2009: £178,000).
The fair values of the LTIPs are inherently valued at the share price at the date of grant less 1 pence per share.
The fair values of the options granted were determined using the Binomial option pricing model. Assumptions used in the application 
of the option pricing models were: 
—  Risk-free interest rate in the range 2.93% to 5.11% for the different grants 
—  Dividend yield  3%
—  Volatility 30%
—  Life of options five and a half years
—  Fair values range from 36.6 pence to 64.5 pence 
Expected volatility was estimated by reference to historical share price movements in both the Group and comparable quoted companies 
with a longer listing history than the Group.

23. Financial instruments and risks
The Group’s financial risk management policies are designed to reduce the risk of currency, liquidity and credit risk exposure.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash at bank and other items including trade receivables and trade payables that arise 
directly from its operations. 
The Group has no assets or liabilities other than forward foreign exchange contracts that fall to be classed as derivatives. The Group 
does not engage in instruments of a speculative nature.
(a) Currency risk
The Group carries out most of its business in US Dollars and hence it is exposed to currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. 
So as to mitigate this risk the Group places forward contracts for the sale of US Dollars at fixed rates. The purpose of such transactions 
is to manage the currency risk arising from the Group’s operations. At year end the Group had contracts outstanding to sell US$9.0 million 
(2009: US$9.0 million) and to receive Sterling. These contracts all had a maturity date of less than one year and were contracted at 
rates ranging from $1.49 to $1.67 to £1. The average rate of the forward contracts was $1.60 to £1. 
At each balance sheet date, the contracts which are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are restated to their fair value, 
based on currency contracts with similar maturity profiles. At 31 March 2010 the fair value of these contracts was a liability of £258,000 
(2009: asset £10,000).
The rate on the balance sheet date was $1.52 to £1 (2009: $1.43). The average rate for the year was $1.60 to £1 (2009: $1.69).
As at 31 March 2010 all cash and cash equivalents were held in Sterling except for bank accounts totalling US$1.8 million (2009: US$1.6 million) 
and Euro 0.0 million (2009: Euro 0.3 million). There is no difference between the book values and fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
The effect on profit before taxation of a 10% weakening in the average US Dollar exchange rate in the year compared to the effective 
rates for the year is approximately £1.2 million adverse (2009: £1.4 million). This effect is before hedging and with all other variables being 
equal. A 10% strengthening in the average US Dollar is approximately £1.2 million favourable (2009: £1.4 million). The effect on equity 
is similar to that on profit before taxation.
(b) Liquidity risk
The Group finances itself through retained earnings. The Group is fundamentally cash generative and manages its liquid resources 
so as to obtain the best available rates of return on cash investments, whilst retaining access to those resources. 
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is given in note 22. The Group does not currently have any borrowings.
(c) Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets 
is represented by the carrying value of receivables as at the balance sheet date. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing 
basis and a bad debt provision is held to cover doubtful debts. The Group has not historically suffered from significant bad debts.
(d) Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rates on its cash and short-term deposits.  40 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010

24. Ultimate controlling party
No individual shareholder has ultimate control of the Company. 
25. Post balance sheet event – purchase of Endeavour Shipbrokers 
On 24 June 2010 the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the business of Endeavour Shipbrokers Pty Limited (“Endeavour”), 
a dry cargo shipbroker based in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. This acquisition takes the Group into the dry cargo market and 
is an important expansion strategically as it enhances ACM’s offering and diversifies the Group’s earnings. This is in line with ACM’s 
stated strategy to become an integrated global shipbroking services provider.
The acquisition was for a total consideration of AU$10 million (£5.8 million). The consideration comprises AU$4 million (£2.3 million) 
in cash and the issue of 1,815,000 new ordinary shares in ACM (“Consideration Shares”). The Consideration Shares were admitted to 
trading on AIM on 30 June 2010. These ordinary shares rank pari passu with the existing ordinary shares of the Group. All Consideration 
Shares are the subject of a lock-in and orderly market arrangement. The cash element of the consideration was funded from the 
existing cash resources of the Group.
Endeavour concentrates on the growing Asia Pacific dry bulk market and has a wide range of global clients including major world 
recognised blue chip mining, industrial and agricultural companies, as well as ship owners and operators. For the eight months to 
28 February 2010, on an unaudited basis, Endeavour achieved revenue of AU$4.0 million. The unaudited accounts of Endeavour 
for the year to 30 June 2009 showed revenue of AU$5.4 million and a profit before taxation of AU$3.1 million before allowing for 
Director bonuses.
Endeavour is highly complementary with the Group’s recently started venture for dry cargo in the UK. 41 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010

Notes
1.  If you have sold or transferred all your ordinary shares in the Company, please send this document and the enclosed form of proxy 
(Proxy Form) to the stockbroker, or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was effected, for transmission to the purchaser 
or transferee.
2.  Holders of ordinary shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. Shareholders are entitled 
to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A shareholder 
can appoint the Chairman of the meeting or anyone else to be his/her proxy at the meeting. A proxy need not be a shareholder. 
More than one proxy can be appointed in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached 
to a different ordinary share or shares held by that shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy, the Proxy Form should be photocopied 
and completed for each proxy holder. The proxy holder’s name should be written on the Proxy Form together with the number of 
shares in relation to which the proxy is authorised to act. The box on the Proxy Form must also be ticked to indicate that the proxy 
instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All Proxy Forms must be signed and, to be effective, must be lodged with the 
Company’s registrar so as to arrive not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, or in the case of an adjournment 48 hours 
before the adjourned time. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only 
the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names 
of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
3.  The return of a completed Proxy Form will not prevent a shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
4.  Only shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the meeting 
shall be entitled to attend the AGM either in person or by proxy and the number of ordinary shares then registered in their respective 
names shall determine the number of votes such persons are entitled to cast on a poll at the AGM.
5.  The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in note 2 does not apply to Nominated Persons. 
The rights described in that note can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
6.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the AGM, arrangements will be put in place at the AGM so that; 
(i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in 
accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll 
those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as 
corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same 
corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as 
its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives 
who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate 
representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample 
form of appointment letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above. 
7.  In accordance with regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting 
(and for the purposes of the determination by the Company of the number of votes they may cast), members must be entered on 
the Company’s register of members by 11.30am on 31 August 2010, or if the meeting is adjourned, by not later than 48 hours before 
the time and date fixed for the adjourned meeting.
8.  A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution.
9.  Copies of all service agreements under which Directors of the Company are employed by the Company or any subsidiaries will 
be available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, during normal business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays 
and public holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM, and at the venue of the AGM for 15 minutes 
prior to and during the meeting.
10.  Except as provided above, shareholders who have general queries about the meeting should write to the Company Secretary 
at the address of our registered office. You may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice of AGM or any related 
documents (including the Proxy Form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

Resolution [6] – Auditor – this resolution, if passed, will re-appoint RSM Tenon Audit Limited as auditor of the Company and authorise 
the Directors to fix their remuneration.
As special business
The following item will be proposed as an ordinary resolution:
Resolution [7] – Authority to allot shares
This resolution, if passed, will authorise the Directors of the Company generally and unconditionally to allot ordinary shares of the 
Company up to a maximum nominal value of £65,021 representing approximately one third of the current issued share capital of 
the Company. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company unless previously varied, revoked or renewed 
by the Company in general meeting.
The following items will be proposed as special resolutions:
Resolution [8] – Disapplication of pre‑emption rights
This resolution, if passed, will grant the Directors of the Company power to allot shares wholly for cash pursuant to the authority 
conferred on them by resolution 7 otherwise than to the existing shareholders of the Company in proportion to their existing holdings of 
ordinary shares. The first part of the disapplication is limited to rights issues, open offers and similar pro-rata issues. In relation to a 
rights issue, open offer or other pro rata issues the disapplication authority is unlimited and allows the Directors to offer shares to 
existing shareholders other than strictly in proportion to their holdings, where for example, overseas regulations make it difficult 
to offer shares pro rata to existing overseas shareholders or when dealing with fractions of shares. The second part of the 
disapplication is limited to issues of shares pursuant to the terms of the Company’s current share scheme and any other share 
schemes approved by the Company in general meeting. The final part of the resolution also enables your Board to allot shares for 
any purpose up to an aggregate nominal value of £19,506 representing approximately 10% of the current issued share capital of the 
Company.
Resolution [9] – Share buy back 
This resolution seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own shares and is proposed as a special resolution. 
If passed, the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 1,950,600 of its shares, representing just under 10% of 
the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at the date of this notice of AGM.
The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any shares purchased under this authority. 
The authority will expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM.
Whilst the Directors do not currently have any intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution, the Directors would 
require the authority granted by this resolution to make market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares as a method of 
returning surplus cash to shareholders. The Directors will only exercise the authority to purchase shares where they consider that 
such purchases will be in the best interests of shareholders generally and will result in an increase in earnings per share.
The Company may either cancel any shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and subsequently sell 
or transfer them out of treasury or cancel them). The Directors currently intend to transfer sufficient shares purchased under this 
authority into treasury in order to satisfy the Company’s share incentive schemes and to cancel any excess shares purchased.

Chairman’s Statement 
David Jenkins 
Chairman 
We believe that those property 
businesses such as ourselves with 
equity able to invest in the near-term 
into the markets should be able 
to transact at favourable levels 
of return. 
I am pleased to be able to 
report a further signifi cant 
improvement in the fortunes 
of your Company in 2010. 
We achieved a proﬁt before tax of £2.6 million as compared 
to a loss before tax of £11.4 million for the previous year. 
No less signiﬁcantly, shareholders’ funds beneﬁted from 
the £100.2 million issue of new equity during the year, 
ending the year at £333.1 million, an increase of 
£89.1 million compared with the position at the end of 
2009. Net assets per share ended the year at 272 pence, 
compared to 297 pence at the end of 2009 and 270 
pence immediately following the share issue. 
It is pleasing to be able to report in a period of 
considerable economic uncertainty and with subdued 
forecasts for economic growth in both the near and 
medium-term, that Development Securities has been able 
to grow its business so substantially. This could not have 
been done without shareholder support and we remain 
grateful for the conﬁdence you have shown in us. 
Strategically, we have maintained a consistent business 
model over the last 15 years or so, especially with regard 
to the management of our risk proﬁle. It was this prudent 
strategy that enabled the business to survive the acute 
stresses of recent years. On the other hand, there 
have been recent tactical changes in our approach to 
Adapting to current 

market conditions
 
to improve returns
 
the market which we believe will assist us in capturing 
improved returns. 
Given our enhanced ﬁnancial strength and stability, 
the Board has recommended the payment of a ﬁnal 
dividend for the year of 2.4 pence per share payable on 
6th July 2011 to shareholders on the register on 3rd June 
2011. This brings the total dividend payment for the year 
to 4.8 pence per share, equivalent to that paid in respect 
of the previous year. 
The ﬁrst step change in the level of our business 
occurred when we raised equity of £100.0 million in July 
2009, which subsequently proved to be the low point of 
the real estate markets. As we had intended, we have now 
deployed this capital into the market, together with 
appropriate leverage where applicable and none of it was 
utilised to pay down debt. Since July 2009, the Investment 
Property Databank Index (IPD) had shown a recovery in 
capital values of 8.8 per cent to December 2009. The 
increase of this Index in calendar 2010 was 8.3 per cent. 
Accordingly, by the end of the year, the markets which had 
fallen originally by some 44 per cent from their peak in 
2007 had recovered 18.1 per cent from that low point. 
The second recent step change occurred twelve 
months later with our next equity raise of £100.2 million in 
July 2010. The proposition this time was different; we had 
identiﬁed early in 2010 that the recovery in the banking 
sector was likely to be a long and drawn out process and 
that, until the banks’ balance sheets, capital ratios and 
reserves were properly reinstated, there would be a 
continuing reluctance of the banks to advance fresh capital 
to the real estate sector. Indeed, subsequent events have 
borne this out and it is noticeable that, probably for the ﬁrst 
time, the amount of net new bank lending to the property 
sector has been negative for six consecutive quarters. 
Notwithstanding this withdrawal of capital, the proportion 
of commercial property loans to the total loan books of the 
banks is still uncomfortably high and we anticipate that 
the banks’ relative inability to provide fresh capital to 
the market will continue well into the medium-term. 
Accordingly, we believe that those property businesses 
such as ourselves with equity able to invest in the near-
term into the markets should be able to transact at 
favourable levels of return. 
There are still clouds on the horizon, however. The 
austerity programme now being introduced in the UK will 
have an impact which is not easy to predict. Increased 
levels of taxation, both direct and indirect, together with 
signiﬁcant reductions in Government expenditure are likely 
to reduce domestic consumption and encourage the 
restoration of savings levels as the consumer battles to 
survive the storm. Unsurprisingly, these current difﬁculties

are also adversely affecting levels of business conﬁdence 
and are likely to continue to do so until the way ahead has 
greater clarity. Rental growth in the occupational markets 
has reduced by some 15.1 per cent over the last three 
years and whilst that fall appears now to have levelled out, 
it will likely take many years before any signiﬁcant rental 
growth reappears. 
I am pleased to report that our IPD investment 
portfolio performance for 2010 equalled that of the IPD 
UK Quarterly Property Index for that year notwithstanding 
that our portfolio of real estate investments does not 
include any element of Central London weighting. Whilst 
it was clear that Central London was the sector with 
the strongest capital and rental growth during 2010, our 
more than acceptable comparative performance to the 
benchmark conﬁrms our long-held contention that, in 
current market conditions, terms of trade in the secondary 
markets have moved towards those with appropriate 
expertise and capital. We expect this to continue. The 
valuation uplifts in our Balance Sheet of course take no 
account of improvements in the development and trading 
portfolios, which are reported only on ultimate sale. 2010 
saw us continue with our strategy of focusing our 
investment portfolio on property assets that represent a 
mix of core defensive income and asset management 
initiatives. We have no present plans to change this 
approach. We do, however, have a considerable amount of 
equity remaining available in cash to invest into the 
marketplace as and when suitable opportunities arise and 
we remain alert to allocate this capital into a market which 
is likely to remain constrained of cash for some time.
 Active development on a substantial scale is 
normally seen in the second half of an economic cycle 
when demand for retail and ofﬁce accommodation is 
strengthening, vacancy rates are falling and capital 
availability is expanding. It is therefore unsurprising that we 
have not been recently engaged in any major development 
activity in the UK’s largest cities although we continue to 
seek out sites that could represent proﬁtable developments 
for future years. On the other hand, the rapid recovery in 
rental values in the City of London together with both a 
perception of reduced supply and the weight of inward 
investment have conspired to raise values of prime 
development sites to levels which would appear to be hard 
to justify in such an early stage of the current economic 
cycle. Whilst we continue to pursue opportunities in this 
particular market, we are apprehensive both with regard to 
the underlying strength of demand and also the quantum 
of supply that may be brought to the market in the medium-
term. We suspect that the City of London will remain a 
market for those with deep pockets and a longer-term 
investment horizon. 
Outlook 
Monetary policy is hard to predict, perhaps even by those 
who pull the levers, but we do anticipate that interest rates 
will remain at minimal levels for some time yet to come. It 
is quite likely that both the Government and the Bank of 
England will seek to maintain interest rates at around 
current levels as and until stronger economic growth in the 
UK is initiated. To date, the two major domestic UK banking 
groups with signiﬁcant government equity ownership have 
only gradually released troubled loans and foreclosed real 
estate into the market and it is arguable this has had 
minimal impact on pricing such has been the strength of 
investor demand for product. It would appear that these 
UK banking groups have now realised the value from the 
larger, better located and better let properties and that the 
next few years will see them work harder to maintain the 
same level of capital release from smaller loans. It perhaps 
follows that the next tranche of loans to be realised by the 
banks will be within the secondary rather than the prime 
sector. The availability of capital to acquire these assets 
will be reduced since investors with an appetite for prime 
property are unlikely to have the same risk proﬁle on assets 
which are noticeably inferior in terms of location, tenant 
covenant strength and lease maturity proﬁle. 
Conclusion 
To say that we have clarity in all aspects of the market­ place would be wrong. However, we do have clarity with 
regard to the opportunity and returns that will be available 
to us as we apply our cash and expertise into those 
stressed areas of the market that lack adequate capital. If 
signiﬁcant large-scale development projects need to await 
the next phase of the economic cycle, so be it. We will 
maintain the risk proﬁle of our business model within the 
constraints in which we have operated for many years. 
On behalf of the Board, I would again like to record 
my welcome to Sarah Bates, our new Board member, who 
brings with her an outstanding record of experience and 
skills, some of which we have now seen close at hand 
during the past year. 
It remains for me to thank all of our Directors, 
management and staff for their valued contributions. 
Their professionalism and standing in the marketplace has 
undoubtedly been the key to our success through the last 
few years and will represent the base on which we will 
move forward with growing success.

Business Model 
A business model proven 
sustainable in unprecedented 
Our strategy, followed 
consistently for over 15 years 
by the management team, 
allows for the cyclical nature 
of the property industry, 
thus mitigating the eff ects 
of major market fl uctuations. 
The following are the key elements which, applied 
rigorously, enabled the Company to emerge in a better 
position than many of its competitors from the recent 
severe market conditions.
 01 
Low risk ﬁnancial and funding structure 
Development Securities differs from most property 
companies, having a conservative use of debt. It seldom 
owns the major projects it is actively developing, although 
it may, on some schemes, have a modest ﬁnancial 
involvement. The Company typically derives project 
management fees through the development process and 
a participation in the eventual gain arising to the investors 
when the project is completed. 
We have never believed it is appropriate for a 
company of our size to accept sole development risk in 
relation to the complex and substantial development 
projects in which we are involved. We endeavour to share 
the majority of development project risk with ﬁnancial 
institutions and partners who are the more appropriate 
long-term investors. 
Our funding partners have included: 
 Standard Life Investments 
 The Prudential Assurance Company 
 Legal & General Assurance Society 
 Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited 
 Aviva Investors 
 DEKA Immobilien Investment GmbH 
 Commerz Grundbesitz Investmentgesellschaft 
 Deutsche Grundbesitz Investmentgesellschaft 
 Corpus Sireo Immobilienfonds
market severity
 
02 
Large-scale development projects 
In our experience, large and complex development projects 
offer greater proﬁt potential than smaller ones, without 
necessarily increasing the inherent risk proﬁle. 
Our strong track record, including such successful 
multi-phase developments as PaddingtonCentral, also 
gives us a competitive advantage when seeking these 
large-scale projects.
 03 
Focus with balance and diversity 
In order to provide a sustainable business model through 
the vagaries of the property and business cycles, we aim 
to combine opportunities for short-term development 
gains with a pipeline of multi-phase projects. To ensure 
focus of effort and expertise we restrict our activities to the 
United Kingdom, remaining largely within the commercial 
property market. 
Our balanced, diversiﬁed business model typically 
includes examples of: 
 Single, prestige ofﬁce developments 
 Multi-phase ofﬁce developments 
 Regional urban regeneration projects 
 Retail development projects 
 Mixed-use developments 
 Residential
 04 
Investment portfolio 
We know that large developments, perhaps lasting through 
several property cycles, create uneven proﬁts and cash ﬂow. 
The Company allocates a signiﬁcant element of its 
equity to the ownership of a diverse investment portfolio, 
consisting of properties spread across the UK, covering 
retail, ofﬁce and industrial sectors: this mix is driven by 
market conditions, availability, stock selection and potential 
for asset improvement. 
The investment portfolio provides a steady and 
predictable ﬂow of funds, contributing signiﬁcantly towards 
central overheads.
 05 
Geographic focus 
All of our development and investment activity is conducted 
within the United Kingdom.

Five year summary 
Principal risks 
Development Securities’ business model is deﬁ ned by the 
nature and extent of the risks which the Directors consider 
appropriate to its skills and size. Project speciﬁc risk and 
cumulative portfolio risk are key measures by which the 
Executive Directors appraise potential new transactions. 
The Group’s risk proﬁle is maintained under continual 
review by its Risk Committee, which meets quarterly, and 
by the Board. 
The Directors consider the following to be the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the business. They 
may be grouped as external risks, whose occurrence 
is beyond the control of the Group, and business risks, 
which the Directors choose to manage as part of the 
Group’s operations. 
External risks 
Market risk 
The real estate market is closely linked with the health of 
the wider economy, and susceptible to both national and 
global shocks. Recessionary conditions can undermine 
the demand for both new developments and existing 
investment property, and hence signiﬁcantly reduce their 
value. Speciﬁcally there is a risk to real estate values in the 
potential for the banks to accelerate their deleveraging in 
the sector, perhaps forcing a large amount of property on 
to the market. 
Current and prospective market conditions form a 
principal focus for both executive management and the 
Board, as described through the following pages. 
Scarcity of opportunities 
The Group’s business is transactional, and requires a ﬂ ow 
of opportunities, which can be sparse either because of 
lack of market demand for new product or through excess 
equity liquidity forcing uncompetitive market pricing. 
The Group maintains a ﬂexible approach to market 
opportunity, resisting the temptation to chase activity 
when prices move too high, and seeking sectors and 
locations where value can be generated, as described in 
the Operating Review on pages 10 to 31. 
People risk 
The Group’s success depends on the ability and experience 
of its Directors and management. The departure of key 
individuals or the failure to attract and retain new talent can 
result in the loss of core competencies and industry 
knowledge and networks. 
The Group aims to motivate and reward its team 
appropriately and competitively, as described in the 
Remuneration Report, and the Board keeps the strength 
and depth of the team under continual review. 
Counterparty, funding, liquidity and interest rate risks 
Counterparty and other ﬁnancial risks are described in the 
Financial Review on pages 35 to 41. 
Business risks 
Planning risk 
Procuring an appropriate and valuable planning consent is 
a key element of the creation of value through property 
development. Securing planning permission is a complex 
and uncertain process, with applications subject to 
objection from a wide range of potential stakeholders, 
and hence prone to delay, modiﬁcation and rejection. 
The Directors rely on their experience and local 
knowledge to maximise the chance of success and reduce 
the risks and costs of failure to a minimum. 
Construction risk 
Construction is subject to signiﬁcant risks of cost overruns, 
delay and the failure of an appointed contractor. 
The Group examines these risks in each case, 
conducting appropriate due diligence on the capabilities 
and ﬁnancial security of its prospective contractors. The 
Group deploys its own experienced project managers to 
minimise the likelihood and impact of the above risks.

Chief Executive’s Statement 
Well positioned 
to unlock potential 
in the market 
Michael Marx 
Chief Executive 
Development Securities, with its 
track record of partnership with 
both institutions and private investors, 
together with its transparency as 
a regulated, publicly listed entity, 
is increasingly seen as a desired 
partner for those in need of capital. 
With the two recent, successful share offerings in 
July 2009 and July 2010 that have together raised 
£200 million, we are approaching the appropriate scale 
for a signiﬁcant property business from which a number of 
advantages will ﬂow. 
Clearly, the Company has greater resources with 
which to approach a marketplace presently somewhat 
starved of capital, but not so much resource that we are 
compelled to seek larger, prime sector deals at what may 
be inﬂated prices – our preference remaining to operate 
in the space above the level associated with private 
capital, but below that normally associated with the large 
REIT operations. Secondly, we will be more operationally 
efﬁcient since we intend to deploy the new equity without 
the need to add signiﬁcantly to our overhead structure and 
as a result, the operational cash ﬂow will be more even and 
move closer to being self-sustaining. Additionally, once we 
have completed the deployment of the fresh £200 million 
of capital raised, we will have doubled the value of property 
assets under our control, thus reducing the impact on our 
ﬁnances of those legacy assets from the previous cycle 
which are perhaps not best suited for this stage of the 
current economic cycle. 
There continues a sense that the UK remains at the 
crossroads without any strong sense of clarity as to which 
direction the economy will eventually take. Probably in the 
main due to the swift application of the policy of quantitative 
easing, a complete economic collapse was avoided but 
there are undoubtedly pitfalls ahead wherever one looks. 
Unsurprisingly, after the traumatic experience of recent 
years, both business and consumer conﬁdence is in 
relatively short supply and, as is often the case, it will need 
to be rebuilt slowly and carefully. It is of little comfort that 
the UK is not alone in these difﬁculties, especially since 
our major trading partner, the European Union, has its own 
problems on a perhaps more extensive scale. 
This current uncertainty prescribes the behaviour of 
the consumer and consequently also of industry and 
business. Household savings ratios have now restored 
themselves to the reasonable level of ﬁve per cent as is the 
customary reaction following a period of ﬁnancial stress. 
Given the challenges faced in the coming few years 
through increased direct and indirect taxation, as well as 
the likely rise in unemployment induced by government-led 
cut backs, the savings ratios may plateau rather than 
increase as these savings reserves are utilised to overcome 
the next few difﬁcult years. It remains to be seen whether 
and how rapidly the private sector can take on the challenge 
of energising the spare capacity that now exists in the UK 
economy – for therein lies the solution. 
Rental growth has now levelled out after a decline 
of several years and given current vacancy rates that 
exist within most sectors, is unlikely to increase at a 
signiﬁcant rate until the medium-term. Prospective IPD 
Index performance will therefore depend more on interest 
rate levels and yields if further capital growth is to be 
achieved. We do not view this as likely for some time, but 
we need to remind ourselves that real estate is a long-
term, cyclical business rather than a short-term sprint. 
In such circumstances, it is reassuring to see that 
on an historic comparative yield basis, property still looks 
fairly priced in comparison both to the bond and equity 
markets. It would seem that the generous yield spread is 
justiﬁed by the uncertainty that lies ahead. 
Apart from the level of interest rates, which are to 
some extent within the control of the UK monetary 
authorities, the two big UK banking groups are in control 
of a substantial overhang of real estate that represents the 
legacy of past lending to the real estate sector. In addition, 
there are, of course, the even more acute problems 
associated with the Irish banking system. To date, the 
banks generally have been cautious with regard to both the 
speed and quantum of the real estate they have released 
back to the market and have focused primarily on those 
prime assets which have found ready investors from within 
the substantial amount of money that is seeking to enter 
the market. Increasingly, having now harvested what might 
be termed the low hanging fruit, the UK banking groups 
may ﬁnd it more challenging to dispose of those assets of 
a more secondary nature. But since their exposure to real 
estate loans is still at levels above those when the 1990 
crash began, deal with these assets they must. Effectively, 
circa £100 billion needs to be found over the medium-term 
to reduce the banks’ inappropriate loan exposures to the 
real estate sector. Some of this amount will likely come 
from further loan loss provisions once the banks have 
internally replenished their capital through enhanced 
earnings, and some from redemption or reﬁnancing. It is 
only once the banking sector has returned to health that 
the property business, amongst others, will have a chance 
to ﬁre on all cylinders again.

The support of our shareholders in the last two years for 
fresh equity of £200 million has placed us in a strong 
position for the next few years. The large scale cash-rich 
real estate investors have traditionally and quite rightly 
been reluctant to invest outside the prime sector due to 
considerations of both risk and lot size. Development 
Securities represents one of the relatively few portals 
through which such much needed equity can ﬂ ow in order 
to access the returns from this fertile area of the market, 
since we not only have the cash and the expertise 
necessary to deal with complex real estate issues, but 
have always remained diligently focused on commercial 
property in the UK. As such, our brand in the market has 
strengthened in those various areas of the sector where 
capital starvation is acute. 
Development Securities, with its track record of 
partnership with both institutions and private investors, 
together with its transparency as a regulated, publicly 
listed entity, is increasingly seen as a desired partner for 
those in need of capital. Under such circumstances, we 
are tending to ﬁnd that terms of trade are moving more in 
our favour. 
It would seem that, for Development Securities, the 
next few years will be spent for the most part unlocking 
problem assets with pregnant value or carrying forward 
modest-sized development schemes which are unable to 
ﬁnd sufﬁcient available capital. 
It is unsurprising that major development schemes 
in the next few years are likely to be restricted to Central 
London where special considerations have seemingly 
always applied. History would caution us that this market 
is the most volatile of all sectors in the UK, due to its heavy 
focus on the ﬁnancial services sector and with an increasing 
representation by overseas investors who may often also 
be signiﬁcantly represented in the occupational markets in 
Central London. It would appear that the likely reason why 
real rents have declined so signiﬁ cantly in the Square Mile 
since the early 1980s is that supply has continued on 
average to consistently outpace demand. Since the advent 
of Canary Wharf, this supply has also appeared outside 
the walls of the City of London but has nevertheless drawn 
off a considerable amount of demand, thus weakening 
rental growth within the core district. We do not believe 
that a new generation of very tall buildings in the Square 
Mile will alleviate this factor – rather, perhaps, compound 
it. Nevertheless, since there still appears to be value to be 
captured in the increasing agglomeration of skills in 
London, we continue to pursue Central London 
development schemes and search out those opportunities 
where creativity and added value justify risk and price. We 
are conﬁdent that we will eventually secure appropriate 
opportunities, but we proceed with caution. 
Whilst property is not manifesting indications of a 
fresh price bubble, there is little doubt that quantitative 
easing encouraged the recent sharp upward re-pricing of 
the market as investors struggled to ﬁnd assets that they 
could regard as generating signiﬁcant steady cash ﬂow 
and which offered the potential, at least, of an inﬂation 
hedge. The assets that we have been able to acquire over 
the last 18 months or so have come forward to the market 
by virtue of some degree of ﬁnancial stress. Apart from the 
obvious instances of where we have been able to acquire 
property previously foreclosed by the banks because of 
loan defaults, there would appear to be increasing pressure 
from the banks onto their customers to resolve loans that 
are not fully performing and accelerate property disposals 
in order to avoid the need for loan foreclosure. Additionally, 
the absence of signiﬁcant fresh capital to the property 
sector outside of the prime Central London market, has 
brought forward a number of situations where both fresh 
capital and expertise is required to unlock development 
potential. Finally, mainly in the area of strategic land 
improvement, there is a signiﬁcant shortage of capital 
available to individuals who have expertise and are willing 
to partner with us in exchange for appropriate funding. 
Strategic land opportunities in which we have taken 
interest relate mainly to prospective residential land. 
Otherwise, our preferred asset class for development 
propositions emerging from the market still tends to be 
neighbourhood shopping centres anchored either by a 
major food store or by an equally strong major retail trading 
covenant. These schemes enable us to create value where 
demand is evident and also provide a defensive component 
due to the strength of the anchor itself. 
More recently, we are evolving an increasing 
appetite in well established urban areas for mixed-
use development projects that can embrace a not 
insigniﬁcant residential component. Of course, opportun­ istic transactions will always be of interest at the 
appropriate value. 
Our current role, outside of possible large-scale 
commercial development in Central London, is focused on 
the transformation of assets, which presently languish for 
one reason or another within the secondary sector of the 
market, into higher quality real estate that will appeal to the 
ultimate cash investor. If interest rates remain low and 
inﬂation remains subdued, the cash investor will deploy his 
funds into these newly created or refreshed assets with or 
without a capital contribution from the banking sector. If 
inﬂation does begin to manifest itself, the cash investor will 
largely believe that his real estate portfolio will act in the 
medium- to longer-term as a partial inﬂation hedge. 
Within the above strategic and tactical observations 
we will continue to run our business in accord with the 
same risk-averse policies which fashioned our track record 
over the last 15 years or so. Those strategies proved 
effective against the worst excesses of volatility that the 
UK market has ever seen and we believe will continue to 
do so.

operating-review 
The world in general, and 
the UK commercial property 
market in particular, seem 
non-committal as to the future 
direction of their markets. 
They may also simply be exhausted. It is nearly three and 
a half years since the banking crisis began, and there is 
still no apparent let up. A return to the comforts of the old 
normality looks as far away as ever. As is apparent from 
the still gathering ﬁscal storm in the peripheral nations 
of the Eurozone, policy is still struggling to get on top 
of the liquidity and solvency issues that lie at the heart of 
the crisis. 
Financial markets theoretically discount the future 
into today’s prices. However, they have been, to date, 
strangely schizophrenic. Anyone who bet on inﬂation 
and economic recovery, buying gold, equities or inﬂation-
linked bonds, made good money in 2010. Likewise, bets 
on deﬂation, namely nominal government bonds, have also 
paid off. This apparent conﬂict reﬂects the uncertainty 
felt by market participants as to whether the continued 
global economic recovery, which the equity markets are 
discounting, is built largely on government stimulus. 
Against this backdrop, it is somewhat surprising, 
given the degree of current inﬂation and currency 
depreciation in recent years, that ten-year gilt yields are 
still under 4.0 per cent. This reﬂects both the impact of 
quantitative easing and a belief that the UK deﬁcit will be 
brought under control in the medium-term and inﬂ ationary 
trends can be suppressed. 
However, there is a degree of risk that the present 
low bond yields may be coming to an end in response to 
improving economic trends and rising inﬂation. Lenders 
are starting to seek higher returns on their funds, and if 
longer-term rates climb this could have implications for 
property yields. 
Property values continued to rise during 2010 
against the market’s predictions, as investors sought to 
deploy cash earning a minimal return. However, much of 
this growth was front-loaded and the second six months of 
the year saw most values track sideways. 
We believe that markets will continue to undulate in 
response to the latest economic news. Economic stimulus 
from governments and resilient demand from Asia should 
allow a continued slow and patchy recovery. It is imperative 
that we recognise the swings in sentiment and adjust 
tactics if appropriate. 
This recovery should translate into commercial property 
values overall being ﬂat in 2011, with prime values up a 
little and secondary easing, making asset management 
the key to differentiation in performance. Slow economic 
recovery is not conducive to a swift return to rental growth, 
and this remains the case with rental values in all sectors 
apart from Central London. We believe it will be 2012, at 
the earliest, before the wider market will witness positive 
growth trends. In addition, shortening lease lengths and 
the slow unpicking of risk will impact on assets with short-
term lease events. 
The need to drive business performance by intensive 
asset management has prompted us to move our focus 
further up the ‘risk curve’ and deploy our full range of value 
add skills. Taking advantage of the lack of liquidity in the 
secondary market, and the resulting favourable pricing of 
assets, we have secured a number of projects where we 
are planning extensive refurbishment or redevelopment, in 
order to create institutional-grade investment stock. 
At this point in the property cycle, major development 
requirements are naturally few. Those that have arisen 
have been almost exclusively in Central London. We have 
reviewed several opportunities, and submitted bids on 
some, but we have been outbid by others with perhaps a 
more bullish view of medium-term occupier demand.

for major development, we 
have been active in pursuing 
our existing projects at 
PaddingtonCentral and 
West Quay, Southampton, 
and bringing forward our 
prospective new scheme 
in Hammersmith. 
At Two Kingdom Street, PaddingtonCentral, we completed 
the 274,000 sq. ft. net prime ofﬁce accommodation 
ﬂagship of this project where we are in partnership with 
Aviva Investors and Irish-based Avestus. Whilst 75,000 
sq. ft. was rapidly let in the spring to Astra Zeneca, interest 
in the remaining 199,000 sq. ft. has been subdued. At St 
Bride Street, London EC4 
01
, forward-funded by Corpus 
Sireo and completed in 2010, after a quiet year, 2011 has 
started well, and we currently have 12,000 sq. ft. ofﬁce 
accommodation under offer.

Looking into the future we are now bringing forward, with 
a view to start in 2011, the detailed design of two ofﬁce 
buildings at PaddingtonCentral (Four and Five Kingdom 
02
Street 
03 
)
. At Hammersmith Grove we hope for a 
determination of our planning application in March 2011, 
four months after we completed the purchase of the 
property. The Hammersmith site accommodates 275,000 
sq. ft. net of prime ofﬁces in two buildings with the ﬁrst 
phase comprising 105,000 sq. ft. net. We intend to build 
this speculatively on a forward-funded basis. 
At Slough, the council will complete its handsome 
new bus interchange in mid-2011, allowing us to demolish 
the existing station, so clearing the way for the ﬁrst phase 
of this 350,000 sq. ft. ofﬁce development. Speculative 
development here is unlikely to be viable in 2011, so we 
04
shall be marketing for pre-lets . 
Outside the South East, speculative development of 
commercial ofﬁces will be a rare phenomenon in current 
markets. Accordingly, our strategy at Cambourne, 
Cambridge; Curzon Street, Birmingham and Axis Tower, 
Manchester is to minimise expenditure and wait. All these 
locations are established, with strong commercial markets 
and, with very low levels of new product across the board, 
a return of conﬁdence across the wider economy will 
induce a recovery of rental growth prospects, the key pre­ condition for funding of speculative development. We see 
Manchester recovering ﬁrst. It should not be forgotten that 
Curzon Street is in any event currently in something of a 
siding, having been identiﬁed as the site of Birmingham’s 
new high-speed rail station. Whilst, for the moment, 
we are hamstrung by this proposal, the possible location 
of Birmingham’s HS2 station on this site will of course 
signiﬁcantly enhance the location. 
Our hotel development at West Quay, Southampton, 
pre-let to Premier Inn 
05 
and forward-sold to AMEC 
Pension Fund, is on target to complete in mid-2011. 
Turning to new business, we remain active bidders 
for sites and opportunities in most London locations. On 
good sites in prime locations, bidding is very competitive, 
with London exhibiting its enduring attraction as a store of 
value to the international investor. This often drives down 
returns to the point when they are too low to attract our 
capital, which can be invested elsewhere in the UK to 
deliver the appropriate return for our shareholders.

liquidity to the development 
marketplace. Having access 
to capital, we have considered 
a range of opportunities arising 
for this reason, and selected a 
number of acquisitions off ering 
strong returns. 
These projects are across a range of sectors and regions, 
with the common features mostly being their requirement 
for equity and for signiﬁcant and often complex added 
value components. These projects are generally controlled 
by the Group, sometimes in partnership with others, 
working with specialists to access sectors or regions which 
are new to us. 
Retail developments 
In March 2010, we acquired a shopping precinct and car 
park in Hale Barns, an afﬂ uent suburb of Manchester. We 
Other 
development and 
trading activity 
have submitted a planning application for a comprehensive 
redevelopment comprising a 30,000 sq. ft. food store which 
has been pre-leased to Booths, 12,000 sq. ft. of further 
retail accommodation and 24 residential units. We expect 
to obtain planning permission shortly and, subject to 
resolving the ﬁnal vacant possession issues, will be 
commencing development later this year. It is likely that 
the scheme will be developed in conjunction with an 
institutional development partner. 
At the Wick Site in Littlehampton, we were 
sufﬁciently encouraged by the site’s planning potential to 
take a surrender of the occupational leases for a reverse 
premium of £4.9 million. We now have a seven-acre 
development site held in our books at an industrial land 
valuation which should offer signiﬁcant upside if a retail-
led planning consent can be secured. 
Residential developments 
We believe that selected residential markets offer 
interesting demand/supply dynamics and we have 
reviewed a number, along with specialist partners. 
At Westminster Palace Gardens, London SW1, 
which we acquired in June 2010, we have secured planning 
consent for the change of use of 22 ofﬁce suites to residential 
use and have obtained vacant possession of the majority 
of these units. We are now preparing the tender for the 
conversion works. The continued strength of the Central 
London residential market is encouraging and we hope to 
exceed our original forecast returns from this development. 
Since the year-end we have completed the 
£5.0 million acquisition of a single dwelling house on the 
Sandbanks peninsula, Dorset 
06
, which has planning 
permission for demolition and redevelopment as four 
luxury apartments. Development works will commence 
immediately and we are hopeful of securing early sales. 
Interestingly, of the 60 deals undertaken on the peninsula 
in 2010, only eight required mortgage ﬁnance. Our ability 
to transact with cash allowed us to secure the opportunity 
at an attractive entry price, since local and regional 
developers lacked access to capital. 
Mixed-use developments 
We continue to believe that the suburban London market will 
offer interesting mixed-use development opportunities as the 
demand for residential accommodation in London continues 
to be ﬁrm. This activity continues to build upon the principles 
of density of development and mix of uses that we secured 
07
earlier at our Colindale, London NW9 development . 
To date, we have secured two new opportunities in 
this sector. In May, we entered into a joint venture with Orion 
Land & Leisure Limited to fund the planning and land

acquisition costs to facilitate a 300,000 sq. ft. mixed-use 
residential and retail development in Shepherds Bush, West 
London. Since entering into the joint funding arrangement 
we have been selected as preferred developer by the 
London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and entered 
into option agreements with the key landowners. A planning 
strategy brief for the area has also been adopted and we are 
now preparing to submit a planning application in the second 
quarter of 201 1. An assessment of our development options 
will be made once planning consent has been obtained. 
In September we entered into a joint funding 
arrangement with Cathedral Group to promote a 2.5 acre 
site in Greenwich, South East London, for a 300,000 
sq. ft. mixed-use development. Simultaneously, we 
entered into a contract, conditional on planning, for the site 
purchase and have recently submitted a planning 
application for our proposals which we are hopeful of 
seeing consented in the second quarter of 2011. We are 
already in discussions with end users for the hotel, 
affordable housing and student accommodation with a 
view to securing early commitments conditional upon 
planning. The strategy in respect of the private residential 
accommodation will be determined later. 
We are in early stage negotiations on two further, 
similar projects in East London which are food store led 
mixed-use schemes incorporating a residential element. 
Both schemes are situated near major transport interchanges. 
Since the year-end we have acquired for £4.3 million 
an industrial and ofﬁce complex in a residential area of 
Watford, Hertfordshire. Currently yielding circa 8.5 per 
cent, we intend to secure residential planning consent on 
the majority of the site, retaining part of the site for 
employment uses. This granular activity has limited 
downside risk, yielding an attractive income return but with 
potential development upside. Again, our ability to transact 
for cash was important in securing the property. 
Other sectors 
We are also reviewing other specialist sectors in partnership 
with sector experts and during the course of 2010 signed 
framework agreements with two specialist care home 
developers. The UK’s demographics are supportive of 
increasing demand for care homes and we believe that the 
sector will in time mature into a mainstream investment 
class offering long-term indexed leases. We intend only to 
pursue opportunities which are either pre-let or pre-sold, 
choosing operators cautiously in a sector not unknown for 
its signiﬁcant ﬁnancing issues. We have recently 
commenced an 80-bed care home in Dartmouth which is 
pre-sold to an end user. We hope to secure further 
opportunities in this sector in 2011. 
Bank portfolios 
We have continued to work with several banks to resolve 
third party situations requiring both capital and expertise. 
During 2010 we completed transactions with three 
different banks. In July, we acquired Airport House 
08
 in 
Croydon for £7.8 million from LPA Receivers acting on 
behalf of Bank of Ireland, with the bank providing stapled 
ﬁnance. This local landmark building is a well-located 
serviced ofﬁce which was underperforming because the 
previous owner lacked the capital required to maintain the 
quality of accommodation. We have commenced a 
programme of refurbishment works and have already seen 
improving income and occupancy levels. 
In September, we acquired a vacant 103-key hotel 
in the Braehead area of Glasgow 
09
 from LPA Receivers 
acting on behalf of Allied Irish Bank for £3.9 million. The 
price represented a capital value per key of £40,000, 
which was less than its replacement cost. We have granted 
a 25-year management contract to the Campanile Group, 
part of the Starwood Hotel Group. The hotel reopened in 
November and early indications are promising. 
In November we acquired 14 assets (the ‘Rock 
portfolio’) for £23.2 million from LPA Receivers acting on 
behalf of Lloyds Banking Group. Several of the properties 
have asset management potential, requiring the Group’s 
combination of expertise and capital. We have a two- to 
three-year business plan for the portfolio, and have already 
implemented signiﬁcant initiatives which should result in 
some early disposals. We believe that the realisation of the 
portfolio will make a signiﬁcant contribution to the Group’s 
proﬁts. The portfolio has an average lot size of circa 
£1.6 million. An ability to deal with detail and complexity will 
be an important theme in 201 1 as the banks are reluctant to 
take a signiﬁcant discount for uncertainty and Development 
Securities’ willingness and ability to undertake this analysis 
as part of the bidding process represents an advantage 
over competitors in the marketplace. 
These three transactions conﬁrm that the Group is 
increasingly accepted by the banks as a reliable partner 
in the deleveraging of their balance sheets; the Rock 
transaction illustrates our capability in increasingly larger 
deal sizes. 
We continue to pursue such opportunities. We 
believe that the terms of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) ‘bailout’ of the Irish banking sector will require those 
banks, in conjunction with the National Asset Management 
Agency (NAMA), to accelerate their debt reduction activity. 
We have invested time in 2010 in building relationships 
with key market participants and these efforts should 
provide the foundation for a subsequent deal ﬂow.

HDD had been a strategic partner of the Group since 
2007, specialising in the development of local shopping 
centres, in particular within new residential schemes, and 
we acquired the whole of the business in March 2010. We 
consider that HDD has signiﬁcant growth potential as it 
focuses on food store anchored development, an area 
where occupier demand remains high; however, the 
business needed a ﬁrmer capital base in order to capture 
this growth and secure its pipeline of opportunities. The 
full integration of the business has been implemented and 
HDD has achieved a number of notable successes in 
the year. 
At Stanground in Peterborough, planning perm­ ission was secured for a 45,000 sq. ft. food store led 
development. The land consented for food store use was 
sold to Morrisons, producing a proﬁt of £0.5 million. 
At Lawley, Telford 
10
, planning consent was achieved for 
a mixed-use scheme anchored by a 35,000 sq. ft. food 
store, which has been pre-let to Morrisons, and further 
retail, residential and ancillary uses. Funding discussions 
with institutional partners are now under way ahead of a 
start on site in 2011. 
Planning permission has also been received for a 
11
circa 50,000 sq. ft. leisure scheme in Llanelli , 
Carmarthenshire, including a 53-key hotel and ofﬁces. 
HDD has secured pre-lets on 50 per cent of the 
accommodation and the scheme will commence on site 
in April 2011, with a target completion date of autumn 
2012, by which time further lettings should have 
been secured. 
At Bannerbrook   
12 
in Coventry, HDD completed a 
10,800 sq. ft. retail parade, with seven of the eight units 
let in advance of practical completion. The asset will be 
marketed for institutional sale in the Spring. 
HDD continues to secure new opportunities and 
three new projects have been added in 2010.

and expertise by working 
with selected partners whose 
strengths and skills are 
complementary with our own. 
Manchester Arena Complex 
The Manchester Arena Complex was the Group’s most 
signiﬁcant acquisition in 2010. The purchase was concluded 
in June, and the joint venture formally completed in August. 
The Arena is the largest indoor venue in Europe and attracts 
over one million visitors per annum. Immediately following 
acquisition, we re-geared the lease on the Arena to the 
incumbent operator allowing us to make an immediate 
revaluation gain of £9.5 million, of which the Group’s share 
was £2.8 million. We are pursuing further asset management 
initiatives identiﬁed in conjunction with our partners, Patron 
Capital Partners. We regard this transaction as the 
beginning of an investment management activity, adopting 
similar principles to our development business and leveraging 
off our long-term performance track record. 
CTP 
CTP, our associate company based in Manchester, has 
successfully completed several developments and continues 
to review a number of potential new schemes. 
In November practical completion was reached on a 
35,000 sq. ft. food store in Neston, Lancashire 
13
, pre-
sold to Sainsbury’s. In October CTP also achieved practical 
completion of a mixed-use scheme in Kensington, 
Liverpool where the majority of the accommodation had 
been let or sold by practical completion. 
Planning permission has been achieved for a 
100,000 sq. ft. food store in Hattersley, Greater 
Manchester 
14
. Terms are under discussion for forward-
funding, and CTP expects to commence work on site in 
the ﬁrst half of 2011. 
CTP has identiﬁed three new projects with similar 
characteristics to those acquired by the Group, where the 
ability to introduce both equity and expertise will be rewarded 
with higher than normal risk-adjusted returns. 
Beyond Green 
Beyond Green Developments (formerly Blue Living) 
specialises in sustainable development with a focus on 
urban extensions. We are working with them to bring 
forward selected large developments designed and 
planned on sustainable principles. During the year the 
team has continued to pursue a planning appeal for a major 
15
scheme in Tilehurst, near Reading in Berkshire . 
In addition, they have secured a promotion agreement 
for a 3,500 residential unit scheme in Norwich, in respect 
of which it is intended to submit a planning application 
during 2011. 
Wessex Investors 
Wessex Investors are our local partners in the West 
Country, working with us to implement individual asset 
improvement plans, and to bring forward new opportunities. 
In Plymouth we have acquired an existing hotel 
on a site with potential for retail-led redevelopment. 
The hotel will be operated under a management contract 
to produce income whilst the planning strategy is 
progressed. This type of complicated development 
proposition is not untypical of those we are seeing, offering 
signiﬁcant upside with limited downside risk. 
Barwood 
Since entering our strategic land promotion venture with 
Barwood Group, we have been pleased with progress on 
each of the secured projects, although the recent major 
revisions to the planning system have prompted a review 
of our approach in each case. The venture has obtained 
planning consents on two smaller sites which will now be 
sold in the open market to capitalise on the shortage of 
supply to the market of smaller parcels of land.

Throughout 2010, we remained 
committed to our strategy of 
focusing on assets with a mix of 
core defensive income and asset 
enhancement initiatives to drive 
value in the medium-term. 
As at 31st December 2010 the portfolio comprised 
37 assets with a fair value of £199.2 million, increased from 
33 assets at £181.0 million a year earlier. We retain our 
strong discipline in evaluating each opportunity both in 
respect of our existing portfolio and new assets, since 
income return will come under increasing pressure in this 
stage of the current economic cycle. 
The revaluation of the direct investment portfolio at 
December 2010 showed a capital gain of £8.8 million or 
4.6 per cent. We were pleased to achieve a 15.2 per cent 
IPD Total Portfolio Return in 2010, equal to the IPD UK 
Quarterly Property Index return. The IPD Index return 
beneﬁted from a strong contribution from Central London, 
excluding which the Index would have shown 10.1 per cent. 
Our portfolio does not include Central London exposure, 
indicating an outperformance in regional and secondary 
markets of 50 per cent. 
This builds on our record over several years, which 
saw us secure in April a prestigious IPD award for the 
highest three-year annualised return within the specialist 
funds sector. 
The average initial yield in 2010 was 6.12 per cent 
compared with 6.82 per cent in 2009. 
Acquisitions during the year added £4.9 million to 
the rent roll, which was reduced by £1.9 million through the 
sales of Grimsby and Warrington. New lettings within the 
portfolio during the year totalled 101,067 sq. ft. and rent 
of £1.3 million. Voids within the completed portfolio rose 
slightly from 7.5 per cent to 8.0 per cent, principally owing 
to the acquisition of Pearl Assurance House, Nottingham, 
with a business plan of rolling refurbishment within the 
ofﬁce accommodation. Overall, contracted annual rent 
rose to £12.5 million from £11.6 million as at the previous 
year end. 
At Atlantic Village, Bideford it has been another 
active and successful year. Key lettings have been secured 
to Gap and Nike which serve to strengthen further the 
scheme’s attractiveness with footfall at the scheme up 
20 per cent year-on-year as a direct consequence. With 
the anchor tenants now in place, we are working on the 
remainder of the Centre to improve the line up. We also 
feel that the scheme is now sufﬁciently strong to progress 
the proposed extension, and we have recently submitted a 
planning application for a further 84,000 sq. ft. of retail 
accommodation on existing land to provide a second 
anchor area to the scheme. It is expected that planning will 
be obtained later this year and that circa 50 per cent of the 
space will be pre-let before a start on site is made. 
During 2010 we acquired a 40 per cent interest in land 
known as Atlantic Park, located directly across the road from 
Atlantic Village. This 20-acre site has recently been allocated 
in the Local Plan for a mixed-use development and we are 
working up a planning application for submission in 2012. 
At The Furlong Shopping Centre, Ringwood 
16
, we 
have had a successful year in capturing, through rent 
reviews, the rental reversion generated through our 
earlier letting campaign. We continue to improve the tenant 
mix at the Centre and to work on our Phase II proposals, 
where the land acquisition strategy is nearing completion 
and a revised planning application should be made in 201 1. 
At Kingsland Shopping Centre, Thatcham, several 
smaller lettings have served to improve trading. We are 
also giving active consideration to a 10,000 sq. ft. 
extension to the Centre. This additional ﬂoor space will 
enhance the retail critical mass, which is the next stage in 
the value creation process. 
At Crown Glass Shopping Centre, Nailsea 
17
, we 
were much encouraged by Waitrose taking over the former 
Somerﬁeld unit adjacent to our holding. We have seen 
elsewhere just how powerful the impact of this can be on

adjoining retail units and this is starting to occur at Nailsea 
as existing tenants such as HSBC have sought to upsize their 
space and WH Smith are under offer on a unit. We plan to 
continue this process in 2011 whilst working on our 
development plans for further retail accommodation on the 
land we acquired adjacent to the Centre. 
At Swanley Shopping Centre, Swanley 
18
, the 
opening of the Wilkinson unit has provided a much needed 
anchor for the scheme and we are already seeing both new 
occupiers enter the scheme and existing tenants renew their 
leases. In 2011, we need to build on this momentum whilst 
developing, in conjunction with the Local Authority, our 
ideas for an expansion of the scheme in the medium-term. 
At The Broadway, Bexleyheath, we secured an 
expansion of the Primark unit, simultaneously re-gearing 
the lease to a new 25-year term. This activity added ten per 
cent to the asset value and underscores how important a 
proactive asset management strategy can be in a low-
growth environment. 
At the same time, we need to consider the overall 
return potential of the portfolio and dispose of those assets 
where performance has peaked or whose performance may 
be better driven by an alternative strategy outside our core 
skill base. These were the reasons behind the disposals of 
the House of Fraser store in Grimsby (where we considered 
that performance had peaked) and The Genesis Centre, 
Warrington (where more intensive local management was 
needed in these recessionary times). 
The sales achieved a proﬁt over their fair value as 
at 31st December 2009 of £0.3 million. The Grimsby 
property had been acquired only in July 2009, and 
achieved a selling price of £13.2 million against its 
acquisition cost of £10.5 million 14 months earlier. 
Inevitably these disposals remove valuable income, 
and we are pleased to report that the Grimsby income has 
now been replaced by the acquisition of three assets 
in Burnley, Port Talbot and Carmarthen totalling 
£11.8 million, yielding 8.9 per cent and with a weighted 
unexpired lease term of 8.9 years. These assets, whilst 
primarily acquired for their income, also have a degree of 
value-added potential. We continue to seek similar assets 
to replace the Warrington rent roll.

Corporate Responsibility 
ww7 .investorrelations.co.uk/devsec/ar10/ 
corporate-responsibility 
Our approach to corporate 
responsibility (CR) is fully 
integrated within our 
business strategy. 
The Executive Directors have set objectives, which have 
been consistent for many years, in each of the ﬁve key 
areas of corporate and social responsibility that are 
material to our business: Corporate, Environment, 
Employees and Suppliers, Community and Investors. 
Targets for performance in each area are set annually. 
A formal report is made to the Projects Board 
on every live development project each month. These 
reports are required to refer to health and safety matters 
and all other material issues affecting the Company’s 
CR objectives. 
Each year, this information is consolidated and 
recorded by an Executive Director; the progress made is 
assessed and targets are proposed for the following year. 
The Executive Directors as a whole will then discuss 
performance to date and agree new targets. 
Integrated approach 
When planning and bidding for development and 
investment opportunities, the brieﬁng material we give to 
our consultants outlines our CR policies and detailed 
aspirations. Through early consideration in the design 
process, safety, sustainability and environmental con­ siderations become embedded in all our projects. 
As our joint venture business develops, it is our 
intention to share our knowledge and ambitions with 
our partners. 
Corporate 
Objectives 
Develop our minimum standards and advance from 
regulatory compliance towards good practice in sus tain­ able and responsible development. 
 Improve our internal reporting on corporate responsibility 
(CR) matters against our targets and objectives. To 
ensure sustained improvement and commitment to our 
objectives. 
Targets for 2010 
 Establish biannual performance reporting to the Board 
and publish this information on our website,
 www.developmentsecurities.com. 
2010 Progress 
 Reporting was improved through the Projects Board. 
 The nature of reporting (by exception) and the limitations 
of our website prevented us from publishing this 
information on our website. 
Our key objectives are clariﬁed within our brieﬁng 
documents to external consultants. Our surveyors remain 
individually responsible for implementing policy. This has 
continued with the planning applications for Paddington-
Central, Hammersmith Grove and Hale Barns. 
 Our surveyors tailor project strategy for project manage­ ment, sustainable development, waste management and 
BREEAM to suit the speciﬁcs of the development and to 
accord with our objectives. 
Targets for 2011 
 Improve our reporting structure further – surveyors shall 
report on CR matters to the Projects Board on all 
live development schemes by incorporating a written 
statement within their speciﬁc project reports. 
Update and review our corporate website to include 
current objectives and policy. 
Review our health and safety policies, including our 
internal handbook and HSE brieﬁng documents for 
external consultants. 
Review our project brieﬁng document and standard 
consultant appointments to reﬂect current CR Policy. 
 Develop a ‘brieﬁng document’ for our JV partners and 
Investment team. 
 Allocate a CR Co-ordinator internally to monitor our CR 
activities and review our targets annually. 
Environment 
Objectives 
Minimise energy and water consumption at all major 
developments, through good design, efﬁcient con­
struction site practices and advice to occupants. 
 Seek to minimise waste on developments. 
 On every project appoint suitably qualiﬁed consultants to 
advise on technical options available for sustainable 
development. 
Targets for 2010 
 Implement BREEAM assessments for all ofﬁce develop­ ments; plan to achieve an ‘Excellent’ rating; achieve a 
minimum rating of ‘Very Good’. 
To formally brief design teams on the importance of: 
energy efﬁcient design; selection and speciﬁcation 
of materials to minimise their environmental impact; use 
of pre-fabrication; production of a travel plan. 
 To formally brief construction teams on the importance

 emissions; minimising water 
use in construction; reduction, reuse and recycling of 
waste materials. 
2010 Progress 
 A planning approval for the next phase of Paddington-
Central is based on a design that seeks to achieve an 
Excellent BREEAM rating. 
Our planning application for Hammersmith Grove is 
designed to achieve an ‘Excellent’ BREEAM rating. 
 Our planning application for Hale Barns is predominantly 
retail led with residential above. The retail shell units seek 
a BREEAM ‘Very Good’ target and the residential units 
will target a Code 4 Sustainable Homes accreditation. 
 The Premier Inn Hotel at West Quay, Southampton will 
achieve a ‘Very Good’ rating and may yet achieve an 
‘Excellent’ rating with the assistance of the operator. The 
site is on contaminated, reclaimed land in the centre of 
the city. We have had an active waste management 
policy on site for the duration of the project and have 
recycled the concrete and reinforcements from the old 
structures that were grubbed up on site. A travel plan and 
employment strategy for the tenant will be drafted 
following consultation with the local authority. 
Targets for 2011 
 Benchmark and reduce carbon emissions from all future 
developments, in advance of legislation, by working with 
our design and contracting teams on speciﬁcations and 
site management techniques. 
Publish a written case study of one of our major 
developments highlighting the issues of socially responsi­ ble development. 
Employees and Suppliers 
Objectives 
 Maintain collegiate atmosphere; encourage and facilitate 
employee development. 
 Enforce policy to ensure the workplace health and safety 
of all employees and visitors. 
Liaise with construction teams to ensure compliance 
with health and safety best practice procedures. 
 Engage our major suppliers in our sustainable develop­ ment programme and maintain relations through periods 
of inactivity. 
Targets for 2010 
 Ensure the rigorous and consistent treatment of health 
and safety issues by improving on-site reporting and 
engagement with employees. 
 Operate a formal Board reporting process for workplace 
and site-based health and safety issues. 
 Ensure every major supplier understands our sustain-
ability objectives and targets and achieves satisfactory 
performance. 
2010 Progress 
 We have actively supported employees in their continuous 
personal and professional development including training 
courses, technical seminars, lectures and conferences. 
We have held team building events for our site 
developments and encourage participation in risk and 
opportunity sessions with all our team members. 
Our Health and Safety Ofﬁcer reports on risks and 
maintains and distributes a health and safety handbook. 
 We continually assess our external team’s suitability to 
perform their Construction, Design and Management 
(CDM) duties. 
 All project surveyors now report to the Projects Board 
on health and safety matters, highlighting any reportable 
accidents, our response, record-keeping and lessons 
learned. 
 We conduct annual reviews with key suppliers to discuss 
their and our current business objectives, including 
corporate responsibility policies. 
 We appointed a ‘librarian’ to collate and distribute to our 
surveyors technical information received from external 
sources. 
Targets for 2011 
 Extend health and safety reporting process to our joint 
venture partners and the main Board, through an 
obligation to report on any reportable accidents on our 
developments. 
 Review our internal and external HSE documentation. 
 Review our selection procedures for the appointment of 
the consultants that advise us on health, safety and 
environmental issues and CDM matters. 
Ensure that every major supplier understands our 
sustainability objectives and targets and achieves 
satisfactory performance; review our Standard Brieﬁng 
Document in March 2011.

Financial Review 
Graham Prothero 
Finance Director 
Since the equity raising in 2009, 
the Group has invested or committed 
equity of £109.6 million and 
deployed new debt of £133.8 million. 
Our reputation and risk-averse 
capital structure has enabled 
us to raise both equity and debt 
in a market where liquidity is 
constrained. 
Capital structure and liquidity management 
The Group’s strategy for its capital is to maintain a 
conservative balance of equity and debt appropriate to 
the proﬁle of our asset portfolio, achieving both certainty 
and ﬂexibility. This takes into consideration our wider 
operational strategy and our intentions for each asset, 
together with our expectations for the availability and cost 
of alternative sources of ﬁnance. 
Having successfully survived the effects of the 
banking crisis in late 2008 and early 2009, and made all 
appropriate loan-to-value repayments from its own 
resources, the Group was well placed in July 2009 to raise 
£100.0 million of new equity (£94.0 million net of 
expenses), through a Firm Placing, Placing and Open 
Offer. In March of 2010 we raised new 15-year, ﬁ xed rate 
debt of £58.2 million from Aviva Commercial Finance 
Limited, secured against a portfolio of new and existing 
investment properties. In the Spring of 2010, having made 
excellent progress in deploying the new equity, the 
Directors identiﬁed that the Group was continuing to see 
Resilience 
and fl exibility 
are key 
a growing stream of opportunities for further investment, 
and that this would rapidly exceed its remaining equity 
resources. Consequently, in July 2010, having committed 
circa £69.0 million of the equity raised in the previous year, 
the Group again approached shareholders and raised a 
further £100.2 million of new equity (£93.7 million 
net of expenses) through a successful Placing and 
Rights Issue. 
Since the equity raising in 2009, as at 31st December 
2010 the Group had expended and committed equity of 
£93.8 million, and deployed net new debt of £133.8 million, 
increasing to £109.6 million and £133.8 million as at the 
date of this report. 
Consequently, the Group’s gearing (including share 
of joint ventures) as at 31st December 2010 was 27.7 per 
cent, compared with 23.9 per cent at the beginning of the 
year. During the year this ratio peaked at 54.2 per cent, 
immediately before the Placing and Rights Issue. If joint 
ventures are excluded, the ﬁgures for December 2010 and 
2009 were 21.4 per cent and 18.7 per cent respectively. 
The current relatively low level of gearing reﬂects 
the recent equity issue. We expect to see this level continue 
to increase as the funds are invested. In line with our risk-
averse policy of maintaining a conservative level of gearing, 
as described on page 4, we target a level of between 
50 and 60 per cent as an efﬁcient operating level for 
the business. 
Our cash and overall liquidity is managed at Group 
level, with our investment, development and trading 
portfolios assessed and monitored according to their own 
speciﬁc risks. Within our debt facilities we maintain a mix 
of ﬁxed and variable rates, in general preferring the 
certainty of ﬁxed rates for our larger and longer-term 
borrowings. 
As described on page 5, the Group limits its risk 
in major development projects through the principle of 
forward sales. This is achieved in various ways, from 
the completed forward sale of the land and project 
assets, through to the contracted sale of the prospective 
development, with appropriate guarantees of completion. 
The Group’s direct contribution to more modest develop­ ment project ﬁnance is provided by way of equity and 
medium-term bank facilities which provide the necessary 
ﬂexibility to draw down funds as required. 
The Group’s investment portfolio is ﬁnanced by a 
blend of equity, the debenture loan and bank borrowings 
of an appropriate term for each asset or group of assets. 
Our investments in joint ventures and associates are 
funded from equity, with any relevant gearing deployed 
within the ventures themselves.

 Financial Review cont.

ﬁ nancial-review 
Responsibility for management of cash and liquidity risk 
rests with the Board. The executive team has systems in 
place for the monitoring and management of this key 
aspect of our business. Daily review is delegated to the 
Finance Director, who discusses this with the other 
members of the executive team at least on a weekly basis. 
The Board formally reviews the position at its meetings, 
which occur eight times per annum. 
The principal tools of assessment are a 15-month 
cash ﬂow forecast, which is updated in full on a quarterly 
basis and monthly for material changes, a schedule of 
agreed bank facilities and amounts drawn against them, 
a summary of net debt, including derivative instruments, 
a summary of current cash deposit balances and a formal 
commentary on the position prepared by the Finance 
Director for each Board meeting. 
For the longer-term, the Directors review the Group’s 
capital structure, taking account of the real estate cycle, 
any changes in the nature and liquidity of the Group’s asset 
portfolio, the likely forthcoming risks and opportunities for 
the Group, and the market for equity and debt ﬁnance. This 
is formally revisited at least twice per annum, via the 
Group’s Risk Committee, which reports to the Board, and 
at the Board’s annual strategy review. In addition this is 
discussed informally as appropriate at each Board meeting. 
Medium-term liquidity is arranged through a mix of the 
Group’s equity and its debt facilities. The continuing net 
withdrawal of bank debt from the property sector means 
that lending is very cautious. However, the Group has 
strong relationships with its lenders, and has not been 
constrained in arranging new debt during 2010, completing 
new facilities totalling £137.0 million. 
Reﬂecting the nature of the Group’s business, short-
term liquidity requirements are fairly predictable. Cash 
requirements are monitored on a monthly and weekly basis, 
and short-term cash balances are deposited accordingly. 
Cash management 
The Group’s temporarily high levels of cash have prompted 
a reconsideration of our policy on treasury management. 
Cash may be invested across a wider range of instruments, 
including instant and term deposit accounts, money 
market funds and commercial paper. The policy prioritises 
security and liquidity ahead of returns, and the Board has 
set limits for both minimum credit ratings and maximum 
concentrations with respect to counterparties. As at the 
year-end the Group had £104.1 million of cash held across 
eight banks.

Current bank facilities and borrowings 
The Group’s bank facilities are set out in the table on the 
previous page. As at 31st December 2010 the value of the 
Group’s gross borrowings was £175.5 million (2009: 
£126.2 million). Cash balances were £104.1 million (2009: 
£80.6 million), including amounts of £27.0 million held 
as restricted deposits, giving net debt of £71.4 million 
and gearing of 21.4 per cent (2009: £45.6 million and 
18.7 per cent). 
The Group’s share of net debt in joint ventures was 
£20.8 million (2009: £12.8 million); if this is aggregated 
with the Group balances, net debt rises to £92.2 million 
and gearing to 27.7 per cent (2009: £58.4 million and 
23.9 per cent). 
During 2010 the Group repaid loans totalling 
£18.9 million and reﬁnanced other borrowings totalling 
£24.1 million. We also cancelled certain facilities originally 
intended to ﬁnance the extension and redevelopment of 
certain investment assets, but which were deemed no 
longer appropriate for our asset management plans. 
In addition to the new loan of £58.2 million, the 
Group has drawn debt against several asset acquisitions. 
In June the Group arranged a two-year facility of 
£10.0 million for the acquisition and development of 
Westminster Palace Gardens; in the same month we drew 
down a ﬁve-year facility of £6.2 million from Bank of 
Ireland, secured against Airport House, Croydon, as part 
of the agreement for the acquisition of the asset from the 
administrator acting for the bank. Similarly in October we 
drew stapled three-year debt of £15.3 million from Lloyds 
Banking Group, in connection with the acquisition of the 
Rock portfolio. 
In March the Group and its partner each lent a further 
£5.0 million to the Curzon Park Limited joint venture, to 
enable the joint venture to make a part prepayment of its bank 
loan, reducing that borrowing to £15.6 million. In June the 
Group drew down £47.5 million for a term of three years in 
respect of the acquisition of the Manchester Arena Complex; 
in August this facility was transferred into the joint venture 
vehicle, in which the Group retains a 30 per cent stake. 
Committed facilities as at 1st March 2011 total 
£176.8 million, with a weighted average term of 9.1 years 
(falling to 8.5 years including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures). Unutilised facilities are £27.9 million. 
In the Group’s portfolio the earliest maturity date is 
June 2012, in respect of the Westminster Palace Gardens 
project, where the debt is expected to be repaid from 
project cash ﬂows and the Group has no plans to reﬁnance. 
The earliest maturity in respect of facilities ﬁnancing 
longer-term assets is January 2013. 
The bank loan to Curzon Park Limited matures in May 
2015, and the Group is keeping this under review, whilst 
monitoring the prospects for the asset itself (see page 86). 
The borrowings in respect of the Manchester Arena 
Complex joint venture mature in 2013; the Directors 
currently anticipate that this will either be reﬁnanced closer 
to that time, or repaid from an earlier sale of the asset. 
The Directors keep bank covenants under review, 
and are content with the current position. We aim to agree 
our loan-to-value covenants at comfortably tolerable levels, 
leaving sensible headroom for foreseeable changes in the 
general market or the speciﬁc asset. We also incorporate 
cure mechanisms into the facility documentation, such that 
we have an appropriate opportunity to restore the required 
loan-to-value ratio by making cash deposits or prepayments. 
Interest rate risk and hedging 
As at 31st December 2010 the summary of the Group’s 
interest rate exposure was as follows: 
Excluding share  Including share 
of joint ventures of joint ventures 
% % 
Fixed rate 43.8 39.0 
Floating rate, swapped into ﬁxed 26.5 30.7 
Floating rate with cap 8.6 7.7 
Floating rate 21.1 22.6 
The weighted average interest rate payable was 5.8 per 
cent (5.6 per cent including joint ventures). 
As noted in the table in note 16(d), interest rate caps 
and swaps are used to provide protection against exposure 
to interest rate ﬂuctuations. The Directors have maintained 
a mix of ﬁxed and variable rates, in order to provide an 
appropriate measure of certainty within the portfolio. 
Facilities with variable rates of interest, in particular 
longer-term facilities, expose the Group to the risk of 
interest rate ﬂuctuation, whilst ﬁxed rate instruments 
reduce ﬂexibility and incur break costs in the event of early 
settlement. The Directors keep these risks under continual 
review, and regularly consider the possibility and likely cost 
of extending our interest rate hedging. 
Interest rate swaps also carry counterparty risk, in 
respect of the potential failure of the bank on the other side 
of the transaction. The Group mitigates this risk by dealing 
only with major banks and monitors their continuing 
creditworthiness. There is no current indication that any of 
the Group’s hedging counterparties may be unable to 
settle its obligations. 
Interest rate swaps are marked to market in 
the Balance Sheet, giving rise to the risk of fair value

movements in the derivative instrument, and a consequent 
impact on net asset value. The Group also holds a cross-
currency interest rate swap, which is designated as a cash 
ﬂow hedge. Movements in the foreign currency leg of this 
swap provide a hedge against movements in the fair value 
of the €47 million loan notes. Movements in the interest 
leg are taken to reserves. The effects of these fair value 
adjustments in the year to 31st December 2010 are set out 
in the note Derivative ﬁnancial instruments on page 40. 
Other ﬁnancial instrument risks 
Development and trading portfolios 
The principal ﬁ nancial instrument risks in these assets are 
the credit risk in counterparties. Given the nature of these 
assets the amounts owed to the Group can be signiﬁ cant, 
and these arrangements are monitored very closely both 
before contracts are exchanged and throughout the 
execution period. 
The current phase in the cycle means that the Group 
has no major development debtors. The Group is contracted 
to provide £5.0 million of development funding for each 
phase at PaddingtonCentral, in respect of which it earns 
interest and a proﬁt share, both subject to the proﬁtability 
of the phase. The Group’s development partners, who are 
contracted to pay this interest and proﬁt share at the 
completion of each phase, and to repay the capital at the 
end of the development, are large ﬁnancial institutions. 
This risk capital is held as a development participation 
within available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, and at the year­ end was valued at £5.0 million (2009: £5.0 million), as 
described in note 16(a) to the Group ﬁ nancial statements. 
The Directors are satisﬁed that the combination of the 
Group’s risk-averse approach to development funding, its 
cautious selection of development partners and its focused 
and active management of each project provide reasonable 
comfort over the risks of these ﬁnancial exposures. 
Investment portfolio 
The principal ﬁnancial instrument risk in the investment 
portfolio is the credit risk implicit in potential tenant failure. 
The Group maintains the portfolio under continuous 
review. The portfolio is managed by local agents, with 
active involvement by the Group’s investment team. The 
Board receives at each of its meetings analyses of tenant 
proﬁle (including the concentration of credit risk, both by 
sector and by entity), existing and anticipated voids, 
overdue rents, and future and outstanding rent reviews, as 
well as a formal commentary by the investment team. The 
current proﬁle of the portfolio and comments on 
performance in 2010 are set out on pages 29 to 31. 
Projects in partnership 
As described in the Operating Review, the Group is 
conducting an increasing proportion of its business in 
partnership with others, where the Group brings both 
development expertise and funding. These interests are 
carried in a number of balance sheet categories, and are 
summarised in note 26 to the Group ﬁnancial statements. 
The ﬁnancial instrument risks in respect of projects 
in partnership are the ﬁnancial strength and integrity of the 
operating partner, the contractual risk in the partnership 
arrangements and the operating success of the venture. 
The Group manages these risks by securing appropriate 
rights in each case over the use of the Group’s invested 
capital and by active participation in the joint strategic and 
operating control of the ventures. The Directors have 
increased the resources dedicated to this element of our 
internal control, and reﬁned the required level of reporting 
to the Board in this regard. 
Contingent liabilities 
Contingent liabilities are described in note 23 to the Group 
ﬁnancial statements. The Directors ensure that these risks 
are appropriately documented and monitored, and that the 
risk of actual liabilities arising is restricted so far as 
is possible. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group’s operations are conducted almost exclusively 
in the UK. The Group’s principal exposure to foreign 
currency movements is in the €47 million Euro-
denominated loan notes, which is fully hedged to provide 
an effective Sterling liability. The details of the Group’s 
sensitivity to exchange rate movements are set out in note 
16(c) to the Group ﬁnancial statements. 
Maximum credit risk exposure 
The Directors consider that the maximum credit risk 
exposure in each class of ﬁnancial asset is represented by 
the carrying value as at 31st December 2010. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out on pages 4 and 5, in the Chief 
Executive’s Statement on pages 8 and 9 and in the 
Operating Review on page 11. The ﬁnancial position of the 
Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position, borrowing facilities 
and ﬁnancial instrument risks are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 35 to 41, which also cover the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, 
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives, details of its

ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities, and its Net rental income 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. Note 16 to the 
Financial statements gives further information about the 
Group’s ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities. 
The Group has considerable ﬁnancial resources. 
Rental income continues to be robust, with the risk of 
signiﬁcant default assessed by the Directors as low. Our 
development and trading activities are well-diversiﬁed 
across regions and sectors. Our debt ﬁnance is secured 
for appropriate periods and we are comfortable with our 
covenant positions. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully, despite the continuing uncertain 
economic outlook. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. 
Result for the year and net asset value 
Proﬁt before tax for the year was £2.6 million, an 
improvement from the prior year loss of £1 1.4 million. After 
an unrealised loss of £2.8 million in respect of an interest 
rate swap, and a small loss on operating property 
revaluation, Total comprehensive income for the year was 
a negative £0.7 million (2009: negative £9.0 million). 
The investment portfolio produced a contribution of 
£9.5 million, together with net revaluations of £8.8 million 
in the direct portfolio and a further £3.4 million in the 
Manchester Arena Complex joint venture. Proﬁts from 
development and trading were £5.5 million. Operating 
costs totalled £12.9 million and net ﬁnance costs (including 
swap revaluations) were £12.8 million. 
Other movements in net assets were dividend 
payments of £3.9 million and the proceeds of the Placing and 
Rights Issue of £93.7 million, giving a net asset value as at 
31st December 2010 of £333.1 million and 272 pence per

£2.0 million paid in July 2010 to the net asset value as at 30th June 2010. 
Gross rental income from the investment portfolio grew by 
28 per cent to £12.8 million (2009: £9.9 million), the 
increase arising from both new investment properties 
acquired (£1.4 million) and letting and rent review activity 
on the existing portfolio (£1.5 million). Direct costs reduced 
to £3.7 million from £4.6 million in 2009, with the net 
charge within this ﬁgure in respect of onerous lease 
provisions falling from £1.7 million in 2009 to £0.4 million 
in 2010. As a result net rental income improved to 
£9.2 million from £5.5 million in 2009. 
Development and trading proﬁ ts 
Proﬁts from development and trading activity recovered to 
£5.5 million, net of abortive costs, from a net breakeven in 
2009, with contributions from several projects. The sale of 
Canon House, Wallington produced a proﬁt of £1.1 million, 
and a further £1.0 million of proﬁt arose from the premium 
in respect of the lease surrender at the Wick Site, 
Littlehampton. The hotel development at West Quay, 
Southampton generated a proﬁt of £0.7 million (being 
accounted for as a construction contract under IAS 11), 
and HDD’s sale at Stanground contributed £0.5 million 
(over and above its fair value on acquisition in March 2010). 
Rents from the development and trading property portfolio 
contributed £2.4 million, including £1.1 million from the 
Weeke Local Centre, Winchester. 
Operating costs 
Operating costs were £12.9 million, a slight increase from 
the 2009 ﬁ gure of £12.8 million. Within these totals, staff 
costs increased in 2010 by £0.7 million to £7.5 million, 
principally reﬂecting the consolidation of HDD since the 
acquisition in March. The 2009 total included a non­ recurring charge of £1.4 million for a capital contribution in 
respect of a sub-letting. 
Net ﬁ nance costs 
Interest income during the year was £1.4 million, slightly 
above the prior year ﬁgure of £1.0 million on higher average 
cash balances, but continuing to reﬂect very low deposit 
rates. Interest payable increased to £10.9 million from 
£9.1 million in 2009, on higher average borrowings and a 
slightly higher proportion of ﬁxed rate debt. 
Interest payable included a charge of £0.8 million in 
respect of the revaluation of swap instruments on two 
loans. During the year both loans were repaid, incurring 
break costs of £2.9 million, of which £2.1 million had been 
provided as at 31st December 2009. A further charge of 
£2.8 million was taken to Other comprehensive income in 
respect of the cross-currency ﬁxed rate swap relating

Notes (see note Derivative ﬁnancial instruments on 
page 40). 
Interest capitalised against development projects 
was £nil in 2010, compared with a ﬁgure of £1.4 million 
in 2009. 
Investment portfolio 
The carrying value of investment property increased from 
£181.0 million in December 2009 to £199.2 million at 
December 2010. 
Details of acquisitions, disposals and valuation 
movements are set out in note 10(c) to the ﬁnancial 
statements, and further analyses of the management and 
performance of the portfolio are given in the Operating 
Review on pages 29 to 31. 
Sales of investment properties during the year 
produced a small net gain of £0.3 million over their fair value 
as at 31st December 2009. 
Inventory – development and trading properties 
As described in the Operating Review on pages 10 to 31, 
following the equity raises in 2009 and 2010 the Group 
has acquired a number of sites with potential for 
redevelopment. Under accounting rules this work in 
progress is stated not at fair value, but at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value; hence any improvement in value 
is reported only on sale. Acquisitions of development and 
trading assets during 2010 were £89.7 million, with a 
further £3.2 million added to existing schemes. Included 
in this were the Rock portfolio at £24.6 million and 
Westminster Palace Gardens at £10.5 million, as well as 
HDD projects of a further £23.1 million, including 
£18.1 million of existing work in progress consolidated on 
acquisition. Net of disposals during the year, inventory 
increased by £79.1 million to £157.7 million. 
Joint ventures 
The increase in the carrying value of investments in joint 
ventures from £nil in 2009 to £9.7 million in 2010 reﬂ ects 
the Group’s 30 per cent share of the Manchester Arena 
Complex joint venture (MAC), established in July 2010. 
MAC reported proﬁt for the six-month period since 
acquisition of £1 1.4 million. Key to this level of performance 
was the revaluation gain, achieved primarily through the 
regearing of the principal lease. The Group’s share of proﬁt 
after tax was £3.4 million. 
The loss of £0.5 million in Curzon Park Limited 
mainly represented interest on the bank loan. The Group’s 
share of net assets of the joint venture was written down 
to £nil in 2008. As at 31st December 2010, the Group has 
a debtor due from the joint venture of £5.0 million, held 
within Financial assets and has provided a guarantee for 
its share of the joint venture’s bank loan of £15.6 million, 
as noted within contingent liabilities. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are analysed in note 16 to the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
The Group’s Euro-denominated loan notes and the related 
cross-currency hedge are carried as separate instruments 
in the Balance Sheet. During 2010 Sterling strengthened 
slightly against the Euro, decreasing the effective Sterling 
liability of the loan by £1.4 million and reducing the fair 
value of the derivative asset by a similar ﬁgure. The 
softening of EURIBOR interest rates over the period 
caused a further reduction in the value of the swap, such 
that its total fair value reduced to £3.3 million, from 
£7.5 million at the previous year end. 
Other ﬁnancial assets 
Other ﬁnancial assets include the Group’s participation in 
the third phase of PaddingtonCentral, which has been 
revalued by the Directors at £5.0 million (unchanged from 
the previous year), together with loans to a number of 
associate companies. During the year the Group advanced 
a further £2.4 million to CTP, taking the total investment 
in that company to £14.3 million. New loans were provided 
to the Cathedral Group (£1.4 million) and Barwood 
(£1.2 million). The loans to HDD of £9.9 million as at 
December 2009 are now eliminated on consolidation, 
following the acquisition of that group during the year. 
The representation of the Group’s projects in 
partnership under IFRS is complex, being a mixture of 
equity and loan instruments. An analysis of the Group’s 
interests and the accounting treatment of each is set out 
in note 26 to the Group ﬁnancial statements. 
Cash and borrowings 
Details of the Group’s borrowings and cash management 
are set out in note 16(b) to the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
and in the Financial Review on pages 35 to 38.

The gross debt ﬁgure includes the €47 million 2027 
Unsecured Subordinated Loan Note facility, stated in 
Sterling at the current fair value of £40.3 million (2009: 
£41.7 million), and ignoring the hedging instrument. If 
these loan notes are removed from borrowings, gearing 
falls to 12.7 per cent. This is calculated by deducting from 
net debt the current fair value of £40.3 million (2009: 
£41.7 million) and adding back relevant restricted cash 
balances of £10.1 million (2009: £10.3 million) and 
transaction costs of £1.1 million (2009: £1.1 million). 
Taxation 
The tax charge for the year was £1.0 million, principally 
representing an increase in the Group’s deferred tax 
liability of £0.8 million. The Group has signiﬁcant potential 
deferred tax asset balances, but the Directors have 
restricted recognition to the amount of corresponding 
deferred tax liabilities, as uncertain market conditions do 
not offer sufﬁcient probability of proﬁts in the foreseeable 
future within the terms of IAS 12. The charge in the period 
principally reﬂects the deferred tax in respect of revaluation 
gains. There is a corresponding credit of £0.8 million in 
Other comprehensive income, representing additional 
recognition of the deferred tax asset. Tax movements and 
balances are set out in notes 7 and 17 to the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
Dividends 
The Board will recommend to shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting on 27th May 2011 a ﬁnal dividend of 
2.4 pence per share (2009: 2.4 pence per share) to be 
paid on 6th July 2011 to shareholders on the register 
on 3rd June 2011. This ﬁnal dividend, amounting to 
£2.9 million, has not been included as a liability at 
31st December 2010, in accordance with IFRS. The total 
dividend for the year will be 4.8 pence per share (2009: 
4.8 pence per share). 
Earnings/(loss) per share 
The basic and diluted earnings per share for the year to 
31st December 2010 was 1.7 pence (2009: loss of 
16.8 pence on both bases, both restated following the 
2010 Placing and Rights Issue). 
After removing the unrealised revaluation of the 
investment portfolio and the mark-to-market adjustment 
of interest rate swaps, the EPRA adjusted loss per share 
was 11.8 pence per share (2009: 20.3 pence per share), 
as set out in note 9 to the Group ﬁnancial statements.

governance 
Principal activities 
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding 
company. The principal activities of the Group during the 
year were property development, investment and trading. 
Incorporation 
Development Securities PLC is incorporated in Great 
Britain and registered in England and Wales, registration 
number 1528784. 
Business review and future developments 
A review of the Group’s operations, the current state of the 
business and future prospects, including ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial key performance indicators, principal risks 
and uncertainties, is contained in the Chairman’s 
Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement, Operating 
Review and Financial Review, and should be read in 
conjunction with this report. The principal risks of the 
Group are set out on page 5. The information which 
comprises the business review as required by Section 
417(1) of the Companies Act 2006 may be found in the 
Operating Review on pages 10 to 31 and in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on pages 32 to 34. 
Results and dividends 
The proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year attributable to shareholders 
amounted to £1,678,000 (2009: £10,694,000 loss). 
An interim Ordinary dividend of £1,974,000 representing 
2.4 pence per Ordinary share was paid on 9th September 
2010 (2009: £974,000 representing 2.4 pence per 
Ordinary share) in respect of those shares in issue prior to 
the Placing and Rights Issue. The Board recommends a 
ﬁnal Ordinary dividend of 2.4 pence per Ordinary share 
amounting to £2,936,000 payable on 6th July 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at 3rd June 2011 (2009: 
£1,974,000 representing 2.4 pence per Ordinary share). 
Subject to shareholder approval this makes a total dividend 
payment of 4.8 pence per Ordinary share for 2010, 
maintained from the previous year. 
Group structure 
Details of the Group’s principal subsidiary undertakings 
are disclosed on page 84. 
Share capital 
In July and August 2010, following the receipt of valid 
responses, the Company issued 40,096,030 Ordinary 
shares of 50 pence each in connection with a Placing and 
Rights Issue raising gross proceeds of £100,240,000. Of 
the 40,096,030 Ordinary shares, 4,110,000 were issued 
on 28th July 2010 in connection with the Placing and the 
remaining 35,986,030 were issued in connection with the 
Rights Issue on 11th August 2010. The Company’s issued 
share capital of 122,352,504 Ordinary shares of 50 pence 
each as at 31st December 2010 represents a single class 
of shares, with all shares ranking equally and fully paid. 
Details of the share capital are set out on pages 93 and 94. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the shares are 
speciﬁed in the Company’s Articles of Association, or 
alternatively may be governed by statute. There are no 
restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company other 
than those speciﬁed by law or regulation. There are no 
restrictions on voting rights other than as speciﬁed by the 
Articles of Association. 
Three resolutions relating to share capital will be proposed 
as Special Business at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. The full text of the resolutions can be found in the 
enclosed Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
Special Resolution 14. The current authority for the 
Company to purchase its own shares expires at the end of 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. A special 
resolution is to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
to authorise the repurchase of up to 12,235,250 Ordinary 
shares, representing approximately 10.0 per cent of the 
Company’s issued share capital. The Directors have no 
present intention of making any market purchases of the 
Company’s shares, but if they believed such action would 
enhance net assets or earnings per share, they would 
consider exercising their authority. As at the date of this 
report, the Company has an unexpired authority to 
repurchase 12,256,000 Ordinary shares.

Ordinary Resolution 15. The Directors will be seeking the 
renewal of the power to allot shares or grant rights to 
subscribe for, or to convert any security into shares. The 
authority sought will be in two separate tranches. The 
authority in the ﬁ rst tranche will allow the Directors to allot 
new shares and other ‘relevant securities’ up to a nominal 
value of £20,392,084 which is equivalent to one-third of 
the total issued Ordinary share capital of the Company. 
The authority in the second tranche will allow the Directors 
to allot new shares and other relevant securities only in 
connection with a rights issue up to a further nominal value 
of £20,392,084, which is again equivalent to one-third of 
the total issued Ordinary share capital of the Company. 
This is in line with corporate governance guidelines. The 
Directors have no present intention of exercising this 
authority. However, the Directors consider it desirable to 
have the maximum ﬂexibility permitted by corporate 
governance guidelines to respond to market developments 
and to enable allotments to take place to ﬁnance business 
opportunities as they arise. 
Special Resolution 16. If the Directors wish to allot new 
shares and other relevant securities, or sell treasury shares 
for cash (other than in connection with an employee share 
scheme), company law requires that these shares are 
offered ﬁrst to members in proportion to their existing 
holdings. The Directors seek authority to renew the 
disapplication of shareholders’ pre-emptive rights under 
Section 561 of the Companies Act 2006. The purpose of 
paragraph (i) of Resolution 16 is to authorise the Directors 
to allot new shares pursuant to the authority given by 
paragraph (i) of Resolution 15 for cash either (a) in 
connection with a pre-emptive offer or rights issue or (b) 
otherwise up to a nominal value of £3,058,812 (being 
equivalent to 5.0 per cent of the total issued Ordinary 
share capital of the Company), in each case without the 
shares ﬁrst being offered to existing members in proportion 
to their existing holdings. 
The purpose of paragraph (ii) of Resolution 16 is to 
authorise the Directors to allot new shares pursuant to the 
authority given by paragraph (ii) of Resolution 15 for cash 
in connection with a rights issue without the shares ﬁrst 
being offered to existing members in proportion to their 
existing holdings. This is in line with corporate governance 
guidelines. The Board considers the authority sought to be 
appropriate in order to allow the Company ﬂexibility to 
ﬁnance business opportunities or to conduct a pre-emptive 
offer or rights issue without the need to comply with the 
strict requirements of the statutory pre-emption provisions. 
The Board intends to adhere to the provisions in the Pre­ emption Group’s Statement of Principles not to allot shares 
on a non pre-emptive basis (other than pursuant to a rights 
issue or pre-emptive offer) in excess of an amount equal 
to 7.5 per cent of the total issued Ordinary share capital of 
the Company within a rolling three-year period without 
prior consultation with members. 
Change of control 
The Company has entered into signiﬁcant agreements 
with its commercial partners, which contain change of 
control clauses and which may give rise to termination or 
renegotiation in that event. If enforced, the Company may 
be deprived of potential future earning capacity from such 
schemes. The Company is party to a number of committed 
bank facilities which upon a change of control are 
terminable at the bank’s discretion. In addition, under such 
circumstances the Company’s share option schemes 
would normally vest or become exercisable subject to the 
satisfaction of the performance conditions. 
Corporate Governance 
The Company’s statement on corporate governance can 
be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 
48 to 51 of the ﬁnancial statements. The Corporate 
Governance Report forms part of this Report and is 
incorporated into it by cross-reference.

Report of the Directors cont. 
Share option schemes 
Options over 120,000 shares were granted to senior 
management under the Executive Share Option Scheme 
2005. Further details of the share option schemes are 
contained on page 93 and in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 52 to 59. 
Directors 
The Directors serving during the year and up to the date of 
signing the Group ﬁnancial statements were as follows: 
D S Jenkins 
M H Marx 
G Prothero 
C J Barwick 
M S Weiner 
V M Mitchell 
M S Soames 
S C Bates (Appointed 15th January 2010) 
P V S Manduca resigned 7th May 2010 
Brief biographical details are shown on page 43. 
All Directors will be retiring at the next Annual General 
Meeting and, being eligible, will offer themselves for 
re-election. C J Barwick is required to offer himself for 
re-election in accordance with the Articles of Association 
and Combined Code. The other Directors are voluntarily 
offering themselves for re-election as a matter of best 
practice following the Placing and Rights Issue. Following 
the performance evaluation of the Board, all Directors were 
judged to have made a signiﬁcant contribution to the Board’s 
deliberations, reﬂecting their commitment to the role. 
The Articles of Association deal with the appointment and 
replacement of Directors. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 a Director must avoid a 
situation where he or she has, or can have, a direct or 
indirect interest that conﬂicts, or possibly may conﬂict, with 
the Company’s interests. No conﬂicts of this sort have 
arisen during the year under review. 
Directors’ service contracts and interests 
in the Company’s shares 
The unexpired period of Directors’ service contracts and the 
interests in the shares of the Company of the Directors who 
were in ofﬁce as at 31st December 2010 are disclosed in 
the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 59. 
Other than as disclosed in the Remuneration Report, none 
of the Directors had any material interest in any contract 
that was signiﬁcant in relation to the Group’s business at 
any time during the period, other than a service contract. 
Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance 
Article 155 of the Company’s Articles of Association 
provides, among other things, that, insofar as permitted by 
law, every Director shall be indemniﬁed by the Company 
against all costs, charges, expenses, losses or liabilities 
incurred in the execution and discharge of the Directors’ 
duties, power or ofﬁce. The Company maintains Directors’ 
and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance, which is reviewed annually, 
and is considered to be adequately insured. 
The third party indemnity insurance was in force during the 
ﬁnancial year and also at the date of approval of the 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
Articles of Association 
The Articles of Association may be amended by a special 
resolution of the shareholders.

Corporate Governance 
ww7 .investorrelations.co.uk/devsec/ar10/ 
governance 
Development Securities 
Ordinary shares are listed on 
the Official List of the UK Listing 
Authority and, as such, the 
Company is required to state 
whether it has complied with 
the provisions for corporate 
governance contained within 
the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance. 
The Board conﬁrms that the Company has applied the main 
provisions and has complied with all of the provisions set out 
in Section 1 of the June 2008 Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance during the ﬁnancial year under review. The full 
code can be found at www.frc.org.uk. 
In May 2010 the Financial Reporting Council issued a new 
edition of the code, named The UK Corporate Governance 
Code, which will apply to ﬁnancial years beginning on or 
after 29th June 2010. Therefore the new code will be 
followed for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1st January 201 1. 
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards and 
levels of integrity within a corporate governance framework 
which underpins the ethos of the Company. Constructive 
dialogue has continued to be built up over the year between 
stakeholders and has strengthened investor conﬁdence. 
The Company’s governance principles have been, and will 
continue to be kept under review as the Directors believe 
that a sound corporate governance framework is key to 
achieving the Company’s objectives and discharging its 
legal and regulatory responsibilities. 
The Company’s going concern statement can be found in 
the Financial Review on pages 35 to 41 and is incorporated 
here by reference. 
The Board 
The Board is collectively responsible for the success of the 
Company and in this capacity has over the ﬁnancial year under 
review dispensed independent judgement in relation to, but 
not limited to, strategy, executive performance and retention, 
remuneration and succession, ﬁnancial performance, the issue 
of any securities, signiﬁcant borrowing facilities, development 
opportunities, investment portfolio acquisitions and disposals, 
corporate reputation and communication, internal control 
and risk management and the Board’s own effectiveness. 
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Board takes into account 
the size, and complexity of the Group, and internal control 
measures employed to determine those formal matters 
reserved to the Board and those delegated to its various 
Committees or the Executive Directors. 
The Board met eight times during the year and held one 
meeting solely to consider the Group’s strategy. The Chairman 
and the Non-executive Directors met on one occasion during 
the year with no Executive Directors in attendance. 
The Board during the ﬁnancial year consisted of four 
Executive Directors, three Non-executive Directors and 
a Non-executive Chairman. The Company considers all the 
Non-executive Directors to be independent. The Chairman 
was considered independent on appointment. S C Bates 
joined the Board on 15th January 2010, following which there 
were ﬁve Non-executive Directors, until P V S Manduca 
stepped down as Non-executive Director on 7th May 2010. 
The current ratio of Executive and Non-executive Directors 
is permissible for a smaller company under Code provision 
A.3.2. The Non-executive Directors provide a valued role 
by contributing to the decisions and challenging aspects 
of executive decisions to produce a considered and 
independent outcome to Board deliberations. The roles 
and remit of the Chairman and the Executive Directors are 
set out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
V M Mitchell was appointed to the role of Senior 
Independent Director on 7th May 2010 following P V S 
Manduca resigning at the AGM. 
As in previous years, the Board has undertaken a formal 
performance evaluation of the Board as a whole, its 
Committees and individual Directors to ensure effective 
contribution and maintenance of commitment. 
V M Mitchell chaired a meeting of the Non-executive 
Directors without the Chairman or Executive Directors 
present, at which, inter alia, the performance of the 
Chairman was reviewed on behalf of the Board. The 
evaluation was conducted by means of a questionnaire 
which was co-ordinated and collated by the Interim Company 
Secretary. The responses were considered by the Board and 
suggestions for improvements have been implemented. 
All Directors have access to the services of the Interim 
Company Secretary and may seek independent 
professional advice as necessary, at the Company’s 
expense, and subject to the consent of the Chairman. 
Upon election, or re-election, Non-executives are invited 
to serve for three-year ﬁxed terms. All Non-executive 
Directors have conﬁrmed that they have sufﬁcient time to

dedicate to their role. Their terms of appointment are 
available from the Interim Company Secretary and details 
of the Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are 
detailed in section 1k of the Remuneration Report on 
page 57. Directors may receive appropriate training on 
introduction and whilst in ofﬁce. 
To promote internal communication and improve efﬁciency, 
the Board delegates responsibility for certain matters to 
Standing Committees which report back to the Board. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises, V M Mitchell, D S 
Jenkins, and S C Bates. S C Bates joined as a member 
on 27th January 2010 and succeeded P V S Manduca 
as Chairman following the 2010 AGM. 
The Company’s Chief Executive and Finance Director, 
attend the Audit Committee meetings by invitation. The 
Committee also met without Executive Directors present 
and S C Bates as Chairman of the Committee met 
separately with the auditors. 
The Committee met three times during the year. 
A meeting was held to agree the terms of engagement, 
proposed approach and the fees of the annual audit. As is 
standard each year, two of the meetings take place prior 
to the issue of the preliminary full-year and interim results 
in order to consider any signiﬁcant issues arising from the 
audit and review processes. The Board has determined 
that D S Jenkins has ‘recent and relevant ﬁnancial 
experience’ for the purposes of the Combined Code. 
It is within the Committee’s remit to recommend the 
appointment of the external auditors, advise on the Group’s 
accounting policies and monitor the treatment of areas of 
major judgement in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. 
Furthermore, it acts as a conduit between the Board and 
the external auditors. 
Apart from conducting the annual audit, Pricewaterhouse-
Coopers LLP was also engaged during the year to conduct 
a review of the interim results to 30th June 2010 and 
provided tax advisory, compliance and planning services at 
a total cost of £694,000. This ﬁgure also incorporates the 
substantial compliance work undertaken in relation to the 
Placing and Rights Issue which PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP are best placed to undertake as the Company’s 
auditor. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also provided due 
diligence support on the acquisition of the Henry Davidson 
Developments Group and the Manchester Arena Complex. 
An analysis of the non audit fees can be found in note 4 
to the ﬁnancial statements. During the year a non 
audit services policy was approved and adopted by the 
Committee providing for added control measures around 
the instruction of the auditors to undertake non audit work. 
Given the clear efﬁciencies and value-added beneﬁts to 
the Company of combining the audit and consultancy 
roles, additional scrutiny was placed on the independence 
and objectivity of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The 
Audit Committee was satisﬁed as to their independence 
and accordingly recommend their re-appointment as 
auditors. This was subsequently ratiﬁed by the Board 
and accordingly the re-appointment of Pricewaterhouse-
Coopers LLP as auditors will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Pricewaterhouse-
Coopers LLP has been the independent auditors of 
Development Securities PLC since 2008. 
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee comprises D S Jenkins as 
Chairman, V M Mitchell and M H Marx. As from 7th May 
2010, V M Mitchell became a member following 
P V S Manduca’s resignation. The Nomination Committee 
has reviewed the size, structure and composition of the 
Board and devises and implements succession plans for 
appointments to the Board, which are fulﬁlled through an 
effective search, interview and evaluation process based 
upon objective criteria. 
The Nomination Committee meets as necessary. In the year 
under review it met twice, once to discuss and recommend 
the election of S C Bates and the re-election of those 
Directors retiring by rotation at the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting. A second meeting discussed succession planning 
in respect of two of the Non-executive Directors who will 
soon be reaching nine years of service on the Board. At a 
meeting held in February 201 1 the Committee approved the 
retirement by rotation of C J Barwick and the voluntary re­ election of the whole Board in accordance with best practice 
in connection with the recent Rights Issue. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises M S Soames as 
Chairman, V M Mitchell and D S Jenkins. The Committee 
is authorised to determine remuneration policy, details of 
which can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 
52 to 59. 
The policy includes the exercise of powers to grant options 
under the Group’s option schemes to the Executive 
Directors and senior managers and awards under the 
Performance Share Plan. In addition the policy speciﬁes 
the framework for determining the annual bonus, awards 
under the Development Proﬁt Plan, Joint Venture Proﬁt 
Plan, Strategic Proﬁt Plan, the Investment Growth Plan 
and ad hoc bonuses for exceptional contributions.

Approvals Committee 
The Approvals Committee comprises two Executive 
Directors and a minimum of two Non-executive Directors. 
Its remit is to permit the approval of transactions between 
£2.0 million and £5.0 million, which are then reported to 
the Board. Transactions below £2.0 million are delegated 
to the relevant Executive Directors responsible and those 
above £5.0 million are under the remit of the Board. 
The terms of reference of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, as determined by the Board, 
are available upon request from the Interim Company 
Secretary and are also published on the Company’s 
website, www.developmentsecurities.com. 
The above table sets out the attendance of the Directors 
at the meetings of the Board and the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees held during 2010. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Executive Directors have regular dialogue with 
institutional shareholders. The Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director and Non-executive Directors are available at any 
time to meet with them. No shareholders asked to meet with 
V M Mitchell or P V S Manduca, the Senior Independent 
Directors during the year. The Company’s Annual General 
Meeting provides an opportunity to respond to shareholders’ 
appropriate questions. Directors are introduced to 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, including the 
identiﬁ cation of Non-executives and Committee Chairmen. 
The Company’s website www.developmentsecurities.com 
is updated at the same time as the Regulated Information 
Service, to provide additional information dissemination 
for shareholders. Shareholders are also invited to free 
subscription of the Company’s e-mail news alert service 
on the Company’s website. 
Internal control 
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investments 
and protect the Company’s assets. The operational, 
ﬁnancial and compliance risk controls are designed to 
manage risk rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Board has conducted a thorough 
risk assessment of the business, identifying risks, their 
potential impact, likelihood of occurrence, controls and 
mitigating actions, together with early warning systems 
and further actions which need to be implemented. 
Detailed below is a description of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management used in the process of 
preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
The regular process of identifying, evaluating and 
managing signiﬁcant corporate risks has been delegated 
by the Board to a Risk Committee, consisting of M H Marx 
as Chairman, C J Barwick, M S Weiner, G Prothero and 
three senior managers, R C McCubbine, D P Redstone 
and D A K Trench. It has been agreed that from 1st January 
2011 there will be at least one Non-executive Director in 
attendance at meetings of the Risk Committee. 
The Committee meets quarterly during the year to ensure that 
the Group’s risk management procedures are comprehensive 
and appropriate for the current economic climate, regulatory 
requirements and business operations. The Committee’s 
remit includes all of the Group’s subsidiaries and those joint 
ventures and associates which are administered by the 
Company. Those joint ventures and associates not internally 
administered do not form part of the review process and in 
such circumstances, the Committee maintains a current 
schedule of risks, their likelihood of occurrence and 
prospective impact which it assesses for completeness at 
each meeting. The minutes of the Committee’s deliberations 
are reviewed by the Board. In addition to the activities of the 
Risk Committee, a risk-evaluation on each signiﬁcant 
prospective development, investment or joint venture 
opportunity is evaluated by the Board, and for development 
opportunities, the risks are evaluated by an internal 
independent Project Review Committee. The Executive 
Directors regularly evaluate the Group’s risk-weighted 
development exposure, which is then considered by the 
Board. All necessary actions have been or are being taken to 
remedy any weaknesses acknowledged from the quarterly 
reviews. No signiﬁcant failings were identiﬁed over the year.

A ‘whistleblowing policy’ has been prepared and issued to all 
staff in the Group, outlining arrangements by which they 
may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other issues. 
During the ﬁnancial year under review the Company appointed 
H W Fisher as its internal auditors, to carry out a review of the 
control processes employed in speciﬁc areas of the business. 
In recent years the Directors have procured a number of 
internal audit reports from an external service provider, 
instructed ad hoc on speciﬁc issues. During 2010 the 
Directors decided that, in view of the Company’s increasing 
size and complexity, it is appropriate to formalise this role 
into a continuous service. Accordingly H W Fisher has 
been appointed as the Group’s internal auditor, reporting 
to the Audit Committee. 
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control for the year ended 
31st December 2010 and to the date of this report, and 
considers that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Group’s signiﬁcant risks 
including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls 
and a risk management system; that has been in place for 
the year ended 31st December 2010 and up to the date of 
approval of these ﬁnancial statements, that it is regularly 
reviewed by the Board, and that there is a sound system of 
internal control which accords with the Turnbull Guidance. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Remuneration Report and the Financial state­ ments in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under this law, the 
Directors have prepared the Group ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS’s) as adopted by the European Union, 
and the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the Financial statements 
unless they are satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for the period. In preparing 
these Financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
 state whether IFRS’s, as adopted by the European Union 
and applicable UK Accounting Standards, have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Group and Parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements respectively; and 
 prepare the Financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Financial statements and the Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are 
listed in the Remuneration Report conﬁrm that, to the best 
of their knowledge: 
the Group ﬁnancial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS’s as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the Group; and 
 the Report of the Directors incorporating the Summary 
page, the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s 
Statement, the Business Model, Operating Review, 
Financial Review, Corporate Responsibility and Board of 
Directors includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.

Remuneration Report
 
Dear Shareholder
 
I am pleased to introduce the Remuneration Report for the year 2010.
 
The Remuneration report has been divided into three parts:
 
 Overview – summary of the total remuneration policy; 
Remuneration explained – disclosures on Executive Directors’ and senior 
managers’ pay outlining the incentive plans; and 
 Remuneration in detail – detailed audited disclosures which are required by 
the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations. 
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) is responsible for determining 
the remuneration policy for the Company’s Executive Directors and for ensuring 
that the remuneration of senior managers and other employees is consistent 
with the Company’s remuneration philosophy. The Committee has considered 
the performance of the Company over the year, the impact of the strategy set 
previously and the strategy for future years. The Committee, in light of the 
economic environment and current property market, has sought to reinforce 
the Company’s objectives through the implementation of the remuneration 
policy approved by shareholders in 2010. The Company has complied 
throughout the period with the requirements of the Combined Code in relation 
to Directors’ remuneration. 
In reaching a view on performance, there is no doubt that the Company’s senior 
management team continue to respond appropriately to the economic and 
market cycle. The equity raising issue in 2009 can now be conﬁrmed to have 
taken place at the low point in the cycle, allowing the Company to take full 
advantage of opportunities offered. 
The Committee considered the key achievements over the year were 
as follows: 
 The completion of the commitment of the proceeds from the 2009 equity 
raising. 
 A further successful share offering concluding in August 2010 which has 
enabled the Company to reach a size which will generate new opportunities. 
A signiﬁcant turnaround to achieve proﬁts before tax of £2.6 million 
compared to the previous year’s £11.4 million loss. 
The consolidation of existing strategic partnerships with CTP, Wessex 
Investors, Beyond Green and Barwood, and the commencement of the new 
partnership with Patron Capital. Together with a number of other projects in 
partnership with sector specialists, these ventures provide diversity of 
income and risk, as well as geographic spread. 
 The acquisition of the Henry Davidson Developments Group. 
 A start to the investment of the proceeds of the 2010 equity raise. A number 
of assets and projects have been secured, in line with the strategy set out 
in the July 2010 prospectus, at prices which offer strong opportunities to 
add value. 
The investment portfolio has achieved another exceptional performance, 
achieving a total return of 15.2 per cent. Although only equal to the IPD 
Quarterly Index, it is noteworthy that this was achieved with no Central 
London exposure in the portfolio. The Index performance excluding Central 
London was 10.5 per cent. 
The development pipeline has been focused on regional development, 
particularly of the retail sector, whilst existing Central London development 
schemes and Slough have been maintained ready for the start of the 
next cycle. 
Management of the Company’s risk proﬁle, including maintenance of a 
modest level of net debt throughout the year ensuring that there continued 
to be no need for recourse to shareholders for emergency equity funding. 
The salaries for the Executive Directors have been kept at the 2010 levels. 
Following a market review of the fees of the Non-executive Directors it was 
agreed to increase their fees in line with market competitive levels. 
During 2009 the Committee undertook a substantive review of its executive 
remuneration arrangements. This was to ensure that arrangements would 
support the Company’s strategy as it moved forward into the next stage of its 
development at the start of the next UK commercial property cycle. 
During 2010 we made no changes to the framework introduced at that time. 
The focused proﬁt plans relating to the principal activities of the Company 
(development, investment and joint ventures) continue to be a key part of our 
performance-based pay arrangements, alongside the annual bonus and the 
performance share plan. 
The Development Proﬁ t Plan (section c) has resulted in bonuses being paid to 
M S Weiner and another senior manager for the successful completion of the 
development at Wallington. New Development Proﬁt Plan awards have been 
made to the Directors and senior managers. 
The Committee has reviewed the awards for the Strategic Proﬁt Plan and Joint 
Venture Proﬁt Plan for 2010 (sections d and f). 
The Investment Growth Plan (section e) resulted in a nil vesting as performance 
conditions were not satisﬁed for the 2010 Initial Bonus. 
Awards under the Performance Share Plan were made on 23rd April 2010 to 
the Executive Directors and staff. An assessment of the performance condition 
for the award made under the Plan on 13th May 2008 resulted in a nil vesting. 
A resolution will be proposed to the Shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting seeking their approval of this report.

Overview 
The key objectives of the Company’s Remuneration policy are as follows: 
 to ensure that Executive Directors and senior managers are rewarded in a 
way that attracts, retains, motivates and rewards management of the highest 
quality; 
 to operate focused proﬁt plans and share schemes designed to encourage 
Executive Directors and senior managers to align their long-term career 
aspirations with the long-term interests of the Company and shareholders’ 
expectations; 
 to promote the attainment of both individual and corporate achievements 
measured against performance criteria required to deliver long-term growth 
and sustainability of the business; and 
 to encourage sustained performance over the medium and long-term. 
The total pay framework is based on a mixture of ﬁxed and variable elements 
considered on a meritocratic basis at individual and Group level, taking into 
account the remuneration awarded to employees in the Group. 
The balance between ﬁxed and variable pay is considered appropriate, given 
that the various incentive plans/schemes ensure a signiﬁcant proportion of a 
key individual’s remuneration package is performance related, thereby 
correlating with the interests of shareholders through either the attainment of 
growth in net asset value per share or total shareholder return. 
Role and constitution of the Committee 
The Committee’s full terms of reference are set out on the Company’s website. 
Its principal role is to determine the total remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and to ensure that senior management remuneration is consistent with 
corporate policy. In addition to the support of the Chief Executive, and the 
Company Secretary, the Committee sought professional advice from external 
remuneration consultants Deloitte LLP and legal support from Linklaters LLP. 
Representatives of Deloitte LLP attended two meetings of the Committee by 
invitation. Deloitte LLP currently undertakes the audit of the Development 
Securities Retirement Beneﬁt Scheme of which the Company is a Trustee, but 
otherwise undertakes no other work for the Company. Linklaters LLP are also 
the Group’s principal legal advisor.

Following the Board evaluation process the effectiveness of the Committee 
was reviewed and the Committee was considered to be operating effectively. 
No member has any personal ﬁnancial interest in the matters to be decided. 
Remuneration explained 
a) Salary 
The salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed each year and are 
determined by reference to individual performance and in relation to comparable 
companies in the same business sector. The Committee have considered 
carefully the level of the base salaries payable to the Executive Directors 
with effect from 1st January 2011 and, having consulted Deloitte LLP, the 
Company’s remuneration consultant, have determined that the base salaries 
should remain at the 2010 level. 
The Committee considers the salary increases of Executive Directors at the 
same time as increases proposed for all employees within the Company. It 
applies the same criteria to Executive Directors as are applied to all employees, 
taking account of any changes to roles as well as relevant market movements. 
For 2010 the zero increase that was applied for the Executive Directors was 
substantially below the average increases awarded to employees across 
the Company. 
2011 2010 2010/2011 
£’000 £’000 Increase % 
M H Marx 400 400 0.0 
C J Barwick 325 325 0.0 
M S Weiner 325 325 0.0 
G Prothero 325 325 0.0 
b) Annual bonus 
The non-pensionable annual bonus is based on the performance of the 
Company during the year, team achievements and the speciﬁc contribution of 
the individuals concerned. With the exception of M H Marx, Executive Directors 
are set a target bonus of 37.5 per cent of salary and an above target maximum 
of 75.0 per cent. As M H Marx only occasionally qualiﬁes for awards under the 
Development Proﬁ t Plan described below, his target bonus is 75.0 per cent of 
salary, with a maximum of 150.0 per cent. 
The Committee has always taken a somewhat different approach to the annual 
bonus compared to our competitors in that the annual bonus has never been 
formulaically driven by the annual ﬁnancial results but reﬂects a true measure 
of annual performance in the context of the length of the property cycle. The 
annual bonus in respect of the Executive Directors is determined principally by 
the four main drivers for the creation of shareholder value in our business: 
namely, accurate reading of the economic and market cycles in which we 
operate, the pipeline of future development projects, active management of the 
investment portfolio and the maintenance of the standards of excellence that 
are embedded within the Company’s corporate culture. Speciﬁcally this year 
consideration was given to the success of the investment of the proceeds of

Remuneration Report cont. 
Remuneration explained continued 
the 2009 and 2010 equity raising issues and the asset management at the 
properties purchased. In addition, the Committee measures the Company’s 
absolute and relative performance against its peer group companies during 
the year. 
The Committee considered 2010 to be a year which had ‘Exceeded Target’ 
taking into account the achievements during the year. The following bonus 
awards were made in 2010, with 50.0 per cent of the bonus earned above 
target paid in shares which the recipient must hold for at least two years.

c) Development Proﬁt Plan 
The Committee reserves the right to make awards under the Development 
Proﬁt Plan to Executive Directors and other senior managers who have been 
instrumental in securing development opportunities for the Group. 
Awards are eligible on projects where any phase is likely to produce proﬁts in 
excess of £2.0 million. No more than 10.0 per cent of the proﬁts of each 
development project is awarded in total. When any particular development 
project becomes unconditional, the Committee determines which individuals 
should receive awards under the Plan and the amount of the award. The bonus 
is dependent principally upon the amount of proﬁt actually realised upon 
completion. 20.0 per cent of the award is retained until such time as the proﬁt 
is actually realised, whereupon it will be re-evaluated to determine if any 
additional Executive Directors or senior managers have been instrumental in 
making a signiﬁcant and material contribution in progressing the scheme 
through to completion and, if not, this retention would revert to the original 
participants. 
In awarding annual bonuses and awards under the Development Proﬁt Plan, 
there is no ‘double-counting’. The contribution of any team and individual 
performance, which leads to awards under the Development Proﬁt Plan are 
disregarded in assessing the annual bonus. 
The principal awards, omitting those schemes where current forecasts show a 
nil or nominal proﬁt, have been made to the Executive Directors under the 
Development Proﬁt Plan:

Additional awards under the Development Proﬁt Plan have been made to senior 
managers. 
Following practical completion of Wallington, M S Weiner received £75,694 
from maturity of his Development Proﬁt Plan award. 
In addition to making awards under the Development Proﬁt Plan for securing 
development opportunities, the Remuneration Committee retains the discretion 
to award bonuses to Executive Directors and other senior managers at any time 
for making an exceptional contribution towards the Company. Such awards will 
not be applied in securing any corporate acquisitions. 
d) Joint Venture Proﬁt Plan 
The Committee reserves the right to make awards under the Joint Venture 
Proﬁt Plan to Executive Directors and other senior managers who have been 
instrumental in securing proﬁts generated from joint ventures. 
Awards are made when joint ventures are likely to produce a total proﬁt in any 
one year of more than £2.0 million. No more than 10.0 per cent of this proﬁ t is 
awarded in total. In any given year, the Committee determines which individuals 
should receive awards and the amount of the award for each of the joint 
ventures for the following year. 
In assessing the proﬁt from each joint venture, all proﬁts remitted during the 
year on successful projects are cumulated and all projects which have either 
crystallised or are forecast to make a loss are deducted. Any actual proﬁts/ 
losses realised in subsequent years will be rationalised against forecast losses 
already taken into account. 
In awarding annual bonuses, there is no ‘double counting’. The contribution of 
any team and individual performance which leads to awards under the Joint 
Venture Proﬁt Plan is disregarded in assessing the annual bonus. 
No payments have been made to Executive Directors during the year. 
Awards for joint ventures have been made to an Executive Director and 
a senior manager. 
e) Investment Growth Plan 
The Committee reserves the right to award bonuses under the Investment 
Growth Plan. The performance condition under the award is that the total 
investment portfolio return must exceed 120.0 per cent of the All-Fund Universe 
Index as published by Investment Property Databank if the Index is greater than 
zero, or at least 0.1 per cent if the Index is less than or equal to zero and, in 
addition, represents at least one percentage point above the total return under 
the index. The total investment portfolio return represents the sum of income 
return, net of irrecoverable property expenses, together with capital growth. 
The Initial Bonus represents a bonus pool of 5.0 per cent of the value determined 
by the excess of the total investment portfolio return over the benchmark index 
up to a cap of £1.0 million unless otherwise determined. The award is remitted 
following the end of the ﬁnancial year when the award is determined, with an 
equivalent amount representing a Deferred Bonus assessed two years 
thereafter, provided that during the intervening period the total investment 
portfolio return exceeds a speciﬁed proportion of the index. 
As at the date of this report the 2010 Annual All-Fund Universe Index had not 
been published by Investment Property Databank. A review against the All-
Fund Index will be undertaken when the Index is made available. Based on 
performance during the year against the IPD Quarterly Index, no payments are 
expected to be made to eligible participants. Any subsequent change to this 
position, if any, will be disclosed in the 2011 Remuneration Report. 
No Initial Bonus was paid in respect of 2008 therefore no Deferred Award was 
able to be tested.

f) Strategic Proﬁt Plan 
The Strategic Proﬁt Plan was approved by shareholders in 2010. The Strategic 
Proﬁt Plan is a cash incentive scheme designed to incentivise Executive 
Directors and senior management in all the principal activities of the Group, 
namely development, joint ventures and the investment portfolio. The Plan 
introduces a Group-wide collegiate aspect to rewarding success, and 
supporting co-operation as our executives deliver on the signiﬁcant opportun­ ities that exist across our market. 
The bonus pool available for distribution represents an additional 4.0 per cent 
of the proﬁts achieved (as adjusted) which count towards the maximum amount 
under both the Development Proﬁt Plan and Joint Venture Proﬁt Plan for that 
ﬁnancial year and 2.0 per cent of each of the Initial Bonus and Deferred Bonus 
pools achieved under the Investment Growth Plan. Awards would be made to 
individuals at the discretion of the Committee. In doing so, the Committee will 
take into account whether individuals are already eligible for awards under the 
Development Proﬁt Plan, Joint Venture Proﬁt Plan and Investment Growth 
Plan. As a guideline, 75.0 per cent of the bonus pool will be allocated to the 
Executive Directors and 25.0 per cent to senior management. 
Awards will be subject to a risk underpin such that the Committee must be 
satisﬁed that performance has not been achieved as a result of inappropriate 
ﬁnancial risk (e.g. very high levels of gearing), and that the level of ﬁnancial and 
business risk is in line with the Company’s stated strategy. In making awards 
to individuals, the Committee will also take into account the overall performance 
of the Company. 
No awards have been approved under the Strategic Proﬁt Plan in respect 
of 2010. 
g) Performance Share Plan 
Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made on the basis that shares 
will be acquired subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a 
three-year period, with no retesting. Performance is measured by comparing 
the Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) achieved by the Company with the 
individual constituent members of the FTSE Real Estate Investment Trust Index 
and the FTSE Real Estate Investment Services Index. There is a sliding scale 
of vesting as follows: 
i) 25.0 per cent of the award will vest if the Company’s TSR equals the median 
TSR of the comparator group; 
ii) 100.0 per cent of the award will vest if the Company’s TSR equals or 
exceeds the 85th percentile TSR of the comparator group; and 
iii) pro rata vesting will apply in-between the above points. 
In addition, the Committee must be satisﬁed that there has been a sustained 
improvement in the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance over the 
performance period (typically by considering the change in net asset value). For 
awards from 2010, a risk underpin (as described above) will also apply. 
On 23rd April 2010, awards were made under the Performance Share Plan to 
M H Marx of 112,676 shares in the Company representing 75.0 per cent of 
salary, and to C J Barwick, M S Weiner and G Prothero of 61,033 shares 
each representing 50.0 per cent of salary. As part of the realignment of the 
incentive remuneration package last year, these awards represent 50.0 per 
cent of the 2009 award levels. In total, 527,621 shares were, at the discretion 
of the Committee, awarded to 31 employees and the four Executive Directors. 
The performance condition under the award made on 13th May 2008 has now 
been assessed and there is a nil vesting.

The above graphs demonstrate the Company’s TSR as represented by share

Investment Trust Index and the FTSE Real Estate Investment Services Index. 
The FTSE All Share Real Estate Index used in previous years has ceased to be 
published and having reviewed the constituents of the previous index it is 
considered that the constituents of these two indices are the most appropriate 
for comparison of the Company’s business performance against that of its 
competitors. The Company is a constituent of the FTSE Real Estate Investment 
Services Index, but a number of constituents of the FTSE Real Estate 
Investment Trust Index are also considered as within the Company’s peer group.

 Remuneration Report cont. 
h) Option Scheme 1993 
The Option Scheme 1993 is a share-based bonus scheme approved by 
shareholders in that year. It allows individuals to beneﬁt from movements in the 
price of the Company’s shares over the period between the third and tenth year 
following grant. The Directors may at the date of grant limit the aggregate 
notional bonus which may become payable. 
No new grants have been made during the year and none are currently 
outstanding. 
i) Share option schemes 
The Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 was approved by shareholders in 
that year. This was replaced by the Executive Share Option Plan 2005 which 
was approved by the shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting on 
12th May 2005. The options under both schemes were granted on the basis 
that they may only be exercised if a performance condition is satisﬁed. 
Options over 120,000 shares were granted to six senior managers under the 
Executive Share Option Scheme 2005. 
The performance condition for those options outstanding is to measure the 
average net asset growth of the Company over three consecutive ﬁnancial 
years against the growth in the Investment Property Databank Index (All 
Property). The options will vest on a sliding scale with 50.0 per cent if average 
net asset growth is at least equal to that of the Index, 100.0 per cent if in excess 
of the Index by 4.0 per cent per annum and pro rata vesting in between. The 
performance condition will not be retested after the end of the performance 
period. The performance condition is considered appropriate as the Index 
measures against the Company’s added value. 
It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee that no further grants be 
made to Executive Directors unless in exceptional circumstances, for example, 
a new appointment or an acute retention requirement. Grants to senior 
managers may continue in the future as appropriate. 
Following the declaration of a 28.5 pence special dividend on 19th February 
2003, the Committee resolved that option holders may receive, upon exercise 
of those options then outstanding, a cash bonus equivalent to the special 
dividend as equitable compensation. 
j) Savings related option scheme 
The Save As You Earn Option Plan 2005 was approved by shareholders at the 
2005 Annual General Meeting. The third grant under the Plan was made on 
28th October 2008. There were no grants for 2010. The options may be 
exercised after three years at a price not less than 80.0 per cent of the market 
value of the shares at the time of invitation. Following recent equity raised the 
outstanding options were adjusted in accordance with a formula proposed by 
Linklaters LLP and approved by HMRC creating a revised option price of 
274.1645 pence over 70,993 options in favour of the 27 remaining members 
of staff.

Executive Directors: Date of contract 
M H Marx 24th June 1994  The contracts do not specify an expiry date. All contracts may be terminated upon 
12 months’ notice by either party. 
C J Barwick 12th May 1998  Severance payments are based upon the service contract terms, whilst bearing in 
mind a duty to mitigate, where appropriate. 
M S Weiner 17th March 2004  In the event of early termination, the contractual entitlement includes salary, 
pension, beneﬁts in kind and any awards outstanding under the sections 
described above, subject to the rules of the individual schemes and plans.

The fees of the Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board within 
the aggregate limit set by the Articles of Association. No Director participates 
in any discussion about their own remuneration. The fees of the Non-executive 
Directors were reviewed by the Board with effect from 1st October 2010 based 
on advice received from the Company’s remuneration consultants, Deloitte 
LLP . Following P V S Manduca stepping down on 7th May 2010 no compensation 
was paid to him for loss of ofﬁce as Non-executive Director or Audit Committee 
Chairman. Non-executive Directors do not participate in the Company’s share 
option schemes, performance share plan or pension scheme.

Executive Directors may accept appointment to an external non-executive 
directorship to gain experience, provided this does not create any conﬂict of 
interest and for which they may retain any attributable fees. The only Executive 
Directors to have received any external non-executive directorship fees during 
the year were M H Marx, who received £35,000 from Nationwide Accident 
Repair Services PLC and C J Barwick, who received £45,000 from London & 
Continental Railways Limited. 
l) Retirement beneﬁts 
Qualifying members of staff are invited to join the Development Securities PLC 
retirement beneﬁts scheme, which is a contracted-in money purchase scheme, 
including appropriate life assurance. Since the Company’s policy is to render 
pension payments on a deﬁned contribution basis, this avoids the uncertainty 
of pension liabilities to the Company, which would be the case had a deﬁned 
beneﬁt scheme been adopted. M H Marx and G Prothero have separate 
personal pension arrangements, whilst C J Barwick and M S Weiner are 
members of the Company scheme. The maximum contributions by the 
Company towards the approved Company scheme and any alternative 
arrangements may not exceed a total of 17.5 per cent of salary. 
m) Executive Directors’ shareholding requirement 
During 2003, it was determined that Executive Directors should align 
themselves with shareholders’ interests, with any new Executive Director 
obliged to establish a beneﬁcial shareholding to the value of one-half of their 
basic salary within two years of appointment, rising to an amount equivalent to 
basic salary after four years. M H Marx, C J Barwick, and M S Weiner have all 
met the amount equivalent to basic salary, with G Prothero yet to reach this 
level. Directors’ shareholdings are disclosed below. 
The interests of the Directors, all of which were beneﬁcial, in the share capital 
of the Company, were:

Group Independent Auditors’ Report
 
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Development 
Securities PLC 
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Development Securities 
PLC for the year ended 31st December 2010 which comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 51, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial 
statements. 
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31st December 
2010 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
the information given in the Report of the Directors for the ﬁnancial year for 
which the Group ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
Group ﬁnancial statements; and 
the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on 
pages 48 to 51 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems and, in the Report of the Directors, about share capital structures 
is consistent with the Financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not 
made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit; or 
 a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Parent 
company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 the Directors’ statement, set out on pages 38 and 39, in relation to going 
concern; 
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code 
speciﬁed for our review; and 
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ 
remuneration. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Parent company ﬁnancial statements of 
Development Securities PLC for the year ended 31st December 2010 and on 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
For the year ended 31st December 2010 
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies 
a) 
(i) General information 
The Consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group for the 12 months ended 
31st December 2010 comprise the results of the Company and its subsidiaries 
and were authorised by the Board for issue on 1st March 2011. 
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
(ii) Going concern 
The Group adopts the going concern basis in preparing its Consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements as discussed in the Financial Review on pages 35 to 41. 
b) Basis of preparation 
The Group’s ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations 
as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the ﬁ nancial statements of 
the Group for the year ended 31st December 2010 and applied in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply 
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements for the years ended 31st December 2010 
and 31st December 2009. 
The Consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis and under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed by the revaluation 
of land and buildings, available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, and ﬁnancial assets 
and ﬁnancial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the 
use of critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise 
its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The 
areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the Consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements, are disclosed in note 1(c). 
c) Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management to make 
judgements, assumptions and estimates that affect the application of 
accounting policies and amounts reported in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and the Balance Sheet. Such decisions are made at the time the 
ﬁnancial statements are prepared and adopted based on the best information 
available at the time. Actual outcomes may be different from initial estimates 
and are reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements as soon as they become apparent. 
Judgements other than estimates 
The Group earns revenue from property development, trading and investment. 
Property development includes the entire development process from 
identiﬁcation of an opportunity through to construction, letting and sale of a 
completed scheme. This activity is undertaken both on the Group’s own 
Balance Sheet, and in partnership with larger investors, usually via a pre-sale 
of the completed development. Property trading refers to participation in the 
development process, where the Group acquires an interest in land and 
enhances the potential development, for instance by procuring or changing 
planning permission, before selling on to a third party to complete the 
development. Property investment represents the acquisition of income-
generating real estate which is held for the purposes of income and capital 
gain, through active asset management. 
Financial Statements 
The varied nature of the Group’s properties is such that a number exhibit 
characteristics consistent with more than one classiﬁcation; also the Directors’ 
strategy for an asset may change during its ownership. The Directors determine 
the status of each asset according to their principal purpose on acquisition. 
A change in classiﬁcation would be made only in exceptional circumstances, 
where the strategy has demonstrably changed for a period of over one year (e.g. 
an asset originally acquired for development and resale might be held for 
investment purposes). 
In addition to its directly owned and managed activities, the Group participates 
in similar activities in partnership with others, typically to access expertise in 
different locations or market sectors. The Group’s ﬁnancial participation may be 
by way of equity investment or loan. In each case a judgement is required as to 
the status of the Group’s interest, as an associate, a joint venture or a ﬁnancial 
asset. The Group’s share of control is governed and achieved by a mixture of 
rights set out in agreements and participation in the management of each 
business. The Directors have considered the position in respect of each venture, 
taking account of the operation in practice, and have determined the status of 
each accordingly. These investments are reported under the relevant Balance 
Sheet headings, with a summary in note 26. 
The Group sometimes acquires properties through the purchase of entities 
which own real estate. At the time of acquisition the Group considers whether 
the transaction represents the acquisition of a business. In cases where the 
entity is capable of being operated as a business, or an integrated set of 
activities is acquired in addition to the property, the Group accounts for the 
acquisition as a business combination. When the acquisition does not represent 
a business, it is accounted for as the purchase of a group of assets and liabilities. 
In making this distinction, the Group considers the number of items of land and 
buildings owned by the entity, the extent of ancillary services provided by the 
subsidiary, and whether the subsidiary has its own staff to manage the property 
(over and above the maintenance and security of the premises). 
Where development is undertaken on the Group’s Balance Sheet under a 
contract for a pre-sale, a judgement is required as to whether this represents 
a sale of property or a contract for construction as described in note 1(h)(iv). 
The hotel development at West Quay, Southampton, and the ofﬁce at CityPark 
in Manchester are characterised as construction contracts (under IAS 11), 
whereby revenue is reported in line with construction progress. The amounts 
concerned are set out in note 3. 
The Group’s Curzon Park Limited joint venture owns a development site in 
Birmingham known as Curzon Street. The current proposal for the High Speed 
Train Link between London and Birmingham (HS2) indicates that the planned 
route of HS2 passes through the site, including provision for part of the 
prospective station. In view of this, the ultimate value of the site is uncertain. 
The early indications are that the impact of HS2 may restrict future development 
on the 105-acre site by approximately two thirds of its original potential. The 
Group has (jointly) guaranteed the liabilities of the joint venture to the bank, and 
hence should the value of the site (together with any compensation received) 
be insufﬁcient to repay the bank loan, the Group may incur further charges in 
respect of its obligations to the joint venture and the bank. The Directors believe 
that the site will recover at least its carrying value in the books of the joint 
venture, although the interim and ultimate uses of the site and timing of its 
development remain unclear. The site is discussed in the Operating Review on 
page 24 and in the Financial Review on page 40, and in notes 12 and 23. 
In view of operating losses at ECC, the Group’s serviced ofﬁce subsidiary, the 
Group has conducted an impairment review of its investment in the business. The 
review requires signiﬁcant judgement about customer demand and competitor 
behaviour. The Directors are satisﬁed that there is no impairment to the business.

Estimates 
The key source of estimation uncertainty rests in the values of property assets, 
which signiﬁcantly affects several categories of asset in the Balance Sheet. 
The investment property portfolio is carried at fair value, which requires a 
number of judgements and estimates in assessing the qualities of the Group’s 
assets relative to market transactions. 
The approach to this valuation and the amounts affected are set out in notes 
1(i) and 10(d). 
The same uncertainties affect the determination of fair value of certain 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial instruments, described in note 16, with the further 
complexity that the value of these assets requires estimates of future 
construction costs, tenant demand and market yields. 
The Group’s development and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. The determination of net realisable value relies upon 
similar estimates, with the added challenge, in some cases, of judgements 
about uncertain planning outcomes. These amounts are disclosed in note 13. 
In March 2010 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Henry Davidson 
Developments Limited. IFRS 3R requires the Group to estimate the fair value 
of the assets and liabilities acquired, which demands an assessment of the 
value of land and work-in-progress for a number of projects whose outcomes 
are uncertain. Details of the approach taken and values ascribed are set out in 
note 20. The resulting goodwill is monitored for impairment, requiring a regular 
update of this calculation. At 31st December 2010 the fair value assessment 
was revisited (as permitted by IFRS 3R), in the light of events since the 
acquisition which have shed more light on circumstances prevailing as at the 
acquisition date. Details of the business combination are set out in note 20. 
The Group is party to a number of interest rate swap and foreign currency 
agreements which are required by IAS 39 to be carried in the Balance Sheet 
at fair value. The estimation of this ﬁgure is based upon market assumptions 
about future movements in interest and exchange rates. The assumptions 
used, the estimated fair values and the movements in the period are set out in 
note 16. 
The Group has signiﬁcant deferred income tax losses, arising mainly from 
valuation movements in the Group’s investment and trading property portfolios. 
Recognition of these losses as a deferred income tax asset requires judgements 
and estimates about the amounts and timing of the Group’s future taxable 
proﬁts. The balances are disclosed in note 17. 
The Group has made provision against the cost of onerous lease obligations. 
In each case the Group is required to make assumptions about the likelihood, 
timing and rental levels of future lettings. These provisions are described in 
note 15(b). 
d) Accounting standards 
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for 
the ﬁrst time for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1st January 2010. 
IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’, and consequential amendments to 
IAS 27, ‘Consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements’, IAS 28, ‘Investments 
in associates’ , and IAS 31, ‘Interests in joint ventures’ , are effective prospectively 
in respect of business combinations for which the acquisition date falls within 
the ﬁrst annual reporting period beginning on or after 1st July 2009. 
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business 
combinations but with some signiﬁcant changes compared with IFRS 3. For 
example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the 
acquisition date, with contingent payments classiﬁed as debt subsequently 
re-measured through the Statement of Comprehensive Income. There is a 
choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-related costs 
are expensed. 
As the Group has adopted IFRS 3 (revised), it is required to adopt IAS 27 
(revised), ‘Consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements’, at the same time. 
IAS 27 (revised) requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling 
interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these 
transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard 
also speciﬁes the accounting when control is lost. There has been no impact 
of IAS 27 (revised) on the current period, as none of the non-controlling 
interests has a deﬁcit balance. There have been no transactions whereby an 
interest in an entity is retained after the loss of control of that entity; there have 
been no transactions with non-controlling interests. 
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are effective for the 
ﬁrst time in 2010 but are not relevant to the Group’s operations: 
IFRIC 17, ‘Distributions of non-cash assets to owners’. 
IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from customers’. 
Amendment to IFRS 1 ‘Additional exemptions for ﬁrst-time adopters’. 
IFRIC 9, ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives and IAS 39, Financial 
instruments: Recognition and measurement’. 
IFRIC 16, ‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’. 
IAS 1 (amendment), ‘Presentation of ﬁnancial statements’. 
IAS 36 (amendment), ‘Impairment of assets’. 
IFRS 2 (amendments), ‘Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions’ . 
IFRS 5 (amendment), ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations’. 
IAS 38 (amendment), ‘Intangible assets’. 
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been 
issued but are not effective for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1st January 2010 
and have not been early adopted. The ﬁnancial impact of the new standards, 
new interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations are not 
expected to be material. 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, issued in November 2009. This addresses the 
classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial assets and is likely to affect the 
Group’s accounting for its ﬁnancial assets. The standard is not applicable until 
1st January 2013 but is available for early adoption. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 9’s full impact. However, initial indications are that it may affect the Group’s 
accounting for its available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, as IFRS 9 only permits the 
recognition of fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income if they 
relate to equity investments that are not held for trading. Fair value gains and 
losses on available-for-sale debt investments, for example, will therefore have to 
be recognised directly in proﬁt or loss. In the current reporting period, the Group 
has not recognised any gains in other comprehensive income. The Group has not 
yet decided when to adopt IFRS 9.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements cont. 
For the year ended 31st December 2010 
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued 
d) Accounting standards continued 
IAS 24 (revised), ‘Related party disclosures’, issued in November 2009. It 
supersedes IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’, issued in 2003. IAS 24 
(revised) is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1st January 2011. 
Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted. However, the standard has 
not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
The revised standard clariﬁes and simpliﬁes the deﬁnition of a related party and 
removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose the details 
of transactions with the Government and other government-related entities. 
The Group will apply the revised standard from 1st January 2011. When the 
revised standard is applied, the Group and the parent will need to disclose any 
transactions between its subsidiaries and its associates. The Group is currently 
putting systems in place to capture the necessary information. It is, therefore, 
not possible at this stage to disclose the impact, if any, of the revised standard 
on the related party disclosures. 
‘Classiﬁcation of rights issues’ (amendment to IAS 32), issued in October 
2009. The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after 
1st February 2010. Earlier application is permitted. The amendment addresses 
the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency other than 
the functional currency of the issue. Provided certain conditions are met, such 
rights issues are now classiﬁed as equity regardless of the currency in which 
the exercise price is denominated. Previously, these issues had to be accounted 
for as derivative liabilities. The amendment applies retrospectively in accordance 
with IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’. 
The Group will apply the amended standard from 1st January 2011. It is not 
expected to have any impact on the Group or the parent ﬁnancial statements. 
IFRIC 19, ‘Extinguishing ﬁnancial liabilities with equity instruments’, effective 
1st July 2010. The interpretation clariﬁes the accounting by an entity when the 
terms of a ﬁnancial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing 
equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the 
ﬁnancial liability (debt for equity swap). It requires a gain or loss to be recognised 
in proﬁt or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying 
amount of the ﬁnancial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments 
issued. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably 
measured, the equity instruments should be measured to reﬂect the fair value 
of the ﬁnancial liability extinguished. The Group will apply the interpretation 
from 1st January 2011, subject to endorsement by the EU. It is not expected 
to have any impact on the Group or the parent ﬁnancial statements. 
‘Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement’ (amendments to IFRIC 14), 
issued in November 2009. The amendments correct an unintended 
consequence of IFRIC 14, ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a deﬁned beneﬁt asset, 
minimum funding requirements and their interaction’. Without the amendments, 
entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments 
for minimum funding contributions. This was not intended when IFRIC 14 was 
issued, and the amendments correct this. The amendments are effective for 
annual periods beginning 1st January 2011. Earlier application is permitted. 
The amendments should be applied retrospectively to the earliest comparative 
period presented. The Group will apply these amendments for the ﬁnancial 
reporting period commencing on 1st January 2011. 
Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 2010 were 
issued in May 2010. The effective dates vary standard by standard but most 
are effective 1st January 2010. 
Financial Statements 
e) Basis of consolidation 
The Consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group include the ﬁnancial 
statements of Development Securities PLC (‘Company’) and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the 
Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies generally 
accompanying the shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. 
Where necessary, adjustments have been made to the ﬁ nancial statements of 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to bring the accounting policies used 
and accounting periods into line with those of the Group. 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra­ group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included from the 
effective date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control. 
They are deconsolidated on the date that control ceases. 
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. Any 
excess of the purchase price of the business combination over the fair value of 
the identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value 
of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued 
by the Group. This fair value includes any contingent consideration. Acquisition-
related costs are expensed as incurred. 
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost also 
includes direct attributable costs of investment. The excess of consideration 
over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If the consideration is less than the fair value of the assets and 
liabilities acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
f) Associates and joint ventures 
An associated company is deﬁned as an undertaking other than a subsidiary or 
joint venture over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but not control, 
generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 per cent of the 
voting rights. The Group’s investments in associates included goodwill identiﬁed 
on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss. The Group’s investment 
in associates are accounted for in the Consolidated ﬁ nancial statements using 
the equity method. 
A joint venture is deﬁned as an undertaking other than a subsidiary or associated 
undertaking over which the Group has signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence and which is jointly 
controlled by two or more venturers under a contractual arrangement. The 
Group recognises its interest in a joint venture’s assets and liabilities using the 
equity method. 
Under the equity method, the interest in associates or joint ventures is carried 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the 
Group’s share of its net assets, less distributions received and less any 
impairment in value of individual investments. The Statement of Comprehensive 
Income reﬂects the Group’s share of the associate’s or joint venture’s 
result after tax only after its share of the proﬁts equals the share of losses 
not recognised.

The Group does not equity account for further losses from investments in 
associates or joint ventures where the investment, together with any long-term 
interest that, in substance, forms part of the net investment in the associate or 
joint venture, is held at nil value after provisions for impairment, unless the 
Group has incurred constructive or legal obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the associate or joint venture. 
g) Intangible assets 
i) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value 
of the Group’s share of the net identiﬁ able assets of the acquired subsidiary at 
the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in 
Intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not 
reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of 
impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected to 
beneﬁt from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identiﬁed 
according to operating segment. 
ii) Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets 
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject 
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject 
to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An 
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows (CGUs). Non-ﬁnancial assets, other than 
goodwill, that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal 
of the impairment at each reporting date. 
h) Revenue 
Revenue, which excludes value-added tax, represents: 
i) 	rental income, which is calculated on a straight-line basis. Any incentives 
for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread evenly over the period 
to the earlier of lease expiry and any tenant option to break, where, at 
inception of the lease, the Directors do not consider it to be reasonably 
certain that the option will not be exercised. Lease incentives are usually in 
the form of rent-free periods or capital contributions. Assets held within 
both the investment and development and trading segments earn rental 
income. Lease surrenders from lessees are taken to comprehensive income 
when they are contractually agreed; 
ii) 	trading income from operating properties comprises licence fee income, 
calculated on an accruals basis, and revenue from other services when 
provided. The income is classiﬁed within the operating segment; 
iii) project management fee income is recognised over the term for which 
project management services are provided based on the value of work 
completed and is classiﬁed within the development and trading segment; 
iv) development revenue and proﬁts are recognised in accordance with IAS 1 1, 
‘Construction contracts’ or IAS 18, ‘Revenue’ depending on whether all 
development risks, apart from the construction risk have passed to the 
purchaser under the terms of development agreement. Where only the 
construction risk remains the revenue and proﬁt on the development is 
recognised under IAS 11, so as to match the proportion of development 
work completed on a percentage completion basis. Proﬁts are only 
recognised where the outcome can be determined with reasonable certainty. 
Full provision is made for losses as soon as such losses are foreseen. Where 
revenue and proﬁt is recognised under IAS 18, disposals are recognised 
where the risks and rewards of ownership are considered to have been 
transferred to the purchaser. Proﬁts are recognised within the development 
and trading segment; 
v)	 the sales proceeds of trading properties, undeveloped land and building 
units held as inventory and sold during the year, are recognised when the 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser and 
are classiﬁed within the development and trading segment; 
vi) ﬁnance income is recognised by reference to the principal outstanding using 
the effective interest method; and 
vii) dividend income from investments is recognised when the Group’s right to 
receive income has been established. 
i) 	 Investment properties 
i) 	Investment properties are those properties that are held either to earn rental 
income or for capital appreciation or both. Investment properties may be 
freehold or leasehold properties. For leasehold properties that are classiﬁed 
as investment properties, the associated leasehold obligations are accounted 
for as ﬁnance lease obligations if they qualify to be treated as such. Land 
which is held either for long-term capital appreciation rather than for short-
term sale in the ordinary course of business is classiﬁed as an investment 
property. 
ii) 	Investment properties are measured initially at cost including transaction 
costs and thereafter are stated at fair value, which reﬂects market conditions 
at the balance sheet date. Surpluses and deﬁcits arising from changes in 
the fair value of investment properties are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the year in which they arise. 
iii) 	Completed investment properties are valued, at each reporting date, by 
independent valuers on the basis of market value in accordance with the 
Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors. Fair value is assessed as the estimated amount for which a 
property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer 
and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing 
wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without 
compulsion. A deduction is made to reﬂect purchaser’s acquisition costs. In 
determining the fair value, the capitalisation of net income method and the 
discounting of future cash ﬂows to their present value have been used, 
which are based upon assumptions including future rental income, 
anticipated maintenance costs and appropriate discount rate, and make 
reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties. 
iv) Investment properties in the course of development are valued by the 
Directors, on the basis of the expected value of the property when complete, 
less deductions for the costs required to complete the project and appropriate 
adjustments for risk and ﬁnance costs. In preparing these valuations the 
Directors consult with agents and other advisors to derive appropriate 
assumptions speciﬁc to each asset. 
v)	 Proﬁts and losses on disposal of investment properties are calculated by 
reference to book value and recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership are considered to have passed to the purchaser. Gains and 
losses are recognised within ‘Gains or losses on disposal of investment 
properties’ in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements cont. 
For the year ended 31st December 2010 
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued 
j) Property, plant and equipment 
i) Operating properties 
Operating properties are those properties classiﬁed as owner-occupied and 
held for business purposes rather than for investment, generating revenue by 
way of licence fees and ancillary services. These properties are recognised 
initially at cost, which includes the original purchase price of the asset and the 
costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use. Thereafter the asset is carried at fair value less depreciation and impairment 
charged subsequent to the date of revaluation. A revaluation surplus is credited 
to Other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading 
of Property revaluation reserve, unless it reverses a revaluation decrease on 
the same asset previously recognised as an expense, where it is ﬁrst credited 
to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to that extent. 
The fair value is determined each year by independent, professional valuers on 
the basis of Existing Use Value. Surpluses and deﬁcits in the period are included 
in the Property revaluation reserve within equity, except where carrying value 
is below depreciated cost, in which case surpluses and deﬁcits are included in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Depreciation is provided so as to 
write off the value of the properties, excluding land, over their expected useful 
lives, usually 25 years. 
ii) Other plant and equipment 
Other plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Depreciation is provided so as to 
write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets over their expected 
useful lives on a straight-line method. The principal annual rates used for this 
purpose are as follows: 
Fixtures and ﬁttings and computer equipment – 10% to 33% 
Motor vehicles – 20% 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if 
appropriate at the end of each reporting period. An asset’s carrying amount is 
written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying 
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with 
the carrying amount and are recognised within Other gains and losses in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
k) Leases 
Leases in which a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor are classiﬁed as operating leases. Rents payable under 
operating leases are charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
The Group leases certain long leasehold properties. Leases of property where 
the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed 
as ﬁnance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement 
at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. 
l) Inventory – development and trading properties 
Trading properties and pre-development costs incurred on future development 
projects are carried as inventory and stated at the lower of cost and estimated 
net realisable value. Cost includes directly attributable expenditure and interest. 
No element of overhead is included in cost, since it is not practical to identify 
overhead amounts in respect of particular assets. Where the Directors consider 
Financial Statements 
that the costs are not recoverable from the proposed scheme, the project or 
site is written down to its net realisable value, with the write-down taken to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Net realisable value is calculated as the 
estimated realisable value of the project or site, based upon our current plans, 
less all further costs to be incurred in making the sale. 
m) Current and deferred income tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, 
based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, together with any adjustment in respect of previous years. 
Deferred income tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in 
the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation 
of taxable proﬁ t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred income tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences or unutilised tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items recognised 
directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred income tax liability where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the 
Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
n) Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities 
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Balance 
Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual terms of the 
instrument. 
i) Financial assets 
The Group determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at initial 
recognition. The classiﬁcation depends on the purpose for which the ﬁnancial 
assets were acquired. 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are those loan or equity instrument non-
derivative ﬁnancial assets that are designated as such or are not classiﬁed as 
loans and receivables, ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss or 
held-to-maturity investments. After initial recognition, available-for-sale assets 
are measured at fair value, with gains or losses being recognised as a separate 
component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment 
is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
represented in equity is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Equity instrument ﬁnancial assets are held at cost in the event that the fair value 
of the instruments is not reliably measurable. 
Loans and other receivables with ﬁ xed or determinable payments, that are not 
quoted on an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been 
designated as either fair value through proﬁ t and loss or available-for-sale, are 
classiﬁed as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or

impaired as well as through the amortisation process. The Group’s loans and 
receivables are included within Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash 
equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are ﬁnancial assets held for 
trading. A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed in this category if acquired principally for 
the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held 
for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are 
classiﬁed as current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original 
invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is 
material, receivables are carried at amortised cost. Provision is made when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances 
in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as 
being remote. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against operating costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Amounts due from customers for contract work are included in trade and other 
receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of payments on 
account received. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits held at call with 
banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with no signiﬁcant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
ﬁnancial liability. For the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, 
cash and cash equivalents are stated net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Cash 
and cash equivalents include pledged cash held as security against ﬁnancial 
liabilities. 
Financial assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date. Assets 
are impaired where there is evidence that as a result of events that occurred 
after initial recognition, the estimated future cash ﬂows from the investments 
have been adversely affected. 
ii) Financial liabilities 
Debt and equity instruments are classiﬁed as either ﬁnancial liabilities or as 
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual obligations and 
classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt and loss or other 
ﬁnancial liabilities measured at amortised cost. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net 
of directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising 
on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are 
recognised respectively in ﬁnance income and ﬁnance costs. 
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values 
and subsequently at the higher of the amount recognised as a provision and 
the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation. 
Other ﬁnancial liabilities, including trade and other payables, are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost and are classiﬁed 
as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are 
presented as non-current liabilities. 
Amounts due to customers for contract work is included within trade and other 
payables and represents payments received in advance from customers. 
iii) Derivatives 
The Group enters into derivative ﬁnancial instruments, including interest rate 
swaps, caps and collars and cross-currency swaps, to manage its exposure to 
interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each 
reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income immediately unless the derivative is designated as an 
effective hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in 
proﬁt or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. 
iv) Hedging 
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classiﬁed as a non-current asset or a 
non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is more 
than 12 months and as a current asset or a current liability if the remaining 
maturity of the hedge relationship is less than 12 months. 
At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk 
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will 
be measured throughout its duration. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair value or cash ﬂows of hedged items. 
Cash ﬂow hedge – the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument is recognised in Other comprehensive income. The gain or 
loss relating to an ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. Amounts taken to equity are recycled to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the periods when the hedged item is 
recognised in proﬁt or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging 
relationship or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. 
o) Borrowing costs 
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on investment properties 
and inventories under development are capitalised. The interest capitalised is 
calculated using the rate of interest on the loan to fund the expenditure, or the 
Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings where appropriate, over the 
period from commencement of the development work until substantially all the 
activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale 
are complete. The capitalisation of ﬁnance costs is suspended if there are 
prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted. 
Capitalised interest is written off to direct costs on disposal of inventory or to 
operating proﬁt on disposal of investment properties. 
Fees paid on establishment of loan facilities are capitalised as a pre-payment 
for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it 
relates. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred. 
p) Provisions 
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to 
be required to settle the obligation. The accretion in the discount is recognised 
as an interest expense.

 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements cont. 
For the year ended 31st December 2010 
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued 
q) Pension schemes 
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution scheme. The charge to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year represents the actual amount 
payable to the scheme in the period. Differences between contributions 
payable in the year and contributions paid are shown as either accruals or 
prepayments in the Balance Sheet. 
r) Foreign currencies 
The Consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group are presented in UK 
Sterling, the Group’s functional and presentation currency. 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at 
the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance 
sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange movements 
are dealt with in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with exchange 
differences on borrowings taken to ﬁnance income/costs, except when 
deferred in equity as qualifying cash ﬂow hedges and qualifying net investment 
hedges. 
s) Segmental reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker (CODM). The 
CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the Board. 
t) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new Ordinary shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
u) Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans, the majority 
of which are cash-settled, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for cash-settled instruments of the Group. The fair 
value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the option 
is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options granted. 
The Group has used a Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the 
fair value of share options granted. An equal probability model has been used 
to determine the fair value of share awards under the Performance Share Plan. 
The cost of cash-settled transactions with employees and Directors is 
measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted 
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the 
date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. 
Financial Statements 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated 
as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁed, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisﬁed. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, 
representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’s 
best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of 
the number of cash-settled share-based instruments that will ultimately vest or, 
in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting 
as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous 
balance sheet date is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
with a corresponding entry in accruals. 
v) Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability 
in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
w) Deﬁnitions 
 Operating proﬁt/(loss): stated after gain on disposal of investment properties 
and the revaluation of the Investment property portfolio and before the results 
of associates, jointly controlled entities and ﬁnance income and costs. 
IPD Index and Total Portfolio Return: total return from the completed 
investment property portfolio, comprising net rental income or expenditure 
and capital gains or losses from disposals and revaluation surpluses or 
deﬁcits, divided by the average capital employed during the ﬁnancial period, 
as deﬁned and measured by Investment Property Databank Limited, a 
company that produces independent benchmarks of property returns. 
Total Shareholder Return: movement in share price over the year plus 
dividends paid as a percentage of the opening share price. 
 Gearing: expressed as a percentage, is measured as net debt divided by total 
shareholders’ funds. 
 EPRA is the European Public Real Estate Association. 
EPRA earnings is the proﬁt after taxation excluding investment property 
revaluations (including revaluations of joint venture investment properties), 
gains/(losses) on disposals of investment and trading properties, mark-to­ market movements of derivative ﬁnancial instruments (including those of joint 
ventures) and intangible asset movements and their related taxation. 
 EPRA net assets (EPRA NAV) are the Balance Sheet net assets excluding 
the mark-to-market adjustment on effective cash ﬂow hedges and related 
debt adjustments and deferred taxation on revaluations, and diluting for the 
effect of those shares potentially issuable under employee share schemes. 
 EPRA NAV per share is EPRA NAV divided by the diluted number of shares 
at the period end. 
 EPRA triple net assets is the EPRA NAV adjusted to reﬂect the fair value of 
debt and derivatives and to include deferred taxation on revaluations.

2 Segmental analysis 
The segmental information presented, as required for IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’, consistently follows the information provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision-Maker (CODM) and reﬂects the three sectors in which the Group is operational. The CODM, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the Board. The three operating divisions are: 
 Investment – management of the Group’s investment property portfolio, generating rental income and valuation surpluses from property management; 
 Development and trading – managing the Group’s development projects. Revenue is received from project management fees, development proﬁts and the 
disposal of inventory; and 
 Operating – serviced ofﬁce operations. Revenue is principally received from short-term licence fee income.
 
Unallocated assets and liabilities comprise amounts that cannot be speciﬁcally allocated to operating segments; an analysis is provided below.
 
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information. All operations occur and all assets are located in the United Kingdom,
 
except assets of £642,000 (2009: £642,000), which are located in France and The Netherlands. All revenue arises from continuing operations.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements cont. Financial Statements 
For the year ended 31st December 2010 
9 Earnings/(loss) per share and net assets per share 
Basic earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing proﬁ t/(loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing the proﬁt/(loss) attributable to equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all 
the dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares. 
Management has chosen to disclose the European Public Real Estate (EPRA) adjusted net assets per share and earnings per share from continuing activities 
in order to provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance and to assist comparison between European property companies. 
EPRA earnings/(loss) is the proﬁt/(loss) after taxation excluding investment property revaluations and mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swaps. 
EPRA net assets are the Balance Sheet net assets excluding mark-to-market adjustments on ﬁ nancial instruments used for hedging purposes and deferred 
taxation on revaluations and is calculated on a fully diluted basis. 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share and EPRA earnings/(loss) per share is based on the following data:

shares of 50 pence each were allotted following a Rights Issue. The weighted average number of Ordinary shares for 2009 has been adjusted accordingly.
 
Basic net assets per share amounts are calculated by dividing net assets by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the year-end.
 
Diluted net assets per share amounts are calculated by dividing net assets by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the year-end plus the number
 
of Ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares.

The Group’s Investment properties have been valued at 31st December 2010 and 2009 by independent valuers and by the Directors on the basis of market 
value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Completed Investment properties have been 
valued by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Chartered Surveyors, Savills Commercial Limited, Chartered Surveyors or Ryden LLP, Commercial Property Consultants 
at a value of £168,399,000 (2009: £153,938,000). 
Land held as investment property has been valued by Colliers CRE, Chartered Surveyors at £12,400,000 (2009: £10,000,000). 
Also included within Investment properties are freehold land and buildings representing investment properties under development, amounting to £18,438,000 
(2009: £17,098,000), which have been valued by the Directors. These properties comprise buildings and landholdings for current or future development as 
investment properties. This approach has been taken because the value of these properties is dependent on a detailed knowledge of the planning status, the 
competitive position of these assets and a range of complex project development appraisals. 
Investment properties under development include £7,104,000 (2009: £8,682,000) of landholdings adjacent to retail properties within the Group’s portfolio, 
acquired for the purpose of extending the existing shopping centres. The fair value of these properties rests in the planned extensions, and is difﬁcult to estimate 
pending conﬁrmation of designs and planning permission, and hence has been estimated by the Directors at cost as an approximation to fair value. 
£145,425,000 (2009: £121,825,000) of Investment properties are charged as security against the Group’s borrowings.

At 31st December 2010 1,268 
On 29th March 2010, the Group acquired 100.0 per cent of the issued shares in Henry Davidson Developments Limited (HDD), a property development company 
specialising in neighbourhood retail schemes (see note 20). 
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) identiﬁed according to the operating segment. The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been 
determined based on value-in-use calculations. The calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂow projections based on ﬁnancial budgets approved by management covering 
a period up to the completion of each project (or less than ﬁve years). The pre-tax discount rate used was 8.0 per cent. Goodwill of £1,268,000 arose as a result 
of HDD’s expected future proﬁts from two speciﬁc developments acquired. The carrying amount of the goodwill has been tested for impairment at the reporting 
date. No provision for impairment was considered necessary.

b) Investment in joint ventures 
The Group has the following interests in joint ventures: 
% of Country of 
holding  incorporation Principal activity Reporting segment Joint venture partner 
Manchester Arena Complex LP 30 United Kingdom Investment property Investment Patron Capital Partners 
Curzon Park Limited  50 United Kingdom Property development Development and trading Grainger PLC 
Wimbledon Phoenix Limited  50 United Kingdom Property development Development and trading Foinavon Limited (in administration) 
During the year the Group acquired a 30.0 per cent holding in Manchester Arena Complex Limited Partnership (MAC) with its partner, Patron Capital Partners, 
holding 70.0 per cent of the equity. The company is registered and incorporated in the United Kingdom. The Group’s 30.0 per cent holding has been recognised 
at its share of net assets as at 31st December 2010. MAC is accounted for as a joint venture as both partners jointly control the management of the asset. 
During the year the Group provided a further £5,000,000 funding to our Curzon Park Limited joint venture, to enable a partial repayment of the bank loan held 
within the entity. Our joint venture partner also made a similar contribution. These partial repayments reduced the bank’s loan to the joint venture entity to 
£15,610,000. In turn, the bank extended the loan for a new ﬁve-year term, with loan-to-value testing suspended for three years. 
The joint venture acquired the 10.5-acre Curzon Street site in Birmingham in November 2006. In March 2010, the Government published a paper outlining the 
proposed High Speed Rail Link between London and Birmingham (HS2), which indicates that the planned route passes through the site. The Group, together 
with its joint venture partner, has put on hold plans for development while it awaits the Government’s proposals for taking the project forward. The proposed 
route may restrict development by approximately two-thirds of its original potential. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the project, the Group has provided for 
its share of net assets. 
During 2009, the Group’s joint venture partners withdrew from Hammersmith Central Unit Trust resulting in a proﬁt of £221,000. Hammersmith Central Unit 
Trust is now accounted for as a subsidiary undertaking. 
The Group’s joint venture partner in Wimbledon Phoenix Limited, Foinavon Limited, went into administration on 26th August 2009 at which time the Directors 
considered the investment in joint venture to be impaired and made a full provision. On 14th February 2011, the Group acquired the 50.0 per cent share capital 
previously held by Foinavon Limited. The Group has provided for its share of net assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the project. 
Any contingent liabilities in relation to our joint venture partners are disclosed in note 23. 
The Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of its joint ventures, which includes amounts receivable from those joint ventures, is as follows:

Net realisable value has been estimated by the Directors, taking account of our plans for each project, the planning status and competitive position of each 
asset, and the anticipated market for the scheme. For material developments the Directors have consulted with third-party chartered surveyors in setting their 
market assumptions. The write down of £2,366,000 in 2009 was in respect of the reduced market value estimates of certain development and trading properties. 
Capitalised interest on development and trading properties to date is £615,000 (2009: £615,000). 
No interest was capitalised on development and trading properties during the year.

Provisions of £775,000 (2009: £1,114,000) relate to properties and £5,276,000 (2009: £6,008,000) to onerous leases. 
The property provisions arose from residual liabilities on completed development projects where the Group was responsible for certain development costs in 
prior years. The provisions include estimated costs, the timing and amount of which are currently uncertain. 
The onerous lease provision has arisen from four lease obligations entered into by the Group. A provision of £3,624,000 (2009: £3,100,000) has been made 
in respect of a lease to Stead & Simpson Limited of which Development Securities PLC is a guarantor. Stead & Simpson Limited was placed into administration 
on 28th January 2008. The lease was surrendered on 21st January 2011 and the provision represents the ﬁnal liability due as guarantor. Two provisions of 
£590,000 (2009: £1,250,000) and £52,000 (2009: £358,000) relate to onerous lease obligations entered into in 1989 and 1975 respectively. 
The ﬁnal provision is in respect of the Group’s lease entered into on 19th December 2008 for ofﬁce premises at One Kingdom Street, PaddingtonCentral. 
On 23rd December 2009, a lease was signed to sublet the ofﬁce at PaddingtonCentral to MWB Business Exchange Plc, thereby facilitating a letting of the 
entire ﬂoor to this serviced ofﬁce operator. The provision of £1,010,000 (2009: £1,300,000) relates to the shortfall in rent over the 15-year lease term.

participation is assessed by reference to the stage of completion of the project and progress on construction and lettings. The second phase of PaddingtonCentral 
was completed in 2008, and the participation was returned to the Group together with the related interest and proﬁt share. In accordance with the agreement 
with our funding partner, the Group immediately reinvested £5,000,000 in the next phase, Two Kingdom Street. 
Development loans to joint ventures include a number of working capital and project-speciﬁc loans of £5,703,000 (2009: £3,330,000) to CTP Securities 
Limited. The loans attract ﬁxed coupon rates of between 5.0 and 13.0 per cent. Included in the above amount is an interest-free loan of £208,000. 
Following the renegotiation of the Curzon Park Limited loan facility, the Group provided a £5,000,000 loan to the joint venture in order to repay a share of its 
bank debt. The joint venture partner provided a similar loan. 
During 2010, the Group entered into three further funding agreements totalling £3,023,000, in respect of projects in partnership. The loans attract ﬁxed coupon 
rates of between 3.0 and 8.5 per cent. 
Loan notes with a carrying value of £89,000 (2009: £89,000) are held in Continental Estates Corporation BV, an associate. Interest is earned at a ﬁxed rate 
of 6.0 per cent. Loan notes with a carrying value of £8,425,000 were issued in November 2007 by CTP Securities Limited, with a term of ﬁve years and a ﬁxed 
coupon rate of 4.25 per cent.

c) Financial risk management 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash ﬂow interest rate risk and price 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. 
The nature and extent of the Group’s ﬁnancial instrument risks, and the Directors’ approach to managing those risks, are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 35 to 41 and below. This note provides further detailed information on these instruments. 
Interest rate maturity proﬁle of ﬁnancial liabilities 
The following table sets out the carrying amount by maturity of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk:

 12,997 2,000 — 45,255 5,997 61,650 127,899 
Interest on ﬁ nancial instruments classiﬁ ed as variable rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on ﬁ nancial instruments classiﬁ ed as ﬁ xed rate 
is ﬁxed until the maturity of the instrument. The other ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities of the Group that are not included above are non-interest bearing 
and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group does not undertake signiﬁcant trade overseas, but does hold certain assets, amounting to £642,000 (2009: £642,000) denominated in foreign 
currencies. The currency exposure arising from these investments is not considered to materially affect the Group’s operations and is not subject to hedging 
arrangements. 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from €47,000,000 (2009: €47,000,000) loan notes issued during 2007 that are denominated in Euros. 
The Group has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap with a banking institution to minimise any potential risks. The cross-currency interest rate swap 
is cash collateralised and qualiﬁes to be accounted for as a cash ﬂow hedge as detailed below. The fair value of this cross-currency interest rate swap at 
31st December 2010 was an asset of £3,308,000 (2009: £7,473,000). 
The Group maintains a security deposit of £4,000,000 (2009: £4,000,000) throughout the loan note term. The security deposit is required to cash collateralise 
the foreign exchange risk of the cross-currency interest rate swap for the swap counterparty if Sterling appreciates against the Euro. The Group is further 
required to increase this security if £/€ appreciation is greater than 5.0 per cent. Since the issue of the loan notes in September 2007, the Euro has appreciated 
against Sterling.

Market risk 
A summary of market risk and its effect on the Group is set out in Business Risks on page 5 and further discussed in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 
8 and 9 and in the Operating Review on pages 10 to 31. 
Fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities 
Except as detailed below, in respect of ﬁxed rate debenture and loan facilities, the Directors consider the carrying amount to be either fair value or a reasonable 
approximation of fair value apart from equity instruments classiﬁed as available-for-sale assets under IAS 39, where fair value cannot be reliably measured. 
Fixed rate debt 
A valuation was carried out as at 31st December 2010 by J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to calculate the market value of the Group’s ﬁxed rate debt on a 
replacement basis, taking into account the difference between ﬁxed interest rates for the Group’s borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest rate 
of appropriate debt instruments. Whilst the replacement basis provides a consistent method for valuation of ﬁ xed rate debt, such ﬁ nancing facilities are in place 
to provide continuing funding for the Group’s activities. The valuation is therefore only an indication of a notional effect on the net asset value of the Group as 
at 31st December 2010 and may be subject to daily ﬂuctuations in line with money market movements. 
The fair value compared to the carrying amounts of the Group’s ﬁxed rate ﬁnancial liabilities as at 31st December 2010 is analysed below: 
Book value  Fair value 
31st December 31st December 
2010 2010 
£’000 £’000 
First Mortgage debenture 11% due 2016 20,000 25,711

First Mortgage debenture 11% due 2016 20,000 25,443 
Total ﬁxed rate ﬁnancial liabilities 20,000 25,443 
The fair value difference of £8,965,000 at 31st December 2010 (2009: £5,443,000) represents approximately 11.6 per cent of gross, ﬁxed rate borrowings 
(2009: 27.2 per cent). The effect on net assets per share after tax of this adjustment would be a decrease of 5.3 pence after tax (2009: 4.8 pence).

Cash ﬂow hedges: cross-currency interest rate swap 3,302 7,473 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments at fair value through the Statement of Comprehensive Income: 
Interest rate caps and collars 6 (2,126) 
At 31st December 2010, the Group held one cross-currency interest rate swap designated as a hedge of expected future cash ﬂows arising from €47,000,000
 
variable rate loan notes issued in September 2007. The cross-currency swap is used to hedge the EURIBOR interest rate exposure to a ﬁxed rate of 7.97 per cent 

(ﬁxed at a rate of €1.43:£) and Euro currency exposure from the loan notes. The terms of the derivative have been negotiated to match the terms of the loan notes.
 
The cash ﬂow hedge of the expected future loan note cash ﬂows was assessed to be effective. The mark-to-market movement in the foreign currency leg of
 
the swap of £1,352,000 (2009: £3,231,000) has been recycled through the Statement of Comprehensive Income to offset the re-translation of the €47,000,000
 
loan. The mark-to-market movement on the interest leg of this swap of £2,819,000 loss (2009: £2,794,000 gain) is included within the net unrealised gain/
 
(loss) reserve in equity.
 
At 31st December 2010, the Group held interest rate caps and swaps designated as economic hedges and not qualifying as effective hedges under IAS 39.
 
The derivatives are used to mitigate the Group’s interest rate exposure to variable rate loans of £6,565,000 (2009: £30,952,000). The fair value of the
 
derivatives £6,000 is recorded as a ﬁnancial asset at 31st December 2010 (2009: £2,126,000 liability) with the fair value gain/(loss) taken to ﬁnance costs.
 
Fair value estimation
 
From 1st January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for ﬁnancial instruments that are measured in the Balance Sheet at fair value, which
 
requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
 
i) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
 
ii) Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived
 
from prices) (level 2). 
iii) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).

The following are the deferred income tax liabilities and assets and movements thereon recognised by the Group during the current and previous ﬁ nancial year. 
The UK corporation tax rate will decrease on 1st April 2011 from 28.0 per cent to 27.0 per cent. Deferred income tax is calculated on the temporary differences 
under the liability method using a tax rate of 27.0 per cent (2009: 28.0 per cent).

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net. 
Deferred income tax assets arising from the Group’s trading and capital losses are recognised on the basis that there will be sufﬁcient proﬁts in the foreseeable 
future to utilise such losses. The Group has not recognised deferred income tax assets of £11,839,000 (2009: £12,099,000) in respect of losses amounting 
to £43,848,000 (2009: £43,211,000) that can be carried forward against future taxable income. The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation 
tax by 1.0 per cent per annum to 24.0 per cent by 1st April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year. The overall effect of the further changes 
from 27.0 per cent to 24.0 per cent, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31st December 2010, would be to reduce the net deferred income tax 
asset by £nil. 
Movements in deferred income tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances) are shown on the previous page.

Any options granted on or before 7th November 2002 have not been recognised under IFRS 2 under the exemption in that standard. These options have not 
been subsequently modiﬁed and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. 
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was £0.50 (2009: £0.50). The average share price during the year was 255.0 pence (2009: 
285.0 pence). Of the 528,647 (2009: 418,447) outstanding options at 31st December 2010, 229,166 were exercisable (2009: 229,166). 
The options outstanding at 31st December 2010 were exercisable between 274.16 pence and 559.75 pence per share and have a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 4.2 years (2009: 4.4 years). 
The fair value of grants is measured at the grant date using a Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
instruments were granted. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. The main assumptions 
of the Black-Scholes pricing model are as follows: 
Grant date 31.08.10 08.05.09 28.10.08 28.04.06 27.10.05 19.04.04 
Exercise price (pence) 248.0 275.0 274.16 559.75 430.25 347.5 
Term (years) 7 7 3 7 7 7 
Expected volatility 23% 79% 90% 22% 20% 10% 
Expected dividend yield p.a. 1.9% 2.0% 2.0% 1.5% 1.5% 1.5% 
Risk-free rate 2.9% 1.5% 3.5% 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% 
Expected forfeiture p.a. Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Development Securities PLC share price over multiple time periods. The expected 
volatility reﬂects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
Conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan 
The terms of the Performance Share Plan are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 59. 
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded under the Performance Share Plan are valued at their fair value on the date of the award, using an Equal Probability 
Model, which takes into account the probability of the Ordinary shares vesting based on an equal probability of achieving appropriate total shareholder return 
ranking as determined under the performance condition. 
The principal assumptions for calculating the fair value of the Ordinary shares conditionally awarded are:
 2010 2009

Ordinary shares conditionally awarded (no. of shares) 527,621 660,277

Percentage probability applied for fair value 36.88% 36.88%

The expense recognised for equity-settled share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year is £nil (2009: £nil). 
The expense recognised for cash-settled share-based payments during the year is £19,000 (2009: £68,000).

The merger reserve comprises the premium on shares following the Placing and Rights Issue in July and August 2010 and the Firm Placing and Placing and 
Open Offer in July 2009. No share premium is recorded in the Company’s ﬁnancial statements through the operation of the Merger Relief provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. The subsequent redemption of these shares gave rise to distributable proﬁts of £73,678,000 (2009: £79,141,000), which have been 
transferred to Retained earnings. 
Transaction costs of £6,514,000 have been charged through the newly created merger reserve in the year. Prior to amendments to the Companies Act 2006, 
transaction costs were charged to the share premium account. 
The Capital redemption reserve arose from business combinations in prior ﬁnancial periods. This reserve is not distributable.

On 29th March 2010, the Group acquired 100.0 per cent of the issued shares in Henry Davidson Developments Limited (HDD), a property development company 
specialising in neighbourhood retail schemes. 
Details of the purchase consideration, the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows: 
Purchase consideration £’000 
— Cash paid 1,574 
— Inter-company loan repayment 2,210 
Total purchase consideration 3,784 
The assets and liabilities recognised as a result of the acquisition are as follows: 
Fair value 
£’000 
Inventory – development and trading properties 18,114 
Trade and other receivables 2,224

Borrowings (3,416) 
Net identiﬁable assets acquired 
Goodwill 
2,516 
1,268 
3,784 
The goodwill of £1,268,000 is attributable to HDD’s expertise and reputation and expected future proﬁ ts of development projects that were acquired. None of 
the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
(a) Acquisition-related costs 
Acquisition-related costs of £228,000 are included in operating expenses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
(b) Acquired receivables 
The fair value of trade and other receivables is £2,224,000 and includes trade receivables with a fair value of £13,000. 
(c) Acquired inventory 
The fair value adjustments in respect of inventory relate to speciﬁc projects that are due to generate proﬁts in the short-term. The proﬁts have been adjusted for 
project-speciﬁc risks and uncertainties that may impact the proﬁt level. These adjustments are based on Directors’ best estimates. 
(d) Revenue and proﬁt contribution 
The acquired business contributed revenues of £8,130,000 and a net proﬁt of £1,326,000 to the Group for the period from 29th March 2010 to 31st December 
2010. If the acquisition had occurred on 1st January 2010, consolidated revenue and consolidated proﬁt for the year ended 31st December 2010 would have 
been £8,130,000 and £261,000 respectively.

Property investment income earned during the year was £12,865,000 (2009: £10,080,000). 
23 Contingent liabilities 
In the normal course of its development activity the Group is required to guarantee performance bonds provided by banks in respect of certain obligations 
of Group companies. At 31st December 2010 such guarantees amounted to £34,000 (2009: £134,000). 
The Group has provided guarantees for rent liabilities in respect of properties previously occupied by Group companies. In the event that the current tenants 
ceased to pay rent, the Group would be liable to cover any shortfall until the building could be re-let. The Group has made provision against crystallised liabilities 
in this regard. In respect of potential liabilities where no provision has been made, the annual rent-roll of the buildings beneﬁting from such guarantees 
is £374,000 (2009: £374,000) with an average unexpired lease period of 6.7 years (2009: 7.7 years). 
The Group has guaranteed its share of the interest payable by Wessex Property Fund (see note 12(a)) in respect of the Fund’s borrowings of £17,500,000. 
The interest liability is currently covered by the Fund’s rental income. 
The Group has also guaranteed its share of the capital and interest payable by Curzon Park Limited, a joint venture, in respect of the company’s borrowings 
of £15,610,000. 
24 Pension scheme 
The Company operates a deﬁ ned contribution scheme for Directors and employees. Monthly premia are invested in an independent insured fund. The amounts

Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of Development Securities PLC 
We have audited the Parent company ﬁnancial statements of Development 
Securities PLC for the year ended 31st December 2010 which comprise the 
Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes. The ﬁ nancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 51, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Parent 
company ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent 
company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
Financial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the Financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial 
statements. 
Opinion on ﬁ nancial statements 
In our opinion the Parent company ﬁnancial statements: 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
31st December 2010; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Report of the Directors for the ﬁnancial year for 
which the Parent company ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Parent company ﬁnancial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or 
the Parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or 
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not 
made; or 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.

We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements of Development 
Securities PLC for the year ended 31st December 2010.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements 
For the year ended 31st December 2010 
28 Accounting policies 
a) Basis of accounting
 
The Company’s ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with
 
applicable laws and United Kingdom accounting standards and on a going
 
concern basis and under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies
 
adopted are consistent with the previous year and are set out below.
 
The Company has not presented its own proﬁt and loss account, as permitted
 
by s408 of the Companies Act 2006. The loss after tax for the year was
 
£8,467,000 (2009: £7,772,000).
 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash
 
ﬂow statement under the terms of FRS 1.
 
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D of
 
FRS 29, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and has not disclosed information
 
required by that standard, as the Group’s consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, in
 
which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group
 
under IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
 
The accounts were approved by the Directors for issue on 1st March 2011.
 
b) Investments
 
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are
 
accounted for in the ﬁnancial statements at cost less any provision for
 
impairment.
 
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at
 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
 
c) Operating leases
 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis
 
to the proﬁ t and loss account over the lease term even if the payments are not
 
made on such a basis.
 
d) Tangible assets
 
Tangible assets are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
 
provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset
 
and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its
 
intended use. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost less estimated
 
residual value of such assets over their expected useful lives on a straight-line
 
basis. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are as follows:
 
Fixtures and ﬁttings and computer equipment – 10% to 33%
 
Motor vehicles – 20%
 
e) Provisions
 
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive
 
obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources
 
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to
 
be required to settle the obligation. The accretion in the discount is recognised
 
as an interest expense.
 
f) Taxation
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year,
 
using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together with any
 
adjustment in respect of previous years.
 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences
 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements
 
and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t, and
 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences or unutilised tax 
losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items recognised 
directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the proﬁt and loss account. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
g) Pension schemes 
The Company operates a deﬁned contribution scheme on behalf of the 
Development Securities PLC Group. The charge to the proﬁt and loss account 
in the period represents the actual amount payable to the scheme in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions paid 
are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. 
h) Foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at 
the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at 
the rates ruling at that date. Exchange movements are dealt with in the Proﬁt 
and loss account. 
i) Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of share-based compensation plans, the 
majority of which are cash-settled, under which the entity receives services 
from employees as consideration for cash-settled instruments of the Company. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of 
the option is recognised as an expense. 
The Company has used a Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the 
fair value of share options granted. An equal probability model has been used to 
determine the fair value of share awards under the Performance Share Plan. The 
cost of cash-settled transactions with employees and Directors is measured by 
reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised 
as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. In valuing cash-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions 
linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated 
as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁed, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisﬁed. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, 
representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market 
conditions and of the number of cash-settled share-based instruments that will 
ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, 
be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in cumulative expense 
since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Proﬁt and loss 
account, with a corresponding entry in accruals.

The onerous lease provision has arisen from two lease obligations entered into by the Group. A provision of £3,624,000 (2009: £3,100,000) has been made 
in respect of a lease to Stead & Simpson Limited of which Development Securities PLC is a guarantor. Stead & Simpson Limited was placed into administration 
on 28th January 2008. The lease was surrendered on 21st January 2011 and the provision represents the ﬁnal liability due as guarantor. 
The second provision is in respect of the Group’s lease entered into on 19th December 2008 for ofﬁce premises at One Kingdom Street, PaddingtonCentral. 
On 23rd December 2009, a lease was signed to sublet the ofﬁce at PaddingtonCentral to MWB Business Exchange Plc, thereby facilitating a letting of the 
entire ﬂoor to this serviced ofﬁce operator. The provision of £1,010,000 (2009: £1,300,000) relates to the shortfall in rent over the 15-year lease term. 
These provisions have been calculated by making assumptions about future lettings, the outcome of which is uncertain.

Any options granted on or before 7th November 2002 have not been recognised under IFRS 2 under the exemption in that standard. These options have not 
been subsequently modiﬁed and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. 
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was £0.50 (2009: £0.50). The average share price during the year was 255.0 pence 
(2009: 285.0 pence). Of the 528,647 (2009: 418,447) outstanding options at 31st December 2010, 229,166 were exercisable (2009: 229,166). 
The options outstanding at 31st December 2010 were exercisable between 274.16 pence and 559.75 pence per share and have a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 4.2 years (2009: 4.4 years). 
The fair value of grants is measured at the grant date using a Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
instruments were granted. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. The main assumptions 
of the Black-Scholes pricing model are as follows: 
Grant date 31.08.10 08.05.09 28.10.08 28.04.06 27.10.05 19.04.04 
Exercise price (pence) 248.0 275.0 274.16 559.75 430.25 347.5 
Term (years) 7 7 3 7 7 7 
Expected volatility 23% 79% 90% 22% 20% 10% 
Expected dividend yield p.a. 1.9% 2.0% 2.0% 1.5% 1.5% 1.5% 
Risk-free rate 2.9% 1.5% 3.5% 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% 
Expected forfeiture p.a. Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Development Securities PLC share price over multiple time periods. The expected 
volatility reﬂects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
Conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan 
The terms of the Performance Share Plan are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 59. 
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded under the Performance Share Plan are valued at their fair value on the date of the award, using an Equal Probability 
Model, which takes into account the probability of the Ordinary shares vesting based on an equal probability of achieving appropriate total shareholder return 
ranking as determined under the performance condition. 
The principal assumptions for calculating the fair value of the Ordinary shares conditionally awarded are:
 2010 2009 
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded (no. of shares) 527,621 660,277 
Date of award 23rd April 8th May 
Share price (pence) 264.0 310.0 
Percentage probability applied for fair value 36.88% 36.88% 
Vesting period (months) 32 32 
The expense recognised for equity-settled share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year is £nil (2009: £nil). The expense 
recognised for cash-settled share-based payments during the year is £19,000 (2009: £68,000).

The merger reserve comprises the premium on shares following the Placing and Rights Issue in August 2010 and the Firm Placing and Placing and Open Offer 
in July 2009. No share premium is recorded in the Company’s ﬁ nancial statements through the operation of the Merger Relief provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. The subsequent redemption of these shares gave rise to distributable proﬁ ts of £73,678,000 (2009: £79,141,000), which have been transferred to the 
Proﬁt and loss account.

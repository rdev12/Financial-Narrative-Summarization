Chairman’s statement
Results and dividend
2014 was another year of progress for GKN. We have delivered a good 
set of results. I am particularly pleased with the results because 
in some respects 2014 was not a straightforward year: we faced 
considerable currency headwinds with sterling unusually strong 
against all major currencies for much of the year, the agricultural 
market fell sharply and the military aerospace market continued 
to decline. Despite this, we have grown both our organic sales and 
overall profit. This shows the resilience of our business model and 
strength of our strategy. 
We have continued with our progressive dividend policy and are 
recommending a final dividend of 5.6 pence per share, making a 
total of 8.4 pence per share for the year, an increase of 6% over the 
prior year. Over the course of the past five years we have seen the 
dividend rise 68% from 5.0 pence per share in 2010 to 8.4 pence in 
respect of 2014. 
C ontinued progress
Our strategy
Our strategy is central to the year’s good results. We successfully 
positioned our automotive businesses to grow above the market and 
in 2014 they grew 8% organically compared to market growth of 3%. 
We have repositioned our aerospace business so that 73% is now in 
the higher growth commercial sector, compared to just 42% in 2007. 
Following the successful acquisition and integration as a whole of 
Volvo Aero, we have a leading aerospace engine systems business 
with excellent exposure to some fast-growing platforms. In the 
medium term our aerospace business is very well positioned to take 
advantage of growing platforms such as the Boeing 787 , the A350 
and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
Each year we seek to improve our strategy process. In 2014 we 
refined how we review and develop the Group’s strategic objectives 
by increasing our focus on long term market, economic and 
technology trends. There are some exciting changes ahead of us, 
including the increasing electrification of vehicles and the use of 
additive manufacturing in aerospace. We continue to invest to take 
advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes. Our 
strategic objectives are described in further detail on page 9.
“ We are a long term business with the  
right strategy.” Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
07 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
We did not make any major acquisitions in 2014, taking a disciplined 
approach to potential opportunities and choosing to focus on 
thoroughly integrating our engine systems business following the 
acquisition of Volvo Aero in 2012. During 2014 we were awarded 
investment grade status with all three of the major rating agencies 
and continued to pay down our debt. We are now in a strong  
position to make further acquisitions, but will continue to take a 
focused approach.
Sustainability and risk
GKN has a long history of behaving ethically; of doing the right 
thing. We recognise that we continuously need to ensure that we set 
the right tone from the top and engage with our people to ensure 
that they understand the behaviours that we expect of them. For 
this reason we revised the GKN Code during 2014, making it clearer 
and more engaging, and updating it to bring additional focus to 
areas such as diversity and inclusion, and quality. We have also 
strengthened our diversity and inclusion programme, which is visibly 
supported by the Board, and we have worked hard to improve quality 
and product safety through the ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative 
described by Nigel on page 18.
We have well developed risk management processes, but are not 
complacent and note the emphasis on risk management in the 
revised 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code. We continue to work 
to improve our risk management processes and control systems. We 
have described our work in this area in greater detail on pages 42-51.
The Board
Adam Walker joined the Board at the start of 2014 and quickly became 
an effective member of the team. I am confident that he will be an 
asset to the Company. On 31 December 2014 Marcus Bryson CBE  
retired from his role as Chief Executive Aerospace and Land Systems 
and from the Board. Marcus joined GKN in 1994 and since then 
his contribution to the creation of the GKN we see today, and in 
particular our aerospace division, has been significant. He fully 
deserves the CBE recently awarded for his contribution to the UK 
aerospace industry. We have not replaced Marcus on the Board for 
now and have chosen instead to strengthen the Executive Committee 
with the appointment of Kevin Cummings, CEO GKN Aerospace,  
Peter Oberparleiter, CEO GKN Powder Metallurgy, and Philip Swash,  
CEO GKN Land Systems. They will regularly attend Board meetings to 
ensure that the Board continues to have a good feel for  
what is happening in each division. The Board has real  
diversity of experience and technical expertise, and the  
Board dynamic continues to be excellent with all Directors  
making a valuable contribution. 
Our people
Meeting a wide range of customer expectations is never easy,  
but GKN’s culture is to persevere and through the commitment  
of our people we have delivered a good set of results. They have 
again demonstrated GKN’s resilience and ability to grow above  
the market. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for  
all that they have done.
I have written in the past about a pressing need for a global talent 
pool that is well stocked with young people with the necessary 
scientific and mathematical skills. That remains the case and I am 
glad to report that around the world GKN continues to engage in 
hundreds of local initiatives designed to encourage young people  
to choose engineering as a possible future career. 
Looking forward
As we enter 2015, political and economic uncertainty will continue  
to affect GKN. But we are a long term business with the right  
strategy. I am therefore confident that the Group will continue to 
grow and generate sustainable returns for our shareholders during 
2015 and beyond.

The world population is expected to reach over 
nine billion by 2050, an increase of more than 
two billion from today’s level, with growth 
mainly in urban areas.
Our business model / Global markets
Population growth drives change across our markets: increased 
demand for flights and larger aircraft, changes in the types of car 
people drive and the number of cars on the roads, a requirement 
for increased farming efficiency to help double global agricultural 
production, as well as infrastructure development in cities. All of 
this influences our product development and offers significant 
growth opportunities.
There is also the continual drive to improve the fuel efficiency 
of aircraft, cars and other vehicles, while at the same time 
increasing manufacturing efficiency and product safety. Demand 
for fuel-efficient solutions remains high due to concerns over 
CO2 emissions and air quality. Advanced electric and hybrid 
alternatives are replacing traditional mechanical processes 
and GKN has specific expertise in electric and hybrid vehicle 
technology and electrically-driven machinery which help our 
customers meet this challenge. 
Manufacturers are increasingly opting for lightweight designs 
and materials. Composite aerostructures and engine components 
are already relatively common on new platforms, while in the 
automotive industry, components are being designed to reduce 
weight and size. Development work is underway in both sectors 
to increase the opportunities for lightweight materials. GKN has 
significant know-how in lightweight materials and increasingly 
in advanced production technologies such as ‘Design for Powder 
Metallurgy’ and additive manufacturing that offer the opportunity 
to optimise product design.

2014 performance          
Group management sales
(a)
 
declined by 2% on an absolute 
basis and grew by 4% on an 
organic basis. The corresponding 
figures for GKN Aerospace were a 
decrease of 1% and an increase of 
3%; for GKN Driveline increases of 
1% and 8% respectively; for GKN 
Powder Metallurgy a decrease of 
2% and an increase of 5%; and for 
GKN Land Systems decreases of 
14% and 10% respectively. 
The Group trading margin in 
2014 of 9.2% reflects good 
performance in all four divisions 
relative to their markets. The 
divisional trading margins were: 
GKN Aerospace – 12.4%; GKN 
Driveline – 8.1%; GKN Powder 
Metallurgy – 11.0%; and GKN 
Land Systems – 5.7%.
Group ROIC of 17.7% in 2014 
reflects improved profitability 
partially offset by an increased 
asset base. Divisional ROIC 
performance was as follows: 
GKN Aerospace – 17.7%; GKN 
Driveline – 19.3%; GKN Powder 
Metallurgy – 21.8%; and GKN 
Land Systems – 11.4%.
Free cash flow amounted to  
£234 million, following a 
continued focus on operating 
cash generation throughout 
2014 which included an increase 
in capital expenditure and 
research and development 
investment, and repayment of a 
government refundable advance.
Management EPS in 2014 was 
29.0 pence compared with  
28.7 pence in 2013, an increase 
of 1%.
Dividend per share increased  
in 2014 reflecting positive 
earnings and cash performance. 
The dividend for the year, at  
8.4 pence, is covered 3.4 times 
by management earnings and  
1.7 times by free cash flow.

Non-financial KPIs
Non-financial KPIs help measure the sustainability of our business and progress towards operational 
excellence. We strive to operate in a safe, efficient and ethical manner, and at the same time aim to be an 
employer of choice and make a positive impact on the environment and the communities in which we operate. 
More information can be found in the sustainability report on pages 52-59.
Health and safety performance 
Per 1,000 employees 
Method of calculation 
Accident frequency rate (AFR) measured as the number of lost time accidents per 1,000 employees and 
accident severity rate (ASR) measured as the number of days/shifts lost due to accidents and occupational 
ill health per 1,000 employees. 
Target
Zero preventable accidents. 
2014 performance 
AFR reduced to 1.3 (2013: 1.6). However ASR saw a small increase to 46 (2013: 40), primarily due to specific 
occupational health issues of three employees in North America. More information can be found on page 54.
Environmental performance 
Main impacts on the environment 
Method of calculation 
Energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions, waste generation, waste recycled and water 
consumption measured on a divisional basis per unit of production and against sales in GKN Aerospace. 
Target 
Improved year-on-year performance across all KPIs, with a 15% improvement in energy efficiency from  
2009 to 2014. 
2014 performance 
Environmental performance in 2014 was in line with expectations, with most divisions achieving improved 
results in energy consumption, CO2 emissions, waste and water consumption. Group energy efficiency 
decreased by 4% over 2013, primarily due to currency fluctuations depressing statutory sales, but improved 
by 16% since 2009, meeting our target of a 15% improvement over the five years. See page 58 for more 
information on our environmental performance.
Governance 
Online compliance training
Completion of mandated compliance training on anti-bribery and corruption, competition law and IT security.
Method of calculation 
Measured as a percentage completion against a pre-defined target audience of employees.
Target 
100% training completion for all employees within the target audience. 
2014 performance 
• 98% (7 ,284 employees) of the target audience have to date completed our online anti-bribery training 
(2013: 84%; 6,302 employees).
• 98% (1,575 employees) of the target audience have to date completed our online competition law 
training (2013: 98%; 1,594 employees).
• 85% (14,191 employees) of the target audience have to date completed our online IT security training 
(2013: 37%; 6,273 employees).
Our people 
Management turnover 
Method of calculation 
Management turnover is a measure of success in retaining our leaders and achieving our goal of being 
an employer of choice. Voluntary turnover of management employees, which excludes compulsory 
redundancies, terminations and retirements, is calculated as a percentage of total subsidiary management 
level employees. 
Target
Voluntary turnover of less than 5% of management employees.
2014 performance
In 2014, voluntary management turnover was 4.7% (2013: 6.1%), bringing us into our target range of less 
than 5%.

Chief Executive’s review
The Group continued its progress in 2014 helped by good growth in 
our automotive and aerospace businesses which more than offset 
the headwinds of adverse currency translation and difficult land 
systems markets. Although management sales declined to  
£7 ,456 million, this represented underlying, organic growth 
of 4%. Earnings per share increased by 1% and the Board has 
recommended an increase to the dividend of 0.5 pence.
Our aim is to create long term and sustainable shareholder value 
through a balanced approach with three elements: growth, trading 
margin and return on invested capital. 
We look to grow sales ahead of our markets, have targeted our 
Group margin to run in the 8-10% range and have a goal for return on 
invested capital (ROIC) of around 20%. I am pleased that in 2014 we 
made progress against all three of these objectives.
NIGEL STEIN

Moving forward
Our business
Over the course of the year we have seen the benefit of our business 
model. We are a global engineering business serving the world’s 
leading original equipment manufacturers in three large markets. 
But whichever the market, our approach and strategy are the same: 
using our knowledge of our customers and their needs, combined 
with our leading technology, excellent global footprint and broad 
operational excellence, to design, develop and deliver outstanding 
products. This requires a thorough understanding of market trends 
and a strong capability for product innovation. There are good 
examples of both throughout this report including the case studies 
featured on pages 25-37.
The table opposite summarises some strategic landmarks for the 
Group and in the business review (pages 22-37) we set out the most 
noteworthy divisional achievements. Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
17 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Leading in our chosen markets – excellent positions in their markets 
helped all four divisions prove successful in winning new business 
during 2014. GKN Aerospace won business for both aerostructures 
and engine systems, with the risk and revenue sharing partnership to 
supply components for the Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW100 Geared 
Turbofan
TM
 engine. GKN Driveline won significant sideshaft business 
with Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, BMW, Renault Nissan, Mazda 
and Hyundai whilst successfully designing and launching several 
all-wheel drive products with Fiat, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover. 
For GKN Powder Metallurgy, new business wins in the year totalled 
£165 million, higher than last year’s equivalent and including a 
good proportion of higher margin ‘Design for Powder Metallurgy’ 
components. For GKN Land Systems, the tough markets limited 
options, but its business in the industrial market continued to do 
well, successfully exploiting its leadership in clutches and brakes.
During the year we sold our stake in the emissions control business 
Emitec, a good business with sound prospects, but which did not 
give GKN a route to a leadership position in that market. 
Leveraging a strong global presence – having manufacturing 
plants and design centres located around the world, close to our 
customers, is an important strategic advantage for GKN. We also use 
the regional presence of one division to help other divisions enter or 
expand in that market. 
Mexico and Asia in general saw the greatest activity in this respect. 
Over the course of 2014, Group capital investment in Mexico and 
Asia was £37 million and £56 million respectively.
China continues to be an important market for GKN. Although the 
country’s economic growth has eased in recent years, growth of 
around 7% remains very attractive. We have continued to build 
our GKN Driveline joint venture company whilst at the same time 
expanding the activities of GKN Land Systems and GKN Powder 
Metallurgy in the country. We are also seeking to establish GKN 
Aerospace in China but this remains a work in progress.
Differentiating ourselves through technology – our excellent 
technology helped win significant business this year. This was clearly 
demonstrated through GKN Driveline’s critical role in the Fiat Chrysler 
small all-wheel drive platform, GKN Powder Metallurgy driving its 
margin through new ‘Design for Powder Metallurgy’ component 
wins and GKN Land Systems winning new business with Claas on 
the back of superior technical offering. GKN Aerospace continued 
building its position as a technology leader and was pleased to be 
awarded leadership of a challenging £30 million future wing research 
programme, backed by the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute. 
They also delivered an innovative wing leading edge demonstrator to 
the Clean Sky programme, helping bring an ultra-high performance, 
natural laminar flow wing closer to reality.
Increasing investment was made into advanced engineering projects 
looking to the longer term, including development work on additive 
manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), the electrification of 
vehicle powertrains, future wing technologies and energy storage.  
All look likely to drive significant market changes in the future.

Operational excellence – is fundamental to what we do and provides 
the opportunity to differentiate ourselves in our customers’ eyes. 
Employee safety is our number one priority and our performance 
is set out on page 54. In general 2014 saw a good reduction in the 
number of accidents. However, in February 2014 an employee at GKN 
Aerospace Engine Systems’ El Cajon plant in the US suffered a fatal 
injury whilst operating a forklift truck. I deeply regret this loss of life 
and we have provided support to the employee’s family. Lessons 
have been learned from this and applied elsewhere in the Group.
Across the Group, the GKN Lean manufacturing programme enables 
us to continue to drive continuous improvement in manufacturing 
performance and back-office processes.
Listening to the ‘Voice of the Customer’ in a direct way is vital to our 
success. During 2014 we have implemented improved processes 
to ensure all employees keep their eyes focused on our customers’ 
own ratings of us, understand any concerns and work speedily and 
determinedly to resolve them. Although customers’ views have 
always been important in GKN, I am confident the positive effect of 
this direct feedback will prove an advantage in building our business.
Together the successful delivery of these four strategic objectives 
helped deliver the fifth strategic objective of sustaining above 
market growth. In 2014 overall Group sales showed an organic 
increase of 4%, better than average for our markets.
Chief Executive’s review
Doing the right thing 
Underpinning these results is a strong set of GKN Values. We 
call this ‘doing the right thing’ and the effects of this are set out 
in the sustainability report on pages 52-59. At our 2014 internal 
International Leadership Conference, considerable time was spent 
discussing how GKN’s most senior people should demonstrate our 
Group Values.
Supporting this we have introduced new processes for clarifying 
to managers what is expected of them and getting their 
acknowledgment they understand this. In the months ahead we will 
be running a process of re-communicating the GKN Code to every 
employee wherever they are and no matter which of the 27 Group-
wide languages they speak.
Summary
The continued implementation of our strategy in 2014 delivered 
organic growth, improved margins and increased ROIC, together 
bringing increased financial returns to our shareholders. This 
could not have been achieved without the expertise, focus and 
sheer hard work of the 51,400 committed GKN people around the 
world. In closing, I would like to thank everyone in the GKN team 
for their contribution this year. I would also like to thank my former 
colleagues Marcus Bryson CBE and Bill Seeger for their support and 
contribution as members of my Executive team and the Board.
“ The continued implementation of our strategy in 2014

ROIC, together bringing increased financial returns to our 
shareholders.” Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
19 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Looking ahead
Commercial aircraft production should continue to be strong 
whereas military markets are forecast to decline. GKN Aerospace’s 
2015 organic sales are expected to be broadly flat, reflecting these 
differing trends and the phasing of our programmes. However, a 
strong commercial order book supports attractive growth for GKN 
Aerospace over the medium term.
In automotive, external forecasts predict growth in global light 
vehicle production of around 2% with increases in China and North 
America, and Europe flat. Against this background, GKN Driveline 
and GKN Powder Metallurgy are expected to continue to grow 
organically above the market.
Softer global agricultural equipment markets are likely to more than 
offset the slight improvement in industrial markets. As a result,  
GKN Land Systems 2015 sales are expected to be lower than 2014 
and an £8 million restructuring charge is planned to further reduce 
the fixed cost base. 
Although some markets remain challenging, 2015 is expected to 
be a year of further growth. Beyond 2015, we are well positioned to 
outperform in our large global markets.

GKN DRIVELINE VIGO
Operational excellence founded on Lean manufacturing is a focus for 
GKN sites across the world. This culture of continuous improvement 
enables GKN to deliver quality products and exceptional customer 
service, and GKN Driveline in Vigo, Northern Spain, is one example  
of a site that has seen significant operational improvements in  
recent years. 
The plant, which supplies sideshafts to European automotive 
manufacturers, has implemented a system to reduce waste and 
optimise productivity, created tools for the sharing of knowledge 
and ideas and provided Lean training for all employees. Maximising 
employee involvement, both in the office and on the shop floor, has 
been fundamental in engaging the teams and developing the change 
in culture. 
The site has been recognised by the KAIZEN Institute, a global 
organisation that specialises in the continuous improvement of 
people, processes and systems, winning one of its 2014 awards.

Organic sales increased by £303 million (4%). The adverse  
effect of currency translation on management sales was  
£403 million (5%) and there was a £7 million benefit from 
acquisitions which was more than offset by a £45 million  
reduction due to disposals. 
Organic trading profit increased £66 million, due to the absence  
of restructuring costs (2013: £25 million), the strong performance 
of three of our divisions, lower profits from GKN Land Systems and 
£6 million net benefit from commercial settlements and provision 
releases. Adverse currency translation was £38 million and there 
was a £2 million reduction due to acquisitions and divestments. 
Group trading margin increased to 9.2% (2013: 8.7% or 9.0% 
excluding restructuring charges). Return on average invested 
capital (ROIC) increased to 17.7% (2013: 17.3%).
Basis of reporting
In this report, financial information, unless otherwise stated,  
is presented on a management basis, the definition of which is 
below. The Group uses management measures, which are non-
GAAP measures, to assess operating performance on a consistent 
basis, as we believe this gives a fairer assessment of the underlying 
performance of the business.
The use of management measures allows the Group to chart 
progress, make decisions and allocate resources based on the 
actions for which management is responsible or can influence, 
without volatility arising from significant one-time trading and 
portfolio change transactions or the mark to market valuation of 
currency hedges. 
Definitions 
Financial information, unless otherwise stated, is presented on a 
management basis which aggregates the sales and trading profit 
of subsidiaries (excluding certain subsidiary businesses sold and 
closed) with the Group’s share of the sales and trading profit of 
joint ventures. References to trading margins are to trading profit 
expressed as a percentage of sales. Management profit or loss 
before tax is management trading profit less net subsidiary interest 
payable and receivable and the Group’s share of net interest payable 
and receivable and taxation of joint ventures. These figures better 
reflect performance of continuing businesses. Where appropriate, 
reference is made to organic results which exclude the impact of 
acquisitions/divestments as well as currency translation on the 
results of overseas operations. Operating cash flow is cash generated 
from operations adjusted for capital expenditure, government capital 
grants, proceeds from disposal of fixed assets and government 
refundable advances. Free cash flow is operating cash flow including 
interest, tax, joint venture dividends, own shares purchased and 
amounts paid to non-controlling interests, but excluding dividends 
paid to GKN shareholders. Return on average invested capital (ROIC) 
is management trading profit as a percentage of average total net 
assets of continuing subsidiaries and joint ventures excluding

SUSTAINING ABOVE MARKET GROWTH
KEVIN CUMMINGS
Chief Executive GKN Aerospace
The overall aerospace market remained positive in 2014 driven by  
a growing commercial aircraft market partly offset by a declining 
military market. The division’s commercial sales were 73%, with 
military representing 27%. 
Commercial aircraft production is still growing. Both Airbus and Boeing 
continue to benefit from higher deliveries and a record order backlog, 
and both have announced plans to increase production levels for single 
aisle aircraft in the future. There is also more demand for strong global 
suppliers to support their expansion plans.
Military spending remains under pressure, largely driven by cutbacks 
throughout the US and Europe, with the ramp-up of new programmes 
being delayed and overseas military operations reduced.

GKN AEROSPACE
GKN Aerospace is helping lead the way in wing design for future 
aircraft. It is participating in a number of UK research programmes 
focused on using new manufacturing technologies and more cost 
effective processes to create lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
Together with industrial partners, research institutions and the UK 
Government, GKN Aerospace is working to develop and demonstrate 
new manufacturing techniques that will enable the UK aerospace 
industry to build wings for tomorrow’s aircraft. 
It is focusing on creating a new generation of automated processes 
and technologies that will extend the boundaries of what we are 
able to manufacture, while at the same time increasing the quality, 
consistency and speed of production. 
The key financial results for the year are as follows:
GKN Aerospace
Change (%)
2014 2013 Headline Organic
Sales (£m) 2,226 2,243 (1) 3
Trading profit (£m) 277 266 4 7
Trading margin 12.4% 11.9% 
Return on average 
invested capital 17.7% 17 .8% 
Overall, GKN Aerospace’s organic sales were £59 million higher (3%). 
There was an adverse £76 million (3%) impact from currency translation. 
Organic commercial aerospace sales were 4% higher, driven by 
increased demand for the Boeing 787 , A350 and engine spares, partly 
offset by lower A330 and A380 sales and a £17 million reduction due to 
the previously announced supply chain contract taken back in-house 
by Airbus in May 2013. Military sales were broadly flat as spares on 
programmes which ceased production were offset by lower sales for 
F/A-18 Super Hornet and UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter. 
The organic increase in trading profit was £18 million, the impact from 
currency on translation of results was £10 million adverse (4%) and 
there was a £3 million benefit relating to losses from the Composite 
Technology and Applications Limited (CTAL) disposal in 2013. 
Each year there are commercial issues and provision movements 
which impact the results. This year they amounted to a £4 million 
net benefit, which included a credit of £11 million as progress was 
made on an onerous contract partly offset by a £7 million charge for 
customer claims. Trading profit also included income of £8 million 
(2013: £5 million) for milestones achieved in relation to CTAL, which 
is not expected to be repeated in 2015. 
Other factors included improved commercial spares sales and 
higher volumes on new programmes offset by lower military sales 
on mature programmes. Further start-up operating losses at the 
new A350 facility were £8 million (2013: loss of £11 million).  
Trading margin was 12.4% (2013: 11.9%). 
Return on average invested capital was 17.7% (2013: 17.8%), 
following the repayment of a Government advance in the first half 
of the year.
 
During the year a number of important milestones were achieved 
including: 
• a new 7% (US$2.5 billion) risk and revenue sharing partnership 
(RRSP) with Pratt & Whitney covering the supply of components  
for the PurePower PW1900 Geared Turbofan™ engine for the  
Embraer 190 and the 195-E2 narrow body aircraft; 
• a long term agreement (LTA) worth more than US$200 million with 
Rolls-Royce to supply components for the latest version of the 
Trent 1000 engine, a capability enhancement of the existing Trent 
1000 engine for the Boeing 787; 
• a contract from Boeing for the final assembly and paint of 
Advanced Technology (AT) Winglets for the new 737 MAX; 
• investment and work being transferred into our low cost 
manufacturing facilities in Mexico; and
• leading collaborative projects backed by the UK’s Aerospace 
Technology Institute for additive manufacturing and future  
wing research. 26 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

GKN DRIVELINE 
The market for electric and hybrid vehicles is growing and consumers 
are increasingly looking for dynamic performance, not just exceptional 
fuel efficiency and low CO
2
 emissions.
GKN Driveline has developed the industry’s first two-speed eAxle, 
which delivers electric power throughout a vehicle’s entire speed 
range. Optimised for weight, packaging and efficiency, the two-speed 
eAxle supports effective hybridisation, contributing to an outstanding 
driving experience.
The technology features on the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car, a 
vehicle that is changing the perception of hybrid vehicles. Working 
closely with BMW, GKN drew on the expertise and knowledge of its 
global engineering network to deliver the project from concept to 
production in just 24 months.

2014 2013 Headline Organic
Sales (£m) 3,444 3,416 1 8
Trading profit (£m) 280 246 14 23
Trading margin 8.1% 7 .2% 
Return on average 
invested capital 19.3% 17 .0% 
Organic sales increased by £265 million (8%) compared with global 
vehicle production which was up 3%. The adverse effect of 
currency translation was £226 million (7%) and the impact from 
disposals was £11 million, being the proportionate loss of sales 
from a wholly-owned business in China which was transferred into 
our Shanghai GKN HUAYU Driveline Systems Co Limited (SDS) joint 
venture in November 2013. Constant velocity jointed (CVJ) systems 
accounted for 60% of sales and non-CVJ sales were 40%. 
GKN Driveline’s market outperformance was broadly based across  
the main markets reflecting recent market share gains, a stronger 
position in premium vehicles, demand for which continued to be 
good, and GKN Driveline’s broadening product mix, particularly 
with all-wheel drive (AWD) systems. GKN Driveline slightly 
underperformed the market in Japan due to our specific  
programme mix. 
The organic improvement in trading profit was £53 million, 
including the absence of £16 million of restructuring charges 
reported in 2013. The adverse impact of currency translation on 
trading profit was £18 million (8%). Each year there are commercial 
settlements and provision movements which impact the results.  
In 2014, whilst individually larger than usual, they amounted to  
a £2 million net benefit. This £2 million included a commercial 
settlement credit of £14 million and a credit of £5 million as 
progress was made on an onerous contract, partly offset by a 
higher than usual £17 million charge for warranty and quality 
claims. GKN Driveline’s trading margin was 8.1% (2013: 7.2%, or 
7.7% excluding restructuring charges), reflecting higher organic 
revenue growth. 
Return on average invested capital increased to 19.3% (2013: 17 .0%). 
During the year, over £700 million of annualised sales in new and 
replacement business was secured in CVJ and AWD systems and a 
number of important milestones were achieved, including:
• expanding facilities in Mexico and AWD capacity in Newton, US;  
• expanding facilities in China with new Power Transfer Unit (PTU) 
wins and localisation of AWD products from Europe and  
North America;
• design and launch of the world’s first integrated disconnect AWD 
system for Fiat Chrysler’s small SUV platform;
• eAxle new launches on advanced plug-in hybrid supercars, with 
the world’s first two-speed eTransmission on the BMW i8 and 
Porsche awarding GKN Driveline ‘Technology Partner’ status for its 
development of a high-performance eAxle for the 918 Spyder; and
• 11 customer awards, including from Ford, General Motors, 
Mitsubishi, Nissan and Volvo. 30 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

absence of £5 million of restructuring charges reported in 2013. 
The impact of currency translation was £6 million adverse (7%). 
The divisional trading margin was 11.0% (2013: 10.1%, or 10.6% 
excluding restructuring charges), reflecting the move towards 
higher value ‘Design for Powder Metallurgy’ parts. 
Return on average invested capital was 21.8% (2013: 21.1%), 
reflecting the improvement in profitability. 
GKN Powder Metallurgy continued its strong product and 
development activities in engines and transmissions, being 
awarded £165 million of annualised sales in new and replacement 
business. It also won a number of quality awards including: 
Excellent Supplier Award and Zero PPM 2014 Award from GETRAG 
(Jiangxi) Transmission Co., Ltd.; and four Supplier Quality 
Excellence awards from General Motors.
Reflecting our move into more advanced applications of powder 
metal technologies, GKN Powder Metallurgy is expanding its 
facilities in North America with more complex and efficient tooling 
and presses. It has signalled its commitment to the Chinese  
market with the expansion of its two production facilities there  
and also announced a technology collaboration agreement with 
McPhy Energy to develop solid state hydrogen storage solutions. 
During the year, Hoeganaes made progress in the development  
and commercialisation of high technology powders for additive 
manufacturing. For example, highly alloyed tool steels, nickel 
based alloys and specialised stainless steel powders have been 
developed and the first commercial shipments made. Early 
development work also progressed on titanium powders for 
additive manufacturing. A new research titanium atomizer is 
currently being installed at the Powder Innovation Centre in the  
US and will be commissioned during the first half of 2015.

GKN POWDER METALLURGY
GKN Powder Metallurgy has worked with a global machine 
manufacturer to develop and build a new type of press to improve 
manufacturing efficiency and deliver increased value to its customers.
The advanced compaction presses enable GKN Powder Metallurgy to 
manufacture more complex parts, at a higher speed, with improved 
quality and cost effectiveness. This is especially important when 
applying a ‘Design for Powder Metallurgy’ approach, which requires 
specialist production techniques to cater for the freedom of design 
the process allows. 
The first of these presses in North America was installed at GKN Powder 
Metallurgy, St Mary’s, Pennsylvania, during 2014 to support the product 
launch of a complex gear for an electronic parking brake system. The 
presses are already in use in Europe and Asia, and are now being rolled 
out at a number of GKN Powder Metallurgy plants in North America.

The organic decrease in sales was £84 million (10%) and the 
adverse impact of currency translation was £40 million (5%).  
The organic decrease in sales included £14 million due to the 
previously announced cessation of two chassis contracts in the 
second half of 2013. The acquisition impact of £1 million related  
to our wheels venture in China. 
The organic decrease in trading profit was £27 million, including 
the absence of £3 million of restructuring charges in 2013.  
The negative impact of currency translation was £4 million (6%). 
Trading margin was 5.7% (2013: 8.3%, or 8.7% excluding 
restructuring charges). In 2015, there is expected to be an  
£8 million restructuring charge reflecting actions being taken  
to further reduce the fixed cost base in response to difficult  
market conditions.
Return on average invested capital was 11.4% (2013: 18.3%).
Good progress was made towards winning new business and 
implementing the GKN Land Systems strategy through broadening 
its product offering and geographic footprint, particularly investing 
to support industrial product sales in North America and enhancing 
capacity in China.

GKN LAND SYSTEMS
GKN Land Systems’ Armstrong facility in Iowa, US, manufactures 
wheels for agricultural vehicles in close proximity to key OEMs in 
North America. Substantial investment to replace key components of 
its main rim rolling line has significantly improved its ability to both 
serve its existing customers and attract new customers.
The new technology means the Armstrong facility can now produce 
larger wheels and deliver a 40% increase in production speed, 
improved quality through greater consistency and tighter tolerances, 
and reduced changeover times. These benefits have added value for 
customers and mean that GKN Land Systems has widened its product 
portfolio so it can better serve the North American agricultural market.
Business review / Other Businesses
GKN’s Other Businesses comprise Cylinder Liners (which is a 59% 
owned venture mainly in China, manufacturing engine liners for the 
truck market in the US, Europe and China), our joint venture stake 
in EVO Electric (a developer of axial flux motors) and the activities 
relating to GKN Hybrid Power, acquired on 1 April 2014 from 
Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited. Since the acquisition, 
GKN Hybrid Power has secured orders to fit 750 buses with its 
innovative fuel-saving solution. 
GKN sold its 50% stake in Emitec for a cash consideration of  
£37 million on 31 July 2014. 
GKN’s Other Businesses reported combined sales in the year of  
£94 million (2013: £104 million), reflecting a £23 million organic 
increase in sales and a £6 million benefit from acquisitions, more 
than offset by the £34 million impact from disposals and the  
£5 million adverse currency translation. Trading profit was  
£5 million (2013: £5 million). 38 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
STRATEGIC REPORT
Business review / Other financial information
Corporate costs
Corporate costs, which comprise the costs of stewardship  
of the Group and operating charges and credits associated  
with the Group’s legacy businesses, were £20 million  
(2013: £25 million), primarily due to a lower charge in relation  
to future incentive schemes.
Items excluded from management trading profit
In order to achieve consistency and comparability between 
reporting periods, the following items are excluded from 
management measures as they do not reflect trading activity:  
Change in value of derivative and other financial 
instruments 
The change in value of derivative and other financial instruments 
during the year resulted in a loss of £209 million (2013: profit of 
£26 million).
When the business wins long term customer contracts that are in  
a foreign currency, the Group offsets the potential volatility of the 
future cash flows by hedging through forward foreign exchange 
contracts. At each period end, the Group is required to mark to 
market these contracts even though it has no intention of closing 
them out in advance of their maturity dates. 
At 31 December 2014, the net fair value of such instruments  
was a liability of £180 million (2013: asset of £52 million) and the 
change in fair value during the year was a £232 million charge 
(2013: £19 million credit). 
There was also a £4 million credit arising from the change in the 
fair value of embedded derivatives in the year (2013: £4 million 
charge) and a net gain of £19 million attributable to the currency 
impact on Group funding balances (2013: £11 million net gain). 
Amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising 
on business combinations 
The charge for the amortisation of non-operating intangible  
assets arising on business combinations (for example, customer 
contracts, order backlog, technology and intellectual property 
rights) was £69 million (2013: £75 million).
Gains and losses on changes in Group structure
The net gain on changes in Group structure was £24 million  
(2013: £12 million).
On 31 July 2014, the Group sold its 50% share in Emitec,  
a joint venture company, for a cash consideration of £37 million.  
The carrying value on the date of disposal was £14 million and  
£1 million of previous currency variations were reclassified  
from other reserves resulting in a profit on sale of £24 million.
Impairment charges
Consistent with previous years, goodwill was tested for 
impairment. As a result of difficult markets and reduced sales  
of certain products during the year, an impairment charge of  
£69 million (2013: nil) has been recorded in respect of three cash 
generating units; two in Aerospace and one in Land Systems. 
Additionally, an impairment charge has been recorded against  
the carrying value of an investment balance of £4 million in  
Other Businesses.
Post-tax earnings of joint ventures
On a management basis, the sales and trading profits of joint 
ventures are included pro rata in the individual divisions to which 
they relate, although shown separately post-tax in the statutory 
income statement. 
The Group’s share of post-tax earnings on a management basis 
were £62 million (2013: £54 million), with trading profit of  
£75 million (2013: £64 million). The Group’s share of the tax  
and interest charges amounted to £13 million (2013: £10 million). 
Underlying trading profit increased by £13 million, reflecting a 
strong trading performance by our joint venture companies, 
primarily in China.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs totalled £129 million (2013: £128 million) and 
comprise the net interest payable of £73 million (2013: £73 million), 
the non-cash charge on post-employment benefits of £50 million 
(2013: £45 million), fair value changes in net investment hedges  
of £3 million credit (2013: nil) and a charge for unwind of discounts  
of £9 million (2013: £10 million). The non-cash charge on post-
employment benefits, fair value changes in net investment hedges 
and unwind of discounts are not included in management figures. 
Details of the assumptions used in calculating post-employment 
costs are provided in note 24.
Interest payable was £75 million (2013: £76 million), whilst interest 
receivable was £2 million (2013: £3 million) resulting in net interest 
payable of £73 million (2013: £73 million).
Interest charged on Government refundable advances was  
£7 million (2013: £6 million). Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
39 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Profit before tax 
Management profit before tax was £601 million (2013: £578 million). 
Profit before tax on a statutory basis was £221 million  
(2013: £484 million). The main differences between management 
and statutory figures are the change in value of derivative and other 
financial instruments, amortisation of non-operating intangible 
assets arising on business combinations, impairment charges,  
and the interest charge on net defined benefit pension plans. Further 
details are provided in note 3 to the financial statements.

Taxation
The book tax rate on management profits of subsidiaries  
was 22% (2013: 20%), arising as a £121 million tax charge  
(2013: £105 million) on management profits of subsidiaries  
of £539 million (2013: £524 million). The book tax rate is likely  
to increase at a similar rate in 2015. 
The Group’s theoretical weighted average tax rate, which assumes 
that book profits/losses are taxed at the statutory tax rates in the 
countries in which they arise, is 37% (2013: 34%). The book tax rate 
was significantly lower, largely because of the recognition of 
deferred tax assets (mainly in the US) due to increased confidence 
in the Group’s ability both to access the losses and realise future 
taxable profits that absorb brought forward tax deductions.
The cash tax rate was 13% (2013: 10%), primarily due to the 
utilisation of prior years’ tax losses. The cash tax rate is expected 
to be similar to the book tax rate in 2015. 
The tax rate on statutory profits of subsidiaries was 29%  
(2013: 18%) arising as a £47 million tax charge (2013: £77 million 
charge) on statutory profits of subsidiaries of £160 million  
(2013: £432 million).
Non-controlling interests 
The profit attributable to non-controlling interests was £5 million 
(2013: £12 million, including £8 million from the pension 
partnership arrangement).
Earnings per share
Management earnings per share was 29.0 pence (2013:  
28.7 pence). Average shares outstanding in 2014 were  
1,640.6 million (2013: 1,634.7 million).
On a statutory basis, earnings per share was 10.3 pence (2013:  
24.2 pence), lower primarily due to the loss on mark to market  
of foreign exchange hedging contracts and impairment charges.

Dividend
In view of the continued improvement in trading performance and 
taking into account the Group’s future prospects, the Board has 
decided to recommend a final dividend of 5.6 pence per share 
(2013: 5.3 pence per share). The total dividend for the year will, 
therefore, be 8.4 pence per share (2013: 7.9 pence per share).  
The Group’s objective is to have a progressive dividend policy 
reflecting growth in earnings per share and free cash flow 
generation. The final dividend is payable on 18 May 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at 10 April 2015. Shareholders may 
choose to use the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) to reinvest 
the final dividend. The closing date for receipt of new DRIP 
mandates is 24 April 2015. 40 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
STRATEGIC REPORT
Cash flow
Operating cash flow, which is defined as cash generated from 
operations of £765 million (2013: £782 million) adjusted for capital 
expenditure (net of proceeds from capital grants) of £403 million 
(2013: £349 million), proceeds from the disposal/realisation  
of fixed assets of £19 million (2013: £4 million) and repayment  
of the principal of a government refundable advance in the  
UK of £38 million (2013: nil) was an inflow of £343 million  
(2013: £437 million).
Within operating cash flow there was an outflow of working  
capital and provisions of £33 million (2013: £47 million outflow). 
Capital expenditure (net of proceeds from capital grants)  
on both tangible and intangible assets totalled £403 million  
(2013: £349 million). Of this, £328 million (2013: £273 million)  
was on tangible fixed assets and was 1.5 times (2013: 1.2 times)  
the depreciation charge, higher than the previous year due  
to additional investment in the automotive businesses in  
North America. Expenditure on intangible assets, mainly  
initial non-recurring costs on aerospace programmes, totalled  
£75 million (2013: £76 million). 
The Group invested £161 million in the year (2013: £149 million)  
on research and development activities not qualifying for 
capitalisation, net of customer and government funding.
Net interest paid totalled £83 million (2013: £65 million) including 
£16 million of previously accrued interest on a government 
refundable advance. Tax paid in the year was £68 million  
(2013: £52 million).

Free cash flow
Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow including joint venture 
dividends and after interest, tax, amounts paid to non-controlling 
interests and own shares purchased, but before dividends paid to 
GKN shareholders, was an inflow of £234 million (2013: £346 million). 
The year-on-year change reflects increased capital expenditure of 
£54 million, repayment of a government refundable advance in  
the UK relating to the A350 programme of £54 million (including 
interest) and incremental pension funding of £12 million. 
Net debt
At the end of the year, the Group had net debt of £624 million 
(2013: £732 million) after payment of a government refundable 
advance (including accrued interest) of £54 million. In September 
2014, the Group entered into a series of cross currency interest  
rate swaps to better align its foreign currency income receipts  
with its debt coupon payments. The fair value of these derivative 
instruments at 31 December 2014 was a liability of £26 million 
which is included in the net debt figure of £624 million.

Pensions and post-employment obligations
GKN operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and 
historic retiree medical plans across the Group. 
At 31 December 2014, the total deficit on post-employment 
obligations of the Group totalled £1,711 million (2013:  
£1,271 million), comprising the deficits on funded obligations of 
£1,095 million (2013: £763 million) and on unfunded obligations  
of £616 million (2013: £508 million). The total deficit represents  
a £440 million increase since 31 December 2013 which is due 
primarily to significantly lower discount rates in all of the  
major territories where GKN operates post-retirement schemes.  
New US mortality assumptions have also contributed to the 
increase in the deficit, and these factors have been partly offset  
by strong asset performance. 
The amount included within trading profit for the period comprises 
current service cost of £49 million (2013: £51 million) and 
administrative costs of £3 million (2013: £3 million), offset by a 
settlement credit of £9 million. The settlement credit related to a 
Business review / Other financial information Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
41 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
voluntary programme run in the US which offered deferred members 
the opportunity to take a cash lump sum in lieu of a future pension. 
Interest on net defined benefit plans, which is excluded from 
management figures, was £50 million (2013: £45 million).
Cash contributions to the various defined benefit pension  
schemes and retiree medical arrangements totalled £108 million 
(2013: £112 million). 
UK pensions
The accounting deficit for UK schemes increased to £1,005 million 
(2013: £714 million), due to the application of lower discount rates. 
Both UK pension schemes (GKN 1, a mature scheme, and GKN 2,  
with a larger active and deferred population) underwent funding 
valuations as at 5 April 2013 and final agreement was reached on 
the valuation and resulting deficit recovery plan for each scheme 
during the year. The agreed deficit recovery plan requires payments 
of £10 million per year and the potential for further additional 
payments commencing in 2016, contingent upon asset 
performance. The first payment of £10 million was made during the 
year. This is in addition to a £30 million (2013: £30 million) annual 
payment made under the Group’s pension partnership arrangement.
Early in the year, a bulk annuity pensioner 'buy-in' was completed 
in relation to the UK pension scheme, GKN 1, as a result of which a 
proportion (c.12%) of GKN 1 liabilities are now fully insured.  
The transaction involved a payment of £123 million, made from GKN 
1’s assets. This gave rise to an additional scheme funding requirement 
of £8 million which the Group will pay to GKN 1 over a four-year 
period. The first payment of £2 million was made during the year.
Defined contribution pension schemes
In addition to defined benefit pension schemes, the Group also 
operates a number of defined contribution schemes for which the 
income statement charge was £35 million (2013: £34 million).
Net assets
Net assets of £1,501 million were £294 million lower than the 
December 2013 year end figure of £1,795 million. The decrease 
includes management profit after tax of £480 million more than 
offset by dividends paid to equity shareholders of £133 million, 
currency on translation of subsidiaries and joint ventures net of  
tax and the change in value of derivative and other financial 
instruments of £182 million and a loss on remeasurement of 
defined benefit plans of £485 million.
Treasury management
All treasury activities are co-ordinated through a central function 
(Group Treasury), the purpose of which is to manage the financial 
risks of the Group and to secure short and long term funding at  
the minimum cost to the Group. It operates within a framework of 
clearly defined Board-approved policies and procedures, including 
permissible funding and hedging instruments, exposure limits  
and a system of authorities for the approval and execution  
of transactions. It operates on a cost centre basis and is not 
permitted to make use of financial instruments or other derivatives 
other than to hedge identified exposures of the Group. Speculative 
use of such instruments or derivatives is not permitted. Group 
Treasury prepares reports at least annually to the Board, and on a 
monthly basis to the Finance Director and other senior executives  
of the Group. In addition, liquidity, interest rate, currency and  
other financial risk exposures are monitored weekly. The overall 
indebtedness of the Group is reported on a weekly basis to the  
Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
Funding, liquidity and going concern
At 31 December 2014, UK committed bank facilities were  
£880 million. Within this amount there are committed revolving 
credit facilities of £800 million (31 December 2013: £837 million) 
and an £80 million eight-year amortising facility from the European 
Investment Bank (EIB). The revolving credit facilities of £800 million, 
renegotiated during the year, mature in 2019, whilst the first of  
five equal, annual £16 million EIB repayments falls due in 2015.  
At 31 December 2014, the £80 million EIB facility was fully drawn 
(2013: £80 million fully drawn) and there were no drawings on any 
of the UK revolving credit facilities (2013: no drawings). 
Capital market borrowings at 31 December 2014 comprised  
a £350 million 6.75% annual unsecured bond maturing in  
October 2019 and a £450 million 5.375% semi-annual unsecured 
bond maturing in September 2022.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had net debt of £624 million  
(31 December 2013: £732 million).
All of the Group’s committed credit facilities have financial 
covenants requiring EBITDA of subsidiaries to be at least 3.5 times 
net interest payable and for net debt to be no greater than 3 times 
EBITDA of subsidiaries. The covenants are tested every six months 
using the previous 12 months’ results. For the 12 months to  
31 December 2014, EBITDA was 11.8 times greater than net interest 
payable, whilst net debt was 0.7 times EBITDA.
The Group entered into a series of cross currency interest rate 
swaps during the year to better align its foreign currency income 
receipts in USD and EUR with its debt and had the effect of 
converting its Sterling bonds into US Dollars ($951 million) and 
Euros (€284 million). The cross currency interest rate swaps have 
been designated as a net investment hedge of the Group’s USD and 
EUR net assets. The fair value of the cross currency interest rate 
swaps at 31 December 2014 was a liability of £26 million (2013: nil).
The Directors have taken into account both divisional and Group 
forecasts for the 18 months from the balance sheet date to assess 
the future funding requirements of the Group and compared them 
to the level of committed available borrowing facilities, described 
above. The Directors have concluded that the Group will have a 
sufficient level of headroom in the foreseeable future and that the 
likelihood of breaching covenants in this period is remote, such 
that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on 
a going concern basis. 42 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Level 3:
Independent assurance
Monitoring and compliance
Level 1:
Risk ownership
and control
Level 2:
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s risk appetite and 
ensuring that appropriate risk management systems are in place.
The Board reviews the Group’s principal risks throughout the year as part of its normal agenda, adopting an integrated approach to risk 
management regularly discussing our principal risks. In addition, in the middle and at the end of each year, the Board assesses the Group’s 
principal risks, taking the strength of the Group’s control systems and our appetite for risk into account. 
The Board delegates responsibility for day-to-day risk management to the Executive Committee, including the identification,  
evaluation and monitoring of key risks facing the Group and the implementation of Group-wide risk management processes and controls. 
The Executive Committee is supported in this by its Sub-Committee on Governance and Risk. 
The Audit Committee keeps the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management systems under review and reports to the Board on the results 
of its review. The occurrence of any material control issues, serious accidents or major commercial, financial or reputational issues, or the 
identification of new risks, are reported to the Board and/or Audit Committee as appropriate. 
Following changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code in 2014 we reviewed whether there are any gaps in our integrated approach to 
risk management at a Board level by comparing our principal risks to the topics discussed by the Board during a typical year. As a result  
of this review, we will increase the level of oversight of certain principal risks and will strengthen the independent assurance provided in 
respect of some risks. Whilst overall we are happy with our risk management processes, our philosophy across the Group is to seek to 
continuously improve. Risk management is no exception.
How GKN manages risk 
The Group has four levels of defence through which it manages significant risks: 
Level 1: Risk ownership and control 
Our businesses are responsible for maintaining an effective risk 
and control environment as part of day-to-day operations, under 
the direction of the Group CEO and the Executive Committee. This 
includes implementation and regular monitoring and review by 
divisional management of processes and controls which are 
designed to ensure compliance with the Board’s appetite for risk, 
Group policies and the GKN Code (see page 54). These front line 
controls are regularly updated to respond to the Group’s changing 
risk profile.
Level 2: Monitoring and compliance 
Group functions monitor adherence to the procedures set out by 
the Executive Committee and provide guidance to the businesses 
on their application. This includes ongoing reviews by our health 
and safety audit team and Group IT and financial control functions. 
Representatives of these functions report their findings to the 
Executive Sub-Committee on Governance and Risk or directly to the 
Executive Committee. The Sub-Committee reports twice a year to 
the Executive Committee on matters relating to the Group’s 
governance, risk management and assurance framework including 
areas of concern or proposals for improvement.
Level 3: Independent assurance 
Independent assurance over the Group’s risk management, control 
and governance processes is provided by the Group’s Corporate 
Audit team, the Head of Risk and external assurance providers.
Level 4: Oversight 
The Board, Executive Committee and Audit Committee provide 
oversight and direction in accordance with their respective 
responsibilities, more information on which is set out in the 
Governance section of this annual report.

Enterprise Risk Management
GKN’s enterprise risk management (ERM) programme facilitates a 
common, Group-wide approach to the identification, analysis, and 
assessment of risks and the way in which they are managed, 
controlled and monitored.
Identify and analyse: A broad spectrum of risks is considered 
through the ERM process. The Executive Committee and the Board 
review the output from ERM at both a divisional and Group level.
Manage and mitigate: Management controls designed to 
monitor and mitigate the risks are documented. Risk owners are 
assigned for each risk.
Assess: The ERM process provides a consistent set of definitions 
and a common approach to risk evaluation with specific reference 
to likelihood and impact.
Respond: The risk response is based upon the assessment of 
potential risk exposure and the level of tolerance acceptable.  
The response reflects whether we ‘accept’ the risk on the basis of 
its assessed level of exposure and mitigating controls currently in 
place, or ‘reduce’ the risk through additional mitigation to bring it 
in line with required levels of tolerance.
Monitor: The output from the ERM process is regularly  
reviewed together with the live tracking of delivery of planned 
improvement actions.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The nature of both our business and our strategy means that we 
face a number of inherent risks. The Board has carefully considered 
the type and extent of the principal risks to the Group achieving its 
objectives and delivering a satisfactory return for shareholders. 
These principal risks and uncertainties are summarised below 
according to the strategic objective to which they relate. They may 
also impact our objective to sustain above market growth.
Over time our risk profile evolves and the Board’s view of the 
principal risks facing the Group is updated accordingly. This year, 
the risk relating to integrated systems complexity has been split 
into two risks relating to contract risk and product quality. The 
Board believes that this reflects more clearly the risks associated 
with, respectively, revenues which are increasingly tied to long 
term contracts with complex terms and the increasing cost and 
frequency of product recalls across the automotive industry in 
general. Acquisition integration has been removed as a principal 
risk following the successful integration of the aero engine division 
of AB Volvo and we have added a risk relating to the supply chain. 
The nature of each principal risk is further described on pages  
44 to 51 together with the corresponding mitigating actions that  
are in place and an overview of the risk trends during 2014.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk management / Principal risks and uncertainties
Highly competitive markets
Leading in our chosen markets
Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Increasing
▴
GKN operates in highly competitive markets with 
customer decisions typically based on price, quality, 
technology and service. Contracts for major programmes 
are subject to highly competitive bidding processes and 
the strength of our competitors and general market 
conditions continue to drive price pressure and more 
challenging contractual terms.
In those countries where we have strong margins, these 
margins may come under pressure as our competitors 
improve, particularly if the relevant markets slow. An 
inability or delay in developing or maintaining sufficient 
or appropriate engineering and manufacturing 
capabilities in high growth markets could further 
increase the risk.
Customer vertical integration (including OEMs taking 
production in-house), the entry of new competitors or 
consolidation of existing competitors also contribute to 
increased competition. 
Potential impact
Competition, if not mitigated, could result in reduced 
sales and profit margins and potentially lost growth 
opportunities in high growth markets. An inability to 
secure new business awards on major programmes 
could significantly impact future growth, cash flow  
and profitability.
• Maintaining a balanced portfolio of businesses across our 
markets provides some protection against competition in 
individual markets or countries.
• Continual review of competition and market trends.
• Targeted investment in engineering, Lean manufacturing 
resources, quality and customer relationships.
Changes during 2014
Strong competition and customer pricing pressures have 
continued throughout 2014. Pressure on margins is increasing in 
high growth markets such as China and competition is particularly 
strong in areas of new and emerging technologies. Despite these 
challenges, we continue to win new business and differentiate 
ourselves through our technology.
The strategic report on page 13 includes more information on the 
trends in each of our markets.
Supply chain
Leading in our chosen markets
Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Stable
◂▸ 
Our suppliers are key to our success. It is essential that 
suppliers and subcontractors continue to meet our high 
standards of technical competence, innovation, product 
quality, reliability, delivery performance, cost, financial 
stability, safety, ethics and social responsibility. 
Our supply chain network is exposed to potentially 
adverse events such as physical disruptions, 
environmental and industrial accidents, and scarcity of 
supply or bankruptcy of a key supplier which could 
impact our ability to deliver orders to our customers.
The cost of our products can be significantly affected  
by the cost of the underlying commodities and  
materials from which they are made. Fluctuations  
in these costs cannot always be passed on to the 
customer through pricing.
Potential impact
A sustained supply chain disruption, or the delivery  
of defective product to us, could impact our ability to 
meet customer requirements, result in additional 
contractual liabilities and have a consequential impact 
on financial performance.
• Contract terms and conditions that require our suppliers to 
meet specified performance standards. 
• Ongoing assessment of supplier technology and dependency. 
• Monitoring of the financial and operational viability of key 
suppliers. 
• Ongoing monitoring of inventory levels to ensure availability in 
times of production volatility. 
• Contingency plans designed to enable us to secure alternative 
key material supplies at short notice, to transfer or share 
production between manufacturing sites and to use substitute 
materials where required. 
• Dual sourcing where appropriate to reduce dependence on 
single suppliers. 
• Supplier quality reviews and audits. 
Changes during 2014
We continue to carefully manage and monitor our supply chains 
and, where appropriate, build upon long term supplier 
relationships. In December we introduced a new Supplier Code of 
Conduct aimed at making it easier and clearer for suppliers to 
understand what we expect of them (see page 57 for more 
information). Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report

Customer concentration
Leading in our chosen markets
Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Stable
◂▸ 
Significant customer concentration exists in the 
automotive and aerospace industries so a large portion 
of the Group’s revenues comes from a relatively small 
number of customers. Around 50% of the Group’s 
revenue is derived from its top 10 customers.
Potential impact
The insolvency of, damage to relations with, or 
significant worsening of commercial terms with a major 
customer could seriously affect the Group’s future 
results, and could result in loss of market share and 
future business opportunities, asset write-offs and 
restructuring actions.
• Regular review of the Group's relations with and exposure to 
key customers. 
• Extensive and regular dialogue with key customers and strong 
commercial and engineering relationships.
• We monitor and review quality, service and delivery 
performance based upon customer KPIs (the ‘Voice of the 
Customer’ programme is described further on page 48 under 
‘Product quality’).
• Credit exposure is actively reviewed and managed.
Changes during 2014
There have been no significant changes in the OEM customer 
landscape with the proportion of business from the Group’s top 10 
customers remaining stable during 2014. No individual customer 
accounts for more than 10% of Group revenue. However, we have 
won significant new business with one of our automotive 
customers, have continued to diversify our aerospace customer 
base, and will continue to regularly review the degree of our 
customer concentration.

customer trends and page 143 (note 19c) on credit risk. 
Joint ventures
Leveraging a strong global presence
Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Increasing
▴
A sizeable portion of the Group’s profits and cash flows 
are generated by a small number of joint ventures. In 
these circumstances, there is an inherent risk that the 
objectives of the joint venture partners in regard to the 
joint venture may diverge.
Potential impact
Such a misalignment of objectives may result in the 
Group’s inability to pursue its desired strategy as a 
consequence of which the Group’s business and future 
results may be adversely affected.
• The Group seeks to participate only in ventures in which its 
interests are complementary to those of its partners. 
• Thorough pre-transaction due diligence procedures on any 
potential joint venture partner. 
• Continual focus on sustaining strong relationships with joint 
venture partners. 
Changes during 2014
Revenues and profits generated by our joint venture partners have 
again increased this year. Relationships remain strong, further 
enhanced by the expansion in November 2013 of GKN Driveline’s 
long-standing joint venture in China to cover the complete range 
of GKN Driveline products. On 31 July 2014, the Group sold its 
stake in the Emitec joint venture.

Risk management / Principal risks and uncertainties
Laws, regulations and corporate reputation 
Leveraging a strong global presence
Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Stable
◂▸
The Group is subject to applicable laws and regulations 
in the global jurisdictions and industries in which it 
operates. This includes certain territories where strong 
ethical standards may not be well established or where 
parts of the markets in which we operate are highly 
regulated. Regulations include those related to export 
controls, environmental and safety requirements, 
product safety, tax laws, intellectual property rights, 
competition laws and ethical business practices.
Tax in particular is a complex area where laws and their 
interpretation are changing regularly, leading to 
potential uncertainty in tax exposures. 
Potential impact
Non-compliance could expose the Group to fines, 
penalties, damage to reputation, suspension or 
debarment from government contracting or suspension 
of export privileges. 
• A strong culture of 'doing the right thing' which is regularly 
emphasised by senior management.
• Group-wide governance policies and procedures, ongoing 
compliance training and strong oversight.
• Ongoing monitoring of regulatory developments in major 
jurisdictions.
• Ongoing monitoring of employee concerns through our 
independent Employee Disclosure Hotline.
Changes during 2014
There have been no significant new regulations impacting the 
Group during 2014, but our markets are subject to increased 
enforcement activities in relation to existing regulations, 
particularly in relation to vehicle safety. 
In response, we have taken steps to reinforce our commitment 
across the Group to ‘doing the right thing’ in all activities. This 
includes emphasising the importance of ‘doing the right thing’ to 
all senior managers at the Group’s International Leadership 
Conference and re-launching the GKN Code to remind employees 
of the standard of behaviour we expect. We continue to strengthen 
our risk management systems.

Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Stable
◂▸
We operate globally and as such results could be 
impacted by global or regional changes in the 
macroeconomic or political environment, changing 
consumer demand and preferences, and supply  
chain volatility.
Our businesses could be impacted by changing 
consumer preference and associated volatility in 
automotive demand; challenging credit conditions 
resulting in lack of access to finance by customers and 
end consumers; delay or cancellation of orders for civil 
aircraft and changes in the amount or timing of US 
military spending; volatility in agricultural, construction, 
mining and industrial markets; exchange rate 
fluctuations; and changing oil prices.
Potential impact
Major or prolonged economic or financial market 
deterioration, including movements in exchange rates  
of key currencies or political uncertainty in one of our 
key markets, may significantly impact the Group’s 
operational performance and financial condition. 
Sustained market weakness could lead to impairment  
of assets or site closures. It may also materially impact 
our customers, suppliers and other parties with whom 
we do business. 
• The Group has a diversified portfolio of businesses across our 
markets providing some protection against individual market 
or country risks. 
• Lead market indicators are regularly reviewed so that we can 
respond quickly to changing trading conditions.
• Our mitigation strategy also includes:
 — planning, budgeting and forecasting processes.
 — flexible management of variable and fixed cost base, 
investment spending and working capital.
 — further diversification into other sectors which present new 
opportunities.
 — focused restructuring activities, where necessary, to 
respond to markets which have suppressed levels of 
economic activity.
 — regular review of our financial risk management processes, 
including foreign currency hedging. 
Changes during 2014
During the year we have aligned our debt to the principal 
currencies in which our revenues and cash flows are generated 
through cross currency swaps. 
We have further strengthened our presence in Asia and Mexico 
and are working hard to continue to diversify our aerospace 
customer base. 
Further commentary on the recent trends and outlook for each of 
our markets is set out in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 16

competitive advantage. GKN may lose customers  
to competitors offering new technologies if we are 
unable to adapt to or take advantage of market 
developments such as changes in legislative, regulatory 
or industry requirements, competitive technologies or 
consumer preferences.
Potential impact
The failure to launch new products, new product 
applications or derivatives of existing products to meet 
customer requirements could have a significant impact 
on future profitable growth.
• Regular assessment of market and technology trends and 
drivers.
• Close relationships and technical partnerships with customers.
• Divisional technology plans aligned to emerging and future 
trends and business strategy.
• Regular review of current and future technology plans by the 
Group Technology Strategy Board.
• Consideration of technology plans as part of the Board’s 
annual strategy review.
• Focused investment in research and development.
Changes during 2014
We have continued to invest in technology as we aim to meet 
customers’ expectations for improving efficiency of aircraft, cars 
and other vehicles with solutions that are lighter and more 
fuel-efficient. We have further strengthened our Engineering 
Fellowship who support the Board in developing the Group’s 
technology plan and provide engineering leadership throughout 
the Group. The Group continues to establish cross-divisional 
projects aimed at delivering innovative solutions to meet our 
customer needs across all our markets.

itself through technology is included in the business review 
section on pages 22-37.
Contract risk
Driving operational excellence
Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Increasing
▴
Across our businesses an increasing percentage of 
revenues are generated through contracts which are 
long term in nature and subject to complex terms  
and conditions. Contracts include commitments  
relating to pricing, quality and safety, and technical  
and customer requirements.
Specifically within the Aerospace business, the Group 
has risk and revenue sharing partnerships (RRSP) with 
key engine manufacturers. These contain formalised  
risk sharing arrangements relating to risks that are not 
always within GKN management control.
Both our aerospace and automotive businesses enter 
into design and build contracts. These are complex 
contracts that are often long term, so it is important that 
the contracted risk is carefully managed.
Potential impact
A failure to fully understand contract risks or to 
anticipate technical challenges and estimate costs 
accurately at the outset of a contract can lead to 
unexpected liabilities, increased outturn costs and 
reduced profitability.
• Robust bid and contract management processes including 
thorough reviews of contract terms and conditions, contract-
specific risk assessments and clear delegation of authority  
for approvals.
• Continuous review of contract performance. 
Changes during 2014
As the Group focuses on providing solutions to its customers, 
often including a design element, the risks associated with 
complex contracts increases. The Group regularly reviews ways to 
further strengthen its contract management processes and this 
will continue as an area of focus during 2015.

Programme management
Driving operational excellence
Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Increasing
▴
Many of the programmes entered into by the Group are 
complex and long term, and are subject to various 
performance conditions which must be adhered to 
throughout the programme. The management of such 
programmes brings risks related to:
• delays in product development or launch schedules;
• failure to meet customer specifications or predict 
technical problems;
• inability to manufacture on time for the start of 
production or to required production volumes;
• dependence on key or customer nominated suppliers;
• failure to manage effectively internal or customer-
driven change;
• inability to forecast accurately and to manage costs.
Potential impact
Ineffective programme management could result in 
damage to customer relationships or cancellation  
of a contract resulting in claims for loss and  
reputational damage.
Poor performance against a contract could also 
undermine the Group’s ability to win future contracts 
and could result in cost overruns and significantly lower 
returns than expected.
• Embedded programme management, including investment 
phasing and product testing activities.
• Periodic impairment reviews of capitalised development costs, 
including formal review at half year and year end.
• Ongoing review and approval of key programmes by the 
Executive Committee and the Board. 
Changes during 2014
Programme management risk has continued to increase in line 
with the move towards common global platforms in automotive 
and the launch of new aircraft in aerospace, together with the 
application of new technologies. In response, the Group has 
continued to strengthen its risk management systems in this area, 
and this will continue as an area of focus during 2015.

major new programme wins.
Product quality
Driving operational excellence
Risk trend Description and potential impact Mitigation
Increasing
▴
The quality and safety of our products is essential.  
We are exposed to warranty, product recall and  
liability claims in the event that our products fail to 
perform as expected.
In automotive, the industry in general has experienced 
higher levels of recalls in recent years and the OEMs 
often seek contribution from throughout the supply 
chain. This risk increases where:
• vehicle manufacturers offer longer warranty periods;
• more vehicles are being built on standard platforms, 
so a single quality issue can affect a large number  
of vehicles;
• regulators and our customers are taking a more 
stringent approach to recalling vehicles particularly if 
there is a possible safety issue.
In aerospace customers and regulators impose very 
strict product safety and quality obligations on all 
aircraft suppliers.
Potential impact
A product failure could result in serious losses, 
damaging GKN’s financial performance and potentially 
our reputation. In particular, the costs associated with 
vehicle or aircraft recalls can be significantly higher than 
the cost of simply replacing defective products.
• High levels of quality assurance are embedded in robust 
manufacturing systems.
• Regular reporting and monitoring of quality performance based 
upon customer KPIs.
• Maintenance of critical parts lists.
• External agency quality reviews.
• Robust contract terms and conditions.
Changes during 2014
Excellence in quality has continued to be a priority during the year 
with continuous improvement programmes ongoing in each of our 
businesses. A central part of this year’s focus on quality has been 
our 'Voice of the Customer' initiative. In addition to our internal 
quality KPIs we now view quality through the eyes of our 
customers by collecting the quality reports issued by our 
customers, analysing these and by working to continously improve 
quality and delivery as measured by our customers.

which are key to maintaining production levels for major 
customers and internal service levels.
In addition, certain of the Group’s businesses  
are exposed to a higher inherent risk of natural disasters 
because of their geographical locations.
Potential impact
A sustained disruption to internal facilities or production

The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension 
post-retirement medical plans with aggregate net 
liabilities of £1,711 million at 31 December 2014. These 
plans are exposed to the risk of changes in asset values, 
discount rates, inflation and mortality assumptions.
Potential impact
Increases to the pension deficit could lead to a 
requirement for additional cash contributions to these 
plans, thereby reducing the amount of cash available to 
meet the Group’s other operating, investment and 
financing requirements.
• Close co-operation with scheme fiduciaries regarding 
management of pension scheme assets and liabilities, 
including asset selection and hedging actions.
• Alternative funding and risk mitigation actions are 
implemented where appropriate.
Changes during 2014
During the year, against an economic backdrop which has seen 
pension liabilities remain at a high level versus historical norms, 
driven by the exceptionally low yields on long term bonds, we have 
continued to undertake pension risk reduction initiatives, 
including a partial buy-in transaction in the UK and an increase in 
hedging ratios. In addition, in the UK we commenced a ‘pension 
increase exchange’ exercise to further mitigate inflation risk, 
which will conclude in early 2015, and undertook a 'voluntary lump 
sums programme' in the US, whereby deferred members of the US 
pension plan were offered a cash lump sum in lieu of future 
pension rights. The Group continues to have a reasonable degree 
of visibility over the range of short to medium term funding  
cash flows.

As a global engineering business we aim to 
reduce the impact that both our operations 
and our customers have on the environment. 
Every product that we engineer is designed 
to perform better than its predecessor,  
be it lighter, more efficient or resulting in 
less waste.
We also aim to support the communities 
in which we operate. GKN is proud of the 
positive role that our sites and employees 
play in society every day, whether this is 
through job creation and promoting good 
business practice, or supporting local charity 
and community organisations. This supports 
our strategic objective of leveraging a strong 
global presence.
GKN believes in doing the right thing by our people, as a business and in our world.

GKN Code 
During 2014 we revised the GKN Code to make it clearer and simpler, 
and to provide additional guidance on key areas of risk. The new GKN 
Code will be rolled out to all employees during 2015, reinforcing our 
Values and reminding employees about the standards of behaviour 
we expect. 
The rollout programme started in February 2015 with briefings at 
each of our divisional leadership conferences; it will be followed  
by an ongoing cascade to all employees through manager-led  
face-to-face awareness sessions. 
Health and safety
At GKN we have a goal of zero preventable accidents. To support 
this we have a number of GKN-developed and globally applied 
behavioural safety programmes. These highlight potential safety 
issues, share best practice and help to minimise hazards at our 
sites. Led by our Group-wide communications and awareness 
programme, thinkSAFE!, this consistent approach helps us work 
towards our strategic objective of driving operational excellence. 
thinkSAFE! and ‘don’t WALK BY!’ continued throughout 2014  
and we introduced thinkHEALTH! (occupational health awareness). 
These programmes encourage employees to resolve safety and 
health concerns.
The Group extended its management and control of potentially 
catastrophic risk by introducing the use of the 'Bowtie model'. 
The Group identified a number of improvement opportunities to 
reduce the overall health, safety and environment (HSE) risk profile, 
completing the majority of actions in 2014. The Bowtie process will 
be further developed and improved during 2015.
Sustainability report / Our people
We have continued to integrate Total Plant Risk Management (TPRM) 
techniques into key operations following their introduction in 2013. 
TPRM is focused on raising our hazard awareness competence within 
manufacturing sites and uses screening tools to identify risks and 
take corrective actions.
We require all our manufacturing plants to achieve certification to 
the health and safety standard OHSAS 18001 or equivalent, and all 
sites have obtained or are working towards certification. 
We measure our health and safety performance through two metrics: 
accident frequency rate (AFR) is used to track the number of lost time 
accidents and accident severity rate (ASR) records the number of days 
lost due to accidents and occupational ill health. In 2014 there was 
continued improvement in the AFR, reducing from 1.6 in 2013 to 1.3; 
however, the ASR saw a minor increase from 40 to 46, primarily due to 
specific occupational health issues in North America associated with 
the long term absences of three employees. Actions to address this 
have been implemented in 2014 and will continue into 2015.
During 2014 we increased our focus on near-miss incident reporting 
and associated improvement actions. There was an overall reporting 
increase of 74% over 2013. This focus will continue into 2015  
with the aim of using this leading indicator as a means of taking 
preventive actions.
In February 2014 an employee at GKN Aerospace Engine Systems' El 
Cajon plant in the US suffered a fatal injury whilst operating a forklift 
truck. We deeply regret this loss of life and have provided support 
to the employee’s family. A full investigation was carried out and 
lessons learned have been communicated across the Group. This has 
included a forklift truck safety improvement programme. 
During 2014, 69 health, safety and environmental audits were carried 
out through our internal HSE audit function, HSE peer audits and 
using external audit expertise. These audits assess performance 
against broad-based and wide-ranging criteria. Audit findings are 
analysed and corrective actions are taken. We also share best 
practice examples across the Group.
 
During 2014, there were 14 incidents in respect of which a safety 
enforcement action was issued; 13 in the US with a penalty totalling 
$16,710 and one in the UK without a penalty.

Leadership assurance
Our leadership team plays an essential role by setting an example 
and personally demonstrating how we value the importance of 
‘doing the right thing’. All GKN leaders are required, on an annual 
basis, to confirm that that they understand the behaviours expected 
of them as leaders in promoting the right behaviours within GKN. In 
2015 they will also be asked to confirm that they have received, read 
and understood the new GKN Code and have held a cascade briefing 
with their team. 
Speaking up
GKN is committed to a culture in which people feel comfortable 
speaking up when they see behaviour which is inconsistent with 
the GKN Code. We continue to promote the importance of our 
confidential Employee Disclosure Hotline, which is available to all 
employees and enables them to raise concerns on an anonymous 
basis. It is hosted by an external, independent company and is 
available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Matters reported are 
investigated and feedback is always provided to the caller. Over the 
past three years we have experienced a rise in the number of calls  
to the hotline to 133 calls in 2014 (0.3% of employees). We attribute 
this to increased promotion raising awareness of the service and a 
growing workforce.

Graduates and apprentices
In 2014, GKN divisions recruited over 150 graduates worldwide. 
These are sought-after posts attracting high quality candidates.  
As we seek to increase the number of talented individuals we recruit 
with the skills and talent to become our leaders of the future,  
a Group-wide graduate programme will be re-introduced during  
2015. This will focus on recruiting high calibre individuals onto a  
fast-track management programme, consisting of cross divisional 
and diverse assignments. 
GKN is also expanding its recruitment of apprentices and has  
nearly 900 globally, an increase of around 20% during 2014.  
An apprenticeship with GKN combines learning practical skills  
with classroom studies, preparing young people for a future career  
at the heart of engineering. 
Developing our people
GKN is committed to supporting all its employees through 
investment and development. Training and career development 
remain a focus for the business. Employee progress is charted 
through managerial and technical career paths, supported by 
focused assessment and training. 
Our online training support tool, GKN Academy, enables employees 
to access development options from their workplace or from 
home. There is now a library of 4,400 courses available in up to 
20 languages, in support of our growing global workforce. In 2014, 
employees completed more than 21,600 courses – a 45% increase 
on the previous year – and the GKN Academy site experienced an 
average of 8,500 hits per month.

GKN is helping to inspire the next generation of engineers  
through global support for international student motorsport 
competitions, such as Formula Student, in which students 
compete to design, build and race their own vehicles. Over 100 
universities and more than 4,000 students were involved in these 
contests. During 2014, GKN invested approximately £23,000 
supporting teams and contests in the UK, China and Spain, 
as well as providing materials, components and expertise to 
contestants across the world.  56 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The Group has an organisation-wide succession planning and 
development programme to ensure our people develop the 
capabilities required to deliver the business plan. In 2014 the Group 
internal recruitment rate for management roles was 70%. Voluntary 
turnover of management employees, which excludes compulsory 
redundancies, terminations and retirements, was 4.7% (2013: 6.1%), 
bringing us into our target range of less than 5%.
Employees by business*
* Including subsidiaries and joint ventures. 
Employee engagement
GKN is committed to creating and maintaining a working 
environment that stimulates both personal and  
organisational growth. 
In the first half of 2014, the results of the 2013 biennial Global 
Employee Survey, reported last year, were delivered to every 
business unit and every global function. Since then site-level action 
plans have been created to address issues raised by the survey.
Progress against these action plans are captured through Positive 
Climate Index (PCI) sessions, held monthly in every GKN site. 
Hosted by business leaders, and facilitated by HR colleagues, 
these sessions provide an opportunity for open and honest 
dialogue between employees and site leadership. Colleagues 
answer questions about their experiences of working for GKN and 
can suggest ideas for improvement. HR teams and Site Steering 
Committees then work together to respond to the issues raised and 
drive cultural improvements.
PCI performance is now an essential measure of business 
performance and forms part of all monthly divisional  
operation reviews. 
The Group’s average PCI data has been consistent for the past three 
years. A programme of support for leaders is being deployed in the 
form of an Engagement Workshop for management teams. This will 
be rolled out and expanded in 2015.
Sustainability report / Our people
Diversity and inclusion
As a global organisation with operations in more than 30 countries, 
we value the individuality that each employee brings to our 
business. Our objective is to have a positive and inclusive working 
environment free from any kind of discrimination and in which 
employees are motivated to maximise their contribution.  
GKN’s policies require all Group companies to treat employees  
fairly and with respect, recognising their abilities, differences  
and achievements.
Our aim is to ensure that the workforce is representative of the 
countries and markets in which we operate and the communities in 
which we are located, including an appropriate gender mix. Women 
make up 13.2% of total subsidiary employees (see table below) and 
6.8% of the senior executive population.

As an engineering group we face particular challenges in increasing 
our gender diversity, especially amongst the senior executive 
population. In order to increase our talent pipeline of women and 
other under-represented groups, we have implemented a diversity 
and inclusion programme which will focus on the following actions 
in 2015:
• Interactive diversity training for executives and senior 
management.
• Identification of high potential people from under-represented 
groups and setting up mentoring relationships.
• Recruitment and promotion training for relevant employees.
• Online diversity training throughout the organisation. Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report

Human rights
A respect for human rights is the first tenet in our Ethics Policy. It 
is also implicit in our Values and the other policies which underpin 
them. We support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and do 
not tolerate the use of child or forced labour. 
Suppliers
Supply chains are carefully planned and monitored. We align our 
resources and capacities to our customers’ demands, ensuring 
timely delivery of high quality products with minimum disruption  
and waste.
Our suppliers are integral to the sustainability of our business.  
We are committed to treating all our suppliers and partners with 
fairness and integrity and aim to develop and maintain strong 
supplier relationships. In return, we expect our suppliers to ‘do 
the right thing’. Our supply chain management policy sets out the 
principles and procedures each GKN company should follow in 
dealing with suppliers and potential suppliers. 
In December 2014 we introduced a new Supplier Code of Conduct 
aimed at making it easier and clearer for suppliers to understand 
what we expect of them. This code sets out the requirements of 
suppliers in relation to health, safety and environmental standards, 
internationally accepted standards of workers’ rights, use of child 
and forced labour, ethical standards, bribery and corruption, and 
compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Our contractual 
terms and conditions support the implementation of this code. 
Continuous improvement
GKN’s Lean Enterprise model provides a framework for continuous 
improvement across the Group. Employees from the office and 
factory floor up to the executive level are trained to identify value for 
customers and shareholders, and encouraged to eliminate waste or 
remove barriers.
As we strive towards operational excellence, employee teams  
work to improve workplace safety, meet customer targets for 
quality and delivery, and improve the flow of parts and information. 
Employees and leaders develop skills in coaching and problem 
solving, building a culture of continuous improvement in our 
factories and offices alike.
The ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative in 2014 has reinforced 
mechanisms for reflecting customer views on GKN’s performance 
into our management reviews.
GKN employees delivered over 80 weeks of training to more than  
300 leaders during the past year. A new course, Lean Leadership, 
was developed and delivered to Executive leaders, providing 
alignment at all levels of the Group. In our sites, leaders delivered 
Lean Fundamentals training and led events to organise work cells, 
develop value streams, and improve business processes.
This robust system of training, improvement workshops and 
coaching ensures that GKN grows its culture of continuous 
improvement and contributes to a successful and sustainable  
Lean Enterprise.
Compliance training
Our online compliance training modules continue to be an important 
element of our overall compliance programmes. Of our pre-defined 
target audience of employees, 98% have completed training on anti-
bribery and corruption and competition law, and since their launch, 
12,500 and 3,400 employees respectively have completed these 
courses. 85% (14,191 employees) of the pre-defined target audience 
have completed online IT security training. All new starters meeting 
our defined criteria are expected to complete these online courses 
which are supplemented by face-to-face training for individuals in 
roles more relevant to those areas.

Environment
The Group is committed to continuous improvement in all areas of 
environmental performance and seeks to minimise our impact on the 
environment across our operations. 
We apply GKN Lean Enterprise techniques to energy efficiency and 
waste reduction programmes, both in offices and at manufacturing 
locations. Sites are required to develop energy efficiency targets and 
plans, which are reviewed regularly, and best practice is rewarded 
in the Environmental category of the annual GKN Excellence Awards. 
ISO 14001 is our mandated environmental management system 
and all manufacturing sites have either achieved this or are in the 
process of obtaining certification. 
In 2014, in line with the thinkSAFE! methodology, we introduced 
thinkGREEN!, an environmental awareness programme targeted  
at all employees to encourage them to help reduce our impact on  
the environment.
A major project was launched in 2014 to introduce energy metering 
and monitoring at 10 pilot sites across GKN. This programme will  
be further expanded in 2015 to cover our major energy using sites. 
The project will allow our sites, divisions and Group to have near real 
time energy data and take corrective actions as appropriate.

Environmental performance in 2014 was in line with expectations, 
with most divisions achieving improved results, as illustrated in 
the charts. Group energy efficiency decreased by 4% over 2013, 
primarily due to currency fluctuations depressing statutory sales, 
but improved by 16% since 2009, meeting our target of a 15% 
improvement over the five years. Going forward, we have set a target 
of improving Group energy efficiency by 3% year-on-year.
Doing the right thing in our world Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
59 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
GKN calculates greenhouse gas emissions using the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol. The greenhouse gas intensity of the Group (i.e. 
operations included in the consolidated financial statements) 
increased by 8% in 2014. Expressed as tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent 
per £million sales, emissions intensity increased from 171 in 2013 
to 186 in 2014. This increase was caused primarily by currency 
fluctuations depressing Group sales and partly by improved 
greenhouse gas collection processes (see note below). The 
absolute emissions of the Group increased by 6% from 1,228,000 
tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent in 2013 to 1,300,000 tonnes of CO
2
 
equivalent in 2014. This includes: Scope 1 (direct) emissions of 
280,000 tonnes and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions of 1,020,000 
tonnes (2013: 245,000 tonnes and 983,000 tonnes respectively). 
This increase was largely due to improved data collection and 
increased production in our more energy-intensive businesses.  
We have set a target of improving Group greenhouse gas intensity 
by 3% year-on-year going forward.
Note: Scope 1 emissions in 2014 include CO
2
 equivalent emissions resulting from 
transport, process and fugitive emissions, which were not included in 2013. Process 
emissions from arc furnaces at two GKN Powder Metallurgy plants were included in  
both years.
During 2014 there were 15 environmental enforcement actions, 
all in the US. Four resulted in financial penalties totalling $6,600. 
Environmental enforcement actions from 2013 in Brazil were 
finalised and resulted in a penalty of R$3,035.
Communities
The majority of GKN sites are active in their communities. Sometimes 
the activity is management-led, but on many occasions it is the 
employees who instigate projects and initiatives. We focus these 
activities on two main areas: enhancing local communities through 
social projects and charitable donations; and working with young 
people to inspire the next generation of engineers. 
We aim to support young people in our communities and also to 
inspire them to study science and mathematics and consider a 
career in engineering. Around the world, GKN led over 125 significant 
projects aimed at doing this; these projects touched the lives of 
more than 25,000 young people.
Hearts of Gold
Held annually, our internal Hearts of Gold awards allow us to 
recognise extraordinary GKN people who contribute to their 
communities. Hearts of Gold winners receive a trophy and a 
certificate to recognise their achievement. 
We are also working on improved ways of recording and celebrating 
these remarkable stories. One example is a new Hearts of Gold 
microsite, which allows GKN employees to upload and share 
community activities that they and their colleagues have taken part 
in. This site is due to be launched in the first quarter of 2015.

The Casa dos Sonhos – or House of Dreams – began as the vision of 
one GKN Porto Alegre employee, Maria Mercedes de Paula, in 1985. 
She wanted to help under-privileged children in her community and 
after almost 20 years of fundraising and meetings with businesses 
and local authorities, her school was built in the nearby town of 
Gravataí in 2003. Today, 70 children from the ages of 6 to 16 attend 
Casa dos Sonhos, learning reading, writing, sports and IT skills,  
and GKN continues to donate Christmas gifts and equipment to

GOVERNANCE
Chairman’s introduction to governance
The value of good governance has been increasingly recognised by 
stakeholders over the past few years. Whilst strong operational 
performance is important, the Company’s progress towards its 
strategic objectives must be underpinned by ethical behaviour and 
a strong set of core values. For example, if we wish to lead in our 
chosen markets, then we must compete fairly. If we want to expand 
our global footprint, then we need to be mindful that we may 
encounter differing ethical standards and must ensure that we hold 
ourselves to the highest standards of behaviour.
These standards and values are set and demonstrated by the 
Directors. With this in mind, we approved a revised code of conduct 
(the GKN Code) in 2014 which was designed to provide a clear 
framework for the increasingly complex environment in which our 
51,000 employees operate. The financial and reputational impact  
if we get it wrong cannot be underestimated and the revised GKN 
Code helps our employees understand the obligations we have to 
the Company’s stakeholders.
Leadership
The balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board  
and on the Committees which support its work is crucial to the 
Group’s success. 
During the year, Adam Walker succeeded Bill Seeger as Group 
Finance Director following Bill’s retirement. Adam brings a wealth 
of knowledge and experience which has been invaluable in what 
has been a challenging year for many UK companies. Marcus 
Bryson, CBE, retired from his role as Chief Executive Aerospace and 
Land Systems at the end of 2014 after 20 years with the Company. 
Marcus will continue to work for the Company on a part-time basis  
in 2015 to provide advice and support in relation to industry 
developments and UK government relations. The Nominations 
Committee considered both succession planning and the 
composition of the Board in light of Marcus’ retirement;  
further information can be found in its report on page 71. 
Effectiveness
Following our external evaluation in 2013, during the year we 
conducted an internal evaluation of the Board. The evaluation 
process involved face to face interviews with each Director to 
gather feedback on the areas we believe to be critical to the 
Board’s effectiveness. More information on the process can be 
found on page 67 of this statement.
Accountability
The Board is ultimately responsible for setting the risk appetite of 
the Group and for the maintenance of appropriate risk management 
systems. During the year we continued to refine our risk procedures 
and further strengthen our risk assurance processes in response  
to changes in the market environments in which we operate.  
A description of how GKN manages risk and the principal risks which 
could impact the Group are set out on pages 42 to 51 of the strategic 
report, and a summary of the internal control and compliance 
procedures is set out on pages 68 and 69 of this statement.
The actions we have taken throughout the year are described more 
fully throughout this report.

Leadership
The role of the Board
We are responsible for the long term success of GKN, with the 
overarching aim of safeguarding shareholders’ interests. Principally, 
we achieve this through:

responsibilities reserved to us, is available on our website at  
www.gkn.com.
Board meetings
I set Board agendas following consultation with the Chief Executive 
and with the assistance of the Company Secretary. An annual

GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance continued
We meet formally approximately eight times a year. At least one 
meeting is combined with a Board visit to the Group’s business 
locations, and in 2014 we visited GKN Driveline in Oles ´nica, Poland. 
In addition to regular Board meeting discussions on strategy, one 
two-day Board meeting per year is devoted to reviewing progress 
made against Group strategy and for discussing longer term 
strategic options. During this meeting senior executives give a 
number of updates and each divisional chief executive proposes the 
strategic options for their respective division. A number of informal 
meetings are also held during the year which helps to strengthen 
relations between Directors. Additionally, I meet from time to time 
with the non-executive Directors without the executive Directors 
being present.
Board committees
Certain Board responsibilities are delegated to our Board 
Committees which play an important governance role through  
the work they carry out. Reports on their activities can be found  
on the following pages and their terms of reference are available  
on our website. All Board Committees are supported by the  
Company Secretariat.
Briefing papers are prepared and circulated to Committee members 
in advance of each meeting and, in respect of the Audit Committee, 
made available to other Directors. In order that the Board remains 
fully updated on their work, the Committee Chairmen report formally 
on Committee activities at the subsequent Board meeting.
The Committees may obtain external professional advice at the 
Company’s expense if deemed necessary.

Effectiveness
 
Board composition 
The Board currently comprises three executive Directors and 
five non-executive Directors including the Chairman. It 
considers that all of the non-executive Directors, excluding the 
Chairman, are independent and it is not aware of any 
relationship or circumstance likely to affect the judgement of 
any Director.
The composition of our Board is kept under review by the 
Nominations Committee to ensure that it retains the necessary skill, 
knowledge and experience to meet the needs of the business. In 
2014 it considered composition and succession planning in light of 
Marcus Bryson’s decision to retire from the Board; further details 
can be found on page 71.
Following the appointment of Adam Walker as Group Finance 
Director Designate on 1 January 2014 and until William Seeger’s 
retirement from the Board on 25 February 2014, our Board comprised 
five executive and four independent non-executive Directors 
(excluding me as Chairman). Although contrary to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code provision which states that at least half the board, 
excluding the chairman, should comprise non-executive directors, 
we considered that this arrangement was necessary to facilitate  
an orderly handover between William Seeger and his successor.  
As a Board, we are content that the independent judgement of the 
non-executive Directors was not adversely affected during this  
short period.
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, all Directors will seek 
re-election at the 2015 AGM. Our biographical details are given on 
page 61.
Recommendations for appointments to the Board are made by the 
Nominations Committee. The Committee follows Board-approved 
procedures (available on our website) which provide a framework for 
the different types of Board appointments. Appointments are made 
on merit against objective criteria with due regard to diversity of 
skills, experience and gender. Non-executive appointees must also 
demonstrate that they have sufficient time to devote to the role. The 
activities of the Nominations Committee during the year are set out 
on page 71.
Development
Directors are continually updated on the Group’s businesses, the 
markets in which they operate and changes to the competitive and 
regulatory environment through briefings to the Board and meetings 
with senior executives. Board visits to Group business locations 
enable us to meet local management and employees and to update 
our knowledge of the Group’s operations. Non-executive Directors 
are also encouraged to visit Group operations to increase their 
exposure to the business.
I discuss training and development needs with each Director as part 
of our annual individual performance evaluation process. The 
Company Secretary keeps under review the suitability of external 
courses so that any needs identified either through the evaluation 
process or on an ad hoc basis can be addressed. Directors attended 
external training courses on a number of matters during the year 
including ethics, technological updates and risk and compliance.
Information and support
I am responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate, timely 
and clear information. The provision of information to the Board was 
reviewed during the year as part of the performance evaluation 
exercise referred to on the following page.
To ensure that adequate time is available for Board discussion and to 
enable informed decision making, briefing papers are prepared and 
circulated to Directors one week prior to scheduled Board meetings. 
All Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary who ensures that the Board is fully briefed on 
legislative, regulatory and corporate governance developments. In 
addition, Directors may, in the furtherance of their duties, take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The Company Secretary also supports the Committee Chairmen by 
ensuring that agendas are appropriate and address all matters for 
which the Committee has specific responsibility.
Induction
On joining the Board, a Director receives a tailored induction to suit 
the individual’s background and experience. This includes:
• a comprehensive induction pack with background information 
about GKN, details of Board meeting procedures, and Directors’ 
duties and responsibilities in addition to a number of other 
governance-related issues; 
• a briefing with the Company Secretary who is tasked with 
facilitating the induction of new Directors both into the Group and 
as to their roles and responsibilities as Directors;
• meetings with the Chief Executive and with relevant senior 
executives to be briefed on the Group strategy and each 
individual business portfolio; 
• plant visits; and
• external training where appropriate, particularly on matters 
relating to the role of a Director and the role and responsibilities 
of Board Committees.
This induction process was applied following the appointment of 
Adam Walker. Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report

Performance evaluation 
Board evaluation
Each year a performance evaluation of the Board is undertaken. An 
external evaluation is carried out every three years. Following the 
external evaluation conducted in 2013, we undertook an internal 
evaluation in 2014. The evaluation process is described below:
Together with the Company Secretary, I agree areas of focus that 
we believe to be critical to the Board’s effectiveness. For 2014 
these included: 
• strategy and process; 
• Board composition and succession planning;
• risk and risk management systems; 
• monitoring financial and non-financial performance;
• culture; and 
• overall Board and Committee working/efficiency.

2014 actions 
Following feedback gained during last year’s evaluation exercise, 
progress against our key actions included making changes to the 
strategy process to ensure that macro and mega trends were 
considered in more detail. We also invited external industry experts 
to attend our strategy meeting to update us on future technology 
trends and market outlook.
2015 actions 
Feedback from the evaluation was generally positive. In particular, 
members felt that there was a constructive and challenging dynamic 
and the style of the meetings was conducive to all members feeling 
that their contributions were encouraged and valued. 
Following discussion of the evaluation results, the Board agreed the 
following key actions for 2015:
Strategy
Divisional strategies to be discussed in  
the context of long term macro-economic 
and technology trends, with input from 
external experts.
Risk
KPIs relating to key principal risks to be 
revised and reported to the Board.
The internal control systems of each division 
relating to quality, programme management 
and contracting to be reviewed during 2015.
Succession 
planning
Increase senior management’s level of 
exposure to the Board to accelerate 
development. 
Director evaluation
The individual performance of the Directors was evaluated  
against a number of assessment areas. I conducted interviews  
with each Director, taking into account feedback received as part  
of the Board evaluation process. I can confirm that each Director  
continues to make a valuable contribution to the Board and devotes 
sufficient time to the role. My evaluation was undertaken by the 
Senior Independent Director taking into account the views  
of the other Directors. 
Committee evaluation 
Committee evaluations were carried out as part of a separate 
process; details of these evaluations can be found in the relevant 
Committee report. 68 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Accountability
Financial and business reporting
When reporting externally, the Board aims to present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
position and prospects. During the year, the Board satisfied 
itself that appropriate assurance processes are in place to 
enable it to state that this annual report, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for users to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy. A statement of this responsibility, 
together with additional responsibilities of the Directors in 
respect of the preparation of the annual report, is set out on 
page 102. Page 109 of the auditors’ report includes a statement 
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP about their reporting 
responsibilities. As set out on page 41, the Directors are of the 
opinion that GKN’s business is a going concern.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for setting the risk appetite of the Group 
and we also retain responsibility for maintaining sound risk 
management and internal control systems and undertaking an 
annual review of the effectiveness of these systems. Certain 
elements of this responsibility are overseen on our behalf by the 
Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.
Our risk management and internal control processes are regularly 
reviewed and revised to ensure that they remain relevant to changes 
in the Group’s internal and external risk profiles. Improvements 
during 2014 included:
• the development and approval of a revised GKN Code for  
Group employees;
• the continued strengthening of the Group’s export control 
compliance programme;
• the introduction of an online tool for assessing external  
anti-bribery and corruption risks; 
• the revision of our Supplier Code of Conduct; and
• the enhancement of reviews of catastrophic health  
and safety risk. 
During the year, we considered changes to the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code and related FRC guidance, particularly in respect 
of risk management and internal control. We are reviewing our 
processes in the context of these changes and will report against the 
revised provisions in the 2015 annual report.
Enterprise risk management
GKN’s enterprise risk management (ERM) programme facilitates a 
Group-wide approach to the identification and assessment of risk.  
A description of the process for managing enterprise risk, together 
with a summary of risks which could have a material impact on  
the Group and actions in place to mitigate those risks, is given  
on pages 42 to 51.
Internal control 
The Group has in place a number of controls to manage risk in respect  
of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated accounts. 
These include:
• the implementation of Group accounting policies and procedures, 
supported by regular bulletins from the central and divisional 
finance teams on the application of accounting standards and 
reporting protocols;
• Group and divisional policies governing the maintenance of 
accounting records, transaction reporting and key financial  
control procedures;
• a proprietary internal control monitoring system, GKN Reporting  
and Integrity Procedures (GRiP), to assess compliance with key 
financial controls on monthly, quarterly and annual cycles;
• monthly operational review meetings which include,  
as necessary, reviews of internal financial reporting issues  
and financial control monitoring;
• divisional certifications in relation to internal financial controls, 
accounting judgements and representations of divisional financial 
results; and
• ongoing training and development of financial reporting personnel.
Other controls in place to minimise risk and ensure the efficient conduct 
of the Group’s business include:
• the regular review of the GKN Code and policies to ensure that areas 
of potential risk are adequately covered. The Code and policies 
define the behaviours expected of all GKN employees and are 
available on the Group intranet;
• the development and dissemination of training programmes to 
educate employees on relevant topics such as competition law or 
anti-bribery and to reinforce the behaviours expected of them;
• clearly defined approval limits and delegated authorities, 
particularly in relation to treasury transactions and capital 
expenditure submissions; and
• an employee disclosure hotline which employees can use to report 
any instances of suspected wrongdoing.
The areas of our risk assurance processes in which compliance 
monitoring is considered to be of the utmost importance currently 
include: financial reporting, IT controls, legal matters (including 
anti-bribery and corruption, competition law and export control), 
human resources issues (including employment practices and 
employee disclosure) and health, safety and the environment. The risk 
assurance framework therefore incorporates:
• monthly monitoring of compliance with the GRiP financial reporting 
processes through a self-certification process and peer reviews; 
• the quarterly completion of an IT controls checklist confirming 
adherence to Group IT standards and policies;
• monitoring the completion of mandated training on legal topics and 
the compliance of divisional sales agents and consultants 
committees (implemented as part of the Group’s anti-bribery and 
corruption measures) with the relevant Group policy;
• the bi-annual completion of a human resources controls  
checklist confirming compliance with certain Group HR  
standards and procedures;
• monitoring the completion of internal health and safety audits 
against target and any themes arising from these audits;
• the annual completion of a questionnaire by senior managers in 
relation to awareness of the Group’s Code and policies; and
• the annual confirmation by senior managers that non-financial 
controls are in place and operating effectively in their businesses.
The Executive Sub-Committee on Governance and Risk (ESCGR) 
monitors the output from these processes and reports any areas of 
concern and proposals for improvement to the Executive Committee 
for consideration.  Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
69 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
In 2014, the ESCGR made recommendations to revise the Group’s 
Supplier Code of Conduct and recommunicate the Group’s Fraud 
Management policy, both of which were accepted by the Executive 
Committee.
Risk review
Each year all Group businesses are required formally to review their 
business risks and to report on whether there has been any material 
breakdown in their internal controls. This formal review is 
supplemented by an interim review conducted at the half year. 
Businesses also have to confirm annually whether they have 
complied with statutory and regulatory obligations as well as with 
the policies which support the GKN Code. 
The Group’s systems and procedures are designed to identify, 
manage and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects of 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They are not 
designed to eliminate such risk, recognising that any system can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Process for review of effectiveness
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the ongoing control 
processes, and the actions undertaken by the Committee to 
discharge this responsibility are described in the Audit Committee’s 
report on pages 72 to 77.
The Board receives an annual report from the Audit Committee 
concerning the operation of the key systems of internal control and 
risk management. This report is considered by the Board in forming 
its own view on the effectiveness of the systems.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk management during the 
period covered by this annual report. It confirms that the 
processes described above, which accord with the FRC guidance 
on internal control (the revised Turnbull Guidance), have been in 
place throughout that period and up to the date of approval of 
the annual report. The Board also confirms that no significant 
failings or weaknesses were identified in relation to the review.
Relations with investors
The Board maintains a dialogue with investors with the objective of 
ensuring a mutual understanding of objectives.
Major shareholders
Communication with major institutional shareholders is undertaken 
as part of GKN’s investor relations programme, in which non-
executive Directors are encouraged to participate.
With support from the Company Secretary, I meet with institutional 
shareholders and investor representatives to discuss matters 
relating to governance and strategy and feed back any issues to the 
Board. The Senior Independent Director is also available to discuss 
issues with shareholders where concerns cannot be addressed 
through normal channels of communication.
Richard Parry-Jones, in his capacity as Remuneration Committee 
Chairman, also engages in discussion with shareholders on 
significant matters relating to executive remuneration. 
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Director of Investor 
Relations meet regularly with major shareholders to discuss 
strategy, financial and operating performance. Feedback is sought 
by the Company’s brokers after meetings and presentations to 
ensure that the Group’s strategy and performance is being 
communicated effectively and to develop further an understanding 
of shareholders’ views. This feedback is included in a twice-yearly 
report to the Board, which also provides an update on investor 
relations activity, highlights changes in holdings of substantial 
shareholders and reports on share price movements. In addition, 
external brokers’ reports on GKN are circulated to all Directors. 
GKN hosted a number of events for institutional investors in 2014, 
which included site visits to its facilities in the UK, China and the US 
and divisional presentations on strategy, growth opportunities and 
technology innovations. A recording of the presentations and slide 
material shown is available on our website.
Communications with shareholders
Written responses are given to letters or email received from 
shareholders and all shareholders receive, or can access 
electronically, copies of the annual and half year reports. The 
investor relations section of our website provides further detail 
about the Group, including share price information, webcasts and 
presentations of annual and half year results, other presentations 
made to the investment community, and copies of financial reports.
Annual general meeting
Information regarding the 2015 AGM is given on page 99. 
Shareholders who attend the AGM are invited to ask questions 
during the meeting and to meet with Directors after the formal AGM 
business has been completed. Resolutions for consideration at the 
AGM are voted on by way of a poll rather than by show of hands to 
allow the votes of all shareholders to be counted, including those 
cast by proxy. The results of the poll vote are announced to the 
London Stock Exchange and published on our website after 
the meeting. 
Compliance statement
This corporate governance statement, together with the 
Nominations Committee report on pages 70 and 71, the Audit 
Committee report on pages 72 to 77 and the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 78 to 98, provide a description of

In accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the majority of members 
are independent non-executive Directors.
The Secretary to the Committee is Jos Sclater, General Counsel & Company Secretary.
Role
The role of the Nominations Committee is to lead the process for identifying, and making 
recommendations to the Board on, candidates for appointment as Directors and as Company 
Secretary, giving full consideration to succession planning and the leadership needs of the Group. 
It also: 
• makes recommendations to the Board on the composition of the Nominations Committee and 
the composition and chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees; 
• keeps under review the structure, size and composition of the Board, including the balance of 
skills, knowledge, experience, ethnicity and gender and the independence of the non-executive 
Directors; and
• makes recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes.
The Nominations Committee follows Board-approved procedures in making its recommendations.

2014 activities 
During 2014 we: 
• considered the composition of the Board following Marcus 
Bryson’s decision to retire;
• considered and recommended new appointments to the 
Executive Committee;
• considered and recommended the appointment of Jos Sclater as 
General Counsel & Company Secretary; and
• recommended to the Board a three-year extension of terms of 
office for Richard Parry-Jones and Tufan Erginbilgic. 
Board and Committee composition
In light of Marcus Bryson’s retirement at the end of 2014, we 
considered the subsequent composition of the Board and the 
Executive Committee and the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on each. 
Following our review, we deemed the size of the Board and the 
balance of executive and non-executive Directors following Marcus 
Bryson’s retirement to be appropriate. We considered that the 
Board’s collective skills and experience and its knowledge of both 
GKN and the industries in which it operates would enable the Board 
to continue to discharge its responsibilities effectively. We did, 
however, support changes to the Executive Committee to ensure 
appropriate divisional representation. Accordingly, the Board 
approved our recommendation to appoint Kevin Cummings, CEO 
GKN Aerospace, Peter Oberparleiter, CEO GKN Powder Metallurgy, 
and Phil Swash, CEO GKN Land Systems, to the Committee. Each 
will attend Board meetings when there is a significant agenda item 
relating to their divisions, giving the Board direct access to their 
knowledge and expertise where appropriate.
Executive matters
Following the retirement of Judith Felton, Company Secretary, in 
June 2014, the Committee recommended the appointment of Jos 
Sclater as Company Secretary in addition to his role as General 
Counsel. The Board approved our recommendation. 
Non-executive matters
During the year we considered the extension of the terms of 
appointment of Richard Parry-Jones and Tufan Erginbilgic. Taking 
into account the contribution that each makes to the Board and its 
Committees, the Committee recommended to the Board the 
extension of the terms of both non-executive Directors for a further 
three years. The Board approved these recommendations. 
Diversity 
We acknowledge the importance of diversity, including gender, 
both on the Board and throughout the Group. Our aim is for the 
Board to consist of people with diverse experience who can add 
real value to Board debates, thereby supporting the achievement of 
our strategic objectives. This includes diversity of industry skills, 
knowledge and experience in addition to gender and ethnicity. 
It is our aim to have at least 25 per cent female representation on 
the Board and we will continue to work towards this as and when 
positions arise. However, our overriding purpose in any new 
appointment must always be to select on merit, in fulfilment of our 
role of ensuring the continued success of the Company.
We are currently focusing on the development and support of our 
executive pipeline with regard to gender and ethnic diversity; 
further information can be found in the sustainability review on 
page 56. 
Advice provided to the Committee
From time to time the Committee appoints external search 
consultants to assist with the selection and recruitment of 
potential new Board members. During the year no such assistance 
was required. 
Performance evaluation 
The Committee’s annual evaluation was carried out as part of a 
series of one-to-one interviews between the Company Secretary 
and each Director. No changes were considered necessary to the 
Committee’s terms of reference as a result, and the Committee was 
considered to be effective in fulfilling its role throughout 2014.

The Committee met five times in 2014, with meetings generally timed to coincide with the  
financial and reporting cycles of the Company. Our attendance at these meetings is set out  
in the table on page 65.  Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
73 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
In order to maintain effective communication between all relevant 
parties, we invited the Group Chairman, Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, Head of Corporate Audit, the external audit 
engagement partner and other members of senior management to 
attend Committee meetings as necessary. 
Members of the Committee met separately at the start of each 
meeting to discuss matters in the absence of any invitees. At the 
conclusion of meetings, the Head of Corporate Audit and the audit 
engagement partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) were 
each given the opportunity to discuss matters without executive 
management being present. Both the Head of Corporate Audit and 
the external auditors have direct access to me should they wish to 
raise any concerns outside formal Committee meetings.
2014 activities 
Our activities in 2014 principally related to financial reporting, the 
external audit, internal control and risk management. In addition, 
we considered other specific matters such as treasury activities, 
updates from the divisional finance directors on relevant divisional 
matters and the Group’s approach to IT controls including  
cyber security.
Significant issues 
We identified the issues below as significant in the context of the 2014 financial statements. We consider these areas to be significant 
taking into account the level of materiality and the degree of judgement exercised by management. We debated the issues in detail to 
ensure that the approaches taken were appropriate. 
Area of focus Committee action
Impairment testing
(see Note 11 to the financial 
statements)
An impairment review is carried  
out annually by management to 
identify cash generating units in 
which the recoverable amount  
of the unit’s assets (including 
expected future cash flows 
generated by those assets) is  
less than the value of the assets 
carried in the Group’s accounts. 
Impairment results in a charge to  
the Group income statement. 
Key judgements and assumptions 
need to be made when valuing the 
assets of the cash generating units 
and the quantum of potential future 
cash flows arising from those assets. 
We considered the significant judgements, assumptions and estimates made by management in preparing 
the impairment review to ensure that they were appropriate. 
We reviewed assumptions relating to:
• the discount rates, which reflect the risk inherent in each unit taking into account factors such as 
geography and sector, used to discount the expected future cash flows to their present value; 
• the estimation of long term growth rates for the territories in which the units were based; and
• the forecast of operating cash flows, based on the most recent budget and strategic reviews and taking 
into account data such as sales profile and prices, market performance, volume, raw material costs and 
capital expenditure levels. 
We also considered sensitivities that would affect the assumptions noted above.
We obtained the external auditors’ view in relation to the appropriateness of the approach and outcome of 
the review. Taking this into account, together with the documentation presented and the explanations 
given by management, we were satisfied with the thoroughness of the approach and judgements taken. 
The review resulted in the impairment of four units and a charge to the income statement of £69 million. 
Provisions for potential 
liabilities 
(see Note 21 to the financial 
statements)
The Group makes provisions where  
it is probable that settlement of 
liabilities will result in a cash outflow 
in respect of contractual obligations, 
warranties, litigation, customer and 
supplier claims and other matters. 
Key judgements are made in 
assessing an appropriate level  
of provisioning. 
We increased our focus on this area in 2014 due to the evolving risk profile of the Group, particularly with 
regard to long term complex contracts in aerospace and increasing customer activity in relation to vehicle 
recalls in automotive. Both of these factors could have a significant impact on the Group’s liabilities. 
Further details on the nature of these risks can be found in our principal risks and uncertainties on 
pages 47 and 48.
In particular, we focused on the potential liabilities arising from contractual matters with customers. To 
determine whether the level of provisioning in the balance sheet was appropriate, we considered 
management’s view of a number of factors including the nature of the claim received, details of any costs 
incurred and potential recall or rectification costs. We also reviewed an assessment of the likelihood of 
future cash outflows arising and the historical accuracy of the level of Group provisions.
We invited PwC’s comments on this area and concluded that the approach taken in respect of provisioning 
continued to be appropriate.  74 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
GOVERNANCE
Audit Committee report continued
We also reviewed the following areas due to their materiality and the application of judgement. However, we considered them to be stable 
in nature and therefore we did not classify them as significant issues in the context of the 2014 financial statements. 
Development costs on 
aerospace programmes 
(see Note 11 to the financial 
statements) 
Development costs for large aerospace 
programmes can be significant and 
assessing the likelihood of future 
recoverability of costs involves various 
judgements and assumptions. These 
relate to factors such as anticipated 
volumes, method of amortisation, 
forecast cash flows and discount rates. 
Impairment reviews of programme development costs against associated future cash flows are 
circulated to the Committee on a six-monthly basis. On each occasion we reviewed the valuation and 
the assumptions made, including programme risk factors, and the most recent external forecasts of 
aircraft programme demand. Actions and factors likely to influence levels of impairment were noted and 
the view of the external auditors was sought in relation to the appropriateness of the approach and 
outcome. Particular focus was placed on the A350 programme due to the value of its development costs, 
which totalled £210 million including capital expenditure and capitalised interest at 31 December 2014. 
Taking into account the documentation presented and the assessment of the external auditors, we were 
satisfied with the approach and judgements taken. 
Post-employment 
obligations 
(see Note 24 to the financial 
statements) 
Determining the current value of the 
Group’s future pension obligations 
requires a number of assumptions. 
These assumptions relate principally to 
life expectancy, discount rates applied 
to future cash flows and rates of 
inflation and future salary increases.
Key matters reviewed this year included the appropriateness of valuation assumptions such as discount 
rates, mortality and inflation. The Committee also reviewed the impact of certain pension de-risking 
activities on the financial statements. In the US, cash lump sums were offered to deferred members on 
a voluntary basis in lieu of future pension obligations. In the UK, a bulk annuity ‘buy-in’ was completed 
whereby the Group insured a proportion of its pension liabilities. 
Valuation assumptions, prepared by external actuaries and adopted by management, were  
considered in the light of prevailing economic indicators and the view of the external auditors.  
The adoption of a new US mortality table was reviewed and the approach adopted by management  
was accepted as appropriate.
Treasury hedging activities
(see Notes 18 and 19 to the financial 
statements) 
In 2014, the Group entered into cross- 
currency interest rate swap instruments 
to convert its £350 million 6.75% bonds 
maturing in 2019 and £450 million 
5.375% bonds maturing in 2022 into US 
Dollars and Euros. Although entering 
into such instruments is a relatively 
common activity for companies which 
operate globally, we considered  
this area due to the quantum of  
the amounts involved and the 
accounting implications.
The use of such instruments requires a number of decisions to be made which impact the financial 
statements. In some areas, management has discretion as to how to act, particularly with regard to:
• the way in which the instruments are accounted for;
• the way in which the instruments are valued; and 
• the method by which the effectiveness of the instruments is measured. 
We considered management’s adoption of net investment hedge accounting and reviewed the method 
and frequency by which it planned to perform the valuations of the swap instruments and effectiveness 
testing of the hedge relationship. We were content that the decisions taken by management were 
appropriate in all instances. 
Given the significance of foreign currency movements on the financial statements, we debated the 
nature of the Group’s hedging activities and reviewed the financial and presentational impact on the 
2014 financial statements. We were satisfied by the approach taken and disclosures given.
Financial reporting 
During the year, we: 
• considered information presented by management on 
significant accounting judgements and policies adopted in 
respect of the Group’s half year and annual financial statements 
and agreed their appropriateness; 
• examined key points of disclosure and presentation to  
ensure the adequacy, clarity and completeness of the  
financial statements; 
• discussed with PwC its audit reports which highlighted key 
accounting matters and significant judgements in respect of 
each set of financial statements;
• reviewed documentation prepared to support the going concern 
judgement given on page 41; and
• received an update on the implications of a new accounting 
standard which will take effect in 2017. 
External audit 
In 2014, we: 
• approved PwC’s audit plan and terms of engagement; 
• conducted our annual review of the independence and 
objectivity of PwC; 
• noted the non-audit fees payable to PwC, having regard  
to the policy on the provision of non-audit services; 
• approved for recommendation to the Board a revised  
policy on non-audit services to take effect from 2015;
• determined that PwC remained effective in their role  
as external auditors; 
• recommended to the Board that PwC be appointed  
as external auditors for a further year; and
• agreed the timing of a tender exercise in relation to  
the appointment of external auditors. Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
75 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to 
the Board in relation to the appointment of the external 
auditors. We also approve the terms of engagement and fees 
of the external auditors, ensuring that they have appropriate 
audit plans in place and that an appropriate relationship is 
maintained between the Group and the external auditors. 
Audit plan
PwC’s presentation of their audit plan set out the scope and 
objectives of the audit together with an overview of the planned 
approach, an assessment of the Group’s risks and controls and 
proposed areas of audit focus. In my role as Chairman, I attended 
PwC’s audit planning meeting. Additionally, PwC worked with 
Corporate Audit and management to identify areas which indicated 
an increased risk of control breakdown. These areas were then 
targeted proactively to ensure they received the appropriate 
amount of attention during the audit.   
Independence
As a Committee we are responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Company’s policies on 
external audit which are designed to maintain the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors. These policies regulate the 
appointment by the Group of former employees of PwC and set out 
the approach to be taken when using the external auditors for 
non-audit work. 
Our annual review of the independence of the external  
auditors included: 
• receiving confirmation from PwC that they remained 
independent and objective within the context of applicable 
professional standards; 
• considering the tenure of the audit engagement partner, who is 
required to rotate every five years in line with ethical standards; 
• ensuring that management confirmed compliance with the 
Group’s policies on the employment of former employees of PwC 
and the use of PwC for non-audit work; and 
• considering Corporate Audit’s annual review of PwC’s 
objectivity, independence and effectiveness and of the  
audit process. 
As a result of this review, we concluded that PwC remained 
appropriately independent in the role of external auditors.
Non-audit services
In order to safeguard independence further, we monitor compliance 
with the policy for the provision of non-audit services. The external 
auditors are generally excluded from consultancy work and are  
not engaged by GKN for other non-audit work unless there are 
compelling reasons to do so, for example where PwC can  
draw upon significant historic knowledge gained through the  
audit process. 
Details of the fees paid to PwC in 2014 can be found in note 
4(a) to the financial statements. Non-audit fees incurred 
during 2014 amounted to £0.9 million which related principally 
to tax compliance services (£0.5 million). Tax advisory services 
totalled £0.2 million and audit related assurance services and 
other services amounted to £0.1 million each. Non-audit fees 
as a percentage of audit fees totalled 20%. All such activities 
remained within the policy approved by the Board. 
During the year, we approved a revised policy on the provision of 
non-audit services for recommendation to the Board. This takes 
effect from 2015 and was amended in anticipation of the 
implementation of EU legislation. In addition to limiting the 
permissible services, the authorisation levels were also reviewed 
and amended. Any proposal to use the external auditors for 
non-audit work with a value between £50,000 and £250,000 must 
be submitted to the Group Finance Director for approval prior to 
their appointment. All proposals above this amount must be 
submitted to me for approval. In addition, the Group Finance 
Director will seek my prior authorisation for certain aspects of 
non-audit services relating to acquisitions, disposals and 
investigative accounting services, regardless of the fee value. The 
use of contingent fees is strictly prohibited under the policy. 76 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
GOVERNANCE
Audit Committee Report continued
Effectiveness and reappointment
Our review of the performance of PwC and the effectiveness of the 
external audit process included consideration of responses from 
questionnaires conducted with members of the Committee, 
executive Directors and senior management. All participants were 
asked to rate PwC’s effectiveness in a number of areas including 
independence and objectivity, audit planning and execution, 
conduct and communication, audit findings and feedback and 
expertise and resourcing. The results confirmed that both PwC and 
their audit process were considered to be effective and that a good 
working relationship was supplemented by a sufficient amount of 
robustness in challenging management judgements. Minor 
improvements relating to team member continuity and 
communications with site management were suggested to and 
accepted by PwC. 
PwC have been the Company’s external auditors since their 
formation in 1998, although several predecessor organisations of 
PwC held office for some time prior to that date. Whilst the 
Company has not formally tendered the audit in recent years, the 
Committee did conduct a comprehensive review of the 
effectiveness and performance of the external auditors following 
the rotation of the audit partner in 2011. As part of this exercise, 
the new audit partner submitted a tender proposal for future audits 
covering matters such as independence, objectivity, resourcing 
and value for money. We also conducted a benchmarking exercise 
based on external data and a review of external documents on the 
four major audit firms issued by regulatory bodies. 
In determining whether to recommend the auditors for 
reappointment in 2015, we took into consideration the tenure of the 
audit partner, the results of the effectiveness review detailed 
above, the FRC Audit Quality Inspection Report in respect of PwC 
and the firm’s internal quality control procedures. Taking these 
elements into account, we concluded that it was appropriate to 
recommend to the Board PwC’s reappointment as the Company’s 
auditors for a further year. 
Mindful of the increasing regulatory focus on audit tendering in the 
UK and EU, we have been keeping under review the appropriate 
timing of conducting a formal tender exercise. During 2014, the 
Committee recommended, and the Board accepted, a proposal to 
put the audit contract out to competitive tender following the 
rotation of the current audit partner. It is therefore anticipated that 
any change in auditors would take effect for the audit of the 2016 
financial statements. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting our choice of 
external auditors.
Internal control and risk management 
In fulfilling our remit we: 
• reviewed the results of audits undertaken by Corporate Audit; 
• received reports on control issues of significance to the Group; 
• reviewed the status of the Group’s internal financial control 
monitoring system; 
• reported to the Board on our evaluation of the operation of the 
Group’s systems of internal control and risk management, 
informed by reports from Corporate Audit and PwC; and 
• noted the implementation of additional risk processes. 
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems and the activities and effectiveness of 
Corporate Audit. 
We reviewed Corporate Audit’s quarterly reports throughout the 
year which detail any internal control issues and identify any 
themes arising in relation to audit recommendations. We 
considered the adequacy of management’s response to matters 
raised and the implementation of recommendations made. 
We received regular updates on progress in respect of the 
continued development of the Group’s risk management framework 
and the implementation of additional assurance processes in order 
to strengthen the framework. Further information on the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk management is given on pages 
68 and 69. Together with an internal control review undertaken by 
Corporate Audit and an informal review of our internal control 
environment carried out by PwC, we evaluated the systems of 
internal control and risk management and reported to the Board on 
our evaluation in order that it could form a view on the 
effectiveness of those systems. The Board’s statement on internal 
control can be found on pages 68 and 69.
Internal audit 
During the year we: 
• approved the appointment of a new Head of Corporate Audit;
• approved the 2015 Corporate Audit programme, including the 
proposed audit approach, coverage and allocation of 
resources; and 
• reviewed the effectiveness of Corporate Audit. 
In relation to consideration of the Corporate Audit programme for 
the forthcoming year, we reviewed the proposed audit approach, 
coverage and allocation of resource. We also received progress 
updates against the 2014 audit programme throughout the year. 
We reviewed the terms of reference and effectiveness of Corporate 
Audit, taking into account the views of Directors and senior 
management on matters such as independence, proficiency, 
resourcing, and audit strategy, planning and methodology. The 
review confirmed that the Corporate Audit function was 
independent and objective and remained an effective element of 
the Group’s corporate governance framework. Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report

Employee disclosure 
To support the Group’s Employee Disclosure Procedures Policy 
(available on our website), GKN operates a Group-wide 
international employee disclosure hotline. Run by an external 
and independent third party, the hotline enables employees to 
make (anonymously if preferred) confidential disclosures 
about suspected impropriety and wrongdoing. Any matters 
reported are investigated and escalated to the Audit 
Committee as appropriate, and statistics on the volume and 
general nature of all disclosures made are reported to the 
Committee on an annual basis.
Other matters
During the year we:
• received an update on treasury strategy, particularly in respect 
of hedging activities;
• reviewed progress against the Group’s IT security plan; and
• received updates from divisional finance directors on matters 
relevant to their divisions.
Recognising the financial impact that an IT security breach could 
have on the Company, we received an update on the Group’s 
approach to IT security controls in terms of prevention, detection 
and response. Further information can be found in our principal 
risks and uncertainties on page 50.
We also received updates from our divisional finance directors on 
matters relevant to their divisions. Principally these related to 
contractual matters, reviews of programme development costs and 
updates on a cross-divisional project to develop a bespoke 
software tool to track and improve the separation of duties in 
transactions, thereby reducing the risk of fraud or error.
Advice provided to the Committee 
The Committee has independent access to the services of 
Corporate Audit and to the external auditors, and may obtain 
outside professional advice as necessary in the performance 
of its duties.
Performance evaluation 
Our annual evaluation process was carried out by questionnaire in 
2014. The questionnaire focused on areas such as Committee 
composition, quality and content of meetings, role and remit, and 
areas of focus for 2015. Feedback from the questionnaire, which 
was circulated to Committee attendees as well as members, showed 
that the Committee was considered to be effective in fulfilling its 
role throughout 2014.
Overview of Committee activities for 2015 
Risk management will continue to be our priority for 2015. As part of 
the refinement and reinforcement of our internal control systems, 
the Board plans to review the control systems relating to the 
Group’s principal risks of product quality, programme management 
and contracting. We will consider the effectiveness of any additional 
internal control systems that may be implemented as a result of this 
review. Our other area of focus will be the oversight of the tender 
process for the external audit contract.

Directors’ remuneration report
PROFESSOR RICHARD PARRY-JONES CBE
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
We note the emphasis in the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code on designing pay schemes that promote the long term success of the 
Group. This is in line with our approach to reward. GKN is a long term business, with automotive platforms often lasting for seven years or 
more and aerospace platforms frequently lasting for more than twenty years. This is why in 2012 we were one of the first industrial 
companies to introduce a significant five year element into our long term incentive scheme. The other elements of our incentives 
arrangements are also carefully designed to align with our strategy and risks, as described below.
Incentive scheme Link to strategy and risk
Annual bonus 
scheme (STVRS) 
Our Short Term Variable Remuneration Scheme (STVRS) is designed to incentivise the achievement of short 
term financial and strategic initiatives which are required to deliver the long term strategy.
As described on page 9, we aim to achieve a balanced approach between growth, margin and return on 
invested capital (ROIC), resulting in increased cash flow. The STVRS financial targets are designed to reward 
the achievement of these measures. We set challenging targets, whilst seeking to avoid excessive risk taking.
The STVRS strategic measures are designed to reward the achievement of key strategic goals that will help 
deliver the broader Group and divisional strategies and address key risks. The 2014 strategic measures were 
tailored to Group and divisional strategies but there were some common themes as set out below:
Strategic goal Link to strategic objective Link to principal risk
New business wins Leading in chosen markets Highly competitive markets
Development of technology Technology driving margin Technology and innovation
Implementation of our ‘Voice of the 
Customer’ initiative
Operational excellence Product quality
We ensure that the strategic goals are specific, measurable and fairly assessed.
Deferred bonus 
plan (DBP)
Any STVRS payment that exceeds 65% of salary is deferred into shares for a two year deferral period. Awards 
will generally lapse on resignation. This aids retention as well as aligning executives’ interests with those of 
our shareholders.
Long term 
incentive  
plan (SEP)
As described on page 9, our strategy aims to increase earnings per share (EPS) on a sustainable basis. The 
Sustainable Earnings Plan (SEP) incentivises executives to sustain EPS growth over the medium to long term. 
Performance is measured over three and five years. Whilst we want to encourage earnings growth, we do not 
want to drive the wrong behaviour. We therefore consider the quality of earnings before we approve the 
vesting of each SEP award.
As with the DBP, the structure of the SEP is designed to aid the retention of executives, recognising that the 
appointment and retention of key executives continues to be crucial to the Group’s achievement of its 
strategic objectives.
Dear Shareholder 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you 
for supporting our remuneration policy, which  
was approved by 98% of shareholder votes at last 
year’s AGM. Since then, we have not made  
any significant changes to our remuneration 
arrangements and continue to take a disciplined 
approach to execution to ensure that our 
remuneration framework rewards the right 
behaviours and supports the strategic goals  
of GKN.  Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
79 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Performance and STVRS outcome for 2014
As described in the strategic report, GKN made good progress in 2014 despite some difficult trading conditions. These included the effects of 
translational currency exchange rates, market volatility in Land Systems and certain automotive territories and some declining military 
programmes. These adverse factors were more than offset by some good performances.
STVRS payments to executive Directors were between 38% and 55% of salary, depending upon performance against their targets. The maximum 
annual bonus achievable was 110% of base salary. Given the Group’s good results, this outcome reflects the stretching targets we put in place at 
the start of 2014.
As a general principle, the Committee seeks to avoid exercising discretion unless there are good reasons to do so. During 2014 we exercised 
discretion to ensure that STVRS performance was measured on a consistent, like-for-like basis by excluding the impact of two small 
transactions: the acquisition of Williams Hybrid Power and the disposal of the Group’s 50% share in Emitec. These transactions were not 
included in the financial targets set at the start of the year and therefore we felt it was reasonable to exclude them. We also reviewed the 
circumstances surrounding the fatal accident at El Cajon and exercised our discretion to adjust some payouts in the chain of accountability 
downwards in line with our principle that safety is our top priority.
SEP
The first SEP award was granted in 2012 and the three year performance period for that award ended on 31 December 2014. The core element of 
the 2012 SEP award vested at 67.5% of maximum following annual compound growth in earnings per share of 9.4% over the performance period. 
The Committee carefully considered the quality of earnings, noting that performance across the Group’s KPIs was generally strong during the 
performance period. In particular, ROIC was good for each year of the performance period, ending at 17.7% for the Group in 2014. This is a 
particularly credible outcome given that we acquired Volvo Aerospace during the relevant performance period. The share price performed well 
during the performance period, increasing from 183p on 1 January 2012 to 344p on 31 December 2014 and the dividend per share increased from 
7.2p in 2012 to 8.4p in 2014. The sustainability element of the 2012 SEP award will be measured at the end of 2017 after the five year 
performance period.
Other key decisions during 2014
Marcus Bryson, CBE, retired from the Board at the end of 2014. Given Marcus’ contribution to GKN and his retirement after many years of 
exceptional performance, he was treated as a good leaver and, in line with our approved remuneration policy, his outstanding awards under  
the SEP will vest taking into account performance achieved and time served during the relevant performance periods. 
We approved salary increases for the executive Directors of around 2.7% for 2014, after carefully considering their performance, market 
reference points, and salary increases awarded to both the senior management population and all UK employees. The salary increases approved 
for the executive Directors were broadly in line with those awarded to UK employees generally.
We approved an increase in the Chairman’s fee; this is explained in more detail on page 92. We concluded that this increase was appropriate in 
light of the scope of the role, time commitment and positioning against the market. We also considered the Chairman’s shareholding 
requirement of 30% of his fee and decided that it continued to be appropriate.
In the course of the year, the Committee considered the external environment for executive talent and changes to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, consulted with shareholders, reviewed its effectiveness and agreed on actions for continuous improvement.
 
Our approach for 2015
No major changes will be made to the structure of the STVRS for 2015 but we will continue to refine it to ensure that it incentivises the right 
behaviours. Having reviewed the STVRS payments over the last three years against Group performance and shareholder expectations, we 
consider that the targets have been challenging. Whilst we have not changed our approach to setting targets for 2015, we have revised the ranges 
above and below target to encourage executives to drive beyond the targets, whilst carefully managing risk. We have tailored the ranges for each 
division and our view of their markets in 2015. In addition, we have refined the cash targets to continue encouraging improvement in sustainable 
cash flow. The strategic measures for 2015 are aligned with our strategy and risks and include incentivising the continued development of our 
risk management systems, implementation of our diversity and inclusion programme, new business wins and operational excellence.
As a Committee, we keep the remuneration framework under review to ensure that it continues to be appropriate and effectively aligns 
executives with the long term sustainability of the business. Whilst we do not plan to make any significant changes for 2015, we will apply  
malus and clawback provisions to our STVRS and SEP schemes for our executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee. In addition, 
we will review the STVRS and SEP schemes and targets to ensure that they continue to be both appropriately stretching and an effective tool for 
the appointment and retention of top executives. 
Overall, given GKN’s performance over the one and three year periods to the end of 2014, I am comfortable that the absolute amounts awarded 
to our executive Directors in respect of 2014 are appropriate. We will continue to take a rigorous, principled and fair approach to setting 
remuneration. The following pages describe in further detail how we have implemented our remuneration policy in respect of 2014, together  
with our plans for 2015.

Salaries
During the year
In June 2014, we undertook an annual review of salaries for executive Directors. We took into account a number of factors, including their 
performance, increases awarded to senior management and employees in the UK generally, the advice of our remuneration advisers and 
market data. We approved salary increases of 2.7% (rounded to the nearest thousand) for executive Directors as set out below. This increase 
was broadly in line with the average increase awarded to UK employees generally. Salary increases were effective from 1 July 2014.

Implementation of policy for 2015
Any salary increases in 2015 will be made in line with the approved remuneration policy as set out at the end of this report.
Taxable benefits
All Directors received healthcare benefits and car and fuel allowances. In addition, William Seeger received US benefits (medical insurance, 
life insurance, long and short term disability benefit and fees for computation of annual tax return) that were taxable in the UK and converted 
into UK sterling using the average exchange rate for the first business day of each month.
Pension entitlements
During the year
Pension benefits are provided to executive Directors through the GKN Group Pension Scheme (2012) (the Scheme). The Scheme has changed 
in recent years in line with pension regulations. Directors receive benefits either under the defined benefit section of the Scheme or the 
defined contribution section of the Scheme depending on when they joined.
Defined benefit section of the Scheme 
These are legacy arrangements which apply to Nigel Stein, Marcus Bryson and Andrew Reynolds Smith, under which they receive:
• a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable salary on their normal retirement date with a maximum annual accrual rate of 1/30
th
.  
From 1 September 2007, benefits under the Scheme have been calculated on a career average basis; and
• a supplementary cash allowance of up to 40% of the difference between their pensionable salary and base salary.
They may choose to opt out and receive a cash allowance on their full base salary. Nigel Stein opted out of the Scheme.
Defined contribution section of the Scheme 
Adam Walker receives retirement benefits by way of a cash allowance equivalent to 25% of base salary which may be delivered in cash or as 
a payment into the defined contribution section of the Scheme. He was automatically enrolled into the Scheme but chose to opt out and 
therefore receives the full allowance as cash.
No compensation is offered for any additional tax suffered by a Director in the event that the value of his or her pension exceeds the 
statutory lifetime allowance.
William Seeger did not participate in the Scheme during the period he was a Director but received an overall allowance of 40% of base  
salary, which included the Company’s contributions to qualified and non-qualified defined contribution pension arrangements consistent 
with US practice.
Details of the pension benefit provisions under the defined benefit and defined contribution sections of the Scheme can be found on 
page 90.

STVRS 
Purpose of Short Term Variable Remuneration Scheme (STVRS) 
Aligning short term financial and strategic measures with long term strategic objectives
Payments under the STVRS are triggered by performance against targets set for financial and strategic measures. The financial measures 
represent a maximum opportunity of 90% of base salary, assessed against targets relating to profit, margin and cash flow in relation to 
Group or individual portfolios as appropriate. The strategic measures for 2014 are summarised below and represent the remaining bonus 
opportunity of 20% of base salary.
The STVRS financial measures are designed to reward the achievement of profit, margin and cash flow without encouraging excessive 
risk-taking. Strategic objectives are tailored to meet the broader Group strategies and the individual business needs of each division. 
Payments of up to 65% of base salary are made in cash and any balance is deferred into shares under the DBP (see page 84).
2014 STVRS performance (audited)
Performance of the financial measures achieved relating to Group profit and margin for 2014 are set out below:

Profit (£m) 611 643 675 642 50 24.2 
Margin (%) 8.9 9.2 9.5 9.3 10 6.7 
The profit and margin figures above are calculated using 2014 budget exchange rates to eliminate the impact of translational currency 
fluctuations. As described in the Chairman’s letter, actual performance has been adjusted to remove the impact of two small one-off items to 
ensure that performance is measured against targets on a like-for-like-basis and some payouts were reduced in light of a fatal accident at 
our Aerospace site in El Cajon, US. Targets are set on a monthly, cumulative basis to reflect the budgeted cash profile for the year and also 
include an element in relation to cash conversion and an underpin to encourage capital expenditure broadly in line with budget phasing. 
Performance of strategic goals at Group and divisional levels included the following:
Strategic goals Outcome
• Winning appropriate new business and delivering other strategic 
initiatives relating to technology development and market 
expansion.
• A good performance across the Group, with particularly strong 
new business wins by Driveline at appropriate margins and good 
growth of the Land Systems business in China. 
• Improving quality through the ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative. • Very good progress across all divisions, particularly Aerospace. 
• Successful transition of the new members of the Executive 
Committee, higher graduate recruitment and improvements in 
intellectual property and treasury management.
• Strong progress with a seamless transition to the new Executive 
Committee members, an additional 75 graduates into our training 
schemes and delivery of key intellectual property and treasury 
initiatives.
STVRS is based on performance against stretching targets set by the Committee at the start of the year. The Board believes that detailed 
cash flow and divisional financial targets are commercially sensitive, but the disclosure set out overleaf in relation to 2014 STVRS provides 
information on the level of performance achieved against the various measures during 2014 and demonstrates the extent to which this 
performance met threshold, target and maximum levels. 84 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Taking into account the revisions to the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, we will apply clawback provisions to the STVRS from 2015 
onwards (the DBP already includes malus provisions). Clawback and malus will be applied in the event of a material misstatement of the 
Group’s published accounts or if an individual is guilty of serious misconduct or has committed a serious breach of the GKN Code. We will 
also be able to apply malus provisions where there has been a failure of risk management or major reputational damage to GKN. In applying 
clawback, the value of any other long or short term incentive awards may be reduced.
STVRS – deferred shares
Purpose of Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) 
Aligning interests of key executives with those of shareholders

85 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Implementation of policy for 2015
There is no change to the policy for setting targets for 2015. However we have revised the ranges above and below target to encourage 
executives to drive performance beyond the targets. Any STVRS payment above 65% of salary earned in respect of 2015 will be deferred. 
Long term incentives
Purpose of Sustainable Earnings Plan (SEP)
Sustained earnings performance to support the Group’s growth strategy and objective of creating long term  
shareholder value
The SEP is designed to improve alignment with the Group’s growth strategy and with shareholder interests, as well as encouraging and 
rewarding earnings performance which is sustained over the long term. Awards take the form of a Core Award and a Sustainability Award 
and are normally granted annually to executive Directors and to the senior management population. The chart below illustrates how the 
SEP operates:

Vesting of awards in 2014 (audited)
The long term incentive values shown in the single total figure table on page 81 relate to the 2012 SEP Core Award for which the performance 
period ended on 31 December 2014. The performance targets and vesting levels are set out in the table below. The quality of earnings is  
an important assessment which includes the creation of both financial and shareholder value. Before we approved the 2012 SEP vesting 
levels we reviewed the quality of earnings. This included a review of organic sales growth, trading margin, free cash flow, ROIC, dividend  
per share, net debt and cost of capital during the performance period. As described in the Chairman’s letter, we were satisfied with the 
quality of earnings.

(a) Core and Sustainability Awards (in the form of conditional awards) were granted as performance share awards with no exercise price.
(b) Value is based on the maximum number of shares that would vest assuming the relevant performance conditions (see page 85 for further details) are satisfied in full. The number 
of Core Award shares is calculated using the GKN share price of 396.23p, being the average share price for the three dealing days immediately before the date of grant (10 March 
2014). The number of Sustainability Award shares is based on 20% of the Core Award Shares. The value excludes the amount attributable to dividend equivalents (paid in 
additional shares or cash) over the relevant performance periods which are released at the same time as the Core and Sustainability Award shares.
Implementation of policy for 2015
Awards under the SEP, with a face value of 174% of base salary, will continue to be measured against growth in EPS using the targets set out 
on page 85 and against a baseline EPS for 2014 of 32.1p. Provided all or part of the Core Award vests, the Sustainability Award will be 
measured by reference to the highest level of EPS achieved in any year of the core performance period.
Taking into account the revisions to the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, we will apply malus and clawback provisions to the 2015 SEP 
awards and subsequent awards. Clawback and malus will be applied to the SEP Core awards in the event of a material misstatement of the 
Group’s published accounts or if an individual is guilty of serious misconduct or has committed a serious breach of the GKN Code. We will 
also be able to apply malus provisions to all SEP awards where there has been a failure of risk management or major reputational damage to 
GKN. In applying clawback, the value of any other long or short term incentive awards may be reduced.
Historic plans
Prior to the introduction of the SEP in 2012, long term incentive awards were granted under the GKN Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which 
targeted EPS growth and the GKN Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) which was based on TSR performance. Details of vested and 
outstanding LTIP and ESOS awards are shown on pages 89 and 90. Since 2012, all long term incentive awards have been granted under      
the SEP.
Joining awards 
Purpose of joining awards 
To compensate for long term incentives forfeited on leaving former employer
Adam Walker joined the Board on 1 January 2014 and became Group Finance Director on 26 February 2014. In addition to participating in the 
normal ongoing incentive arrangements (STVRS and SEP), he was granted joining awards (as set out below). These awards were granted in 
line with the remuneration policy to compensate him for the long term incentive arrangements he forfeited on leaving his former employer.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Executive Directors’ share interests (audited) 
We believe that the interests of Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders so we operate a shareholding requirement to 
achieve this. For executive Directors, a considerable part of this alignment can be achieved through the retention of shares released under 
the DBP and under long term incentive plans. 
In July 2012, the alignment between shareholders and executive Directors was improved as the minimum shareholding requirement was 
increased from 100% to 200% of base salary. Nigel Stein, Marcus Bryson and Andrew Reynolds Smith, who were all in post at that time, were 
expected to meet the requirement within five years and did so comfortably (see table below). 
Adam Walker, as a newly appointed Director, is expected to acquire shares with a value of 100% of his base salary within five years of 
appointment and 200% of base salary as soon as possible after that. He is expected to retain all vested long term incentive awards (net of 
tax) until the requirement is met in full. He has made considerable progress towards meeting the requirement since his appointment to the 
Board on 1 January 2014. 
The shareholding requirement is tested annually on 31 December using the average share price for the final three months of the year based 
only on shares that are held outright by the Director or their connected persons.
We also apply a similar shareholding requirement for Executive Committee members and the top 100 executives in the Group as we believe 
that their interests should be closely aligned with shareholders in the same way as those of executive Directors and non-executive Directors 
(see page 93). Executive Committee members are expected to hold shares with a value of a minimum of 100% of base salary (retaining all 
vested long term incentives net of tax until the requirement is met in full). The top 100 executives below that level are required to hold a 
minimum of either 20% or 30% of base salary, depending on their grade, (retaining 50% of vested long term incentives net of tax until the 
requirement is met in full).
The following table shows the number of shares held by the Directors (and their connected persons) at 31 December 2014. It also shows the 
interests of executive Directors in share awards at the same date (with further details provided in the subsequent tables).

Payments in respect of retiring Directors (audited)
Marcus Bryson
Marcus Bryson stepped down from the Board at the close of business on 31 December 2014 and retired from the Company on 1 January 2015. 
He will be employed on a part-time basis until 31 December 2015. No STVRS or SEP awards will be made to him in respect of 2015.
Incentive awards
In accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plans and the remuneration policy, Marcus Bryson’s incentive awards will be treated 
as follows:
• The 2011 ESOS award over 168,353 shares with an option price of 199.58p has vested in respect of performance to 31 December 2013 and 
can be exercised until 1 July 2015 (six months after retirement).
• The 2011 LTIP award of 343,558 shares has vested in respect of performance to 31 December 2013 and will be released (i.e. the award will 
become capable of exercise) as soon as practicable following his retirement, in accordance with the rules of the plan. A cash amount 
equivalent to the dividends on the vested shares (from the beginning of the third year of the relevant performance period to the release 
date) will also be paid.
• The 2014 DBP award over 11,675 shares will be released as soon as practicable following his retirement in accordance with the rules of the 
plan. A cash amount equivalent to the dividends on the shares during the period from grant to release will also be paid. 
• The 2014 STVRS award will be paid wholly in cash as it did not exceed the 65% threshold for any deferral into shares.
We considered Marcus Bryson to be a good leaver for the purposes of the SEP awards granted in 2012, 2013 and 2014; this was considered 
appropriate given his retirement from full time employment and his contribution to the Group. The number of shares under his unvested 2013 
and 2014 SEP awards will be reduced on a pro rata basis to reflect his length of service during the relevant performance periods. These 
awards will remain subject to the original performance conditions and any core awards that vest will be released at the end of the relevant 
three year core performance period. The sustainability awards relating to all of his 2013 and 2014 SEP awards will lapse. The 2012 Core Award 
(which vested at 67.5% as shown on page 89) will be released in full (217,489 shares) on 24 February 2015 together with 12,152 dividend 
equivalent shares. The Sustainability Award will lapse.
William Seeger
William Seeger retired from the Board on 25 February 2014. The payments he received whilst he was a Director are shown in the single total 
figure table on page 81. This section provides details of remuneration and benefits received whilst he was an employee and following his 
retirement from the Company. 
In the 2013 annual report on remuneration we disclosed estimated values of certain expatriate benefits that he was entitled to receive. 
Where these payments have been made whilst he was an employee and following his retirement from the Company, we have set out the 
actual amounts below.
Payments whilst an employee
William Seeger continued to be employed within the Group until his retirement on 31 August 2014. During this time he received salary and 
normal benefits and pension entitlements. For the period 26 February 2014 to 31 August 2014, he received the following expatriate benefits: 
• Repatriation costs of £7,242 (estimated at £15,000). No further payment due.
• Tax return support of £4,219 for the period 26 February 2014 to 31 December 2014 (estimated at £25,000 until vesting of all outstanding 
awards). Payments ongoing until 2018.
• Reasonable expenses for sale of his US property of $57,232 (payment capped at the lower of 7% of selling price or $100,000. No further 
payment due.
• Tax and social security equalisation was applied to his remuneration for the period so he was not disadvantaged by his global tax 
position (details for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014 are shown in the hypothetical tax withholding section below). Tax 
equalisation will continue to be applied to any relevant payment made. 
Payments following retirement
For the period 1 September 2014 to 31 December 2014, William Seeger received the following ongoing expatriate benefits:
• US healthcare benefits of £5,214 (estimated at £15,000 for 18 months following his retirement from the Company). Payments ongoing until 
March 2016.
• Tax return support continued to be applied for the period following retirement (full details shown above). Payments ongoing until 2018.
• Tax and social security equalisation continued to be applied for the period (full details for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014 
are shown in the hypothetical tax withholding section below). Tax equalisation will continue to be applied to any relevant payment made.
As reported on page 89, the 2012 SEP Core Award vested at 67.5%. On 24 February 2015, 90,796 shares (50% of the vested Core Award 
shares) and 5,073 dividend equivalent shares will be released to him. The remaining 90,797 vested Core Award shares will be released in 
2017. The Sustainability Award associated with the vested Core Award will vest subject to the satisfaction of the sustainability target 
measured over each of the financial years ending 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016, and will be released in 2017. The number of 
Sustainability Award shares has been reduced to 40,867 shares to reflect the extent to which the core target has not been met over the core 
performance period; the number of Sustainability Award shares which vest will be determined by reference to the extent to which the 
sustainability target is met and pro-rated for time served over the award’s five year period. 92 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Hypothetical tax withholding
William Seeger is a US national who relocated to the UK in 2008. During the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014, his emoluments 
were paid in US$ subject to full US State and Federal hypothetical tax withholding. The Company operates hypothetical tax and social 
security withholding so that he is placed in a tax neutral position mitigating him against double taxation in the UK and US. This treatment 
has resulted in GKN making a payment of £1,671,937 (2013: £1,055,689) to the UK and US tax authorities with any overpayment of taxes 
being subsequently refunded to the Company. For 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014, the best estimate of the amount which is not 
expected to be refunded to the Company, based on information available to date, is £134,780 (2013: £26,298). These amounts are not 
included in the single figure table for 2013 or 2014 on page 81. For the period he was a Director (1 January 2014 to 25 February 2014), the 
estimated actual tax payments made by the Company were £120,751 on a cash paid basis. Of this, the best estimate of the amount which is 
not expected to be refunded to the Company based on the information available to date is £53,604.
No payments for loss of office were made to any past Director during the year.

Implementation of policy for 2015
In November 2014, we reviewed the fees for the Chairman and approved an increase of 6% with effect from 1 January 2015. We concluded 
that this increase was appropriate taking into account the scope of the role, time commitment and positioning against market. 
In November 2014 the fees for non-executive Directors were reviewed by the Board and an increase of 9% was approved taking into account 
the current market environment, the scope of the role, the time commitment expected of them and the time since the last increase was made 
(being two years ago). The additional fees for the Audit and Remuneration Committee Chairmen and Senior Independent Director were also 
reviewed but not increased. The fees from 1 January 2015 are set out below:

Non-executive Directors’ shareholdings
The Board reviewed the shareholding requirement for non-executive Directors in November 2014 and confirmed that the current requirement 
to achieve a minimum shareholding of 30% of base fees within three years of appointment remained appropriate. The shareholding 
requirement is tested annually on 31 December using the average share price for the final three months of the year based only on shares that 
are held outright by the Director or their connected persons. All non-executive Directors met the requirement comfortably.

Percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive 
The comparison of the percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive is based on a senior management population of 
approximately 196 people around the world. This is considered appropriate as it includes those employees with international responsibilities 
who have similar remuneration arrangements to the Chief Executive, in particular the annual bonus arrangements.

External appointments
Executive Directors may accept one non-executive directorship with another company (excluding that of chairmanship of a FTSE 100 
company) subject to review by the Board in each case. The Board recognises the benefits that such appointments can bring both to the 
Company and to the Director in broadening their knowledge and experience in other markets and countries. The fees received for such a role 
may be retained by the Director. Andrew Reynolds Smith is a non-executive director of Morgan Advanced Materials plc from which he 
received (and retained) a fee of £48,715 in respect of 2014.  Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report

Dilution limits 
The rules of the discretionary share plans (SEP, ESOS and LTIP) contain limits on the dilution of capital. These limits are monitored to ensure 
that the issue of new shares or transfer of shares from treasury does not exceed 5% of the issued share capital in any rolling 10 year period 
for discretionary plans or 10% of the issued share capital in any rolling 10 year period for all employee plans.
At 31 December 2014 the cumulative number of shares issued under discretionary plans for the previous 10 year period as a percentage of 
the issued share capital was 2.67%. The Company no longer operates an all employee share plan.
GKN’s policy is to satisfy awards under the SEP, ESOS and LTIP by the issue of shares, transfer of shares from treasury or from an employee 
share ownership plan trust (Trust) established for that purpose. DBP awards are satisfied by transfer of shares held in the Trust. A dividend 
waiver operates in respect of shares held in the Trust.
During the year, shares held in treasury were used to satisfy awards under the ESOS and LTIP and shares held in the Trust were used to 
satisfy awards under the DBP. Details of the Trust shares are set out below:

Directors’ remuneration policy
The Company’s full policy on remuneration for executive Directors was approved by shareholders on 1 May 2014 and can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.gkn.com/remuneration. We have included sections of the remuneration policy below that we consider would be 
most helpful for shareholders to have repeated here.
Policy table for executive Directors
Fixed Pay
Base salary Benefits in kind Pension
Purpose and 
link to 
strategy 
• To provide a market 
competitive salary to recruit 
and retain individuals with 
the necessary knowledge, 
skills and experience  
to deliver the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
• To provide benefits 
consistent with the scope 
and location of the role.
• To provide appropriate retirement 
benefits and assist with recruitment and 
retention.
Operation 
• Normally reviewed annually 
(with any increase generally 
taking effect from 1 July) 
taking into account a 
number of factors including 
individual experience, scope 
of the role, responsibility 
and performance, Group 
profitability, prevailing 
market conditions and  
pay awards in the  
Group generally.
• Benefits are consistent  
with those provided to 
senior managers, and 
principally include car  
and fuel allowance, life 
assurance, disability and 
healthcare benefits.
• Other benefits may be 
provided at the discretion 
of the Committee based on 
individual circumstances 
and business requirements, 
such as appropriate 
relocation and expatriate 
allowances and support. 
• Provided by means of an allowance 
delivered in cash and/or as payment to a 
pension plan. 
• Where historical arrangements are in 
place, benefits are provided in part 
through membership of the GKN Group 
Pension Scheme 2012.
Maximum 
potential 
value 
• Salary increases will 
normally be in line with the 
average increase awarded to 
other employees in the 
Group. However, larger 
increases may be awarded 
in circumstances where it is 
considered appropriate by 
the Committee, such as: 
 – an increase in scope and 
responsibility;
 – a new executive Director 
being moved to market 
positioning over time; and
 – an existing executive 
Director falling below 
market positioning.
• To comply with the 
Regulations, the maximum 
potential value for existing 
Directors will be no more 
than the amount paid to the 
Chief Executive at any time 
plus 15%. 
• Benefits are set at a level 
which the Committee 
considers appropriate and 
are kept under review. Car 
and fuel allowances will not 
increase by more than 15% 
in any one year. Some 
benefits (such as 
healthcare insurance) are 
provided through third 
parties and therefore the 
cost to the Company may 
vary from year to year. 
Relocation and expatriate 
allowances, where granted, 
are set at a level which the 
Committee considers 
appropriate based on 
market practice and 
individual circumstances. 
• The maximum allowance for Directors 
appointed from 1 January 2013 onwards 
is 25% of base salary. 
• Directors appointed before that date 
currently have legacy benefits under  
the GKN Group Pension Scheme 2012,  
a defined benefit scheme. The pension 
due under these arrangements is up to 
two-thirds of pensionable salary 
(calculated on a career average basis  
for service from 1 September 2007 
onwards), with a maximum annual 
accrual rate of 1/30th. The Committee 
has discretion to provide alternative 
arrangements on terms no more 
favourable if it considers it to be in the 
best interests of the Company. These 
Directors receive a supplementary cash 
allowance of up to 40% of the difference 
between their individual pensionable 
salary and base salary.

• To drive and reward 
achievement of short  
term financial and 
strategic measures  
which support long term 
strategic objectives.
• Any STVRS payment above a 
percentage of salary 
(currently 65%) is deferred 
into shares to assist with 
retention of key executives 
and to align their interests 
with those of shareholders. 
• To encourage and reward sustained earnings 
performance in line with the Group’s growth 
strategy and its objective of creating long term 
shareholder value.
• To assist with retention of key executives. 
Operation 
• Award levels and 
performance measures 
(including the proportion 
relating to strategic 
measures and weightings) 
are reviewed annually to 
ensure alignment with the 
Group’s financial and long 
term strategic objectives. 
• Level of payment is 
determined by the 
Committee after the year 
end based on performance 
against targets. 
• Payments up to a certain 
percentage of base salary 
(currently 65%) are 
normally made in cash and 
the balance is deferred 
into shares under the DBP. 
The Committee has 
discretion to make the 
payment wholly in cash  
in certain circumstances 
(for example to a 
departing Director).
• DBP awards are released at 
the end of a two year deferral 
period. Awards generally 
lapse in the event of 
resignation during the 
deferral period. 
• On release, a cash amount is 
paid equivalent to the 
aggregate dividends per 
share paid during the 
deferral period. 
• A maulus provision exists  
to allow the Committee  
to adjust unvested DBP 
awards in the event of 
material misstatement, 
material failure of risk 
management or serious 
reputational damage.
• Awards comprise a Core Award and a 
Sustainability Award (equal to 20% of the 
shares in a Core Award) with vesting based on 
performance over an initial three year (core) 
period and subsequent two year 
(sustainability) period.
• Subject to performance, 50% of the Core 
Award is released after the end of year three; 
the balance of the Core Award and the 
Sustainability Award are released after the 
end of year five. 
• On vesting, the value of dividends accrued on 
vested shares from date of grant to date of 
release is delivered in additional shares  
or cash at the discretion of the Committee. 
• The Committee reviews the award levels 
annually and keeps performance targets  
under review to ensure continued alignment 
with strategy.
Maximum 
potential 
value 
• Maximum is 110%  
of base salary.
• No additional opportunity 
above the STVRS maximum.
• Maximum award level under the SEP rules is 
200% of base salary (including both the Core 
and Sustainability Awards). 
Performance 
measures 
• Targets are normally 
applied to a combination 
of Group, and where 
appropriate individual 
portfolio, financial and 
strategic measures. A 
significant proportion of 
the total award is based 
on financial measures. 
• Performance is measured 
over a one year period. 
• Payments range between 
0 to 110% of base salary 
with 55% of base salary 
payable for achievement 
of on target performance.
• No additional performance 
measures (see STVRS) but 
release is subject to 
continued employment.
Core Awards: 
• Measured over the initial three year period 
based on a stretching EPS growth target. 
• Vesting at threshold is 25% rising to a 
maximum of 100%.  
Sustainability Awards: 
• If the highest level of EPS attained in any year 
of the core performance period is achieved or 
exceeded in both years four and five, the 
Sustainability Award will vest in full (subject  
to any reduction made in respect of the core 
target not being satisfied over the core 
performance period). 
• The sustainability target will be assessed for 
year four and year five separately. 
• Vesting at threshold is 50% rising to a 
maximum of 100%. 
Vesting of Core and Sustainability Awards is 
subject to an additional test based on the 
Committee’s assessment of the quality of 
earnings (as described below).  98 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
GOVERNANCE
Performance measures
STVRS: a combination of financial and strategic measures which support the delivery of the Group’s long term strategic objectives. 
Appropriate targets are set each year which align with the specific business objectives for that year. The Committee has discretion to alter 
targets to reflect changed circumstances such as material changes in accounting standards or changes in the Group’s structure. The 
Committee also has discretion to reduce payments based on its assessment of underlying performance of the Group, including health and 
safety performance.
SEP: based on sustained EPS growth over the long term in line with GKN’s stated growth strategy and objective of creating long term 
shareholder value. Before any vesting can occur, the Committee must be satisfied that this is justified by the quality of earnings. This will 
involve consideration of Group return on average invested capital (ROIC) against internal projections, shareholder expectations, new 
investment performance and cost of capital to ensure that the level of vesting appropriately reflects shareholder value creation. In 
accordance with the rules of the SEP, the Committee can adjust and/or set different performance measures and targets if events occur (such 
as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions) which 
cause the Committee to determine that the measures or targets are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they 
achieve their original purpose.
 
Whilst stretching, targets under the STVRS and SEP are designed to discourage inappropriate risk taking.
 
Policy table for Chairman and non-executive Directors
Purpose and link 
to strategy 
• To provide fees within a market competitive range to recruit and retain individuals with the necessary 
experience and ability to make a substantial contribution to the Group’s affairs.
Operation 
• Fees are reviewed periodically. 
• The fee structure is: 
 – Chairman is paid a single consolidated fee. 
 – Non-executive Directors are paid a basic fee plus an additional fee for any chairmanship of Board 
Committees and for the role of Senior Independent Director. 
• Fees are paid in cash.
Maximum 
potential value 
• Set at a level which reflects the contribution and commitment required of them, taking into account fee 
levels in other companies of similar size and complexity. 
• Overall the fees paid to non-executive Directors will remain within the limit stated in the articles of 
association, currently £1 million per annum.
The Chairman and non-executive Directors do not receive benefits in kind nor do they participate in the Group’s short and long term incentive 
arrangements or in its pension scheme.

Additional information
Annual general meeting 
The annual general meeting (AGM) of the Company will be held at 
2.00 pm on Thursday, 7 May 2015 at 195 Piccadilly, London W1J 9LN. 
The notice of meeting, which includes the business to be transacted 
at the meeting, is included within the AGM circular. The circular  
also contains an explanation of all the resolutions to be considered 
at the AGM. 
Dividend 
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 5.6p per ordinary share 
in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014, payable to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 10 April 
2015. This, together with the interim dividend of 2.8p paid in 
September 2014, brings the total dividend for the year to 8.4p. 
Issued share capital 
At 31 December 2014, the issued share capital of the Company 
consisted of 1,660,529,859 ordinary shares of 10p (2013: 
1,660,529,859 shares), of which 17,797,916 shares (1.07%) were held 
in treasury (2013: 20,558,781 shares; 1.24%). During the year a total 
of 2,760,865 ordinary shares were transferred out of treasury in 
connection with the exercise of options by participants under the 
Company’s share option schemes (2013: 7,684,420 shares). 
The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. In 
addition, GKN has a sponsored Level 1 American Depositary Receipt 
(ADR) programme for which the Bank of New York Mellon acts as 
Depositary. The ADRs trade in the US over-the-counter market where 
each ADR represents one GKN ordinary share. 
Rights and obligations attaching to shares 
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends when 
declared, to receive the Company’s annual report, to attend and 
speak at general meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies and to 
exercise voting rights. 
On a show of hands at a meeting of GKN, every member present 
holding ordinary shares has one vote. On a poll taken at a meeting, 
every member present and entitled to vote has one vote in respect of 
each ordinary share held by him. In the case of joint shareholders 
only the vote of the senior joint holder who votes (and any proxy duly 
authorised by him) may be counted. Shares held in treasury carry no 
voting rights. 
GKN operates an Employee Share Option Plan Trust (the Trust) to 
satisfy the vesting and exercise of awards of ordinary shares made 
under the Group’s share-based incentive arrangements. The trustee 
of the Trust does not exercise any voting rights in respect of shares 
held by the Trust. Once the shares are transferred from the Trust to 
share scheme participants, the participants are entitled to exercise 
the voting rights attaching to those shares. A dividend waiver 
operates in respect of shares held by the Trust pursuant to the 
provisions of the Trust deed. 
Full details of the rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s 
shares are contained in the articles of association. 
Restrictions on the transfer of securities 
Whilst the Board has the power under the articles of association to 
refuse to register a transfer of shares, there are no restrictions on 
the transfer of shares. 
Under the Company’s articles, the Directors have power to suspend 
voting rights and the right to receive dividends in respect of shares 
in circumstances where the holder of those shares fails to comply 
with a notice issued under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting 
rights.

Membership of the Board and biographical details of the Directors in 
office at the date of this report are shown on page 61. All Directors 
will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the 2015 AGM in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further details 
relating to Board and Committee composition are disclosed in the 
corporate governance statement on pages 62 to 69. 
The articles of association provide that a Director may be appointed 
by an ordinary resolution of shareholders or by the existing 
Directors, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director. Further 
information on GKN’s internal procedures for the appointment of 
Directors is given in the corporate governance statement. 
The executive Directors serve under rolling contracts that are 
terminable with 12 months’ notice from the Company and 6 months’ 
notice from the executive Director. The non-executive Directors serve 
under letters of appointment and do not have service contracts with 
the Company. 
Copies of the service contracts of the executive Directors and the 
letters of appointment of the non-executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours and will be available for inspection at the  
Company’s AGM. 
The Directors’ remuneration report, which includes the Directors’ 
interests in GKN shares, is set out on pages 78 to 98.
Directors’ powers 
The Board of Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company 
subject to the provisions of relevant legislation, the Company’s 
articles of association and any directions given by the Company in 
general meeting. The powers of the Directors include those in 
relation to the issue and buyback of shares. 
At the 2014 AGM the Directors were authorised to exercise the 
powers of the Company to purchase up to 164,003,599 of its ordinary 
shares. No shares were purchased under this authority in 2014. The 
Directors were also authorised to allot shares in the Company up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £54,667,866. These authorities will 
remain valid until the 2015 AGM or 1 July 2015, if earlier. Resolutions 
to renew these authorities will be proposed at the 2015 AGM. 
Directors’ indemnities 
Pursuant to the articles of association, the Company has executed a 
deed poll of indemnity for the benefit of the Directors of the 
Company and persons who were Directors of the Company in respect 
of costs of defending claims against them and third party liabilities. 
These provisions, deemed to be qualifying third party indemnity 
provisions pursuant to section 234 of the Companies Act 2006, were 
in force during the year ended 31 December 2014 and remain in force. 
The indemnity provision in the Company’s articles of association 
also extends to provide a limited indemnity in respect of liabilities 
incurred as a director, secretary or officer of an associated company 
of the Company. 
A copy of the deed poll of indemnity is available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office during normal business hours and will 
be available for inspection at the Company’s AGM. 
The Company has also arranged appropriate insurance cover for 
legal action taken against its Directors and officers. 
Conflicts of interest 
Under the Companies Act 2006, Directors must avoid situations 
where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts or possibly may conflict with the Company’s interests. As 
permitted by the Act, the Company’s articles of association enable 
Directors to authorise actual and potential conflicts of interest. 
Formal procedures for the notification and authorisation of such 
conflicts are in place. These procedures enable non-conflicted 
Directors to impose limits or conditions when giving or reviewing 
authorisation and require the Board to review the register of 
Directors’ conflicts annually and on an ad hoc basis when necessary. 
Any potential conflicts of interest in relation to newly appointed 
Directors are considered by the Board prior to appointment. 
Articles of association 
The Company’s articles of association can only be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders. GKN’s current articles are 
available on our website at www.gkn.com.

Change of control 
As at 31 December 2014, the Company’s subsidiary, GKN Holdings 
plc, had agreements with 14 banks for 15 bilateral banking facilities 
totalling £800 million and an £80 million loan facility with the 
European Investment Bank. Each of these agreements provides that, 
on a change of control of GKN plc, the respective bank can give 
notice to GKN Holdings plc to repay all outstanding amounts under 
the relevant facility. 
The Company has in issue £450 million fixed rate notes paying 
5.375% semi-annual interest and maturing on 19 September 2022 
under a euro medium term note programme established by GKN 
Holdings plc (the Notes). Pursuant to the terms attaching to the 
Notes, a holder of the Notes has the option to require GKN Holdings 
plc to redeem or (at GKN Holdings plc’s option) purchase the holder’s 
Notes at their principal amount if there is a change of control of the 
Company and either (i) the Notes are unrated or do not carry an 
investment grade credit rating from at least two ratings agencies; or 
(ii) if the Notes carry an investment grade credit rating from at least 
two ratings agencies, the Notes are downgraded to a non-investment 
grade rating or that rating is withdrawn within 90 days of the change 
of control and such downgrade or withdrawal is cited by the ratings 
agencies as being the result of the change of control. 
Companies in the Group’s Aerospace division are party to long term 
supply contracts with customers which are original equipment 
manufacturers of aircraft and aero engines. Certain of these 
contracts contain provisions which would entitle the customer to 
terminate the contract in the event of a change of control of the 
Company, where such change of control conflicts with the interests 
to the customer. 
Companies in the Group’s Driveline division are party to supply 
contracts with customers which are original equipment 
manufacturers of motor vehicles. Certain of these contracts contain 
provisions which would entitle the customer to terminate the 
contract in the event of a change of control of the Company. 
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a 
change of control. Outstanding options and awards normally vest 
and become exercisable on a change of control subject to the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.
In line with best practice and the Company’s policy for future service 
contracts of executive Directors, the service contract entered into 
with Adam Walker does not include any provision for the payment of 
a predetermined amount on a change of control of the Company. The 
service contracts of the other executive Directors in office at the 
date of this report were amended on 19 February 2014 to remove the 
change of control provision. 
Payments to suppliers 
It is Group policy to abide by the payment terms agreed with 
suppliers, provided that the supplier has performed its obligations 
under the contract. In support of this policy, the Company is a 
signatory to the UK Government’s Prompt Payment Code. 
Branches 
GKN, through various subsidiaries, has established branches in a 
number of different countries in which the business operates. 
Donations 
In 2014, charitable donations made by Group companies  
around the world totalled £739,000 of which £175,000 was  
to UK registered charities.
 
In accordance with the Group’s policy, no political donations were 
made and no political expenditure was incurred during 2014. 
The Group’s US Aerospace business has a Political Action Committee 
(PAC) which is funded entirely by employees and their spouses. No 
funds are provided to the PAC by GKN and any administrative 
services provided to the PAC by the US Aerospace business are fully 
charged to and paid for by the PAC, and the Company does not 
therefore consider these to be political donations. Employee 
contributions are entirely voluntary and no pressure is placed on 
employees to participate. Under US law, an employee-funded PAC 
must bear the name of the employing company. 
Research and development
Group subsidiaries undertake research and development work in 
support of their principal manufacturing activities. Further details of 
the Group’s research and development activities can be found 
throughout the strategic report. 
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s use of financial instruments can be found in 
Note 19 to the financial statements. 
Strategic report
Pursuant to section 414C of the Companies Act 2006 the strategic 
report contains details in relation to the likely future developments 
of the business of the Group and the disclosure of greenhouse gas 
emissions for which the Company is responsible. 
Auditors and disclosure of information
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of 
the Company and to authorise the Directors to determine their 
remuneration will be proposed at the 2015 AGM. 
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ report confirms that, so far as he/she is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

GOVERNANCE
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom (UK) Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Company 
financial statements the Directors are required to:
• select appropriate accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the 
Company’s transactions, disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company, and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors as at the date of the annual report, whose names and functions are set out on pages 60 and 61, confirm that to the best 
of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face.
In addition, the Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach
Overview
Audit scope
Area of 
focus
Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £22 million which represents 5% of profit before tax, 
adjusted for the change in fair value of derivative and other financial instruments.
• Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to the Group 
financial statements we performed full scope audits in 56 reporting units and 
specified procedures in a further 24 reporting units.
• In addition, certain centralised functions and reporting units, including those 
covering post-employment obligations, derivative financial instruments, taxation, 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments, and the Company were 
subject to full scope audit procedures.
• The components on which full scope audits, specified procedures and centralised 
work was performed accounted for approximately 89% of Group revenue.
• As part of our supervision process, the Group engagement team visited 
component auditors in the USA, Germany, India, Sweden and China, as well as 
being responsible for all UK reporting locations performing full scope audits.
Our assessment of the risk of material misstatement also informed our views on the 
areas of particular focus for our work which are listed below:
• Assessment of the carrying value of the intangible and tangible assets relating to 
the A350 programme at Western Approach.
• Risk of fraud in revenue recognition.
• Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other relevant assets.
• Assessment of the accounting position adopted on complex  
contractual obligations.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in  
order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be 
read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Assessment of the carrying value of the intangible and 
tangible assets relating to the A350 programme at 
Western Approach
Refer to pages 44 to 51 (Principal risks and uncertainties), pages 
73 to 74 (Audit committee report), note 1 (Accounting policies and 
presentation), note 11 (Goodwill and other intangible assets) and 
note 12 (Property, plant and equipment).
We focused on this area because the Directors’ assessment of the 
recoverability of this programme’s intangible assets of £120 million 
and tangible assets of £89 million, inclusive of £15 million of 
capitalised borrowing costs, involve complex and subjective 
judgements and assumptions about the progress and future 
results of this programme. The key judgements and assumptions 
made by the Directors included the discount rate and the key 
business drivers of the cash flow forecasts, being the number of 
aircraft sets to be produced, production and assembly hours, 
material costs, programme timings which include potential delays 
and the effects of foreign exchange rates.
We obtained and understood the Directors’ impairment model 
and tested it for mathematical accuracy, and found that it 
followed an acceptable methodology and was consistent with 
prior periods.
We challenged the Directors on the discount rate used by 
comparing this to the cost of capital for the Group and a selection 
of comparable organisations.
We also challenged the Directors’ impairment model around the 
key business drivers of the cash flow forecasts supporting their 
recoverability assessment. A range of sensitivities were 
performed across the different elements of the impairment model 
in order to understand which judgements and assumptions were 
most sensitive in achieving the Directors’ recoverability 
assessment. The most sensitive and judgemental elements are 
detailed below: 
• for production and assembly hours, we considered the 
Directors’ expectations for achieving targeted learning curve 
improvements and hence reducing the total hours per aircraft 
set. We challenged the Directors on the historical achievement 
of learning curve improvement targets on the A350 
programme. We also considered how this was balanced 
against the expected increase in production rates over future 
years and the implicit challenges that this will bring to 
achieving the required hours improvements.
• for the number of aircraft sets, we considered the Directors’ 
expectations for the number and timing of sets to be produced 
and compared this to current industry expectations, past 
schedules and the latest reported order book from Airbus.
Based on our audit work, the planned levels of production and 
assembly hour improvements appear achievable, although not 
without challenge, and the total number of aircraft sets expected 
to be produced is consistent with current market expectations 
and production schedules. 
As a result of this, we found that the Directors’ assessment of the 
carrying value of intangible and tangible assets relating to the 
A350 programme at Western Approach to be supportable. 
However, we consider that a failure to meet target production and 
assembly hour rates as the supply to Airbus increases, or a 
significant change in the total number of aircraft sets to be 
produced could reasonably be expected to give rise to an 
impairment charge in the future.

Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
Refer to pages 44 to 51 (Principal risks and uncertainties),  
pages 73 to 74 (Audit committee report), note 1 (Accounting 
policies and presentation) and note 2 (Segmental analysis).
We focused on this area because the Group has a number of 
complex revenue recognition policies, which require the Directors 
to exercise judgement and therefore revenue could be subject to 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. This specifically 
includes judgement over whether revenue has been earned, can 
be recognised and the subsequent value at which to recognise 
this revenue.
These complexities and judgements include, but are not  
limited to:
• revenue risk sharing partnerships (RRSPs) in Aerospace where 
GKN are entitled to a set percentage of revenue per completed 
aircraft as contractually agreed with the programme partner, 
which requires the Directors to exercise judgement as to how 
much revenue to recognise reflecting the differences in pricing 
of Original Engine Manufacturer parts and spare parts at the 
year-end;
• pricing of non-contractually agreed elements of revenue, 
including rebates and ongoing pricing discussions, which 
requires a level of judgement to be applied by the Directors 
over how much revenue to recognise; and
• bill and hold arrangements in Aerospace whereby the 
recognition of revenue is based on meeting specific criteria 
which can be subject to judgement by the Directors.
In addition, we also focused on this area because the GKN Short 
Term Variable Remuneration Scheme (STVRS) of the Directors and 
senior management is significantly driven by financial measures 
including revenue recognition, which we concluded gave a greater 
risk of manipulation of judgements around revenue recognition to 
ensure that STVRS targets are achieved.
For each area of complexity identified, we challenged the amount 
of revenue recognised by the Directors to ensure that it was in line 
with IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and the contractual agreement, or latest 
formal correspondence with the customer. In particular:
• For RRSPs we agreed the percentage of revenue entitlement  
to the customer contract, agreed the revenue recognised to 
supporting correspondence from the customer and challenged 
the Directors on the level of revenue recognised where 
estimates were used at the year-end date. Specifically, 
ensuring the reasonableness of the estimate through 
agreement to post year-end confirmations received by the 
Directors from customers.
• When revenue was recognised based on non-contractually 
agreed terms, we challenged the Directors on the level of 
revenue recognised by taking into account the historical level 
of agreement reached with customers on similar programmes 
and agreed the revenue recognised to either post year-end 
cash settlements or communications with the customer.
• For bill and hold arrangements we challenged the Directors  
on the state of completion of the products that had been sold 
by inspecting the product and assessing the level of required 
labour hours needed to complete the product in line with the 
agreed specification. We agreed the acceptance of the risks 
and rewards of ownership and confirmed the overall bill and 
hold arrangement was at the request of the customer by 
verifying this to confirmations with the customer.
In addition to the specific items noted above, we also responded 
to the risk that manual adjustments could override standard 
controls and processes to misstate revenue by testing a sample  
of manual journals relating to revenue so as to identify unusual  
or irregular items. We agreed the manual journals tested to 
corroborative evidence and found no instances of manipulation  
of revenue occurring in this way.
Based on the results of our audit work, we found that the revenue 
recognised by the Directors agreed to the relevant contractual 
terms, was at an appropriate value and was consistent with the 
requirements of IAS 18. However we did note that contracts with 
customers are becoming ever more complex and unique and we 
have therefore recommended that the Directors continue to give 
sufficient consideration to the revenue being recognised. 106 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other 
relevant assets
Refer to page 38 (Business review), pages 44 to 51 (Principal risks 
and uncertainties), pages 73 to 74 (Audit committee report),  
note 1 (Accounting policies and presentation) and note 11 
(Goodwill and other intangible assets).
We focused on this area because the Directors’ assessment 
of whether or not certain elements of goodwill and other 
intangible assets were impaired, and the level of impairment to 
be booked if applicable, involved complex and subjective 
judgements and assumptions about the progress and future 
results of the Group’s Cash-Generating Units (CGUs).
In particular, we focused on the carrying values of material CGUs 
for Aerospace Engine Products in North America (£38 million  
of goodwill and £54 million of other assets) and Land Systems 
Wheels and Structures Europe (£18 million of goodwill and  
£24 million of other assets).
The Directors have recorded total impairment charges of  
£69 million relating to the Aerospace Engine Products CGU  
(£33 million), the Land Systems Wheels and Structures Europe CGU 
(£26 million) and other impairment charges totalling £10 million.
At 31 December 2014 the carrying value of goodwill and intangible 
assets in respect of the Group’s remaining CGUs totalled  
£498 million and £944 million respectively. No impairment 
triggers had been identified by the Directors in respect of the 
remaining CGUs and/or their impairment models determined  
that adequate headroom existed not to result in the need for  
an impairment charge in reasonably possible scenarios.
We understood and challenged the Directors’ impairment models 
around the key business drivers of the cash flow forecasts 
supporting their recoverability assessments, being pricing, 
market performance and expected growth, the level of  
new business wins, the margin growth capabilities and  
capital expenditure requirements. We also evaluated the 
appropriateness of the key assumptions including the discount 
rate and long term growth rate used.
For the Aerospace Engine Products CGU, where the Directors 
recognised an impairment charge of £33 million, we were able  
to evaluate the reasonableness of the Directors’ forecast by 
challenging their assumptions regarding the amount of future 
revenue by agreeing this to contractual terms and challenging the 
margin expected to be achieved by reference to historical margin 
and margin improvement programmes. We also challenged the 
level of maintenance capital expenditure required to deliver 
current programmes as well as to be able to deliver new business 
wins within the current capacity and challenged the margin to be 
achieved in respect of new programmes by reference to historic 
margins achieved. 
In the Land Systems Wheels and Structures Europe CGU, where 
the Directors recognised an impairment charge of £26 million,  
the key assumption we focused on was the amount of growth 
expected to be achieved in both revenue and operating margin. 
Factors we considered were the forecast economic growth in the 
region compared to independent industry forecasts and customer 
data within Europe, combined with the capacity and operating 
capabilities within the CGU which we compared to historical levels.
We also challenged the Directors on the discount rate used by 
comparing this to the cost of capital for the Group and a selection 
of comparable organisations, agreeing any differences identified 
to supporting evidence. The Directors’ key assumptions for long 
term growth rates were also compared to economic and industry 
forecasts for reasonableness and were considered appropriate.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions 
above to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions 
that either individually or collectively would be required for  
the impairment charge to be significantly different to those 
amounts recognised. We also considered the likelihood of such 
changes occurring.
For both Aerospace Engine Products and Land Systems Wheels 
and Structures Europe we found that the planned level of future 
growth in revenue and operating margin reflected performance 
levels below those historically achieved. 
As a result of our audit work, we determined that the impairment 
charges for the Aerospace Engine Products and Land Systems 
Wheels and Structures Europe CGUs were conservative although 
within a range of potential likely outcomes based on the current 
plans which reflect the Directors’ best estimate of the value in 
use of the CGUs.

Governance Financial Statements
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
In addition, based on our audit work, in respect of the remaining 
CGUs, the Directors’ assessment that no impairment charge 
currently needed to be recognised was supportable. However, the 
models are sensitive to growth and margin improvement targets 
which, if not achieved, could reasonably be expected to give rise 
to further impairment charges in the future.
Assessment of the accounting position adopted on 
complex contractual obligations
Refer to pages 25 and 29 (Business review), pages 44 to 51 
(Principal risks and uncertainties), pages 73 to 74 (Audit 
committee report), note 1 (Accounting policies and presentation), 
note 2 (Segmental analysis) and note 21 (Provisions).
The Group continues to work closely with its customers and 
suppliers to resolve contractual and other claims and disputes. 
These matters are principally in respect of warranty, delivery 
performance, pricing and contract variations.
We focused on this area because the Directors are required to 
perform an assessment in line with relevant accounting standards 
and consider each item individually. The determination of 
whether to recognise a liability or not, or make disclosure in the 
financial statements, for claims received, onerous contracts or 
recognise an asset for potential recoveries, requires the Directors 
to exercise considerable judgement.
In addition, given the wide ranging geographical and market 
spread of the Group, there is also complexity in ensuring the 
Directors have considered all known disputes, claims and 
potential recoveries.
We tested, on a sample basis, the valuation and calculation of 
individual liabilities or assets that made up the total, including in 
respect of onerous contracts, claims for contract breaches, late 
deliveries, product quality, warranty, non-contractually agreed 
pricing and cost recoveries. In particular:
• for liabilities recognised, we challenged the Directors on 
ensuring the assessment and calculation of any provision  
was consistent with the requirements of IAS 37 ‘Provisions, 
contingent liabilities and contingent assets’ and that all 
potential outcomes had been considered and appropriately 
disclosed in the financial statements;
• for assets recognised, we challenged the Directors on their 
assessment of the recognition criteria and that the assets were 
virtually certain to be recovered; and
• where liabilities and assets related to the same customer or 
supplier, we challenged the Directors to ensure that all items 
had been individually considered and were not presented on a 
net basis.
We assessed the completeness of the Directors’ list of claims, 
disputes, onerous contracts and potential recoveries using our 
knowledge of the business, enquiries of the Directors, examining 
post year-end correspondence with customers and suppliers and 
assessing the Directors’ material litigation process.
We found no material exceptions from the procedures noted 
above. We consider the Directors’ recognition of liabilities and 
assets to be reasonable and within an acceptable range of 
potentially likely outcomes and consistent with the requirements 
of IAS 37.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates.
The Group is structured along four segments being Aerospace, Driveline, Powder Metallurgy and Land Systems with each division set up to 
manage operations on both a regional and functional basis and consisting of a number of reporting units.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 237 active reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses and 
centralised functions. These reporting units maintain their own accounting records and controls and report to the head office finance team in 
the UK through an integrated consolidation system.
Aerospace reporting units are based predominantly in the UK, USA and Sweden. Driveline reporting units are based in 22 countries with 
Europe and North America being the largest regions. Powder Metallurgy reporting units are based predominantly in North America with other 
sites in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Land Systems reporting units are based predominantly in Europe and North America.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at each reporting unit 
and we used component auditors within PwC UK and from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction, who are familiar with the 
local laws and regulations in each of these territories to perform this audit work. 108 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accordingly, of the Group’s 237 active reporting units, we identified 56 which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial 
information, whether due to their significance and/or risk characteristics. These reporting units accounted for 73% of  
Group revenue.
Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were performed at a further 24 reporting units with due consideration paid to 
obtaining global coverage on a rotational basis. The reporting units on which these specific procedures were performed accounted for a 
further 16% of Group revenue.
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those 
reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements as a whole.
The Group engagement team visits component auditors based on significance and/or risk characteristics, as well as on a rotational basis to 
ensure coverage across the Group. In the current year, the Group engagement team visited component auditors in the USA, Germany, India, 
Sweden and China, as well as being responsible for all UK reporting locations performing full scope audits. Additionally the Group audit team 
was in contact, at each stage of the audit, with a number of other component auditors, which included meeting local GKN management, 
attendance at audit planning meetings, attendance at audit close meetings and review of audit working papers.
The Group consolidation, financial statements disclosures and a number of centralised reporting units were audited by the Group 
engagement team at the head office. These included, but were not limited to, central procedures on post-employment obligations, derivative 
financial instruments, taxation, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments. We also performed group level analytical 
procedures on all of the remaining out of scope active reporting units to identify whether any further audit evidence was needed, which 
resulted in no extra testing being required. The Company was also subject to a full scope audit.
Taken together, the reporting units and group functions where we performed audit procedures accounted for approximately 89% of Group 
revenue. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and 
to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, and consistent with the prior year, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole 
as follows:
Overall Group materiality
£22 million (2013: £23 million).
How we determined it
5% of profit before tax, adjusted for the change in fair value of derivative and other financial 
instruments and as disclosed on the face of the consolidated income statement.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
We believe that profit before tax adjusted for the change in fair value of derivative and other 
financial instruments provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining 
materiality as it eliminates the fluctuating nature of these items which can have a 
disproportionate impact on the Group’s consolidated income statement.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1 million (2013: £1 million) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Governance Financial Statements
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 41, in relation to going concern. We have nothing 
to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded 
that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of 
the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility.
• the statement given by the Directors on page 68, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as  
a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility.
• the section of the Annual Report on pages 73 to 77, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with 
ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 110 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 102, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and  
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming  
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures 
or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of GKN plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 and on the information in 
the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies and presentation
The Group's significant accounting policies are summarised below.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (the “statements”) have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as endorsed and adopted for use by the European 
Union. These statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost method except where other measurement bases are required to 
be applied under IFRS as set out below.
These statements have been prepared using all standards and 
interpretations required for financial periods beginning 1 January 
2014. No standards or interpretations have been adopted before the 
required implementation date. 
Standards, revisions and amendments to standards  
and interpretations
The Group adopted all applicable amendments to standards with an 
effective date in 2014, including IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, with no 
material impact on its results, assets and liabilities. All other 
accounting policies have been applied consistently.
Basis of consolidation
The statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company 
and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”) and the Group's share of 
the results and equity of its joint ventures and associates.
Subsidiaries are entities over which, either directly or indirectly, the 
Company has control through the power to govern financial and 
operating policies so as to obtain benefit from their activities. This 
power is accompanied by a shareholding of more than 50% of the 
voting rights. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the 
year are included in the Group’s results from the date of acquisition 
or up to the date of disposal. All business combinations are 
accounted for by the purchase method. Assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are 
measured at fair value.
Intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses  
are eliminated.
Other non-controlling interests represent the portion of 
shareholders’ earnings and equity attributable to third  
party shareholders.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has a long term 
interest and exercises joint control with its partners over their 
financial and operating policies. In all cases voting rights are 50%  
or lower. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by the 
equity method. The Group’s share of equity includes goodwill  
arising on acquisition.
Foreign currencies
Subsidiaries and joint ventures account in the currency of their 
primary economic environment of operation, determined having 
regard to the currency which mainly influences sales and input 
costs. Transactions are translated at exchange rates approximating 
to the rate ruling on the date of the transaction except in the case of 
material transactions when actual spot rate may be used where it 
more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the 
transaction. Where practicable, transactions involving foreign 
currencies are protected by forward contracts. Assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange 
rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Such transactional exchange 
differences are taken into account in determining profit before tax.
Material foreign currency movements arising on the translation of 
intra-group balances treated as part of the net investment in a 
subsidiary are recognised through equity. Movements on other 
intra-group balances are recognised through the income statement.
The Group’s presentational currency is sterling. On consolidation, 
results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are 
translated to sterling at average exchange rates except in the case of 
material transactions when the actual spot rate is used where it 
more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the 
transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange 
rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Such translational exchange 
differences are taken to equity.
Profits and losses on the realisation of foreign currency net 
investments include the accumulated net exchange differences that 
have arisen on the retranslation of the foreign currency net 
investments since 1 January 2004 up to the date of realisation.
Presentation of the income statement
IFRS is not fully prescriptive as to the format of the income 
statement. Line items and subtotals have been presented on the 
face of the income statement in addition to those required 
under IFRS.
Sales shown in the income statement are those of subsidiaries.
Operating profit is profit before discontinued operations, taxation, 
finance costs and the share of post-tax earnings of joint ventures 
accounted for using the equity method. In order to achieve 
consistency and comparability between reporting periods, operating 
profit is analysed to show separately the results of normal trading 
performance and individually significant charges and credits. Such 
items arise because of their size or nature and comprise:
• the impact of the annual goodwill impairment review;
• asset impairment and restructuring charges which arise from 
events that are significant to any reportable segment;
• amortisation of the fair value of non-operating intangible assets 
arising on business combinations;
• changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments  
and material currency translation movements arising on  
intra-group funding;
• gains or losses on changes in Group structure which do not meet 
the definition of discontinued operations or which the Group 
views as capital rather than revenue in nature; 
• profits or losses arising from business combinations including 
fair value adjustments to pre-combination shareholdings, 
changes in estimates of contingent consideration made after the 
provisional fair value period and material expenses and charges 
incurred on a business combination; and
• significant pension scheme curtailments and settlements.
The Group’s post-tax share of joint venture earnings is shown as a 
separate component of profit before tax. The Group’s share of 
material restructuring and impairment charges, amortisation of the 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2014 Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
117 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
fair value of non-operating intangible assets arising on business 
combinations and other net financing charges and their related 
taxation are separately identified, in the related note.
Net financing costs are analysed to show separately interest 
payable, interest receivable and other net financing charges. Other 
net financing charges include the interest charge on net defined 
benefit plans, specific changes in fair value on cash flow hedges  
and unwind of discounts on fair value amounts established on 
business combinations. 
Revenue recognition
Sales
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration receivable which generally equates to the invoiced 
amount, excluding sales taxes and net of allowances for returns, 
early settlement discounts and rebates.
Invoices for goods are raised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership have passed which, dependent upon contractual terms, 
may be at the point of despatch, acceptance by the customer or, in 
Aerospace, certification by the customer. Sales of services under 
risk and revenue sharing partnerships are recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion based on services performed to date. The 
assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of 
the contract, but will generally be based on: costs incurred to the 
extent these relate to services performed up to the reporting date; 
achievement of contractual milestones where appropriate; or flying 
hours or equivalent for long term aftermarket arrangements. 
Many businesses in Automotive and Land Systems recognise an 
element of revenue via a surcharge or similar raw material cost 
recovery mechanism. The surcharge invoiced or credited is generally 
based on prior period movement in raw material price indices 
applied to current period deliveries. Other cost recoveries are 
recorded according to the customer agreement. In those instances 
where recovery of such increases is guaranteed, irrespective of the 
level of future deliveries, revenue is recognised, or due allowance 
made, in the same period as the cost movement takes place.
Other income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate 
method. 
Sales and other income is recognised in the income statement  
when it can be reliably measured and its collectability is  
reasonably assured.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment charges.
Cost
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in 
bringing the asset into use and borrowing costs on qualifying assets. 
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at 
valuation on 23 March 2000, these values have been retained as book 
values and therefore deemed cost at the date of the IFRS transition.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet 
date they are classified as capital work in progress. Transfers are 
made to other asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or capital work in 
progress. In the case of all other categories of property, plant and 
equipment, depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the 
course of the financial year from the date the asset is available for use.
Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce 
them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, which 
are reviewed annually.
The range of depreciation lives are:
Years

Property, plant and equipment is reviewed at least annually for 
indications of impairment. Impairments are charged to the income 
statement. Similarly, where property, plant and equipment has been 
impaired and subsequent reviews demonstrate the recoverable value 
is in excess of the impaired value an impairment reversal is recorded. 
The amount of the reversal cannot exceed the theoretical net book 
amount at the date of the reversal had the item not been impaired. 
Impairment reversals are credited to the income statement against the 
same line item to which the impairment was previously charged. 
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised as cost on qualifying tangible and 
intangible fixed asset expenditure. A qualifying asset is an asset or 
programme where the period of capitalisation is more than 
12 months and the capital value is more than £25 million. For general 
borrowings the capitalisation rate is the weighted average of the 
borrowing costs outstanding during the year. For specific funding 
and borrowings the amount capitalised is the actual borrowing cost 
incurred less any investment income on the temporary investment of 
those borrowings. 
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial liabilities are recorded in arrangements where  
payments, or similar transfers of financial resources, are 
unavoidable or guaranteed. 
Borrowings are measured initially at fair value which usually equates 
to proceeds received and includes transaction costs. Borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand 
deposits, and overdrafts together with highly liquid investments of 
less than 90 days maturity. Other financial assets comprise 
investments with more than 90 days until maturity. Unless an 
enforceable right of set-off exists and there is an intention to net 
settle, the components of cash and cash equivalents are reflected 
on a gross basis in the balance sheet.
Other financial assets and liabilities, including short term 
receivables and payables, are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment 
provision unless the impact of the time value of money is considered 
to be material. 118 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Derivative financial instruments
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. 
Derivative financial instruments including forward foreign currency 
contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are used by the 
Group to manage its exposure to risk associated with the variability 
in cash flows in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities or 
forecast transactions. All derivative financial instruments are 
measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value.
Where derivative financial instruments are not designated as or not 
determined to be effective hedges, any gain or loss on 
remeasurement is taken to the income statement. Where derivative 
financial instruments are designated as and are effective as cash 
flow hedges, any gain or loss on remeasurement is held in equity 
and recycled through the income statement when the designated 
item is transacted, unless related to the purchase of a business, 
when recycled against consideration.
Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments no longer 
designated as effective hedges are taken directly to the  
income statement.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised 
at their fair value when the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
derivative are not closely related to the host contract. Gains and losses 
arising on the remeasurement of these embedded derivatives at each 
balance sheet date are taken to the income statement.
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at 
fair value and subsequently at the amount of the obligation under 
the contract.
Goodwill
Goodwill consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration 
over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets 
net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of 
businesses acquired at the date of acquisition. Acquisition related 
expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is 
recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of a joint venture is included in the carrying value of 
the investment.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested at least annually for 
impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised 
impairment losses that arise from the annual assessment of its 
carrying value. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the 
recoverable amount, determined as the higher of estimated 
discounted future net cash flows or recoverable amount on a fair 
value less cost of disposal basis, goodwill is written down to the 
recoverable amount and an impairment charge is recognised in the 
income statement.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment charges.
Computer software
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant 
or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible 
assets. Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly 
incurred in bringing the asset into use. Amortisation is provided on a 
straight line basis over its useful economic life which is in the range 
of 3-5 years.
Development costs and participation fees
Where development expenditure results in a new or substantially 
improved product or process and it is probable that this expenditure 
will be recovered, it is capitalised. Cost comprises development 
expenditure and borrowing costs on qualifying assets or fair value 
on initial recognition when as a result of a business combination. In 
addition, payments made to engine manufacturers and original 
equipment manufacturers for participation fees relating to risk and 
revenue sharing partnerships and long term agreements, are carried 
forward in intangible assets to the extent that they can be recovered 
from future sales.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use. 
In Aerospace, amortisation is charged over the asset’s life up to a 
maximum of 15 years for all programmes other than risk and revenue 
sharing partnerships where a maximum life of 25 years is assumed, 
either on a straight line basis or, where sufficient contractual terms 
exist, a unit of production method is applied. In Automotive, 
amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the asset’s life 
up to a maximum of 7 years.
Capitalised development costs, including participation fees, are 
subject to annual impairment reviews with any resulting 
impairments charged to the income statement.
Research expenditure and development expenditure not qualifying 
for capitalisation is written off as incurred.
Assets acquired on business combinations – 
non-operating intangible assets
Non-operating intangible assets are intangible assets that are 
acquired as a result of a business combination, which arise from 
contractual or other legal rights and are not transferable or 
separable. On initial recognition they are measured at fair value. 
Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to the income 
statement over their expected useful lives which are:
Years
Marketing related assets
 – brands and trademarks
 – agreements not to compete
20-50
Life of agreement
Customer related assets
 – order backlog
 – other customer contracts and relationships
Length of backlog
2-25
Technology based assets 5-25

Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net 
realisable value with due allowance being made for obsolete or 
slow-moving items. Cost is determined on a first in, first out or 
weighted average cost basis. Cost includes raw materials, direct 
labour, other direct costs and the relevant proportion of works 
overheads assuming normal levels of activity. Net realisable value 
is the estimated selling price less estimated selling costs and costs 
to complete.
Taxation
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement 
unless they relate to items recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income when the related tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income.
Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary differences 
resulting from the difference between the carrying value of an asset 
or liability in the consolidated financial statements and its tax base. 
The amount of deferred tax reflects the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and 
liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are 
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be 
recovered against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of joint 
ventures. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of 
overseas branches and subsidiaries except to the extent that it is 
probable that such earnings will be remitted to the parent in the 
foreseeable future.
Pensions and post-employment benefits
The Group’s pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit 
and defined contribution schemes throughout the world. In the UK 
and in certain overseas companies pension arrangements are made 
through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the 
contributions to which are based on the advice of independent 
actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes. In other 
overseas companies funds are retained within the business to 
provide for retirement obligations.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution and 
defined benefit arrangements which provide certain employees with 
defined post-employment healthcare benefits.
The Group accounts for all post-employment defined benefit 
schemes through recognition of the schemes’ surpluses or deficits 
on the balance sheet at the end of each year. Remeasurement of 
defined benefit plans is included in other comprehensive income. 
Current and past service costs, curtailments and settlements are 
recognised within operating profit. Interest charges on net defined 
benefit plans are recognised in other net financing charges.
For defined contribution arrangements the cost charged to the 
income statement represents the Group’s contributions to the 
relevant schemes in the year in which they fall due.
Government refundable advances
Government refundable advances are reported in Trade and other 
payables in the balance sheet. Refundable advances include 
amounts advanced by Government, accrued interest and directly 
attributable costs. Refundable advances are provided to the Group 
to part-finance expenditures on specific development programmes. 
The advances are provided on a risk sharing basis, i.e. repayment 
levels are determined subject to the success of the related 
programme. Interest is calculated using the effective interest 
rate method.
Share-based payments
Share options granted to employees and share-based arrangements 
put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or 
award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to 
operating profit over the performance or vesting period of the 
scheme. The annual charge is modified to take account of shares 
forfeited by employees who leave during the performance or vesting 
period and, in the case of non-market related performance 
conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
Provisions
Provisions for onerous or loss making contracts, warranty 
exposures, environmental matters, restructuring, employee 
obligations and legal claims are recognised when: the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it 
is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. Restructuring 
provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee 
termination payments. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. Any increase 
in provisions due to discounting, only recorded where material, is 
recognised as interest expense within other net financing charges.
Standards, revisions and amendments to standards and 
interpretations issued but not yet adopted
The Group does not intend to adopt any standard, revision or 
amendment before the required implementation date. At the date of 
authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards 
which have not been applied in these financial statements were in 
issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2018); and
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (effective from 
1 January 2017).
These standards and other revisions to standards and 
interpretations which have an implementation date in 2015 or 
thereafter are still being assessed. 120 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies and presentation continued
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out above. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the 
use of estimates, subjective judgement and assumptions that may affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and 
reported profit and earnings for the year. The Directors base these estimates, judgements and assumptions on a combination of past 
experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The accounting policies where the Directors consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions have to be made are those 
in respect of post-employment obligations (note 24), derivative and other financial instruments (notes 4b and 20), taxation (note 6), 
provisions (note 21) and impairment of non-current assets (note 11). Details of the principal estimates, judgements and assumptions made 
are set out in the related notes as identified.
2 Segmental analysis
The Group’s reportable segments have been determined based on reports reviewed by the Executive Committee led by the Chief Executive. 
The operating activities of the Group are largely structured according to the markets served; aerospace, automotive and the land systems 
markets. Automotive is managed according to product groups; driveline and powder metallurgy. Reportable segments derive their sales from 
the manufacture of products and sale of service. Revenue from inter segment trading and royalties is not significant.

IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be valued at the balance sheet date and any difference between that value and the 
intrinsic value of the instrument to be reflected in the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Any subsequent change in value is reflected in 
the income statement unless hedge accounting is achieved. Such movements do not affect cash flow or the economic substance of the 
underlying transaction. In 2014 and 2013 the Group used transactional hedge accounting in a limited number of instances.

On 31 July 2014, the Group sold its 50% share in Emitec, a joint venture company, for cash consideration of £37 million. The carrying value on 
the date of disposal was £14 million and £1 million of previous currency variations were reclassified from other reserves resulting in a profit 
on sale of £24 million.
On 7 November 2013, the Group sold its controlling interest in GKN Driveline Torque Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (TSH) to Shanghai GKN 
HUAYU Driveline Systems Co Limited (SDS), a joint venture company. The transaction took the Group’s ownership in TSH from 100% to 50%. 
The profit on sale of £9 million, comprised the fair value of consideration received (increased equity interest in SDS of £15 million) less the 
previous carrying value of TSH of £6 million. TSH had a net overdraft of £2 million on the date of disposal.
On 24 December 2013, the Group sold its 49% share in a joint venture company, Composite Technology and Applications Ltd for cash 
consideration of £3 million. The carrying value on the date of disposal was nil, resulting in a profit on sale of £3 million.

Management tax rate
The tax charge arising on management profits of subsidiaries of £539 million (2013: £524 million) was £121 million (2013: £105 million charge) 
giving an effective tax rate of 22% (2013: 20%). Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions 
affecting this are given in the business review.
Significant judgements and estimates
The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude. 
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions which require estimates for each matter and the exercise 
of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic tax positions. Where appropriate, 
estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions. As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax 
liabilities, subsequent adjustments which have a material impact on the Group’s tax rate and/or cash tax payments may arise. Tax payments 
comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items and, as a result, there can be substantial differences 
between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments. Where companies utilise brought forward tax losses such that little or 
no tax is paid, this also results in differences between the tax charge and cash tax payments. With regard to deferred tax, judgement is 
required for the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is based on expectations of future financial performance in particular legal entities 
or tax groups.

Deferred tax assets are recognised where management projections indicate the future availability of taxable profits to absorb the deductions.
‘Other’ deferred tax arises mainly in relation to items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period than the income or expense is 
accrued in the accounts.
(e) Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Certain deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the basis that the Group’s ability to utilise them is uncertain as shown below.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where the distribution of such profits is planned. If 
these earnings were remitted in full, tax of £16 million (2013: £14 million) would be payable.
(f) Changes in UK tax rate
A reduction in the mainstream rate of UK corporation tax from 23% to 21% took effect from April 2014 which gives rise to an effective rate of 
21.5% for the year. A further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015 has been substantively enacted. UK temporary differences are measured at 
the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
(g) Franked investment income – litigation
Since 2003, the Group has been involved in litigation with HMRC in respect of various advance corporate tax payments and corporate tax 
paid on certain foreign dividends which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of the Group’s EU community law rights. The most recent 
High Court judgement in the case was published in December 2014. Although the judgement was broadly positive, it is anticipated that 
HMRC will appeal at least some of the technical points decided.
GKN have historically received payments from HMRC in respect of the case, which have been recognised as received. The continuing 
complexity of the case and uncertainty over the issues raised (and in particular which points HMRC may seek to appeal) means that it is not 
possible to predict the final outcome of the litigation with any reasonable degree of certainty.

earnings per share using the cash tax rate which is discussed on page 39 of the Strategic Report. Management EPS using the cash tax rate  
is 32.1p (2013: 31.9p). A total of £267,158 in dividends was received by key management in 2014 (2013: £227,000).
10 Share-based payments 
The Group has granted options over shares to employees for a number of years under different schemes. Where grants were made after 
7 November 2002 they have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”. Awards made before that date have not been 
so accounted. Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 that impact the 2014 accounting charge are: 
Sustainable Earnings Plan (SEP)
Awards comprising Core and Sustainability Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in August 2012, March 2013 and 
March 2014. Core and Sustainability Awards are subject to performance targets with Core Awards subject to achievement of EPS growth 
targets over an initial three year performance period and Sustainability Awards subject to the highest level of EPS attained in any year during 
the core performance period being achieved or exceeded in years four and five. Sustainability Awards will be reduced to the extent that the 
target in the core performance period has not been met. Sustainability Awards are measured independently in years four and five. 50% of 
Core Awards will be released at the end of year three; the balance of Core Awards and any Sustainability Awards will be released at the end of 
year five. There is no provision for retesting performance for either the Core or Sustainability Awards. On vesting, dividends are treated as 
having accrued on the shares from the date of grant to the date of release with the value delivered in either shares or cash.

An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit (CGU) to their recoverable 
amount. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results. For the purposes of carrying out impairment 
tests, the Group’s total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested. 
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment. In some cases, a CGU is an individual subsidiary 
or operation.

Consistent with previous years all goodwill was tested for impairment. An impairment charge of £69 million has been recorded in  
respect of 3 CGUs; 2 in Aerospace and 1 in Land Systems of £65 million and the carrying value of an investment balance of £4 million in  
Other Businesses.
An impairment charge in Engine Products – East, North America (Aerospace) of £33 million follows a downturn in the market and loss of 
business during the year. The charge only comprises goodwill. The remaining recoverable amount of £59 million represents its value in use, 
using a discount rate of 12% (2013: 12%). The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows and a 5% change in this 
assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by £3 million.
An impairment charge in Special Products Europe (Aerospace) of £6 million follows a reduction in sales for a key product. The charge only 
comprises goodwill. The remaining recoverable amount of £6 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 9% (2013: 11%).  
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows but a 5% change in this assumption would not have impacted the 
impairment charge.
An impairment charge in Wheels and Structures Europe (Land Systems) of £26 million follows a significant downturn in the market during the 
year and loss of future orders. The charge comprises goodwill of £18 million and property, plant and equipment of £8 million. The remaining 
recoverable amount of £17 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 12% (2013: 13%). The impairment charge is most 
sensitive to operating cash flows and a 5% change in this assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by £2 million.
Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates
One CGU within the Group, Power Management Devices (Land Systems), has been assessed for impairment using an estimation of fair value 
less costs of disposal based on a multiple of EBITDA and recent comparable market prices. Due to market conditions in the year value in use 
was not considered to be a representative assessment for impairment testing. The relevant assets of Power Management Devices have been 
assessed against fair value less costs of disposal. The assessment used an assumed EBITDA taking into account past performance, and a 
market based multiple following a review of comparable companies within a peer group. Sensitivity analysis on this CGU is provided below.
All other CGUs’ recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use. Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which 
are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance. In the case of certain 
CGUs within the Group’s Aerospace business, value in use was measured using operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years 
which incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes. Management consider forecasting over this period to more 
appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of those CGU’s programmes.
In determining the value in use of CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows. 
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external 
sources of information.
Operating cash flows
The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes (including reference 
to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within 
Driveline businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain military and civil programmes within Aerospace), raw material  
input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of  
foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of maintaining capital expenditure required to support 
forecast production. 
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based upon long term government bonds in the territory, or territories, 
within which each CGU operates. A relative risk adjustment (or “beta”) has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each 
CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies. 
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing. The range of rates reflects the mix of 
geographical territories within CGUs within the reportable segments.
Aerospace: UK 9% (2013: 11%), Europe 8% (2013: 11%) and North America 12% (2013: 12%)
Driveline: North and South America 14%-25% (2013: 13%-24%), Europe 9%-12% (2013: 12%-14%) and Japan and Asia Pacific 
region countries 10%-20% (2013: 10%-19%)
Powder Metallurgy: Europe 10% (2013: 12%) and North America 14% (2013: 13%)
Land Systems: Europe 9%-12% (2013: 11%-14%) and North America 14% (2013: 13%) 136 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(c) Impairment testing continued
Long term growth rates
To forecast beyond the detailed cash flows into perpetuity, a long term average growth rate has been used. In each case, this is not greater 
than the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or 
territories where the CGU is primarily based. This results in a range of nominal growth rates:
Aerospace: UK 3% (2013: 3%), Europe 2% (2013: 3%) and North America 3% (2013: 3%)
Driveline: North and South America 3%-6% (2013: 3%-8%), Europe 2%-4% (2013: 2%-7%) and Japan and Asia Pacific region 
countries 2%-10% (2013: 2%-10%)
Powder Metallurgy: Europe 2% (2013: 4%) and North America 3% (2013: 3%)
Land Systems: Europe 2%-4% (2013: 2%-4%) and North America 3% (2013: 3%)
Goodwill sensitivity analysis
The results of the Group’s impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to 
the key assumptions described above. Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been reviewed. 
At 31 December 2014, the date of the Group’s annual impairment test, the estimated recoverable amount of one CGU within the Group’s 
Aerospace operations using value in use and one CGU within the Group’s Land Systems operations using fair value less costs of disposal 
exceeded their carrying value by £199 million and £23 million respectively. 
The table below shows the discount rate, long term growth rate and forecast operating cashflow assumptions used in the calculation of 
value in use and the amount by which each assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the 
carrying value.

The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed and nor has the Group any significant contingent 
liabilities in relation to its interest in the joint ventures. The share of capital commitments of the joint ventures is shown in note 27.
On 31 July 2014, the Group sold its 50% share in Emitec, a joint venture company, for cash consideration of £37 million. The carrying value on 
the date of disposal was £14 million, see note 4d for further details. A loan of £8 million was repaid on closing (provided originally in January 
2013) and a guarantee contract was waived (2013: £10 million). 
On 24 December 2013, the Group sold its 49% joint venture interest in Composite Technology and Applications Ltd (CTAL) for £3 million. The 
carrying value on the date of disposal was nil, resulting in a profit on sale of £3 million, shown in note 4d. Prior to disposal the Group had 
invested £4 million of cash during 2013.
On 7 November 2013, the Group sold its controlling interest in GKN Driveline Torque Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (TSH) to Shanghai GKN 
HUAYU Driveline Systems Co Limited (SDS), a joint venture company. The transaction took the Group’s ownership in TSH from 100% to 50%. 
The addition to joint ventures of £15 million was matched by a £15 million cash contribution into SDS by the other venturer.

Government refundable advances are forecast to fall due for repayment between 2015 and 2055. 
In May 2014, the Group repaid a government refundable advance in the UK, received in 2009 and 2010 relating to the A350 programme.  
The principal repaid was £38 million and the associated accrued interest was £16 million.
Non-current deferred and contingent consideration falls due as follows: one-two years nil (2013: £6 million), two-five years £1 million  
(2013: nil) and over five years £2 million (2013: nil). Non-current amounts owed to suppliers and customers fall due within two years.
Contingent consideration of £6 million (2013: £6 million) is based on; the Filton site achieving certain levels of sales in 2015 (£3 million) and 
sales levels in GKN Hybrid Power Limited (£3 million). The range of contingent consideration for GKN Hybrid Power Limited, an acquisition during 
the year, is unlimited (2013: nil to £6 million). During 2014, a further £6 million was paid in cash relating to the Filton acquisition during 2009.
During 2013, £62 million of deferred consideration relating to the purchase of Aerospace Engine Systems in 2012 was paid in cash. 
Included within amounts owed to suppliers and customers is £33 million (2013: nil) payable to banks in respect of supply chain finance 
arrangements.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair values for financial instruments:
Unsecured bank overdrafts, other short term bank borrowings, bank balances and cash, short term bank deposits and other financial assets 
approximate to book value due to their short maturities. For other amounts, the repayments which the Group is committed to make have 
been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2014. Bonds included within other borrowings have been valued 
using quoted closing market values.
19 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities give rise to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Market risk includes foreign currency 
risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk. The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit 
the effects of financial risk on financial performance. Derivative financial instruments include; forward foreign currency contracts, which are 
used to hedge risk exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business and cross currency interest rate swaps which hedge cash flows on 
the Group’s debt. Further information is provided in the treasury management section of the Strategic Report.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports 
from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken. The Treasury 
Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign currency risks, interest rate risk, 
financial credit risk and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
(a) Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the 
subsidiaries’ functional currency. These exposures are forecast on a monthly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central 
Treasury Department. Under the Group’s foreign currency policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number 
of forecast time horizons using forward foreign currency contracts.
On 3 September 2014 the Group entered a series of cross currency interest rate swap instruments with its relationship banks which in 
substance convert the 2019 and 2022 sterling bonds into US dollars ($951 million) and Euros (€284 million). These derivative instruments 
have been designated as net investment hedges of US dollar and Euro net assets.
The Group’s reporting currency for its consolidated financial statements is sterling. Changes in exchange rates will affect the translation of 
results and net assets of operations outside of the UK. The Group’s largest exposures are the Euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in 
the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and joint ventures by £1 million and £4 million respectively.
Regarding financial instruments a 1% strengthening of sterling against the currency rates indicated below would have the following impact 
on operating profit:

Euro 0.2 1.2 2.8
US dollar (0.5) 22.9 2.0
The derivative sensitivity analysis has been prepared by reperforming the calculations used to determine the balance sheet values adjusted 
for the changes in the individual currency rates indicated with all other cross currency rates remaining constant. The sensitivity is a fair value 
change relating to derivatives for which the underlying transaction has not occurred at 31 December 2014. The Group intends to hold all such 
derivatives to maturity. The analysis of other items has been prepared based on an analysis of a currency balance sheet.

(b) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on fixed rate borrowings and cash flow interest rate risk on variable rate net borrowings/
funds. The Group’s policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Group’s 
cost of capital. This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined 
time horizon. The Group’s normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 50% to 80% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast 
to arise over a 12 month horizon. At 31 December 2014, 96% (2013: 96%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates. 
As at 31 December 2014, £174 million (2013: £31 million) was in bank deposits, £3 million of which was on deposit with banks on the Isle of 
Man (2013: £3 million).
(c) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments. In terms of 
substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk; operational and 
financial. Operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other 
receivables. Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits, facilities and 
financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Operational
As tier-one suppliers to aerospace, automotive and land systems original equipment manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts 
outstanding with a single customer at any one time. The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating 
agencies. The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Group’s results. However, there are many advantages 
in these relationships. In Land Systems there are a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers. 
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group. At a subsidiary level documented credit control 
reviews are required to be held at least every month. The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits. At a divisional 
level debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance are reviewed regularly. Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these 
levels based upon the customer’s ability to pay and other factors in the Group’s relationship with the customer. 
At 31 December the largest 5 trade receivables as a proportion of total trade receivables analysed by major segment is as follows:
2014 
% 
2013 
% 
Aerospace 74  69 
Driveline 57  54 
Powder Metallurgy 24  21 
Land Systems 24  23 
The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the 
normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year. Based on management information collected as at month ends the 
maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was £1,199 million (2013: £1,156 million).
Financial
Credit risk is mitigated by the Group’s policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long term credit rating, normally 
at least A- or equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is £35 million (2013: £28 million), however, the Group is not exposed to mark to 
market risk for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2014 as all counterparties were in a liability position (2013: £11 million 
exposure to a single bank).  144 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

exposure to a single bank). 
(d) Capital risk management
The Group defines capital as total equity. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure which optimises 
the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group’s two external banking covenants require an EBITDA of subsidiaries to net interest payable and receivable ratio of 3.5 times or 
more and net debt to EBITDA of subsidiaries of 3 times or less measured at 30 June and 31 December. The ratios at 31 December 2014 and 
2013 were as follows:
2014 
£m 
2013 
£m 
EBITDA 864  866

£m
2013 
£m
Net debt 624  732 
EBITDA 864  866 
Net debt to EBITDA ratio 0.7 times  0.8 times 
The Group monitors these ratios on a rolling basis and they are part of the budgeting and forecasting processes.
(e) Liquidity risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as part of its normal financing and trading cycle at times when peak borrowings are required. 
Borrowings normally peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments. The Group’s policies are to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is available to meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and 
acquisition objectives. Liquidity needs are assessed through short and long term forecasts. Committed bank facilities under a revolving 
credit facility total £800 million which expires in 2019. There were no drawings on these facilities at 31 December 2014. In addition the 
Group’s European Investment Bank unsecured facility (£80 million) is repayable in five equal annual instalments of £16 million commencing 
in June 2015. Committed facilities are provided through 14 banks.
The Group also maintains £98 million of uncommitted facilities, provided by 4 banks. There were no drawings against these facilities at 
31 December 2014.

(f) Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly of metals, which has a significant impact on input costs and the overall 
financial results. The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure in a variety of ways including medium term price agreements, surcharges and 
advance purchasing. In rare circumstances and only in respect of certain specified risks the Group uses derivative commodity hedging 
instruments. The impact of such financial instruments in respect of the overall commodity price risk is not material.

IFRS13
The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are forward currency contracts, cross currency 
interest rate swaps and embedded derivatives. All of these financial instruments are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as 
defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined with reference to available market information at the 
balance sheet date, using the methodologies described in their relevant notes:
• Forward currency contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and embedded derivatives, see note 20;
• Unsecured bank overdrafts, other short term bank borrowings, bank balances and cash, short term bank deposits and other financial 
assets, see note 18;
• Fair value less costs of disposal for impairment testing of one CGU, see note 11;
• Bonds included within other borrowings, see note 18; and
• Fair values of trade receivables and payables, short term investments and cash and cash equivalents are assumed to approximate to cost 
due to the short term maturity of the instruments and as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The discounted contingent element of deferred and contingent consideration of £6 million (2013: £6 million) is categorised as a Level 3 fair 
value measurement, see note 17. 
(h) Hedge accounting
The Group entered into a series of cross currency interest rate swaps during the year to better align its foreign currency income receipts in  
US dollars and Euros with its debt. The cross currency interest rate swaps have been designated as a net investment hedge of the Group’s  
US dollar and Euro net assets. The fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps at 31 December 2014 was a liability of £26 million 
(2013: nil).

Significant estimates and judgement
Whilst estimating provisions requires judgement, the range of reasonably possible outcomes is narrow. After consideration of sensitivity 
analysis, amounts stated represent management’s best estimate of the likely outcome.
Contract provisions
The Group has a small number of onerous contracts and a non-beneficial lease arrangement, primarily arising on business combinations and 
contractual dispute matters. Onerous contracts relate to customer programmes where the unavoidable costs of delivering product are in 
excess of contracted sales prices.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as £7 million in 2016 and £44 million from 2017.
Warranty
Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under 
contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues 
undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation. In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply 
of replacement products and compensation for the customer’s associated costs. Amounts set aside represent management’s best estimate 
of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer. 
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as £13 million in 2016 and £9 million from 2017.
Claims and litigation
Claims provisions are held in the Group’s captive insurance company and amount to £9 million (2013: £8 million). Claims provisions and 
charges are established in accordance with external insurance and actuarial advice.
Legal provisions amounting to £5 million (2013: £4 million) relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation 
actions that have arisen in the normal course of business. Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the 
Group’s stance in law. Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the 
litigation action occurs where legal advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which 
in all cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent management’s view of the likely 
outcome having taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies. Amounts of £3 
million (2013: £5 million) are provided.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as £4 million in 2016 and £5 million from 2017. 148 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Employee obligations
Long service non-pension and other employee related obligations arising primarily in the Group’s continental European subsidiaries amount 
to £23 million (2013: £22 million).
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as £3 million in 2016 and £17 million from 2017.
Other
Other provisions include £2 million (2013: £4 million) in relation to previous reorganisation arising from the Group’s strategic restructuring 
programmes and £11 million (2013: £10 million) relating to other customer and supplier exposures. Utilisation of the provision due in more 
than one year is estimated as £5 million in 2016 and £5 million from 2017.

transferred out of treasury during 2014 to satisfy the exercise of options by participants under share option schemes. The remaining treasury 
shares, which represented 1.1% (2013: 1.2%) of the called up share capital at the end of the year, have not been cancelled but are held as 
treasury shares and represent a deduction from shareholders’ equity.
At 31 December 2014, the GKN Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (“the Trust”) held 186,652 ordinary shares (2013: 1,887,665). A total of 
130,000 shares were purchased by the Trust in the open market during 2014 for cash consideration of less than £1 million (2013: 1,768,040 
shares were purchased for cash consideration of £5 million). During the year a total of 1,831,013 (2013: 2,992,373) shares were transferred 
out of the Trust to satisfy the vesting and exercise of awards of ordinary shares made under the Group’s share-based incentive arrangements. 
The remaining Trust shares will be used to satisfy future exercises. A dividend waiver operates in respect of shares held by the Trust.
During the year shares issued from Treasury under share incentive schemes generated a cash inflow of £1 million (2013: £8 million).

The Group’s pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world. In addition, in 
the USA and UK various plans operate which provide members with post-retirement medical benefits. The Group’s post-employment plans in 
the UK, USA and Germany together account for 98% of plan assets and 97% of plan liabilities. 
The Group’s post-employment plans include both funded and unfunded arrangements. The UK pension schemes are funded, albeit in deficit 
in common with many other UK pension schemes, with the scheme assets held in trustee administered funds. The German and other 
European plans are generally unfunded, with pension payments made from company funds as they fall due, rather than from scheme assets. 
The USA includes a combination of funded and unfunded pension and medical plans, whilst Japan also operates a funded pension plan. 
The Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements provide benefits to members in the form of an assured level of pension payable for life. 
The level of benefits provided typically depends on length of service and salary levels in the years leading up to retirement. In the UK and 
Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with inflation, whereas in the USA pensions generally do not receive inflationary 
increases once in payment. The UK and German schemes are closed to new entrants, whilst the USA schemes are closed to future accrual.
Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2014. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service cost elements were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The assumptions table above specifies separate assumptions for past and future service in relation to the UK pension scheme. This 
represents a change in approach, whereby a different, “future service” set of assumptions will be used to determine the service cost for the 
following year. There is no impact on the 2014 reported numbers as a result of this change. This approach reflects evolving market practice 
and is based on the premise that active members of the scheme are younger and have, on average, longer remaining life expectancy than an 
average scheme member. Given that yield curves typically rise over time, this longer duration implies a higher discount rate for the “active” 
sub-set of members which has been set at 3.80%, as at 31 December 2014. 
The UK schemes each use a duration specific discount rate derived from the Mercer pension discount yield curve, which is based on 
corporate bonds with two or more AA-ratings. The European discount rate was calculated with reference to Aon Hewitt’s German discount 
rate yield curve. For the USA, the discount rate referenced the Citigroup intermediate pension liability index, the Merrill Lynch US corporate 
AA 10+ years index and the Towers Watson Rate:LINK benchmark.

The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes, are as follows:
United Kingdom
The key current year mortality assumptions for both GKN1 and GKN2 use S1NA year of birth mortality tables with CMI 2013 improvements and 
a 1.25% p.a. long term improvement trend. These assumptions give the following expectations for each scheme: for GKN1 a male aged 65 
lives for a further 21.8 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 23.8 years whilst a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 23.5 years 
from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 25.7 years from age 65. For GKN2 a male aged 65 lives for a further 22.8 years 
and a female aged 65 lives for a further 25.1 years whilst a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 24.6 years from age 65 and a female 
aged 45 is expected to live a further 27.1 years from age 65.
Overseas
In the USA, RP-2014 tables have been used whilst in Germany the RT2005-G tables have been used. In the USA, the longevity assumption for 
a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 21.6 years (female 23.8 years) whilst in Germany a male aged 65 lives for a further 18.6 years (female 
22.8 years). The longevity assumption for a USA male currently aged 45 is that he also lives for a further 23.2 years once attaining 65 years 
(female 25.7 years), with the German equivalent assumption for a male being 21.5 years (female 25.5 years). These assumptions are based on 
the prescribed tables, rather than GKN experience.
Assumption sensitivity analysis
The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions (longevity: 1 year) on the defined benefit obligations as at 31 
December 2014 is set out below:
UK Americas Europe ROW 
Liabilities  
£m 
Liabilities 
£m

Discount rate +1% 472  39  89  3

Rate of inflation -1% 408  –  63  –

Life expectancy -1 year 109  8  19  – 
Health cost trend +1% (2) (2) –  – 
Health cost trend -1% 2  1  –  – 
The above sensitivity analyses are based on isolated changes in each assumption, whilst holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and there is likely to be some level of correlation between movements in different assumptions. In addition, 
these sensitivities relate only to potential movement in the defined benefit obligations. The assets, including derivatives held by the 
schemes, have been designed to mitigate the impact of these movements to some extent, such that the movements in the defined benefit 
obligations shown above would, in practice be partly offset by movements in asset valuations. However, the above sensitivities are shown to 
illustrate at a high level the scale of sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to key actuarial assumptions. 
The same actuarial methods have been used to calculate these sensitivities as are used to calculate the relevant balance sheet values, and 
have not changed compared to the previous period.
Judgements and estimates
USA Lump Sum settlements
During 2014 the Group undertook a voluntary lump sum programme in the USA, whereby deferred members of its USA pension schemes were 
offered the no-obligation opportunity to exchange their future pension rights for a cash lump sum. A settlement credit (£8 million) has been 
recognised in relation to this programme which is based on the differential between the actuarial valuations used for accounting purposes 
(£32 million) and the cash lump sum amounts (£24 million). The £8 million has been recorded within trading profit of Aerospace (£3 million), 
Driveline (£3 million) and Powder Metallurgy (£2 million).
Buy In
During the year, a bulk annuity pensioner “buy-in” was transacted in relation to the UK pension scheme, GKN 1, as a result of which a 
proportion of GKN 1 liabilities are now fully insured. The transaction involved a payment to Rothesay Life of £123 million, made from GKN 1’s 
assets. The bulk annuity covers £110 million of pensioner liabilities valued on an IAS 19 accounting basis, as at 31 December 2014. 152 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Pension partnership interest
On 31 March 2010, the Group entered into a pension partnership arrangement with the Trustee of the UK pension scheme, which entitled the 
UK pension scheme to a distribution of £30 million per annum for 20 years, subject to discretion exercisable by the Group in certain 
circumstances.
The accounting and disclosure for this arrangement changed during 2013 following amendments to the pension partnership agreement 
which resulted in the income interest no longer meeting the criteria for recognition as an IAS 19 plan asset. This increased the Group’s 
reported post-employment obligation deficit by an amount of £342 million and eliminated the non-controlling interest of £332 million which 
was previously recognised in equity. The remaining difference of £10 million was recognised in equity within retained earnings, as it 
represented a transaction with equity holders.
During the year the Group has paid £30 million (2013: combined amount of £30 million) to the two UK pension schemes through the pension 
partnership and this is included within the amount of contributions/benefits paid. In 2013 £10 million was paid before the partnership 
agreement was amended and was treated as a distribution from the pension partnership, whilst £20 million was treated as a contribution/
benefit paid.

In the UK, the Group is required to complete a statutory valuation of its pension schemes at least every three years and to agree a recovery 
plan to eliminate any resulting deficit. Both UK pension schemes had a funding valuation as at 5 April 2013 and during the year final 
agreement on recovery plans with the scheme trustees was reached. The Group’s UK pension funding deficit is lower than the equivalent UK 
accounting deficit.
This has resulted in additional UK deficit recovery payments of £10 million per year which commenced in 2014 and the potential for further 
additional payments commencing in 2016, contingent upon asset performance. In addition the Group also agreed, during the year, to pay  
£2 million per year for 4 years to UK scheme, GKN1, to cover a funding requirement arising from a £123 million bulk annuity purchase.
The combined contribution for deficit funding and future accrual expected to be paid by the Group during 2015 to the UK schemes is 
£47 million. In addition, a distribution of £30 million is expected to be made from the UK pension partnership to the UK schemes in the first 
half of 2015, which brings the total expected UK cash requirement for 2015 to £77 million. The expected 2015 contribution to overseas 
schemes is £28 million.

(2013: 75%/25%); bonds 91%/9% (2013: 97%/3%).
(c) Defined benefit scheme – risk factors
Through its various post-employment pension and medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which 
are detailed below. The Group’s focus is on managing the cash demands which the various pension plans place on the Group, rather than 
balance sheet volatility in its own right. For funded schemes cash requirements are generally determined by funding valuations which are 
performed on a different basis from accounting valuations. 
Asset volatility: Plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields (although the discount rate methodology 
differs for accounting and funding purposes). If plan assets deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate, this will create or increase 
a plan deficit. GKN’s various pension plans hold a significant proportion of equities and similar ‘growth assets’, which are expected to 
out-perform bonds in the long term, albeit at the risk of short term volatility. 
As the plans mature, with a shorter time horizon to cope with volatility, the Group will gradually reduce holdings of growth assets in favour of 
increased matching assets (bonds and similar). In the meantime, the Group considers that equities and similar assets are an appropriate means 
of managing pension funding requirements, given the long term nature of the liabilities and the strength of the Group to withstand volatility. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2014 Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
155 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Changes in bond yields: A decrease in bond yields will typically increase plan liabilities (and vice-versa), although this will be offset partially 
by an increase in the value of bonds held in the asset portfolios of the various plans. The effect of changes in bond yields is more 
pronounced in unfunded schemes where there is no potential for an offsetting movement in asset values. 
Inflation risk: As UK and some European pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher 
liabilities, although caps are in place to protect against unusually high levels of inflation. The UK asset portfolio includes some inflation 
linked bonds to provide an element of protection against this risk, whilst additional protection is provided by inflation derivatives. 
Member longevity: As the Group’s post-employment obligations are generally to provide benefits for the life of the member, increases in life 
expectancy will generally result in an increase in plan liabilities (and vice versa).
(d) Defined benefit schemes – demographic factors
Weighted average duration is a measurement technique designed to represent the estimated average time to payment of all cash-flows 
arising as a result of defined benefit obligations (i.e. pension payments and similar). The weighted average duration (years) of the defined 
benefit obligations in the UK, USA and Germany are as follows:
2014  2013 
UK GKN 1 11  11 
GKN 2 17  17 
USA 13  13 
Germany 16  16 
Defined benefit obligations are classified into those representing “active” members of a scheme or plan (i.e. those who are currently 
employed by the Group), “deferred” members (i.e. those who have accrued benefit entitlements, but who are no longer employed by the 
Group and are not yet drawing a pension) and “pensioner” members who are currently in receipt of a pension. Additional information 
regarding the average age, number of members and value of the defined benefit obligation in each of these categories for the UK, USA and 
Germany are given below:

Within the UK, there are two pension schemes referred to as GKN1 and GKN2. GKN1 is a mature scheme, comprised primarily of pensioner 
members, which is already at peak annual cash outflow (benefit payments); whilst GKN2 is less mature, with a larger active and deferred 
population. Benefit payments from GKN2 are forecast to continue to rise until the mid 2030s, when they will peak, before beginning to decline.
(e) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes outside the United Kingdom. The charge to the income statement in the year 
was £35 million (2013: £34 million).
25 Contingent assets and liabilities
Aside from the unrecognised contingent asset referred to in note 6 in respect of Franked Investment Income, there were no other material

On 1 April 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the equity share capital of Williams Hybrid Power Limited, now renamed GKN Hybrid Power 
Limited, from Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited. GKN Hybrid Power Limited specialises in the design and manufacture of composite 
flywheel-based energy storage systems, initially exploring options for the bus, truck and tram markets.
The fair value consideration of £11 million comprises an initial cash investment of £8 million, plus contingent consideration estimated at 
£3 million. The range of the contingent consideration payment, based on specific sales from GKN Hybrid Power Limited at a contractual royalty 
rate is unlimited. The fair value of net assets acquired of £11 million, comprises; property, plant and equipment of £1 million, a technology based 
non-operating intangible asset of £7 million, a marketing related non-operating intangible asset of £2 million, a deferred tax liability of 
£1 million and goodwill of £2 million. GKN Hybrid Power Limited has been included in Other businesses for segmental reporting.
From the date of acquisition to the balance sheet date, GKN Hybrid Power Limited contributed £6 million to sales and a trading loss of 
£2 million. If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2014 the Group’s statutory sales and trading profit for the year ended 
31 December 2014 are estimated at £6,983 million and £611 million respectively.
Goodwill (which is not tax deductible) is attributable to the value of the assembled workforce and expected future sales synergies from 
combination with the Group’s existing business. 158 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

159 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland).  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming  
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the  
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information  
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
GKN plc for the year ended 31 December 2014.

1 Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company, incorporated and domiciled in the UK, are presented as required by the Companies Act 
2006. They have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except where other measurement bases are 
required to be applied and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law. In accordance with FRS 8 the 
Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to disclose transactions with related parties. As the consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 7, the Company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of FRS 29.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have been applied consistently in both years presented.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Treasury shares 
GKN shares which have been purchased and not cancelled are held as treasury shares and deducted from shareholders’ equity.
Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The Company has no employees. Equity-settled 
share-based payments that are made available to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the 
vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest.
Profit and loss account
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is 
established. Current tax is recognised in the profit and loss account unless items relate to equity.
Dividends
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the Annual General Meeting whilst interim dividends are charged in the period 
they are paid.
2 Profit and loss account
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. 
The profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £306 million (2013: £4 million).
Auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £0.5 million (2013: £0.5 million).

Over the years the capital structure of GKN plc has changed. Events 
that may need to be considered when calculating any CGT liability in 
relation to our shares are set out in the following paragraphs.

OTHER INFORMATION
Shareholder security 
We are aware that a small number of shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls concerning their investment in GKN.  
These calls are from overseas based organisations who offer to buy GKN shares for considerably more than the current market price.  
In some cases the caller has suggested that there is currently a takeover offer for GKN. There is no such offer and we suspect that the 
calls are bogus.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited investment advice, offers to buy shares or offers of free company reports. 
Operations, commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’, are targeting UK shareholders and callers can be very persistent and extremely 
persuasive. We are aware that they attempt to persuade individuals to provide email addresses or other personal information; 
shareholders are strongly advised not to provide any such details.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) provides the following guidance should you be contacted in this manner:
• obtain the name of the person calling and the organisation they represent;
• check that they are properly authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority by checking the FCA register of regulated firms at 
www.fca.org.uk/firms/systems-reporting/register/search;
• call the organisation back to verify their identity using the telephone number listed for them on the FCA register; 
• search the FCA list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing business with at www.fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-
yourself/unauthorised-firms/unauthorised-firms-to-avoid. If you deal with an unauthorised firm you will not be eligible to receive 
payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme;
• report any suspicions to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 or completing the online form at www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams/
report-scam/share-fraud-form; and
• if the calls persist, hang up.
To reduce the risk of becoming a victim of fraud you should: 
• Ensure all your certificates are stored in a safe place, or hold your shares electronically in CREST (electronic settlement system for UK 
and Irish securities) via a nominee. 
• Reduce the number of cold calls you receive by registering with the Telephone Preference Service on 0845 070 0707 or by 
visiting www.tpsonline.org.uk. Alternatively you can also register by writing to Telephone Preference Service, DMA House, 
70 Margaret Street, London, W1W 8SS.
• Keep all correspondence containing your shareholder reference number in a safe place. 
• Shred all unwanted correspondence. 
• Inform Equiniti as soon as possible if you change your address. If you receive a letter from Equiniti regarding a change of address and 
have not recently moved house, please contact them immediately. You may be a victim of identity theft. 
• Know when dividends will be paid. You can request that dividends be paid direct to your bank, reducing the risk of cheques being 
intercepted or lost in the post. If you change your bank account, inform Equiniti of the details of your new account.
• Consider getting independent professional advice before making any investment decision, particularly if the type of investment is 
unfamiliar to you.

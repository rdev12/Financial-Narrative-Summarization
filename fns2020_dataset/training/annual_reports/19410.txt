What we do
Quintain’s ultimate aim is to own, promote 
and manage ground leased estates that are 
run as businesses, balanced by a large scale 
fund management operation where the rents 
are primarily linked to the retail price index.
Retention of the freehold of our estates 
means that we have a vested interest in 
engineering their long term success.
The diversification of our model seeks to 
offset the higher risk of development against 
the significantly more stable sectors in 
which our funds operate. It is a model 
designed to lead to robust income and 
capital growth.

The Company faced difficult conditions 
during the financial year, but has 
emerged stronger and better placed to 
take advantage of the considerable 
opportunities which it holds.
Until the market changed so 
dramatically in 2007, Quintain relied 
upon the availability of bank debt, 
drawn down against rising valuations, 
to meet recurring costs.
The emergence of the liquidity 
crisis made this an unsustainable way 
to finance the business. In response,  
the Company devised the following 
solution:
•  a significant rights issue to cement 
the financial stability of the Group;
•  the acceleration of the programme 
to expand Fund Management 
and directly-held assets to a level 
whereby the cost of running the 
business is fully covered by income, 
to obviate the reliance on debt; and 
•  an increased focus on the recycling 
of capital from existing assets and 
the introduction, where appropriate, 
of third party capital in order to 
achieve faster progress at Wembley 
and Greenwich.
Good progress is being achieved on 
all three fronts.
The rights issue to raise £183.1m 
was completed successfully in 
December 2009 and the Company now 
has a broader institutional shareholder 
base.
In our specialist sectors of 
healthcare and student housing we 
remain confident of being able to deploy 
our capital on attractive terms and are 
now seeing interesting opportunities 
emerge from the turmoil in the financial 
markets.
The recycling of capital continues. 
In the reporting period we received 
£82.5m from asset sales, including our 
interest in The O2. The offices occupied 
by Transport for London at Greenwich 
have attracted interest from several 
potential purchasers and we continue 
to pursue opportunities to dispose of 
assets with which we have already 
created value.
Our three year business plan 
focuses on the increase of funds under 
management to £2bn and the delivery 
of critical mass at Wembley City.  
As the first step towards achievement 
of these 2013 targets, we have put in 
place a clear operational programme for 
the next 12 months that will bring 
further capital into the business, drive 
progress on our major schemes and 
increase the recurring income 
generated across the Group. Whilst the 
continued uncertainty in the markets 
will no doubt present challenges, the 
business is now in a significantly 
stronger shape and we anticipate  
a year of real progress. 
Chairman’s Statement
“ The business is now 
in a significantly 
stronger shape and 
we anticipate a year 
of real progress.”
William Rucker 
Chairman
Three year business plan
The business is focused on realising 
two key objectives within three 
years: 
•  the first is to double funds under 
management to £2bn
•  the second is to achieve critical 
mass on our Urban Regeneration 
schemes, particularly the 
Western Core of Wembley City

Key Performance Indicators
Quintain aims to deliver exceptional returns in the long term. 
Our target is to achieve upper quartile performance against IPD 
over three time periods: the lifetime of Quintain, ten years 
and ﬁ ve years.
Total return is the movement in net asset value per share, adjusted 
for any dividends paid in the year, as a percentage of the opening 
net asset value per share.
Interest cover is deﬁ ned in our banking covenants as operating 
proﬁ t before net ﬁ nance expenses plus realised surpluses on 
disposals divided by net ﬁ nance costs, excluding mark to market 
adjustments.
Staff retention and motivation is crucial to the creation of value for 
shareholders and happiness at work, measured through a wider 
annual survey, is identiﬁ ed as the most relevant indicator.
This data was not collected prior to 2008.
The IPD performance is measured in comparison to the March 
Universe. 
Gearing is deﬁ ned in our banking covenants as the ratio of net 
borrowings of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries 
to equity shareholders’ funds adjusted for deferred tax and mark 
to market movements. 04 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Chief Executive’s Statement
The financial year was characterised by 
the unfolding global recession, despite 
the efforts of governments to protect 
their national economies. As a result, 
the property sector continued to 
experience great challenges and, 
although the prime market recovered  
at the end of 2009 in response to a wave 
of cash from overseas investors and 
retail funds entering the market, this 
contrasted strongly with the weakness 
of tenant demand.
Results
Our results reflect the wider property 
environment during the year and our 
portfolio’s weight of development 
assets, which typically recover at later 
points in the cycle. Whilst prime property 
was re-rated in the second half of the 
year, ongoing economic uncertainty 
dampened lenders’ appetite for 
development risk and therefore, as 
anticipated, the value of our major 
schemes remained largely static.  
The resulting net asset value per  
share at 31 March 2010 was 120p.  
This compares with 121p, adjusted  
for the rights issue, at the end of  
the last financial year and created  
a total return of (0.8)%. 
Throughout the period we have 
progressively reinforced the business: 
the cash repatriation target was 
surpassed ahead of schedule, overheads 
were reduced by a further 12.4% to 
£21.1m building on the 13.8% reduction 
achieved in the previous financial year, 
and the Company undertook a 
transformational rights issue.  
The combined result of these activities 
was to reduce debt materially, adding 
considerable strength to our balance 
sheet and building a secure platform 
from which to focus on delivering value. 
Gearing, as per our banking definition, 
was 46% at the year end (2009: 105%) 
against a covenant of 110% and interest 
cover was 2.8 times (2009: 1.7 times) 
against a 1.25 times covenant.  
The rights issue has also equipped  
the Group with its share of the equity 
funding it requires to deliver all key 
objectives within the three year 
business plan.
 The performance in income 
terms reflects the actions taken to 
create this stability, with gross profit 
before impairment falling 2.9% to 
£34.0m, partly as a result of sales of 
investment assets. These sales gave 
rise to a loss on valuation, directly  
and through joint ventures, of £9.8m, 
contributing to the loss before tax of 
£10.1m. However, operating profits 
excluding impairments and exceptional 
items rose 18.3% to £12.9m (2009: 
£10.9m) demonstrating an increasingly 
efficient underlying business.
“ The rights issue has 
equipped the Group 
with its share of the 
equity funding it 
requires to deliver  
all key objectives 
within the three  
year business plan.”

Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information Overview
Business delivery
Good operational progress was 
achieved during the period. Our largest 
Fund, Quercus, completed the year 
with the successful raising from 
existing investors of £82.7m at a  
5% premium to net asset value.  
The number of income-generating beds 
in our student accommodation fund 
doubled during the reporting period, 
substantially increasing the Group’s 
share of rental income; and construction 
work on the Bristol and Bath Science 
Park, which is being developed and 
operated by our Quantum Fund, began 
shortly after the year end. The first 
phase of construction of this BREEAM 
Excellent park will be complete and 
income-generating next summer.
Maintaining momentum on our 
Urban Regeneration schemes has 
remained a priority. We were pleased  
to finish the year with 308,000 sq ft of 
new commercial space at Greenwich, 
70% of which has already been let,  
and 520 homes completed at Wembley, 
82% of which are now sold or in 
lawyers’ hands. We have continued  
to attract high quality, international 
brands to our schemes, including  
Hilton International, Tesco, Cineworld 
and Barclaycard.
People
We announce today that, after nine 
years’ service to the Board, Senior 
Independent Director David 
Pangbourne will retire at the Annual 
General Meeting in September 2010. 
David has made an invaluable 
contribution to Quintain over the last 
decade, not least in his eight years  
as Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
and will be greatly missed. 
As previously announced, in 
October William Rucker took over as 
Chairman from John Plender, who 
stepped down from the Board at the 
end of the financial year. In January, 
Joan MacNaughton retired and  
Charles Cayzer and Sir Peter Dixon 
joined the Board. Subsequent to the 
year end, Tonianne Dwyer resigned  
as executive director and Head of Fund 
Management and was replaced in May 
by David Gavaghan.
Outlook
The operational targets within our three 
year business plan are to grow funds 
under management to £2bn and 
complete the Western Core of Wembley 
City. Both actions will increase 
materially the amount of recurring 
income received by the Group. Within 
this three year business plan, there are 
clear operational targets for the next  
12 months shown in the adjacent box 
and against which we will report 
progress.
Although the UK may well be 
facing a period of slow economic 
growth, or even decline, this need not 
impede achieving our primary target of 
a recurring cashflow-positive state or 
impact materially the value we intend 
to capture from our regeneration 
schemes. Through careful financial 
management and prudent 
implementation of our strategy, we 
remain focused on the delivery for 
shareholders of strong and sustained 
returns.

Operational Review
Urban Regeneration
70% of the Group’s assets by value are 
managed within the Urban Regeneration 
business. Geographically, operations  
are focused on London where there is 
extensive opportunity to deliver above 
average returns from the creation of 
mixed-use, sustainable communities, 
designed to respond to the Capital’s 
housing shortage. The segmental 
operating profit for the year from Urban 
Regeneration, before the results of asset 
sales and revaluations, was £5.3m.
Strategy
Urban Regeneration offers Quintain  
the opportunity to generate capital 
growth through the development  
and long term ownership of major  
new estates with excellent existing 
transport connections.
The demographic trends 
supporting the business include  
the long term growth of London’s 
population and chronic shortage of 
housing. The maturity of the consumer 
society, with its demand for exciting 
retail and entertainment destinations, 
supports the mixed-use nature of our 
schemes, which in turn provides an 
inherent flexibility when determining 
the sequencing of the build programme. 
Our major schemes are characterised 
by the ownership or control of the 
operational businesses that drive 
millions of visitors to these destinations 
every year. This high level of footfall  
is a major draw for retailers and 
operators of leisure facilities.
“ Urban Regeneration offers Quintain the 
opportunity to generate capital growth 
through the development and long term 
ownership of major new estates.”

Quintain initiates opportunities and 
then introduces third party capital for 
development through either the 
establishment of joint ventures,  
the selling of long leaseholds or the 
migration of assets into Quintain Fund 
Management. Debt funding is used 
where appropriate, subject to the 
constraints imposed by the Board 
through the agreed gearing limit. 
Wherever possible the freehold of 
the new estate is retained by Quintain. 
This creates the opportunity to build 
additional material income streams 
through the provision of services such 
as estate management, hotels, 
entertainment, revenues from exclusive 
category partners (i.e. financial services 
and ‘pouring rights’), car parking, estate 
agency, catering, waste management, 
advertising and the provision of 
telecommunications and energy.
Market and outlook
The key property sectors for the Urban 
Regeneration business are residential, 
retail, and commercial.
There is a polarisation of the 
residential market in London, where 
prices for larger homes for purchasers 
with substantial equity have performed 
well in contrast to the new build 
apartment market, which targets first 
time buyers. Few such purchasers can 
meet lenders’ requirements for equity 
and so, without parental support,  
many are turning to rental properties.  
In response the Company is building  
a rental business that lets units, thereby 
establishing an income stream that is 
attractive to potential investors. 
In the retail sector, the most robust 
element has been at the budget end of 
the market. In delivering the only 
designer outlet shopping centre  
within the M25, at Wembley City,  
the Company intends to exploit this 
trend, in combination with addressing 
current local shortfalls in restaurants 
and leisure facilities.
The reduced commercial 
development pipeline in London over 
the last two years has resulted in an 
undersupply of prime commercial space 
in some locations, which will take 
several years to address. Occupiers are 
also increasingly seeking offices that 
can achieve excellent environmental 
performance in order to support their 
own sustainability programmes  
and reduce running costs. Recognised 
rating systems of such performance, 
such as BREEAM and the EPC,  
can now add value to high quality 
commercial product such as Pier Walk 
and Mitre Passage at Greenwich 
Peninsula. This presents favourable 
conditions for delivery of high quality, 
sustainable office space in London.

Wembley City
When complete, Quintain’s flagship 
scheme in London will cover 87 acres 
around the iconic National Stadium and 
Arena at Wembley. Today it comprises 
250,000 sq ft of retail parks, a hotel, 
extensive car parking to support the  
170 annual events at the Stadium  
and Arena, leased industrial and 
commercial units and phase one  
of the scheme’s development,  
located to the west of the Stadium. 
Phase One
For the next three years, the weight of 
development activity at Wembley will 
be focused on achieving critical mass 
on this first phase of development, 
referred to as the ‘Western Core’.  
In addition to the existing 520 homes, 
100,000 sq ft office building, Plaza Hotel 
and 12,500-seat Wembley Arena, this 
phase will include: a four star Hilton 
International hotel; accommodation for 
661 students; 220,000 sq ft of retail; and 
a nine screen Cineworld cinema. 
During the year we completed the 
second apartment building on time and 
on budget, increasing the number of 
finished homes on the scheme to 520. 
285 of these homes have been sold to 
registered social landlords as affordable 
housing. Of the 235 private homes, the 
sale of 123 have been completed, an 
additional seven contracts have been 
exchanged and 14 units are currently 
reserved. Sales during 2009 were slow, 
however, an acceleration has been seen 
since the start of this year with 50 
apartments sold in the last five months. 
Sale prices per square foot achieved in 
May 2010 ranged from £391 to £431 at 
Forum House and £435 to £495 at 
Quadrant Court.
Our residential rental business 
continues to grow. With residential 
sales across the London market being 
at exceptionally low levels but rental 
prices rising, we have sought to attract 
tenants for unsold private apartments 
before selling these with the income 
stream in place to investors. We have 
also extended this rental management 
service to our partners on the scheme. 
Revenue generated by our residential 
lettings business is now in excess of 
£1.0m per annum, with the contribution 
to the Group from rental income and 
fees being £365,000. 
This autumn we will start 
construction of the new Hilton 
International hotel, with a view to 
opening in 2012. Originally designed to 
offer 441 rooms, agreement has been 
reached with Hilton to reduce the 
number of rooms in the new hotel  
to 358, which we believe will deliver 
optimum occupancy rates, and create 
instead a destination Sky Bar on the  
top floor. The location of this venue  
and its views over the adjacent 
Wembley Stadium and Arena are 
designed to provide a stunning event 
location for those visiting, staying  
or performing at Wembley City. 
Groundworks and an extensive 
pre-construction programme were 
undertaken during the year on the 
student accommodation plot next to  
the new Hilton, for which a forward sale 
is being explored. Construction of this 
new facility is scheduled to conclude  
at the same time as the hotel, bringing 
661 students to the site.
Subsequent to the year end, we 
completed an agreement to lease with 
Cineworld Group plc regarding the 
1,800-seat cinema complex within  
the 280,000 sq ft retail and leisure hub 
of the Western Core. Marketing for the 
retail component, including the designer 
outlet village, will be launched this 
autumn, paving the way for a start  
of construction in 2011 and opening  
in 2013. 
Phase Two
In April 2010, following a public inquiry, 
the Planning Inspectorate endorsed 
Brent Council’s Core Strategy, an 
important document setting the 
framework for development in the 
Borough until 2026. In particular, it 
acknowledges that Wembley will be 
‘the economic engine’ for Brent, with 
the town centre being extended 
eastwards to facilitate a further 300,000 
sq ft of new retail floor space by 2016,  
in addition to that already granted 
planning consent. It also acknowledges 
that there is capacity for a further 
1.1 million sq ft of retail floor space 
by 2026.
Planning consent was granted for 
the 240,000 sq ft Brent Civic Centre in 
March 2010. Following the year end the 
Company concluded the agreement  
to sell this 2.25 acre plot to the Council 
for £10m. Brent Council anticipates 
opening the Civic Centre, which 
incorporates a library, town hall, 
administration offices and performance 
space, in June 2013. Quintain will then 
lease back the 13,000 sq ft income-
generating retail component of the 
building for 150 years.

Overview Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information Operational and Financial Review Overview
Wembley Arena
Cementing the future of the emerging 
Wembley City destination, it was 
announced in April that we secured 
Barclaycard as the title sponsor for 
Wembley Arena on a five year contract. 
Alongside the value of such an 
endorsement from a major brand, 
Barclaycard will extend the marketing 
reach of the Arena, for which we have  
a profit share arrangement, directly to 
their 10.4 million customers and offer 
them preferential access to tickets. 
They join CocaCola and InBev as 
exclusive category Arena Partners. 
Estate Revenue
Progress has been achieved with regard 
to streamlining site management, with 
a 125-year agreement now in place with 
Wembley National Stadium Ltd for  
car parking on event days. As well as 
reducing costs and management time 
for the Stadium, the agreement is 
expected to contribute £750,000 per 
annum to the Group in 2010/11, 
creating a substantial operational 
business throughout the useful 
economic life of the Stadium. This is 
part of the wider estate management 
operation, which is making an 
increasingly important contribution  
to the Group.
Greenwich Peninsula
Working alongside our joint venture 
partner, Lend Lease (Europe) Ltd, 
through the Greenwich Peninsula 
Regeneration Ltd (‘GPRL’) vehicle, 
Quintain is the master developer of the 
190 acre Greenwich Peninsula scheme, 
adjacent to Canary Wharf. The scheme 
is based on a land draw-down model, 
with the Homes and Communities 
Agency as the major landowner and 
Quintain retaining ownership of 
18.5 acres on the west riverbank, 
facing Canary Wharf.
During the year we made strong 
progress towards establishing 
Greenwich as a vibrant new office 
location. Transport for London and 
Greenwich Council anchor the initial 
development, whilst the architecturally-
stunning O2 and Ravensbourne College 
provide a sense of place in a location 
characterised by superior environmental 
performance and low occupancy costs, 
compared with both the West End and 
the adjacent Canary Wharf. 
Over the 12 month period, 
construction of the first two office 
buildings, totalling 308,000 sq ft, was 
completed. 217,000 sq ft, or 70%, of  
this space has been let to Transport  
for London and the London Borough  
of Greenwich on 20 year and 10 year 
leases, respectively. Transport for 
London has relocated 1,800 employees, 
including its Crossrail team, to the 
Peninsula and Greenwich Council 
anticipates occupancy of their floors  
in Mitre Passage this summer.  
Their primary use of this space will  
be to attract inward investment to  
the Borough through their ‘Destination 
Greenwich’ programme, particularly 
during the London Olympics in 2012.
We have now begun the design of 
the third office building and appointed 
Fletcher Priest to create a 300,000 sq ft 
facility, for which we are seeking a 
pre-let before we start construction.
Construction of the new Ravensbourne 
College will complete this month, in 
preparation for the arrival of 1,400 
digital media and design students in 
September. The College offers higher 
education up to Master degree level 
and connects students with businesses 
from the first day of their course. This 
influx of young, intelligent and creative 
people will bring immediate animation 
to Peninsula Central throughout the  
day to complement that delivered by  
7.5 million visitors per annum to The O2 
at night. With the imminent arrival of 
onsite demand, we are now analysing, 
with the support of the London Borough 
of Greenwich and Ravensbourne,  
the viability of introducing student 
accommodation to the Peninsula.
With the development and leasing 
of this commercial and academic hub, 
and over 3,000 people using the 
Peninsula to work and study every day, 
new demand for retail has been created. 
Following the year end, leases were 
agreed on seven of the 13 retail units  
in Pier Walk, Mitre Passage and 
Ravensbourne College, all of which are 
owned by GPRL. Major brands Costa 
Coffee and Chiquitos will be among the 
first to open retail units at Greenwich 
Peninsula this year.
Following the international 
success of The O2 as an entertainment 
venue and the corresponding increase 
in its value, Quintain and Lend Lease 
disposed of their joint interest in the 
asset in October 2009. This sale 
released £11.8m of capital for Quintain 
and is in line with our corporate 
strategy of adding value to assets before 
selling down to recycle capital to fund 
other opportunities. 
The development of residential 
buildings at Greenwich Peninsula  
was slowed by the liquidity crisis  
in the mortgage market and our focus 
throughout the financial year therefore 
has been on the delivery of extensive 
infrastructure for the first four plots in 
the south east of the Peninsula. 
Following a land sale to Bellway Homes 
in 2007, they are constructing a block  
of 229 apartments and our intention 
now is to start construction of a second 
block of homes in this district. 10 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Key Achievements 
•  Quercus Healthcare raised £82.7m 
of equity in February at 5% 
premium to the fund’s net  
asset value
•  iQ has doubled the amount of 
operational beds within the fund 
during the year
•  We created a fourth fund, SeQuel, 
which focuses on generating 
returns from secondary property, 
which is a sector that is yet to 
experience a re-rating of values
•  Construction has now started at 
the Bristol and Bath Science Park 
(‘SPark’) within the Quantum 
fund.
Overview
28% of the Group’s assets are 
administered through four funds within 
Quintain’s Fund Management business. 
The segmental operating profit for the 
year from Quintain Fund Management, 
before the results of asset sales and 
revaluations, was £16.4m.
Strategy
The purpose of Quintain Fund 
Management (‘QFM’) is to generate 
robust recurring income to support the 
Group throughout the economic cycle 
and to provide an exit route for 
individual assets or groups of assets 
elsewhere within the business. 
We primarily identify asset classes 
that benefit from long term social, 
environmental and economic trends, 
such as the ageing of the UK’s 
population and the desirability of a 
knowledge-based economy. These 
sectors also feature high barriers to 
entry that can deliver a premium for 
strong performance. Teams with 
detailed knowledge and proven skills in 
the specific sectors where QFM invests 
are maintained within the Group. 
The existing four funds are 
focused on healthcare, higher education 
institutions, science and technology 
parks, and industrial and commercial 
property. 17

Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information Operational and Financial Review Overview
Quercus Healthcare Fund
The long term healthcare sector has 
demonstrated resilience throughout the 
reporting period, with some pressure 
arising from the management of 
gearing by operators rather than lack of 
demand. With the number of people 
aged over 85 forecast to more than 
double by 2030, an historical lack of 
investment in the sector and a tight 
regulatory environment, it is anticipated 
that demand for good quality 
accommodation will remain high.
The public sector spending cuts 
recently announced by the Government 
are expected to impact the elderly care 
industry at the micro level. However, 
given the demographic trends noted 
above and the tightening regulatory 
environment, the investors in Quercus 
remain confident that at the macro level 
this will remain a strong market.
Quercus was launched in 
December 1998 in partnership with 
Aviva Investors. The healthcare assets 
within the portfolio are let on long leases 
with RPI-linked/3% minimum annual 
rental uplifts. The tenant base is  
diverse with 37 tenants operating  
232 properties and the average lease 
length remains long at 29 years.
At the start of the reporting 
period, and in line with market trends 
across the sector, valuations fell. 
However, after a period of stabilisation 
some inward yield movement began  
to emerge, particularly in relation to  
the larger operators in the portfolio. 
One acquisition was made at the start 
of the reporting period. Otherwise, the 
focus for the year was the improvement 
of the Fund’s risk profile, ensuring that 
the capital structure reflected more 
accurately its nature as a ‘safe haven’. 
To this end £130.8m of assets were  
sold during the financial year and the 
proceeds used to reduce gearing, which 
ended the period at 42.3%, against a 
covenant of 60%. 
Emphasis is increasingly placed 
on the quality of facilities and care 
provided by individual care homes. 
£3.2m was invested during the year in a 
variety of refurbishment and extension 
projects that will enhance the quality of 
the portfolio’s assets and drive rental 
increases. This programme continues, 
most recently with a £1.5m project to 
expand a care home in Warrington from 
35 beds to 59, with many benefiting 
from en suite facilities. It is anticipated 
that around £16m of similar projects will 
be pursued over the next 
twelve months.
As part of Quintain’s cash 
repatriation programme to manage  
the Group’s gearing, units in Quercus 
were sold in September 2009, which 
broadened the Fund’s investor base to 
around 50. In February, the Fund took 
advantage of increasing appetite for 
long term healthcare assets and raised 
£82.7m from existing investors at a 
premium of 5% to NAV . Whilst this 
reduced Quintain’s interest in the  
Fund to 14.9%, it has given Quercus 
substantial equity to invest in new 
acquisitions where high potential  
for value creation can be identified.  20 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010

The record number of university applications

Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information Operational and Financial Review Overview
iQ Student Accommodation Fund
Purpose built student accommodation 
has been a growth sector in the UK  
for more than a decade, with student 
numbers rising significantly, a lack of 
investment in traditional university 
stock and an increasingly controlled 
regulatory environment. The constraint 
in public sector expenditure over  
the next few years is likely to support 
this market in that universities will  
seek to use their restricted capital for 
educational purposes, increasingly 
looking to outsource the management 
of their students’ accommodation 
requirements. The need for institutions 
to take action is underpinned by the 
estimate that 35% of existing university 
stock is already in poor condition.
The iQ portfolio, which is co-
owned by Quintain and the Wellcome 
Trust, was valued at the end of the 
reporting period at £209.1m (2009: 
£145.7m), reflecting the addition of 
three new schemes in September 2009. 
With little evidence from completed 
transactions relating to purpose built 
schemes at the valuation date, the small 
fall in like for like values was largely the 
product of a marginal softening of yields 
during the year from 6.4% to 6.6%, 
partially offset by year on year rental 
growth of 5.5%. 
 
The marketing suite for one of the three 
new schemes was delivered behind 
schedule, preventing the scheme from 
attracting tenants during the main 
letting period. The impact on the overall 
portfolio was to reduce the occupancy 
level achieved during the year to 91% 
(2009: 99%). Significant action has  
been taken to market this scheme in 
particular for the 2010/11 academic  
year and lettings are now substantially 
ahead of this time last year. Excluding 
this scheme, occupancy exceeded 96%.
Across the portfolio, lettings for 
the 2010/11 academic year are currently 
well ahead of the equivalent period last 
year at 71% (2009: 53%). This figure 
includes the two new schemes that are 
on schedule to complete in Edinburgh 
next month, which will add 635 more 
beds to the portfolio and like for like 
rents are approximately 3% higher than 
2009/10. Together, these factors will 
result in an increase of approximately 
£4m in annualised rental income for  
the Fund.
As announced in the January 2010 
interim management statement, iQ 
purchased a site in Hoxton for £10.8m 
on which a 255-bed accommodation 
scheme is now being built. Subsequent 
to the year end, the Fund committed to 
acquire a further scheme at Elephant 
and Castle in London, which will house 
232 students plus associated retail 
space. Both these schemes will be 
complete in time for the start of the 
2011/12 academic year, meeting the 
ongoing strong demand for 
accommodation in London. Operational Review

Science and technology are recognised 
as engines of future economic growth 
in the UK by both the public and private 
sectors. However, with some notable 
exceptions, the UK has a distance  
to travel to equal leading nations in  
this field. In order to attract and retain 
high calibre investment in the UK, 
accommodation facilities require 
wholesale improvement and 
increasingly will be provided in  
clusters of excellence in areas adjacent 
to major conurbations across the UK.
Quantum, our second fund established 
in partnership with Aviva Investors, will 
capitalise on this trend over the next 
decade. The strategy for the Fund is to 
create and manage good quality, highly 
flexible space that can meet the specific 
requirements of science and technology 
businesses, which follow accelerated 
growth paths with swiftly evolving 
needs. Quantum’s unique selling point 
is not only the ability to accommodate 
tenants with changeable requirements 
effectively, but also to connect them to 
sources of academic support, funding 
and channels to inward investment. 
The model successfully established by 
Quantum in the south west of England 
provides a template for collaboration 
between higher education institutions, 
central and regional government and 
organisations in the private sector that 
can deliver this valuable combination.
The major asset currently held by 
Quantum is the development of 54 acres 
into the Bristol and Bath Science Park 
(‘SPark’). Located near the M4 and M5 
to the north east of Bristol, SPark brings 
together the development experience of 
Quintain with the academic excellence 
and facilities of the Universities of Bath, 
Bristol and the West of England, and the 
inward investment expertise of the 
South West Regional Development 
Agency (‘SWRDA ’).
The Park will offer dedicated, 
highly flexible space, underpinned by a 
suite of support services located within 
the first building on the site, called 
SPark One. Alongside forum space 
incorporating conference facilities and 
investment teams, this building will 
contain an Innovation Centre, where 
fledgling businesses can be based,  
and an Expansion Centre into which 
they can move as they grow. Corporate Information Financial Statements Governance Operational and Financial Review Overview

QED role: investor and asset manager
For more information visit: 
www.quintain.co.uk/sequel
In September 2009, Quintain 
established a new fund called SeQuel 
using debt and some third party 
funding. The Fund was seeded with 
£83.3m of high yielding property assets 
from our Investment Portfolio. 
The substantial fall in the value 
of secondary properties since 2007 
offers significant opportunity for value 
creation in the near term and SeQuel 
will capitalise on this dynamic.  
The majority of the Fund is held in  
office properties, with some industrial 
and retail assets. The tenant base is 
actively managed and diverse, with 
minimal exposure to any single tenant. 
Performance is generated from the 
Fund through asset management 
initiatives such as lease re-gearing  
and extensions, targeted sales in 
response to market movement  
and void reductions. 
We have yet to see a re-rating of 
values in this sector and a marginal 
1.7% increase of values was delivered 
over the reporting period after sales  
of £14.7m, which were £2.1m ahead  
of book value. Gross income at the 
period end was £8.6m, against a gross 
ERV of £9.5m. The initial yield was 
10.1% and voids ERV totalled £986,000, 
representing 10.3% of the portfolio. 
The projected geared equity return  
of this Fund is anticipated to be in the 
mid-20s and we remain ahead of 
schedule with the disposals programme 
to recycle capital.
Corsham Street
We reported in June 2009 that Quintain 
has entered into a forward funding 
agreement regarding a 661-bed scheme 
in central London at Corsham Street. 
The developer has now started 
construction of the scheme, which will 
exploit the Zone 1 location, excellent 
transport links and undersupply of 
appropriate housing in London. 
Combined with the current reduced 
pipeline of development in this sector, 
continued demand for student 
accommodation in London and the 
high quality of the specification, this 
scheme is expected to deliver strong 
performance on completion in time for 
the September 2012 intake.
Following the discussions noted in our 
interim results, the South West Regional 
Development Agency has committed 
£10m of additional capital support for 
the first phase of the development.  
This has enabled the start of the 
construction of SPark One, which is 
scheduled to open in the autumn of 
2011. The resulting building will be 
highly sustainable, achieving a 
BREEAM Excellent rating and a carbon 
emissions target of just 30kg per square 
metre. The new facility will respect the 
existing topography of the site, while a 
minimum of 30% of the materials used 
to construct the building will be 
recycled and at least 40% are being 
locally sourced. 
In March 2010 it was announced 
that the new National Composites 
Centre, supported by Rolls-Royce plc, 
AgustaWestland, Airbus SAS, GE 
and GKN plc, will be built on the 
site, bringing the first 200 of 6,000 
anticipated new jobs to SPark from 
its first day of operation next autumn. 
This £25m facility will accommodate 
the design and laboratory testing of 
new high quality composite products 
that have the ability to improve 
efficiency in the aerospace, automotive 
and wind turbine industries, with the 
objective of accelerating their delivery 
to the market. This groundbreaking 
work will typify the quality of 
technological research SPark is seeking 
to achieve. 24 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010

At Greenwich Peninsula, the first two office 
buildings were completed during the financial 
year. These have robust environmental 
credentials, achieving a BREEAM Excellent 
rating. Among the features of the building that 
have produced this result are deep bore holes 
linked to heating and cooling beams throughout 
the building, using the natural heat within the 
earth to regulate temperature. The close proximity 
of the Tube, bus and river transport terminals to 
the building, easy access to cycle paths and 
integration of cycle storage facilities into the 
building reduce reliance on cars for commuting. 
Driving up rates of recycling
Envac – the UK’s first underground waste removal 
system – has had a good first year of operation at 
Wembley City, delivering recycling levels at twice 
those in the surrounding borough and as much as 
four times those usually achieved in high density 
apartment blocks. Subsequent to the year end 
recycling levels rose in one month to 50% as the 
education programme and continued support of 
new residents began to have an impact.  25
Overview Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Quintain’s ultimate aim is to own, 
promote and manage ground leased 
estates that are run as businesses, 
balanced by a large-scale fund 
management operation.
Owning these new estates for 
generations to come means that it is in 
the interests of Quintain to ensure they 
succeed. This long term interest in the 
towns we are building means that we 
naturally take an approach that will 
prove economically, socially and 
environmentally sustainable.
In addition to ensuring our major 
regeneration schemes are sustainable, 
we also seek to play a wider role  
in sustainable development.  
We do this by:
 Supporting living experiments, such •	
as One Brighton, that pioneer new 
ways of working and aim to achieve 
exceptional standards of 
sustainability
 Fostering joined-up thinking  •	
and action between the many 
stakeholders that seek to manage 
existing communities and build  
new ones
Sustainability Strategy
Our sustainability strategy is to remain 
at the forefront of sustainable urban 
development, gaining competitive 
advantage, market share and higher 
profitability from our reputation and 
actions. We believe that Quintain’s 
position as the property sector’s 
thought leader in sustainability is a vital 
component of our overall corporate 
reputation and a necessary part of  
our business model. This position 
underpins the future viability of the 
business, including for example our 
ability to win and realise major new 
regeneration schemes. It also reflects 
our commitment to the provision of a 
truly sustainable built environment.
Management of Sustainability
The Sustainability Committee was 
reformed during the year to encompass 
a wider group of senior managers that 
better reflects the various operational 
areas of the Group, and therefore 
accelerate the adoption of sustainable 
practices throughout the business. 
One member of the Committee is from 
an external organisation, ensuring that 
best practice and a fresh perspective 
are incorporated into our execution. 
For all development work 
requiring the Committee’s 
authorisation, the Capital Expenditure 
Committee now requires assessment 
of environmental impact prior to that 
authorisation being granted. This has 
deepened the understanding of many 
employees regarding the impact of the 
work they are commissioning and is 
designed to progressively reduce the 
impact of our development activities 
on the environment. 
The Company’s SC2 strategy 
seeks to ensure that sustainable 
practices are integrated into the 
development process from start to 
finish. All suppliers are now assessed 
on the basis of their sustainability 
credentials as well as ability to innovate, 
and on price. Lessons from teams 
working on individual development 
plots are captured at the conclusion 
of the build to ensure that an informed 
approach is taken at the start of 
subsequent build programmes. 
Quintain continues to support the 
Sustainable Environment Foundation, 
which was established by Adrian Wyatt 
in 2007. The purpose of the SEF is to 
promote the benefits and means by 
which carbon emissions will be reduced 
in the development and maintenance 
of the built environment. 
OneBrighton
Our major achievement during 
the year was the delivery of our first 
zero carbon scheme, OneBrighton. 
This 171-apartment development  
is already 90% sold or in lawyers’ 
hands, demonstrating strong 
appetite for a scheme that supports 
sustainable living in an otherwise 
challenging market. 
The development has been 
constructed using 25% recycled 
materials and all the energy  
required is generated on-site or from 
renewable sources. Among the  
many features designed to reduce 
environmental impact, the scheme 
features triple glazing for excellent 
thermal insulation and noise 
reduction and natural ventilation 
throughout the buildings. There  
are roof and sky gardens as well  
as 28 rooftop allotments available  
to residents. 
To support the philosophy of using 
locally sourced food, links have been 
established with a local farm, which 
delivers pre-ordered products to the 
scheme regularly. These are stored  
in purpose built compartments until 
residents are able to collect them. 
The full time green caretaker also 
helps residents to understand how 
they can improve the economic, 
social and environmental impact  
of their lifestyles 26 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Introduction
Following a very challenging year to March 2009 for the 
property sector, an ongoing programme of actions was 
undertaken to improve the stability of and prospects for the 
Company. This included extending the successful cash 
repatriation programme and further reductions in overheads 
as well as additional flexibility enhancements to the banking 
positions. Through its own actions the Company was able to 
deliver a stable financial position from which it launched a 
rights issue in November. This raised £183.1m net and will 
allow us to deliver the next phase of our regeneration projects 
and grow underlying earnings through investing in income-
generating opportunities both directly and through our fund 
management business.
Headline results
The basic net asset value per share at 31 March 2010 was 
120p, a decrease of 0.8% from 121p (adjusted for the rights 
issue) in the prior year. Adjusted diluted net asset value per 
share, the measure recommended by The European Public 
Real Estate Association (‘EPRA ’), fell by 1.5% to 133p per 
share (2009: 135p).

Total return
Quintain’s objective is to maximise long term total return  
to shareholders. In the year to 31 March 2010 the Company 
delivered a total return of (0.8)%, set against a backdrop of 
very challenging market conditions where actions were taken 
to safeguard the business. Quintain also did not benefit from 
the re-rating of prime property that took place in the second 
half of the year, with the majority of the Group’s assets held 
either in land and secondary assets where continuing political 
and economic uncertainty left these markets subdued, or in 
specialist asset classes where yields have been far more 
stable in both the downturn and the upswing.
Operating performance
EPRA earnings per share for the 12 months to 31 March 2010 
were 0.1p (2009: 4.6p). Excluding impairments, this would 
have been a positive 2.0p. The table below reconciles these 
numbers to the reported diluted earnings per share of a loss of 
3.3p (2009: loss of 39.1p). The main reconciling items are the 
impact of unrealised revaluation surpluses and deficits and 
losses on disposals. This year’s EPRA earnings include the 
impact of the impairment of goodwill.

Gross rental income, including our share of joint ventures, 
was £42.4m (2009: £45.1m) with sales of directly owned 
assets and units in Quercus reducing income received.  
The gross contractual annualised rent for directly owned 
properties at 31 March 2010 was £18.5m. This was below 
gross rental income because of net disposals in the year, rent 
free periods and the non-contractual receipt of £0.6m of rent 
from the Sunday market at Wembley.
Within the directly owned portfolio, there were no 
acquisitions in the period, although the impact of new leases 
added £1.3m, more than offsetting new void costs of £0.5m. 
Asset disposals reduced rental income by £0.9m. Within joint 
ventures, the sale of units in Quercus reduced income by 
£2.9m, with the full impact of £5.2m, incorporating the issue 
of new equity, reflected in contracted rent.

Voids, as a proportion of ERV, within directly owned 
properties reduced to 19.1% (2009: 19.8%). This is in line  
with our strategy of buying secondary assets featuring 
opportunities to create value through active management, 
subsequent to which the assets are sold.
The average unexpired lease term across the Group’s 
portfolio was 12 years (2009: 16 years). The reduction was 
mainly driven by a lower equity share in Quercus where the 
homes are typically let on 35 year RPI linked leases.

contracted annualised rent, for both our directly owned 
properties and our share of joint ventures across the Group:

Within joint ventures, the short term expiries relate to the iQ 
fund which includes direct lets to students and so leases  
will always be for one academic year. Bookings for the next 
academic year have already reached 71%, substantially ahead 
of bookings at the same point last year (2009: 53%).
Gross profits before impairments fell by 2.9% to £34.0m 
(2009: £35.0m). The impairment of £8.1m relates to City Park 
Gate in Birmingham, where a charge was taken in cost of 
sales before most of the asset was transferred from trading  
to investment properties. Gross profit is analysed in note 3 to 
the accounts and, in addition to rental income from directly 
owned properties, comprises:
 net income from hotel operations of £4.2m (2009: £3.9m) •	
which relates wholly to the Plaza Hotel at Wembley. 
The net contribution after overheads was £1.6m 
(2009: £1.4m); 
 other net income of £1.3m (2009: £1.4m) mainly related to •	
management and car parking fees and commissions 
through our Commercial Ventures at Wembley; 
 gross profit from the sale of trading properties of £0.1m •	
(2009: £nil) arose from the sale of 10 private units at 
Quadrant Court, Wembley City following practical 
completion in February 2010. The majority of the £11.1m 
turnover related to the sale of affordable units in that block 
and reflected a reimbursement of costs from housing 
associations. 
 fees from fund management and other related services  •	
of £11.9m (2009: £12.9m). The main contributors are 
highlighted in the table below. The contribution from 
Quercus included a performance fee of £6.1m compared 
with £7.1m for the previous year.

Administrative expenses were £21.1m (2009: £26.4m).  
The prior year charge includes an exceptional cost of £2.3m 
relating to the consideration of an equity raising. Further 
savings were made in the current year across staff and office 
costs. Costs may increase in the next financial year if higher 
levels of performance are achieved triggering potential bonus 
payments and incentives under share schemes. Additional 
information is given in note 4 to the accounts. 
Sale of non-current assets
Sales of these assets in the period with proceeds of £75.5m 
(2009: £31.1m) gave rise to a profit on historic cost of £12.5m 
(2009: £8.0m) and a loss against valuation of £7.7m (2009: 
£4.8m). Lack of liquidity in the market in the first six months 
of the year was a material factor in disposals taking place  
at below the previous valuation.
Revaluation surpluses and deficits
Following the amendment to IAS 40 under the IASB’s 
Improvement Project, all revaluation movements are now 
reflected through the Income Statement. The net revaluation 
surplus arising from directly held properties was £7.5m 
(2009: deficit of £280.3m of which £68.2m was reflected  
in the Income Statement with £212.1m through equity).  
These movements are discussed under Properties in the 
balance sheet section below. The revaluation movements  
on joint venture investments are incorporated within  
the share of profit from joint ventures which is discussed  
in more detail below. 
Financial Review

Overview Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Profit/(loss) from joint ventures
The loss from joint ventures in the year of £0.2m (2009: loss 
£47.3m) was driven by a revaluation deficit of £1.1m (2009: 
deficit of £72.7m in Income Statement with £0.5m through 
equity), losses on the disposal of non-current property assets 
of £2.1m (2009: loss £0.1m) and the breakage costs of swaps 
within iQ’s income statement of £1.4m.
The table below analyses the components of profit.  
The £3.5m fall in gross profit was accounted for by a £5.7m 
reduction from Quercus, due mainly to our lower holding in 
this fund as well as asset disposals within the Fund itself, 
partly offset by £1.9m of first time rental income from Pier 
Walk at Greenwich Peninsula. Administrative expenses  
fell from £7.9m to £5.0m. £2.5m of the reduction related to 
Quercus, partly reflecting our lower share of the Fund.
The valuation of joint venture assets at 31 March 2010, 
gave rise to a deficit of £1.1m. This compares with a deficit of 
£73.2m in the previous year. The assets held within specialist 
funds fell in value slightly, with yields remaining relatively 
stable during the year. Pier Walk at Greenwich Peninsula rose 
in value by £10.0m reflecting a compression in the yield from 
7 .25% to 6.0%.
Net finance costs were £11.6m (2009: £12.0m). Within iQ 
there was a charge of £1.4m for cancellation of hedging, and a 
charge of £0.6m for marking to market. This compares with a 
£3.6m negative mark to market for the prior year. There was  
a first time interest cost to the Income Statement of £1.8m  
for the loan on Pier Walk and Mitre Passage at Greenwich 
Peninsula. In line with our lower holding in Quercus, our share 
of net finance costs fell by £2.7m. The tax credit of £0.6m 
(2009: £23.9m) mainly relates to a release of deferred tax 
relating to the deficit on valuation.
A detailed breakdown of profit by joint venture is set out 
in note 11 to these accounts. An explanation of the activities 
of each joint venture below is given within the balance sheet 
section and a full analysis of key joint ventures is provided in

Impairment of other non-current investments
The charge of £0.2m related to a write-down in shares in a 
vehicle owning a hotel in Cambridge. The charge of £3.1m 
related to an impairment arising on the acquisition of the 
remaining 50.1% interest in BioRegional Quintain, and 
comprised mainly the historic losses on the acquired 
proportion. In the previous year an investment of £7.8m  
in Serrastone SA was fully written off.
Finance expenses
Net finance expenses were £11.6m (2009: £9.6m). Interest 
payable fell by £1.0m to £32.7m. Debt levels fell substantially 
in December 2009 on receipt of the proceeds of the rights 
issue. Reduced interest payable from lower average debt levels 
and interest rates was partially offset by the £6m amendment 
fee paid to give greater flexibility on covenants. The average 
cost of debt for the year to 31 March 2010 was 4.9% compared 
with 5.6% for the previous year. Of the interest capitalised in 
the year, £13.4m related to Wembley and £2.2m to Greenwich.
Interest receivable of £4.8m (2009: £9.7m) related to 
interest on cash deposits and loan notes to joint ventures. 
Interest receivable for the prior period also included a third 
party loan that was repaid during that year. The £0.7m credit 
for the change in fair value of financial instruments relates to 
the element of Quintain’s on-balance sheet swaps that are 
classified as ineffective hedges. In addition to this a £0.3m 
deficit has been reflected in equity.

has been credited to reserves (2009: £66.1m), reflecting a 
reduction in the deferred tax provision on the effective 
element of interest rate swaps. The prior year credit also 
included a reduction in the deferred tax provision in line  
with the valuation deficit for that year.  30 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Balance Sheet
As at 31 March 2010, the Group had directly held investment 
properties valued at £812.9m. This includes properties which 
under IAS 16 had previously been classified as development. 
The revaluation movement in the 12 months to 31 March 2010 
gave rise to a surplus of £7.5m (2009: deficit £280.3m). Net of 
capital expenditure, this represented an increase of 0.9%. 
Of the Group’s investment properties, £662.4m are 
within the Urban Regeneration Segment which, given the 
nature of the assets, is treated as a single operation. Within it, 
the two largest assets are Wembley City and Greenwich 
Peninsula and a further analysis of their valuations is set out 
below. Part of these assets are owned within joint ventures 
and so included within Investment in Joint Ventures.
Wembley City
£m
As at 1 April 2009 481.4
Expenditure on trading assets 19.1
Capital expenditure on investment assets 5.7
Capitalised interest 13.4
Disposals (18.8)
Valuation deficit (11.9)
As at 31 March 2010 488.9
The expenditure on trading assets related to the completion  
of Quadrant Court (W04) and the acquisition of Juniper Close, 
both at Wembley City. The capital expenditure was to deliver 
infrastructure, in particular in relation to the Western Core. 
Disposals included £5m for the sale of Fulton and Malcolm 
House and £13.8m for sales of residential units.
The valuation was driven by current market sentiment 
towards large scale regeneration projects, which remained 
subdued given economic and political uncertainties.  
Whilst the stand-back view takes priority, Savills’ valuation  
is supported with a buyer’s expectations of cashflows.  
Within the assessment of the cashflows the key change  
in variables from the previous year were lower forecasts  
for residential sales inflation, higher near term cost inflation 
and revised phasing and delivery of infrastructure. Given the 
ongoing economic concerns the discount rate remained 
unchanged at 15%. Of the standing assets, the only one  
that experienced material yield contraction was the Stadium 
Retail Park which is let on long leases. There the initial yield 
moved from 7 .75% to 5.75%.
Greenwich Peninsula

Capitalised interest 2.2
Disposals (11.8)
Valuation deficit 26.5
As at 31 March 2010 277.1
Within capital expenditure, £21.5m related to the completion 
of N0204, the first office buildings on the Peninsula.  
We disposed of our interests in The O2 for £11.8m. Of the 
valuation surplus £10.0m was accounted for by the uplift in 
the value of the N0204 commercial buildings. In particular the 
first of those, Pier Walk, being a prime building let for 20 years 
to TfL, experienced material yield contraction from 7 .25% to 
6.0%. As with Wembley, the ongoing economic uncertainties 
meant that market appetite for regeneration projects did not 
re-emerge in the way it did for prime commercial assets and 
therefore this aspect of the valuation was relatively flat. Within 
the assessment of the discounted cashflow, higher near term 
cost inflation and lower forecasts for residential sales inflation 
were offset by marginally higher base prices for apartments, 
as pricing evidence emerged and reallocation of development 
exposure between plots.
Capital commitments
The table below sets out capital commitments including  
our share of any commitments within joint ventures.  
Corsham Street is a student accommodation block that  
we have forward funded from the developer. On 1 April 2010

the asset will be sold into a joint venture before the next 
payment of £36m is due in the next financial year.

Quantum is a science park fund owned 50/50 with Aviva Life 
and Pensions UK Limited, managed by Aviva Investors. It has 
signed its first development agreement to build an 829,000 sq 
ft science and technology park, SPark at Emersons Green, 
Bristol and is now on site with phase one. Quantum will look 
to acquire further investment and development opportunities 
as appropriate. Details of this agreement and the plans for the 
Fund are set out in the Operational Review.
Minority interests
The Sequel Fund was created during the year with the 
intention of introducing equity partners into this secondary 
commercial portfolio. To date we have sold a minority stake, 
resulting in the Fund being accounted for as a subsidiary and 
minority interests of £0.3m (2009: £nil) shown in the Balance 
Sheet.
Financing strategy and capital structure
Our financial strategy in the medium term is to manage a 
level of debt that balances the risks to the business with the 
higher returns on equity that, over time, will accrue due to the 
lower cost of debt. Gearing levels, being the proportion of debt 
compared with equity, will vary depending on the profile of 
operational risks, the capital that is currently committed or 
expected to be committed in the future and the cyclical high 
or low of property valuations. 
Our financing structure needs to be flexible and cost 
effective. This has been achieved through securing funding  
at the corporate level, giving us the scope to fund efficiently  
all areas of the portfolio which otherwise would be more 
challenging, such as infrastructure works at Wembley  
and Greenwich. It also provides us with liquidity and 
operational flexibility.
Towards the end of the last financial year to March 2009 
and beginning of this, we negotiated additional headroom on 
all of our corporate bilateral facilities. This allowed us for each 
of three years, in return for paying a 1% amendment fee, to 
increase the maximum gearing covenant from 110% to 150%. 
Because of the significant reduction in gearing arising mainly 
from the rights issue, we have elected not to apply the option 
for the current year. Other flexibility changes, such as the 
ability to elect to exclude losses from the interest cover 
calculation in return for pro-rata repaying and cancelling of 
facilities, remain in place. The average margin on the bilateral 
facilities is now running at 1.4%. 32 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The weighted average rate of interest of the Group’s debt at 
the year end was 6.2% (2009: 4.0%). The rights issue proceeds 
were used to pay down floating rate debt, so increasing the 
average cost of debt for the last quarter. This cost reduces as 
£100m of 3% swaps expired in May 2010. Also in May 2010 
we reset the 5% 2013 swaps to the current market price of 
1.735% following consent from all the bilateral facilities that 
the £14.4m NPV of the transaction will be excluded from the 
interest charge in calculating the interest cover ratio.

** This excludes £15m of facilities cancelled after the year end.
Hedging
The corporate bilateral facilities require that a minimum of 
50% of exposure to interest rate movements is hedged. As at 
31 March 2010, Quintain’s interest rate risk was 122% hedged 
by swaps. The over-hedging arose because of the net £183.1m 
of rights issue proceeds being used to pay down debt.  
The over-hedging fell away after the year end with the expiry 
in May 2010 of £100m of 3% swaps. 
In addition, as explained above, since the year end  
we have reset the 5% 2013 swaps to current market price of 
1.735%. This followed consent from all the bilateral facilities 
that the £14.4m NPV of the transaction will be excluded from 
the interest charge in calculating the interest cover ratio.
The fair value adjustment at 31 March 2010 of interest rate 
hedging instruments was a surplus of £0.4m (2009: deficit 
£31.1m). Of the movement during the year, £0.7m was 
credited to the Income Statement, being the element relating 
to non-cashflow hedges and £0.3m debited directly to equity. 
This unrealised adjustment is excluded in calculating gearing 
for covenant calculation purposes.
In relation to joint ventures, the fair value adjustment on 
these interest rate hedging instruments was a deficit of £0.6m 
(2009: deficit £15.3m) all of which was debited to the Income 
Statement. 
A 50 basis point increase or decrease during the year 
would have changed profit before tax by £0.5m. Whilst at this 
level it is symmetrical, when interest rates reach a level where 
the caps become effective, increasing rates have a lesser 
impact on the cost than reducing rates do on cost savings.
The Quercus Fund has floating rate non-recourse debt  
of which 87% was hedged by swaps at 31 March 2010. 
Quintain’s share of the fair value surplus was £0.2m.  
This is reflected in equity. 
The iQ joint venture also has floating rate non-recourse 
debt of which 132% was hedged with caps and floors at 
31 March 2010. The over-hedging position will diminish as 
the existing pipeline is built out and new schemes are brought 
forward. Of the fair value deficit, Quintain recognised £0.6m 
in the Income Statement and £0.4m in equity.
The N0204 joint venture as at 31 March 2010 had fixed 
80% of its floating debt at 5.28%. Quintain’s share of the fair 
value surplus, reflected in equity, was £0.2m. Whilst the debt 
is non-recourse, there is a contingent equity element. Details 
of these are set out in note 19 to the accounts.
Cashflow
Net cash generated from operating activities was £(30.6)m 
(2009: £3.7m). This included a £28.3m outflow for purchases 
and capital expenditure within trading properties. 
Distributions of £8.9m (2009: £5.9m) from joint ventures are 
included within the investing activities and wholly related to 
Quercus. Alongside net proceeds on disposals, this gave rise 
to a net cash inflow from investing activities of £27.3m (2009: 
outflow £3.4m). The rights issue proceeds of £183.1m were 
mainly used to pay down debt, leaving a net cash inflow from 
financing activities of £41.3m (2009: outflow £19.9m).

Overview Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Accounting
From 1 April 2009 development properties are treated in line 
with investment properties under IAS 40, whereby valuation 
movements on development properties are reflected in the 
Income Statement rather than through equity as previously 
treated under IAS 16. As it has only been applied 
prospectively, prior year results have not been restated.
Key Performance Indicators
We measure our performance both financially and in terms  
of the service we provide to our stakeholders. The leading 
indicators measuring our performance against the key 
elements of our objectives and strategy are:
Financial Performance Indicator Target One year Five years
Total return* 10% Real (0.8)% (5.1)%
IPD Performance**
Top 
quartile
95th 
percentile
19th 
percentile
* Total return is the movement in net asset value per share adjusted for 
the dividends paid in the year as a percentage of the opening net asset 
value per share.
** The IPD performance is measured in comparison with the March 
Universe.
Our total return target is set to be a challenging medium term 
goal. Quintain has not been immune from the significant 
issues faced by the property industry over the last two years 
and in particular the total return in the previous year of (39)% 
has materially impacted the five year return. However, we 
remain focused on this target and believe that, with the stable 
platform we have built this year, the target is challenging but 
achievable in the medium term. Quintain underperformed 
IPD for the first time in 10 years this year. In particular we did 
not benefit from the re-rating of prime stock that took place in 
the second half of last year, with the majority of the assets 
held in land and secondary assets where continuing political 
and economic uncertainty left these markets subdued, and in 
specialist asset classes where yields had been far more stable 
in both the downturn and the upswing. Considered over five 
years, our performance improves considerably delivering a top 
quartile position. Over the 17 years since inception, Quintain 
is in the first percentile.
In addition to these financial measures, we monitor the 
security of the business by reference to the key banking 
covenants and by our stated objective to achieve a cashflow 
positive position as quickly as possible post the rights issue 
and then build on this to allow the payment of a covered 
dividend.

* Interest cover, per our banking covenants, is defined as operating profit 
before net finance expenses plus realised surpluses on disposals 
divided by net finance costs excluding mark to market adjustments.
** Gearing, per our banking covenants, is defined as the ratio of net 
borrowings of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries to 
equity shareholders’ funds adjusted for deferred tax and mark to 
market movements.
*** Operating cashflow is defined as operating cashflow after cash 
interest excluding investment in current assets and swap breakage 
costs adding back dividends received from joint ventures.
Interest cover and gearing remain firmly within the tighter 
internal limits. The internal limit on gearing includes an 
allowance for position in the cycle, so the gearing limit will fall 
as the market rises.
As highlighted in both the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive’s statements, a key milestone for the business is to 
become cashflow positive on a recurring basis and part of the 
proceeds of the rights issue has been allocated to achieve 
this.
At Quintain our most important asset is our staff, whose 
retention and motivation is crucial to the success of the 
Company. From our annual staff survey we gain significant 
feedback, which we act upon. Here we have identified the key 
measure of those that feel ‘very happy at work’ .

Risk Management
In addition to those general economic, security and regulatory 
risks faced by a wide range of companies that are part of the 
general commercial environment, we consider there to be a 
number of specific risks that are faced by our Company.
How we manage risk
In managing the business, the identification and monitoring 
of risk is crucial. During the year Grant Thornton was appointed 
to interrogate and refine our risk register, introducing a more 
robust method of assessment of risk and the effectiveness of 
mitigating actions. A detailed risk register is updated regularly 
and those responsible for managing areas of risk are required 
to report on them every six months, and by exception. Our 
internal audit function reviews the risk register for completeness 
and accuracy. They also carry out with the internal team a 
risk workshop on a six monthly basis. All those that have 
responsibility for any risk areas are invited and all aspects  
of the Group are considered in order to promote a wider 
understanding of risk in the business. In addition, the risk 
register is considered by the Audit Committee. The Risk 
Committee debates key risks and mitigation on a regular 
basis. Set out below are management’s view of the current 
key specific business risks and action taken in mitigation.
Financial Review
continued
Risks and mitigation
Description and implication of risk Mitigation
Property valuations 
Property valuations are inherently subjective and uncertain. 
This is more acute both in current markets where transaction 
volumes are lower than average and in relation to our major 
regeneration projects which are unique with comparables 
used varying materially more than for investment properties. 
 
We use external independent valuers that are well regarded in the industry. We keep 
in close contact to understand how valuations are moving. With respect to the urban 
regeneration properties, valuers support their stand back valuation with their own 
simplified cashflow model.
Banking covenants
The two key financial covenants within the corporate bilateral 
facilities are gearing and interest cover. The gearing ratio of 
46% is significantly below the covenant of 110%. Interest cover 
for the year was 2.8 times against a covenant of 1.25 times.
 
Covenants are forecast and monitored on a regular basis. Internal guidelines which 
have been endorsed by the Board operate at tighter levels of control than the external 
covenants and incorporate the impact of positioning in the cycle to encourage 
significant headroom at the top of the cycle. In re-pricing the 2013 swaps to market, 
the banks have agreed to exclude the NPV payment from interest cover which 
materially increases headroom against forecast for the next three years. The 
corporate debt remains fully hedged to assist in cost certainty and part of the 
proceeds of the rights issue was set aside to invest in income producing assets and 
build the fund management business to improve the income profile of the Group.
Development
The Group is exposed to risks associated with development 
projects. Delays could occur for regulatory or funding reasons. 
Counterparty risk remains high with a risk that contractors 
may become bankrupt or insolvent. This also applies to other 
counterparties such as development partners who may fail to 
meet their obligations. Control of timing and construction 
costs are vital to prevent overspend or delays once on site. 
 
Quintain’s in-house project management team transfers risk to contractors where 
possible and employs a culture of no changes once the design is agreed. The supply 
chain management initiative, SC2, is creating increasing visibility into opportunities 
for cost control and reduction, whilst standardisation across Quintain’s projects will 
increase predictability and provide economies of scale. Structuring of deals and 
retentions provide some support against counterparty risk.
Market
The Group’s business is dependent on the general economic 
and property market conditions in the United Kingdom. 
Deterioration in residential and commercial property markets 
could lead to further declines in the value of the Group’s 
property portfolio, tenant default and a reduction in income 
from these properties. Land, which makes up 45.5% of the 
Group’s gross assets, tends to experience greater volatility  
in valuations than income producing assets.
 
There is significant diversification in the profile of assets, from nursing homes with RPI 
linked long leases and minimum rental uplifts, to direct lets of student accommodation, 
secondary regional property with a wide tenant base and regeneration projects with 
lower initial income profiles. Whilst the Group has a considerable quantity of planning 
consents, we have few development obligations. The largest tenant at 7 .9% of 
contracted annualised rent is Transport for London, which is effectively a Government 
covenant. Live Nation, operating Wembley Arena, is the second largest, comprising 
4.6% of contracted annualised rent. This exposure is reduced by receipts equating to 
approximately half of the rent being received in Quintain controlled bank accounts 
before being passed on and also by Quintain’s ability to step in to the business.
Reputation
Quintain’s reputation with many stakeholders is important  
in the continued effective operations of the business.  
Support from the public sector is essential in continuing  
to achieve detailed planning consents. Relationships  
with joint venture partners and other professional 
organisations are critical in delivery of the business.
 
Ongoing senior management engagement with stakeholders. All deals that may 
have a material impact on reputation must be reviewed by the Board. In order to 
increase our understanding and manage the risk, we recently commissioned a 
perceptions audit and are creating an action plan to address any concerns that arise.
Personnel
The loss of key personnel could affect delivery of the business 
strategy. This risk is currently increased because share 
incentive packages have very little value or no value.
 
A new share incentive plan will be implemented subject to shareholder consent at 
the next AGM. In order to understand and address employees’ issues within the 
business there is an annual employee survey, the findings of which are openly 
disclosed and addressed. There are regular formal staff meetings and monthly 
informal events at which staff can communicate with senior management, as well 
as weekly transmission of news and successes allowing all employees to understand 
the activities around the Group and the impact of their contribution.
The detailed assessment of financial risk management covering credit, liquidity and market risk is set out in note 19 to the accounts. 35

The	 trustees	 of	 the	 Quintain	 Estates	 and	 Development	 plc	
Employee	 Benefits	 Trust	 have	 waived	 the	 dividend	 on	 the	
shares	 of	 Quintain	 Estates	 and	 Development	 plc	 held	 within	
the	 trust	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis.	 During	 the	 year,	 no	 dividend	
was	 paid	 and	 no	 final	 dividend	 is	 being	 recommended.	 	
As	 at	 31	 March	 2010,	 2,534,193	 shares	 were	 held	 in	 trust.
Payment policy
The	 Group’s	 policy	 is	 to	 pay,	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 dispute,	
amounts	 due	 to	 trade	 and	 other	 suppliers	 as	 expeditiously	 as	
possible	 within	 their	 terms	 of	 payment.	 Group	 trade	 creditors	
at	 the	 year	 end	 represent	 approximately	 10	 days’	 purchases	
(2009:	 10	 days).
Purchase of own shares
The	 Company	 was	 granted	 authority	 at	 the	 Extraordinary	
General	 Meeting	 in	 November	 2009	 to	 purchase	 its	 own	
shares	 up	 to	 a	 total	 aggregate	 value	 of	 10%	 of	 the	 issued	
nominal	 capital.	 No	 shares	 were	 purchased	 during	 the	 year

directors	 were	 granted	 authority	 to	 allot	 and	 issue	 relevant	
securities	 up	 to	 a	 maximum	 aggregate	 nominal	 amount	 of	
£43,372,268.	 At	 the	 same	 meeting,	 the	 directors	 were	 further	
authorised	 to	 allot,	 on	 a	 non	 pre-emptive	 basis,	 ordinary	
shares	 up	 to	 a	 maximum	 aggregate	 nominal	 amount	 of	
£6,505,840,	 being	 5%	 of	 the	 nominal	 value	 of	 the	 issued	 share	
capital.	 Both	 authorities	 expire	 on	 the	 date	 of	 the	 2010	 AGM,	
at	 which	 resolutions	 will	 be	 proposed	 for	 their	 renewal.
Share capital
The	 issued	 share	 capital	 of	 the	 Company	 is	 comprised	 of	
ordinary	 shares	 of	 25p	 each.	 Each	 share	 carries	 the	 right	 to	
one	 vote	 per	 share	 on	 a	 poll.	 The	 liability	 of	 members	 of	 the	
Company	 is	 limited	 to	 the	 amount	 unpaid,	 if	 any,	 on	 the	
shares	 held	 by	 them.	 All	 issued	 shares	 of	 the	 Company	 are	
fully	 paid.

Company’s	 share	 rights	 scheme.
•	 	 248,254	 ordinary	 shares	 were	 issued,	 by	 way	 of	 a	 placing,

the	 rights	 issue	 announced	 and	 approved	 by	 shareholders	
in	 November	 2009.	
Changes	 to	 the	 Company’s	 share	 capital	 are	 set	 out	 	
in	 note	 22	 on	 pages	 93	 and	 94.	 The	 Company	 has	 taken	
advantage	 of	 the	 provision	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 to	
abolish	 its	 authorised	 share	 capital	 and	 as	 at	 31	 March	 2010,	
the	 issued	 share	 capital	 stood	 at	 £130,116,804	 (including	 5,234	
treasury	 shares	 with	 a	 nominal	 value	 of	 £1,309).
There	 are	 no	 specific	 restrictions	 on	 the	 size	 of	 a	 holding	
nor	 on	 the	 transfer	 of	 shares.	 No	 person	 has	 any	 special	 rights	
of	 control	 over	 the	 Company’s	 share	 capital	 and	 all	 issued	
shares	 are	 fully	 paid.
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Company	 did	 not	 purchase	 any	
shares	 as	 treasury	 shares.	
Use of financial instruments
Information	 on	 the	 use	 of	 financial	 instruments	 by	 the	 Group	
is	 contained	 in	 the	 section	 on	 Financing	 Strategy	 and	 Capital	
Structure	 in	 the	 Operational	 and	 Financial	 Review	 on	 pages	
31	 to	 32	 and	 in	 note	 20	 on	 pages	 91	 and	 92.
Directors’ indemnities
At	 the	 AGM	 held	 in	 September	 2005,	 shareholders	 authorised	
the	 Company	 to	 indemnify	 directors	 of	 the	 Company	 against	
claims	 by	 third	 parties	 and	 to	 pay	 the	 cost	 of	 defending	 such	
claims	 in	 advance	 of	 a	 claim	 being	 decided.	 Express	 provision	
was	 made	 that	 such	 funds	 would	 need	 to	 be	 repaid	 where	 the	
director	 is	 convicted	 or	 judgement	 given	 against	 him	 or	 her.	
Revised	 indemnities,	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 provision	 of	 the	
Companies	 Act	 2006,	 were	 approved	 in	 March	 2010.	 As	 at	 the	
date	 of	 this	 report,	 an	 indemnity	 was	 in	 existence	 for	 each	 of

the	 Company	 is	 party	 that	 take	 effect,	 alter	 or	 terminate	 upon	
a	 change	 of	 control	 of	 the	 Company	 following	 a	 takeover	 bid,	
and	 the	 effects	 of	 any	 such	 agreements.	
The	 Group’s	 banking	 facilities	 include	 provisions	 which	
require	 the	 Company	 to	 notify	 its	 bankers	 in	 the	 event	 of	 a	
change	 of	 control.	 Thereafter,	 the	 banks	 may,	 within	 30	 days,	
cancel	 the	 Company’s	 banking	 facilities	 and	 request	 the	
immediate	 repayment	 of	 all	 amounts	 due	 to	 them.

person	 (or	 its	 associates)	 and	 50%	 or	 more	 of	 the	 executive	
directors	 of	 the	 Company	 (over	 the	 previous	 12	 months)	 cease	
to	 be	 executive	 directors	 of	 the	 Company	 or	 another	 Quintain	
Group	 Company.	
The	 conditional	 agreement	 relating	 to	 the	 construction	
and	 management	 of	 a	 new	 hotel	 at	 Wembley	 between	 Hilton	
International	 Co	 and	 Quintain	 Group	 companies	 contains	
change	 of	 control	 provisions	 whereby	 Hilton	 may	 terminate	
the	 agreement	 in	 the	 event	 that	 25%	 or	 more	 of	 the	 issued	
shares	 in	 the	 Company	 are	 held	 by	 certain	 identified	
categories	 of	 persons	 to	 whom	 Hilton	 objects.	
Key contractual arrangements
The	 Group	 has	 a	 number	 of	 joint	 venture	 arrangements,	 as	
discussed	 in	 note	 11	 of	 the	 financial	 statements.	 The	 directors

Committee Chairman’s note
I	 am	 pleased	 to	 present	 the	 Remuneration	 Report	 for	 the	
2009/10	 financial	 year.	
The	 past	 year	 continued	 to	 be	 challenging	 for	 all	
businesses,	 and	 Quintain	 has	 had	 to	 operate	 in	 what	 are	
undoubtedly	 tough	 market	 conditions.	 Naturally	 the	 current	
economic	 environment	 presents	 new	 challenges	 from	 a	
remuneration	 perspective.	
The	 Committee	 has	 sought	 to	 be	 pro-active	 and	
continues	 to	 take	 a	 responsible	 approach	 to	 remuneration.	 	
Our	 executive	 directors	 have	 also	 supported	 this	 approach.	
A	 summary	 of	 the	 main	 remuneration	 related	 decisions	 made	
in	 relation	 to	 the	 year	 under	 review	 are	 outlined	 below:
•	 	 During	 the	 year	 under	 review,	 on	 a	 voluntary	 basis,	
executive	 directors	 elected	 to	 waive	 an	 amount	 equivalent	
to	 10%	 of	 their	 basic	 salary,	 part	 of	 which	 included	
foregoing	 their	 car	 allowance.	 Other	 senior	 members	 	
of	 the	 management	 team	 also	 agreed	 to	 forgo	 their	 car	
allowances.
•	 	 No	 bonus	 payments	 will	 be	 made	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 2009/10	
financial	 year	 under	 the	 corporate	 bonus	 scheme	 nor	 were	
any	 paid	 in	 the	 year	 under	 review	 relating	 to	 the	 previous	
financial	 year.
•	 	 No	 awards	 were	 granted	 under	 the	 Company’s	 share	
incentive	 plans	 during	 2009/10.
The	 Committee	 is	 currently	 putting	 together	 proposals	 on	 	
the	 remuneration	 structure	 at	 Quintain,	 on	 which	 it	 will	 be	
consulting	 with	 its	 major	 shareholders.	 Full	 details	 of	 any	
proposed	 changes	 will	 be	 included	 in	 the	 Notice	 of	 Annual	
General	 Meeting	 which	 will	 be	 sent	 to	 shareholders	 in	 good	
time	 for	 the	 AGM	 on	 7	 September	 2010.	 The	 Remuneration	
Committee	 is	 keen	 to	 ensure	 that	 Quintain’s	 remuneration	
arrangements	 for	 senior	 executives	 suitably	 reflects	 the	
external	 environment,	 whilst	 supporting	 the	 Company’s	
future	 strategy	 and	 also	 continuing	 to	 be	 competitive	 	
in	 the	 market	 in	 which	 we	 compete	 for	 talent.	
Remuneration Report 43
Overview Operational	 and	 Financial	 Review Governance Financial	 Statements Corporate	 Information
Introduction
The	 focus	 of	 this	 report	 is	 on	 the	 Group’s	 remuneration	 policy	
as	 it	 applies	 to	 directors	 and	 senior	 managers.	 It	 sets	 out	 the	
Group’s	 remuneration	 policy	 and	 also	 gives	 details	 of	 the	
salaries,	 incentives,	 shares	 and	 pensions	 received	 by	 all	 the	
directors	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010.
This	 report	 has	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	
Large	 and	 Medium-sized	 Companies	 and	 Groups	 (Accounts	
and	 Reports)	 Regulations	 2008	 (the	 “Regulations”)	 and	 the	
Listing	 Rules.	 KPMG	 Audit	 Plc	 has	 audited	 the	 directors’	
emoluments,	 pensions,	 share	 option	 and	 long	 term	 incentive	
scheme	 sections	 of	 this	 report	 to	 the	 extent	 required	 by	 the	
Regulations.
The Remuneration Committee
Details	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee’s	 role	 are	 set	 out	 in	
the	 Corporate	 Governance	 Report	 on	 pages	 52	 to	 55	 and	 its	
membership	 on	 pages	 36	 and	 37.	 The	 Committee	 met	 seven	
times	 during	 the	 year	 with	 full	 attendance	 on	 all	 but	 one	
occasion,	 on	 which	 Joan	 MacNaughton	 was	 unable	 to	 attend.
The	 Committee	 is	 directly	 responsible	 to	 shareholders	
and,	 as	 in	 previous	 years,	 its	 Chairman	 will	 be	 present	 	
at	 the	 AGM	 to	 answer	 any	 questions	 from	 shareholders.	
Martin	 Meech	 will	 be	 offering	 himself	 for	 re-election	 as	
Chairman	 of	 the	 Committee	 by	 shareholders	 at	 the	 AGM.	
The	 Committee’s	 terms	 of	 reference	 are	 available	 	
on	 the	 Company	 website	 or	 on	 request	 from	 the	 Company’s	
registered	 office.	 They	 are	 consistent	 with	 the	
recommendations	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code	 on	 Corporate	
Governance.
The	 Committee	 were	 assisted	 by	 the	 Company	
Secretary,	 Sue	 Dixon,	 who	 attended	 meetings	 by	 invitation.	
No	 executive	 director	 plays	 any	 part	 in	 the	 discussions	
regarding	 the	 determination	 of	 his/her	 own	 remuneration	
package.	 Until	 28	 February	 2010,	 the	 Chairman,	 attended	
meetings	 of	 the	 Committee	 by	 invitation;	 thereafter	 he	 was	
appointed	 as	 a	 member	 of	 the	 Committee.
In	 remuneration	 matters,	 the	 Committee	 has	 the	
authority	 and	 funding	 to	 obtain	 independent	 advice.	 During	
the	 year	 and	 since	 the	 year	 end,	 advice	 has	 been	 sought	 from	
Deloitte	 LLP,	 who	 were	 appointed	 by	 the	 Committee	 and	 who	
also	 provide	 taxation	 advice	 to	 the	 Company.	
Remuneration policy
The	 Committee’s	 policy	 is	 to	 set	 remuneration	 at	 levels	 which	
attract,	 retain	 and	 motivate	 individuals	 of	 the	 high	 calibre	
required	 by	 the	 business,	 while	 taking	 account	 of	 pay	 and	
conditions	 in	 the	 Group	 as	 a	 whole.	
The	 Committee	 takes	 full	 account	 of	 the	 interests	 of	 the	
shareholders	 and	 the	 remuneration	 practices	 of	 other	 relevant	
companies	 when	 determining	 the	 size	 and	 structure	 of	
executive	 pay.	 The	 Group	 is	 committed	 to	 ensuring	 that	
linkage	 between	 performance	 and	 executive	 remuneration	 	
is	 maintained.	
The	 Committee’s	 intention	 is	 that	 base	 salaries	 would	
be	 subject	 to	 periodic	 reviews	 to	 ensure	 market	
competitiveness	 and	 reflect	 the	 performance	 of	 each	 director.	
In	 order	 to	 link	 executive	 performance	 with	 shareholder	
returns,	 increasing	 emphasis	 has	 been	 and	 will	 continue	 to	 be	
placed	 on	 performance	 related	 pay.	 In	 terms	 of	 variable	 pay,	
directors	 participate	 in	 the	 bonus	 scheme,	 and	 hold	 awards	
under	 the	 share	 rights,	 option	 and	 long	 term	 incentive	 plans.	
During	 the	 year	 no	 awards	 were	 granted	 to	 directors	 under	
the	 Company’s	 discretionary	 share	 plans.
The	 fee	 structure	 for	 non-executive	 directors	 is	 reviewed	
periodically	 by	 the	 executive	 directors	 and	 are	 set	 to	 reflect	
the	 time	 commitments	 and	 levels	 of	 responsibility	 expected	 	
of	 them.	 There	 has	 been	 no	 change	 in	 their	 fee	 structure	 since	
April	 2006. 44	 Quintain	 Estates	 &	 Development	 plc Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2010
Other directorships
The	 Company’s	 policy	 is	 that	 executive	 directors	 may	 accept	
outside	 appointments	 provided	 they	 do	 not	 prejudice	 their	
ability	 to	 carry	 out	 their	 responsibilities	 at	 Quintain.	 Whether	
an	 executive	 director	 is	 entitled	 to	 retain	 any	 related	 fees	 will	
be	 considered	 on	 a	 case-by-case	 basis.
During	 the	 year,	 no	 executive	 director	 held	 any	 non-
Group	 related	 directorships,	 except	 for	 Tonianne	 Dwyer,	 who	
is	 a	 director	 of	 two	 flat	 management	 companies	 and	 receives	
no	 remuneration	 for	 this,	 and	 Adrian	 Wyatt,	 who	 represents	
the	 Company	 as	 a	 trustee	 of	 the	 Sustainable	 Environment	
Foundation	 and	 receives	 no	 remuneration	 for	 this.
Payments in respect of former directors
In	 November	 2008,	 the	 Company	 entered	 into	 a	 12	 month	
advisory	 agreement	 with	 a	 former	 director,	 Lady	 Judge	 at	 	
a	 cost	 of	 £55,000	 per	 annum.	 The	 arrangements	 lapsed	 in	
November	 2009.
Service contracts
None	 of	 the	 executive	 directors’	 service	 contracts	 has	 a	 	
notice	 period	 in	 excess	 of	 six	 months	 or	 contain	 liquidated	
damages	 provisions	 or	 provision	 for	 compensation	 for	 loss	 	
of	 office	 on	 early	 termination	 or	 change	 of	 control.	 Contracts	
do	 not	 provide	 for	 mitigation	 in	 the	 event	 of	 termination	 at	
short	 notice.

Overview Operational	 and	 Financial	 Review Governance Financial	 Statements Corporate	 Information
Remuneration of directors and senior staff
The	 directors’	 remuneration	 and	 that	 of	 senior	 staff	 (defined	 	
in	 the	 Committee’s	 Terms	 of	 Reference	 as	 employees	 whose	
annual	 salary	 is	 £150,000	 per	 annum	 or	 above)	 and	 the	 terms	
of	 their	 employment	 are	 reviewed	 at	 least	 annually	 in	 relation	
to	 best	 practice	 and	 benchmarked	 against	 relevant	
comparator	 industry	 data	 where	 available.
In	 considering	 remuneration	 levels,	 the	 Committee	
makes	 reference	 to	 the	 contribution	 each	 individual	 has	 made	
to	 the	 Group	 and	 also	 to	 its	 performance	 as	 a	 whole,	 measured	
in	 terms	 of	 contribution	 to	 net	 asset	 value	 per	 share,	 both	 in	
absolute	 terms	 and	 relative	 to	 the	 property	 sector.
Base	 salaries	 are	 normally	 reviewed	 annually	 with	 	
any	 changes	 taking	 effect	 from	 the	 commencement	 of	 the	
accounting	 period.	 The	 audited	 base	 salaries	 and	 benefits	 	
for	 each	 director	 are	 set	 out	 on	 page	 46.
In	 December	 2008	 each	 of	 the	 executive	 directors	 	
and	 the	 Chairman,	 being	 mindful	 of	 the	 prevailing	 market	
condition	 under	 which	 the	 Company	 operates,	 agreed,	 on	 a	
voluntary	 basis,	 to	 forgo	 an	 amount	 equivalent	 to	 10%	 of	 their	
basic	 salary,	 part	 of	 which	 included	 waiving	 their	 car	
allowances.	
Having	 given	 due	 consideration	 to	 industry	 pay	 	
trends	 and	 employment	 conditions	 in	 the	 wider	 Group,	 the	
Committee	 determined	 that	 executive	 directors	 (and	 other	
staff)	 would	 not	 receive	 any	 salary	 increases	 as	 part	 of	 the	
2009	 salary	 review	 process.
Discretionary bonus scheme
The	 Group	 operates	 a	 discretionary	 bonus	 scheme	 which	 is	
designed	 to	 be	 a	 performance-related	 incentive	 scheme	 to	
reward	 executive	 directors	 and	 senior	 staff	 and	 provide	
motivation	 and	 identification	 with	 the	 success	 of	 the	 Group.
For	 the	 Committee	 to	 exercise	 its	 discretion	 and	
recommend	 the	 payment	 of	 bonuses,	 the	 guidelines	 currently	
adopted	 by	 the	 Committee	 reference	 the	 Group’s	 medium-term	
objectives	 to	 not	 only	 outperform	 the	 average	 of	 the	 IPD	 index	
but	 also	 achieve	 a	 real	 rate	 of	 return	 year	 on	 year	 in	 excess	 of	
10%,	 calculated	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 increase	 in	 shareholders’	
funds	 as	 adjusted	 for	 any	 capital	 variations	 and	 the	 annual	
dividend.	 The	 Committee	 keeps	 the	 performance	 targets	 	
for	 the	 bonus	 plan	 under	 review	 and	 where	 appropriate,	
supplementary	 financial,	 individual	 or	 strategic	 goals	 may	
also	 be	 considered	 in	 respect	 of	 future	 awards.
In	 normal	 circumstances,	 under	 this	 scheme	 executive	
directors	 are	 able	 to	 receive	 up	 to	 100%,	 and	 senior	 staff	 up	 to	
50%,	 of	 base	 salary	 in	 cash.
In	 general,	 any	 award	 above	 this	 level	 is	 deferred	 as	
shares	 under	 the	 Company’s	 Deferred	 Bonus	 Plan	 for	 three	
years.	 The	 Committee	 also	 has	 the	 discretion	 to	 recommend	
the	 payment	 of	 an	 additional	 bonus	 to	 a	 director	 or	 other	
member	 of	 staff	 or	 to	 vary	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 arrangements	
outlined	 above	 for	 exceptional	 performance	 over	 and	 above	
the	 already	 high	 standard	 required.
The	 corporate	 performance	 condition	 in	 respect	 of	 the	
year	 ended	 31	 March	 2009	 was	 not	 achieved	 and	
consequently,	 no	 bonus	 was	 paid	 in	 June	 2009.	
In	 respect	 of	 the	 2009/10	 financial	 year,	 no	 bonuses	 will	
be	 paid	 to	 Adrian	 Wyatt	 or	 Nicholas	 Shattock.	 In	 March	 2010,	
the	 Committee	 determined	 that	 an	 award	 equivalent	 to	 26%	
of	 basic	 salary	 should	 be	 paid	 to	 Rebecca	 Worthington	 for	 	
her	 exceptional	 performance	 during	 the	 extremely	 difficult	
conditions	 in	 which	 the	 Company	 had	 operated	 during	 the	
year.	 The	 strategic	 importance	 of	 her	 contribution	 was	 vital	 	
to	 creating	 a	 platform	 for	 the	 future	 success	 of	 the	 Company	
and	 therefore	 the	 Committee	 determined	 that	 the	 payment	
was	 in	 the	 best	 interests	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 shareholders.
The	 shares	 held	 beneficially	 for	 the	 executive	 directors	
under	 the	 Deferred	 Bonus	 Plan	 were	 released	 to	 them,	 at	 nil	
cost,	 during	 the	 year.	 These	 shares	 were	 awarded	 to	 them	 	
in	 respect	 of	 performance	 in	 the	 2005/06	 and	 2006/07	
financial	 years. 46	 Quintain	 Estates	 &	 Development	 plc Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2010

Pensions
The	 Group	 makes	 payments	 into	 personal	 pension	 plans	
arranged	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 executive	 directors	 at	 the	 rate	 	
of	 15%	 of	 base	 salary,	 except	 for	 the	 Chief	 Executive,	 	
Adrian	 Wyatt,	 who	 received	 a	 cash	 payment	 of	 16.9%	 	
(less	 an	 amount	 equivalent	 to	 employers’	 national	 insurance	
at	 12.8%)	 in	 lieu	 of	 payments	 into	 a	 pension	 plan.
For	 other	 head	 office	 staff,	 the	 rate	 of	 contribution	 into	
personal	 pension	 plans	 is	 12.5%.	 For	 staff	 employed	 by	 other	
Group	 companies,	 the	 schemes	 in	 place	 provide	 for	 employer’s	
contributions	 ranging	 from	 3%	 to	 8%	 of	 base	 salary.
All	 executive	 directors	 and	 staff	 have	 access	 to	 the	
advice	 of	 an	 Independent	 Financial	 Adviser	 in	 relation	 to	 their	
pensions,	 which	 is	 offered	 at	 the	 Group’s	 expense.
Share plans 
The	 Company	 operates	 various	 employee	 share	 plans	 which	
are	 used	 to	 incentivise	 and	 motivate	 both	 the	 executive	
directors	 and	 wider	 employee	 population.	 Non-executive	
directors	 do	 not	 participate	 in	 any	 of	 the	 Company	 share	
schemes.	
The	 Company	 currently	 operates	 three	 discretionary	 share	
based	 incentive	 plans:	
•	 	 The	 Performance	 Share	 Plan,	 which	 is	 operated	 over	 a	
nine-year	 vesting	 cycle,	 and	 in	 which	 only	 executive	
directors	 participate.
•	 	 The	 Company	 Share	 Option	 Plan,	 which	 is	 a	 HMRC	
approved	 option	 scheme.
•	 	 The	 Unapproved	 Share	 Plan,	 which	 is	 a	 share	 rights	 plan	
where	 awards	 are	 granted,	 subject	 to	 performance	
conditions,	 at	 par	 value.
In	 recent	 years,	 awards	 have	 not	 been	 granted	 to	 executive	
directors	 under	 these	 schemes.	 Given	 the	 continued	
uncertainty	 in	 wider	 markets,	 the	 Committee	 determined	
that,	 once	 again,	 no	 awards	 of	 shares	 would	 be	 made	 to	
executive	 directors	 under	 these	 schemes	 during	 the	 2009/10	
financial	 year.	 As	 previously	 mentioned,	 the	 Remuneration	
Committee	 is	 currently	 finalising	 proposals	 regarding	 the	
Company’s	 incentive	 structure	 and	 any	 new	 arrangements	
will	 be	 presented	 to	 shareholders	 in	 due	 course.	
The	 Company	 also	 operated	 a	 Share	 Incentive	 Plan,	 which	 is	 a	
HMRC	 approved	 all-employee	 share	 scheme.	
Further	 information	 regarding	 each	 of	 the	 Company	 share	
plans	 are	 provided	 in	 the	 sections	 below. 47
Overview Operational	 and	 Financial	 Review Governance Financial	 Statements Corporate	 Information
Executive directors’ Performance Share Plan (audited) 
Adopted	 at	 the	 2003	 Annual	 General	 Meeting,	 the	 Plan	 is	 intended	 to	 secure	 the	 long	 term	 services	 of	 key	 directors,	 with	 the	
award	 of	 shares	 being	 conditional	 upon	 the	 achievement	 of	 challenging	 corporate	 performance	 targets	 and	 subject	 to	 lock-in	
arrangements	 for	 participants’	 current	 and	 future	 shareholdings.	 The	 exercise	 of	 share	 awards	 under	 this	 Plan	 is	 subject	 to	 the	
director	 continuing	 to	 be	 employed	 at	 vesting,	 the	 Company	 achieving	 an	 increase	 in	 net	 asset	 value	 plus	 dividends	 paid	 of	 at	
least	 10%	 pa	 above	 the	 Retail	 Prices	 Index	 and	 to	 the	 Company	 outperforming	 the	 average	 IPD	 return	 over	 the	 same	 period.
Details	 of	 awards	 granted	 under	 the	 Plan	 are	 set	 out	 below.	
No	 amount	 is	 payable	 on	 the	 exercise	 of	 these	 rights.	
Awards	 over	 100,000	 shares	 to	 each	 of	 AR	 Wyatt	 and	 NSK	 Shattock	 vested	 in	 2008.	 However,	 under	 the	 original	 terms	 of	
these	 plans,	 these	 shares	 will	 not	 be	 released	 until	 2012.	 The	 performance	 conditions	 relating	 to	 awards	 of	 100,000	 shares	 each	
to	 AR	 Wyatt	 and	 NSK	 Shattock	 which	 were	 due	 to	 vest	 in	 2009	 were	 not	 achieved	 and	 accordingly	 the	 awards	 have	 lapsed.
Aggregate	 awards	 under	 the	 Plan	 are	 limited	 to	 2.5%	 of	 the	 Company’s	 issued	 share	 capital,	 with	 individual	 participants	
being	 limited	 to	 maximum	 awards	 of	 1%	 of	 the	 Company’s	 issued	 share	 capital.

an	 HMRC	 approved	 option	 scheme.	 There	 remain	 outstanding

although	 no	 further	 grants	 are	 made	 under	 this	 plan.
During	 the	 year,	 no	 share	 rights	 or	 approved	 options	
were	 granted.	
In	 relation	 to	 awards	 granted	 in	 previous	 years,	 1,133,424	
options	 and	 share	 rights	 lapsed	 and	 16,425	 rights	 were	
exercised	 at	 25p	 per	 share.	 The	 continued	 operation	 of	 these	
Plans	 is	 currently	 being	 considered	 as	 part	 of	 the	 wider	
remuneration	 review	 being	 undertaken	 by	 the	 Committee,	 the	
results	 of	 which	 will	 be	 reported	 to	 shareholders	 in	 due	 course.
The	 Committee	 considers	 various	 guidelines	 on	
executive	 remuneration.	 In	 relation	 to	 the	 grant	 of	 options	 and	
awards	 and	 the	 design	 of	 share-based	 incentive	 schemes,	 	
the	 Committee	 ensures	 the	 setting	 of	 suitably	 stretching	
performance	 criteria	 and	 the	 recommended	 dilution	 limit	 	
for	 all	 Group	 schemes	 (including	 all-employee	 schemes)	 	
of	 10%	 over	 a	 rolling	 10	 year	 period.

Introduction
The	 Audit	 Committee	 submits	 its	 report	 for	 the	 year	 ended	
31	 March	 2010.	 This	 sets	 out	 the	 Group’s	 audit	 policy	 and	 the	
role	 of	 the	 Committee	 in	 monitoring	 the	 financial	 systems	
and	 the	 management	 of	 external	 and	 internal	 auditors	 which	
are	 carried	 out	 in	 accordance	 with	 current	 legislation	 and	
best	 practice.
Audit Committee
Membership	 of	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 is	 set	 out	 on	 pages	
36	 and	 37.	 Since	 October	 2002,	 it	 has	 been	 chaired	 by	
David	 Pangbourne	 who	 is	 a	 former	 partner	 with	 Deloitte	 LLP	
and	 a	 qualified	 Chartered	 Accountant.	 During	 the	 year,	 	
the	 Committee	 met	 five	 times	 with	 full	 attendance	 on	 each	
occasion.	 The	 Chairman	 will	 be	 present	 at	 the	 AGM	 to	
answer	 questions	 from	 shareholders.	 Simon	 Laffin	 has	 been	
identified	 as	 the	 member	 with	 recent	 and	 relevant	 financial	
experience.
The	 Finance	 Director,	 the	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer	
and	 others	 attend	 by	 invitation.	 The	 Committee	 met	 with	 	
the	 external	 auditor	 without	 management	 being	 present.	 	
The	 Committee	 also	 met	 the	 valuers	 of	 the	 Group’s	 principal	
properties	 prior	 to	 the	 release	 of	 the	 interim	 and	 preliminary	
results,	 with	 the	 external	 auditors	 present.
The	 duties	 of	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 are	 set	 out	 in	 its	 Terms	 of	
Reference,	 which	 were	 reviewed	 and	 approved	 by	 the	 Board	
during	 the	 period	 and	 include:
•	 	 monitoring	 the	 integrity	 of	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	
any	 financial	 announcements	 and	 significant	 reporting	
judgements	 therein;
•	 	 considering	 and	 making	 recommendations	 to	 the	 Board	
regarding	 the	 appointment	 or	 removal	 of	 the	 internal	 and	
external	 auditors;
•	 	 monitoring	 internal	 financial	 controls;
•	 	 monitoring	 and	 reviewing	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 internal	
audit	 function;
•	 	 reviewing	 the	 nature	 and	 scope	 of	 the	 external	 audit	 and	
monitoring	 the	 external	 auditor’s	 independence	 and	
effectiveness;
•	 	 forming	 policy	 on	 the	 supply	 of	 non	 audit	 services	 by	 the	
external	 auditors;
•	 	 considering	 reports	 of	 the	 internal	 and	 external	 auditors	 	
in	 light	 of	 current	 corporate	 governance	 practice;	 and
•	 	 reviewing	 arrangements	 for	 staff	 to	 raise	 financial	
concerns	 in	 confidence.
The	 Terms	 of	 Reference	 may	 be	 found	 on	 the	 Company’s	
website,	 or	 are	 available	 on	 request	 from	 its	 registered	 office.
The	 Committee	 confirms	 that	 there	 has	 been	 an	
ongoing	 process	 in	 place	 for	 the	 identification,	 evaluation	
and	 management	 of	 risk	 during	 the	 period	 to	 the	 date	 of	 the	
publication	 of	 this	 report,	 and	 the	 Committee	 is	 not	 aware	
of	 any	 previously	 unidentified	 risks.	 During	 the	 year,	 a	 new	
approach	 to	 maintaining	 and	 refreshing	 the	 Group’s	 risk	
register	 was	 adopted,	 which	 is	 aimed	 at	 imbuing	 a	 more	
pro-active	 sense	 of	 awareness	 and	 responsibility	 for	 risk	
across	 the	 breadth	 and	 depth	 of	 the	 Company.	
Internal control and internal audit
The	 Board	 recognises	 that	 it	 is	 ultimately	 responsible	 for	 the	
system	 of	 internal	 control	 and	 for	 monitoring	 its	 effectiveness.	
In	 carrying	 out	 its	 duties,	 it	 delegates	 detailed	 responsibility	
for	 internal	 control	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee.	 Management	
prepares	 financial	 statements	 and	 disclosures	 in	 accordance	
with	 applicable	 rules	 and	 regulations	 which	 the	 Committee	
reviews	 for	 clarity,	 completeness,	 accuracy	 and	 context,	 and	
on	 which	 it	 reports	 back	 to	 the	 Board.
The	 Group	 is	 committed	 to	 the	 highest	 standards	 of	
business	 conduct	 and	 seeks	 to	 maintain	 these	 standards	
across	 all	 of	 its	 operations.	 The	 Group	 has	 what	 it	 believes	 	
to	 be	 an	 appropriate	 organisational	 structure	 for	 planning,	
executing,	 controlling	 and	 monitoring	 business	 operations	 	
in	 order	 to	 achieve	 its	 objectives.
The	 Group	 has	 procedures	 designed	 to	 ensure	 complete	
and	 accurate	 accounting,	 and	 to	 limit	 the	 potential	 exposure	
to	 loss	 of	 assets	 or	 fraud.	 Control	 measures	 undertaken	 include	
physical	 controls,	 segregation	 of	 duties,	 reviews	 by	
management,	 and	 internal	 and	 external	 audit.
In	 accordance	 with	 the	 Combined	 Code	 on	 Corporate	
Governance,	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Group’s	 system	 of	
internal	 control	 was	 monitored	 during	 the	 period,	 both	 by	 	
the	 Committee	 and	 by	 the	 Board.	 Areas	 covered	 included	
financial,	 operational	 and	 compliance	 issues.
The	 Board	 considers	 its	 policy	 and	 procedures	 to	 be	
robust	 whilst	 recognising	 that	 such	 a	 system	 is	 designed	 to	
manage,	 rather	 than	 eliminate,	 the	 risk	 of	 failure	 to	 achieve	
business	 objectives	 and	 can	 provide	 only	 reasonable	 and	 not	
absolute	 assurance	 against	 material	 misstatement	 or	 loss.
Audit Committee Report 51
Overview Operational	 and	 Financial	 Review Governance Financial	 Statements Corporate	 Information
Monitoring	 is	 achieved	 through	 reviews	 by	 the	 internal	
auditor,	 which	 are	 reported	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee.	 	
Grant	 Thornton	 carries	 out	 the	 internal	 audit	 function	 using	
an	 audit	 plan	 of	 reviews	 agreed	 by	 the	 Committee	 and	 the	
Finance	 Director.	 Reports	 of	 the	 areas	 reviewed	 together	 	
with	 management’s	 comments	 and	 actions	 are	 discussed	 	
by	 the	 Committee	 and	 there	 is	 a	 continuous	 follow	 up	 on	
management	 actions.	 The	 internal	 auditor	 attends	 some	
Committee	 meetings	 during	 the	 year	 and	 has	 regular	
meetings	 with	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Committee	 without	
management	 being	 present.
The	 Group	 has	 in	 place	 a	 whistle-blowing	 policy	 under	
which	 members	 of	 staff	 with	 concerns	 may	 raise	 these	 in	
confidence	 under	 procedures	 contained	 in	 the	 staff	 handbook.
External auditor
The	 Group’s	 external	 auditor	 was	 first	 appointed	 in	 April	 1992.	
The	 Committee	 makes	 recommendations	 on	 the	 appointment	
of,	 and	 approves	 the	 remuneration	 of,	 the	 external	 auditor,	
with	 particular	 regard	 to	 the	 setting	 of	 appropriate	 parameters	
of	 the	 audit.	 It	 also	 ensures	 the	 external	 auditor’s	 overall	 work	
plan	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 terms	 of	 engagement	 and	 reviews	
the	 audit	 representation	 letters	 prior	 to	 signature	
by	 management.
The	 Committee	 meets	 the	 external	 auditor	 periodically	
to	 ensure	 a	 direct	 line	 of	 communication,	 to	 review	 its	
independence	 and	 to	 agree	 the	 audit	 plan.
The	 Committee	 reviews	 significant	 financial	 reporting	
issues	 and	 judgements	 made	 in	 connection	 with	 the	
preparation	 of	 preliminary,	 half	 yearly	 and	 interim	 reports.	
The	 Chairman	 and	 the	 Committee	 discuss	 any	 major	
accounting	 or	 other	 audit	 issues	 that	 arise	 with	 the	
external	 auditor.	
At	 the	 end	 of	 the	 audit	 cycle,	 the	 external	 auditor’s	 report	 	
is	 reviewed	 by	 the	 Committee,	 which	 reports	 the	 auditor’s	
findings	 and	 makes	 recommendations	 to	 the	 Board.	 	
The	 Committee	 also	 reviews	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 audit	
process	 itself,	 including:
•	 	 whether	 the	 auditor	 has	 met	 the	 management	 plan;
•	 	 the	 robustness	 and	 perceptiveness	 of	 the	 auditor	 in	
handling	 key	 accounting/audit	 judgements	 and	 systems	
of	 internal	 control;
•	 	 obtaining	 feedback	 from	 key	 personnel;	 and
•	 	 the	 auditor’s	 observations	 on	 the	 Company’s	 controls.
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Committee	 reviewed	 its	 procedures	 to	
ensure	 the	 independence	 and	 objectivity	 of	 the	 external	
auditor.	 The	 auditor	 has	 its	 own	 internal	 procedures	 in	 place	
to	 ensure	 that	 none	 of	 the	 audit	 team	 has	 a	 personal	 or	
financial	 interest	 in	 the	 Company	 which	 might	 impair	 their	
judgement	 or	 objectivity.	 Furthermore,	 it	 is	 the	 auditor’s	 policy	
that	 the	 lead	 audit	 director	 be	 rotated	 at	 least	 every	 five	 years.	
During	 the	 previous	 financial	 year,	 the	 audit	 director	 in	 charge	
of	 the	 audit	 team	 was	 rotated.	
The	 Group’s	 policy	 regarding	 provision	 of	 non	 audit	
services	 by	 the	 auditor	 includes	 a	 requirement	 that	 any	
commitment	 to	 fees	 of	 £20,000	 or	 more	 to	 the	 auditor	 for	 non	
audit	 services	 must	 be	 given	 prior	 permission	 from	 either	 the	
Committee	 or	 the	 Board.	 The	 total	 value	 of	 the	 auditor’s	 fees	
was	 as	 follows:	 £295,000	 for	 audit	 fees	 and	 £220,000	 for	 non	
audit	 fees,	 of	 which	 £150,000	 related	 to	 services	 provided	 in	
connection	 with	 the	 rights	 issue.	 A	 breakdown	 of	 these	 can	
be	 found	 in	 note	 4	 on	 page	 74.	 Deloitte	 LLP	 provided	 taxation	
advice	 from	 1	 April	 2004.

Chairman of Audit Committee

Introduction
The	 Board	 collectively	 and	 individually	 subscribes	 to	 the	
principles	 and	 provisions	 in	 the	 Combined	 Code	 on	 Corporate	
Governance	 and	 associated	 guidance.	 Other	 than	 the	 areas	
noted	 below,	 the	 Company	 confirms	 that	 it	 is	 in	 compliance	
with	 the	 Code.
(a)		 In	 principle,	 corporate	 bonus	 arrangements,	 which	
comprise	 cash	 and,	 under	 exceptional	 circumstances,	
share	 awards,	 have	 no	 upper	 limit	 in	 the	 aggregate,	
although	 an	 upper	 limit	 is	 in	 place	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 cash	
element	 of	 the	 plan.	 The	 Board	 believes	 this	 is	 appropriate	
since,	 for	 the	 share	 element	 of	 the	 bonus	 award	 to	 be	
triggered,	 exceptional	 performance	 must	 be	 delivered	 and	
it	 is	 important	 to	 incentivise	 such	 performance.	 During	 the	
year	 under	 review,	 however,	 the	 stringent	 performance	
conditions	 attached	 to	 the	 bonus	 arrangements	 were	 not	
met	 and	 accordingly	 no	 corporate	 bonus	 was	 paid.	 	
The	 Committee	 did,	 however,	 exercise	 its	 discretion	 and	
pay	 a	 bonus	 to	 one	 director	 for	 exceptional	 performance.	
Further	 details	 are	 given	 in	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	
Report	 on	 page	 45.
(b)	 	 From	 1	 March	 2010,	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 was	 not	
comprised	 of	 a	 majority	 of	 independent	 non-executive	
directors.	 This	 position	 will	 be	 addressed	 when	 the	
current	 search	 for	 additional	 independent	 non-executive	
directors	 is	 concluded.
The Board of Directors
A	 schedule	 of	 matters	 reserved	 for	 the	 Board	 has	 been	
approved	 and	 is	 reviewed	 on	 an	 annual	 basis.	 It	 includes	
those	 matters	 that	 are	 most	 significant	 to	 the	 Group,	 based	 	
on	 the	 nature	 and	 size	 of	 the	 transaction,	 both	 in	 terms	 of	
financial	 impact	 and	 risk.
As	 part	 of	 its	 collective	 responsibility	 for	 the	
management	 of	 the	 Group,	 the	 Board	 must	 ensure	 that	
adequate	 resources	 are	 in	 place	 to	 achieve	 its	 strategic	 aims	
and	 that	 its	 obligations	 to	 shareholders	 and	 other	 stakeholders	
are	 met.	 In	 the	 management	 of	 Group	 assets,	 the	 Board	 is	 	
also	 conscious	 both	 of	 environmental	 issues	 and	 community	
relations.	 As	 part	 of	 the	 planning	 process	 for	 its	 major	 	
urban	 regeneration	 projects,	 the	 Group	 has	 also	 engaged	 	
in	 extensive	 consultation	 with	 central	 and	 local	 government	
and	 with	 the	 communities	 involved.
The	 directors	 take	 decisions	 objectively	 and	 in	 the	 best	
interests	 of	 the	 Group,	 being	 collectively	 and	 individually	
responsible	 for	 its	 success.	 They	 are	 accountable	 to	 each	 	
and	 every	 shareholder	 and	 take	 into	 consideration	 the	 need	 	
to	 foster	 the	 Group’s	 business	 relationships	 with	 other	
stakeholders	 in	 discharging	 that	 obligation.
As	 at	 the	 year	 end,	 the	 Board	 comprised	 the	 Chairman	
plus	 four	 executive	 and	 five	 non-executive	 directors,	 four	 of	
whom	 are	 considered	 independent.	 Since	 the	 year	 end,	
Tonianne	 Dwyer	 has	 resigned	 as	 an	 executive	 director	 and	
David	 Gavaghan	 has	 been	 appointed	 as	 an	 executive	 director	
in	 her	 place.
The	 Board	 has	 a	 good	 balance	 between	 executive	 and	
non-executive	 directors,	 with	 the	 diversity	 of	 relevant	 skills	
required	 to	 further	 the	 interests	 of	 shareholders.	 Brief	
biographies	 of	 each	 Board	 member	 can	 be	 found	 on	 pages	
36	 and	 37.	 It	 is	 the	 Group’s	 policy	 that	 executive	 directors	
may	 not	 hold	 more	 than	 one	 external	 directorship.	
Formal	 Board	 meetings	 are	 held	 at	 least	 bi-monthly	 and	
during	 the	 year	 to	 31	 March	 2010,	 there	 were	 eight	 formal	
meetings	 which	 were	 attended	 by	 all	 directors.	 During	 the	
period,	 there	 were	 14	 other	 ad hoc	 Board	 meetings,	 quorate,	
but	 not	 necessarily	 of	 the	 full	 Board,	 to	 facilitate	 day-to-day	
business	 operations.	 The	 non-executive	 directors	 also	 met	
both	 with	 and	 without	 the	 Chairman	 present.
The	 Board	 is	 offered	 training	 and	 information	 in	 a	 form	
and	 of	 a	 quality	 it	 believes	 is	 appropriate	 to	 enable	 it	 to	
discharge	 its	 duties.	 Directors	 receive	 training	 in	 specific	
areas	 relevant	 to	 their	 speciality	 and	 relevant	 to	 the	 Board	 as	 	
a	 whole.	 New	 directors	 are	 offered	 an	 induction	 programme	
including	 tailor-made	 elements	 where	 appropriate.
The	 directors	 have	 access	 to	 the	 Company	 Secretary,	
who	 is	 a	 Chartered	 Secretary.	 The	 Company	 Secretary	 keeps	
the	 directors	 informed	 of	 corporate	 governance	 issues	 and	
changes	 in	 the	 law	 and	 best	 practice	 guidance,	 ensuring	
Board	 procedures	 are	 complied	 with,	 where	 required,	 and	 has	
access	 to	 external	 professional	 advice	 at	 the	 Group’s	 expense.
During	 April	 and	 May	 2009,	 the	 Board	 carried	 out	 an	
appraisal,	 by	 means	 of	 a	 questionnaire,	 of	 its	 operations	 and	
performance	 and	 those	 of	 the	 main	 committees.	 A	 number	 of	
areas	 of	 improvement	 were	 identified	 and	 have	 been	 actioned.	
The	 Chairman’s	 performance	 was	 considered	 at	 a	 meeting	 of	
the	 non-executive	 directors	 without	 the	 Chairman	 present.
Corporate Governance Report 53
Overview Operational	 and	 Financial	 Review Governance Financial	 Statements Corporate	 Information
The	 non-executive	 directors	 bring	 independent	 views	 to	 the	
Board.	 They	 have	 diverse	 experience	 having	 expertise	 in	
property,	 housing,	 and	 accountancy.	 Non-executive	 directors	
take	 an	 active	 part	 in	 debate	 and,	 not	 being	 afraid	 to	
challenge	 proposals,	 ensure	 the	 robustness	 of	 Board	 decisions.	
David	 Pangbourne	 is	 currently	 the	 Senior	 Independent	
Director.	 He	 is	 available	 to	 meet	 shareholders	 at	 the	 AGM	 	
and	 on	 request.	
Non-executive	 directors’	 contracts	 are	 for	 an	 initial	
period	 of	 three	 years,	 which	 may	 be	 extended	 for	 further	
periods,	 subject	 to	 re-election	 by	 the	 members	 in	 general	
meeting.	 Executive	 directors	 have	 rolling	 service	 contracts	
which	 provide	 for	 a	 notice	 period	 of	 six	 months.	 None	 of	 the	
service	 agreements	 contain	 any	 liquidated	 damages	 or	
payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 damages	 on	 change	 of	 control	 provisions.	
All	 directors’	 contracts	 are	 available	 for	 inspection	 at	 the	
registered	 office	 and	 at	 the	 AGM.
In	 accordance	 with	 the	 Company’s	 Articles,	 each	
director	 must	 stand	 for	 re-election	 if	 they	 have	 not	 been	
reappointed	 by	 shareholders	 at	 either	 of	 the	 two	 previous	
AGMs.
The	 Terms	 of	 Reference	 of	 the	 Audit	 and	 Remuneration	
Committees	 require	 the	 Chairman	 of	 each	 Committee	 to	 	
offer	 himself/herself	 for	 re-election	 annually.
This	 year	 Martin	 Meech	 and	 Rebecca	 Worthington	 	
are	 standing	 for	 re-election	 as	 directors.	 Further	 commentary	
on	 the	 reappointment	 of	 Mr	 Meech	 is	 given	 in	 the	 Directors’	
Report	 on	 page	 38.	 Charles	 Cayzer,	 Peter	 Dixon,	 David	
Gavaghan	 and	 William	 Rucker	 will	 each	 be	 standing	 for	
election	 at	 this,	 the	 first	 AGM	 after	 their	 appointments.	
Martin	 Meech	 is	 also	 standing	 for	 re-election	 as	
Chairman	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 and	 further	
information	 regarding	 his	 reappointment	 is	 contained	 	
in	 the	 Directors’	 Report	 on	 page	 38.
The	 Board	 recommends	 to	 shareholders	 that	 those	
directors	 offering	 themselves	 for	 election	 at	 its	 forthcoming	
AGM	 be	 re-elected	 because	 of	 the	 significant	 value	 they	
create	 and	 the	 wide	 ranging	 skills	 and	 experience	 which	 	
they	 bring	 to	 bear	 in	 the	 workings	 of	 the	 Board.
Board Committees
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Company	 re-organised	 the	 membership	
of	 the	 Committees,	 membership	 of	 which	 is	 shown	 on	
pages	 36	 and	 37.
David	 Pangbourne	 is	 currently	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Audit	
Committee	 but	 has	 indicated	 his	 intention	 to	 retire	 as	 a	
director	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 on	 7	 September	 2010.	
His	 replacement	 will	 be	 appointed	 in	 due	 course.	 The	 Audit	
Committee	 meets	 formally	 at	 least	 three	 times	 each	 year.	 	
It	 also	 meets	 separately	 with	 both	 the	 external	 and	 internal	
auditors	 and	 the	 Company’s	 property	 valuers.	 During	 the	 year	
ended	 31	 March	 2010,	 the	 Committee	 met	 on	 five	 occasions	
with	 full	 attendance	 on	 each	 occasion.	 Its	 Terms	 of	 Reference	
are	 available	 from	 the	 Company	 Secretary	 or	 on	 the	
Company’s	 website	 www.quintain.co.uk.	 These	 include	
consideration	 of	 the	 appointment	 and	 terms	 of	 engagement	 	
of	 the	 external	 and	 internal	 auditors	 together	 with	 a	 review	 	
of	 their	 independence,	 objectivity	 and	 effectiveness,	 the	
co-ordination	 of	 internal	 and	 external	 auditors,	 reviewing	
auditors’	 reports,	 annual	 and	 interim	 reports,	 asset	 valuations,	
monitoring	 internal	 control	 policy	 and	 procedures	 and	
consistency.
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 is	 chaired	 by	 Martin	
Meech.	 The	 Committee	 meets	 at	 least	 three	 times	 each	 year.	
During	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010,	 the	 Committee	 met	
seven	 times	 formally	 with	 full	 attendance	 at	 each	 meeting	
except	 for	 one	 meeting,	 which	 Joan	 MacNaughton	 was	
unable	 to	 attend.	 Its	 Terms	 of	 Reference	 (which	 are	 available	
from	 the	 Company	 Secretary	 or	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website	
www.quintain.co.uk)	 include	 consideration	 of	 all	 aspects	 	
of	 the	 executive	 directors’	 performance,	 employment,	
remuneration	 and	 incentives.	 It	 also	 sets	 the	 remuneration	 and	
incentives	 policy	 of	 the	 Group	 as	 a	 whole	 and	 approves	 the	
remuneration	 of	 senior	 staff.	 The	 Remuneration	 Report	 is	 set	
out	 on	 pages	 42	 to	 49.
The	 Nomination	 Committee	 is	 chaired	 by	 William	
Rucker	 and	 comprises	 most	 but	 not	 all	 of	 the	 non-executive	
directors	 and	 the	 Chief	 Executive.	 Whilst	 some	 guidance	
views	 Adrian	 Wyatt’s	 membership	 of	 this	 Committee	 as	 not	
in	 accordance	 with	 best	 practice,	 the	 directors	 believe	 it	 to	 be	
in	 the	 best	 interests	 of	 the	 Group.	 The	 Committee’s	 Terms	 of	
Reference	 include	 the	 review	 of	 the	 structure	 and	 composition	
of	 the	 Board,	 the	 identification	 of	 suitable	 candidates	 to	 fill	
vacancies	 as	 and	 when	 they	 arise,	 making	 recommendations	
for	 the	 re-election	 of	 directors	 and	 forming	 succession	 plans.	
The	 Terms	 of	 Reference	 for	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 are	
available	 on	 request	 from	 the	 Company	 Secretary	 or	 on	 the	
Company’s	 website,	 www.quintain.co.uk. 54	 Quintain	 Estates	 &	 Development	 plc Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2010
The	 Committee	 meets	 formally	 at	 least	 once	 a	 year	 and	
otherwise	 when	 required.	 During	 the	 year,	 it	 met	 six	 times	
with	 full	 attendance	 on	 four	 occasions.	 Joan	 MacNaughton	
was	 unable	 to	 attend	 two	 meetings	 of	 the	 Committee.
The	 Nomination	 Committee	 was	 actively	 involved	
during	 the	 year	 with	 the	 appointment	 of	 all	 of	 the	 new	
directors.	 William	 Rucker,	 who	 was	 appointed	 as	 Chairman	
and	 non-executive	 director	 has	 been	 known	 to	 the	 Board	 for	
many	 years.	 He	 is	 Chief	 Executive	 Officer	 of	 Lazard	 London	
Limited,	 who	 act	 as	 advisers	 to	 the	 Company.	 In	 considering	
his	 appointment	 as	 Chairman,	 the	 views	 of	 shareholders	
holding	 (at	 the	 time)	 a	 combined	 total	 of	 over	 50%	 of	 the	
shares	 of	 the	 Company	 were	 taken	 into	 account.	 Both	 the	
Nomination	 Committee	 and	 the	 Board	 considered	 the	
question	 of	 Mr	 Rucker’s	 independence	 on	 a	 number	 of	
occasions	 and	 concluded	 that	 he	 was	 independent	 in	
character	 and	 judgement	 and	 that	 his	 relationship	 with	
Lazard	 &	 Co.	 Limited	 did	 not	 detract	 from	 this	 opinion,	 	
given	 the	 role	 of	 Lazard	 &	 Co.	 Limited	 as	 the	 providers	 of	
independent	 advice	 to	 the	 Board.	 A	 system	 has	 been	 put	 in	
place	 whereby	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 approves	 fees	 payable	 to	
Lazard	 &	 Co.	 Limited	 for	 any	 advice	 it	 gives	 to	 the	 Company	
and	 Mr	 Rucker	 is	 not	 involved	 in	 any	 fee	 negotiations	 nor	 is	 he	
a	 member	 of	 any	 team	 advising	 the	 Company.
Peter	 Dixon	 was	 appointed	 as	 independent	 non-
executive	 director	 following	 a	 search	 carried	 out	 by	
independent	 consultants.	 Charles	 Cayzer	 was	 appointed	 as	
non-executive	 director	 (albeit	 not	 independent)	 under	 the	
terms	 of	 an	 agreement	 with	 the	 Company’s	 largest	
shareholder,	 Caledonia	 Investments	 plc.
The	 Risk	 Committee	 comprises	 David	 Pangbourne,	
William	 Rucker,	 Simon	 Laffin,	 Martin	 Meech	 and	 Adrian	
Wyatt	 and	 is	 chaired	 by	 Rebecca	 Worthington.	 The	 Deputy	
Chief	 Executive	 and	 the	 other	 directors	 attend	 meetings	 by	
invitation.	 Matters	 within	 its	 wide	 ranging	 remit	 include	
financial	 and	 treasury	 issues,	 valuation,	 reputation,	 legal,	
corporate	 governance,	 management,	 economic	 and	
operational	 risks.
Lease code
The	 Company	 is	 in	 support	 of	 the	 initiatives	 set	 out	 in	
The	 Code	 of	 Practice	 for	 Commercial	 Leases	 in	 England	 and	
Wales,	 which	 was	 launched	 on	 22	 April	 2002.	 The	 Code	
contains	 a	 range	 of	 recommendations	 which	 are	 deemed	 	
to	 represent	 best	 practice	 between	 principals	 and	 their	
representatives	 in	 landlord	 and	 tenant	 matters.

executive	 directors,	 is	 primarily	 responsible	 for	 investor	
relations	 and	 regularly	 makes	 contact	 with	 institutional	 	
and	 other	 shareholders	 in	 an	 effort	 to	 maintain	 an	 open	 	
and	 effective	 dialogue.
The	 Chairman,	 the	 Senior	 Independent	 Director	 and	 	
the	 other	 non-executive	 directors	 are	 also	 available	 to	 meet	
shareholders	 to	 review	 strategy	 and	 corporate	 governance,	 	
or	 to	 discuss	 matters	 of	 concern.	 Shareholders’	 views	 are	
communicated	 to	 the	 Board	 as	 a	 whole.
The	 Company’s	 AGM	 provides	 a	 further	 opportunity	 	
for	 investors	 to	 question	 the	 directors,	 both	 formally	 and	
informally.	 They	 also	 have	 a	 chance	 to	 meet	 any	 new	
directors.	 The	 number	 of	 proxy	 votes	 lodged	 for	 each	 motion	 	
is	 announced	 at	 the	 meeting.
The	 Company	 maintains	 a	 website	 at	 www.quintain.co.
uk	 which	 provides	 information	 relating	 to	 the	 property	
portfolio,	 policy	 statements,	 finance,	 contacts,	 press	 	
releases	 and	 on-screen	 annual	 reports.	 There	 is	 also	 a	 section	
containing	 the	 Company’s	 statutory	 documents.	 Interested	
parties	 may	 register	 to	 receive	 notification	 of	 press	 releases	
and	 may	 contact	 the	 Company	 by	 email.
Going concern
The	 following	 statement	 is	 made	 as	 required	 by	 provision	
C.1.2	 of	 the	 Code:
In	 the	 statutory	 accounts	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 ended	
31	 March	 2009	 the	 directors	 concluded	 that	 there	 was	 a	
material	 uncertainty	 arising	 from	 the	 impact	 of	 the	 loan	
covenants	 of	 the	 continuing	 fall	 in	 property	 values	 which	
appeared	 to	 cast	 doubt	 on	 the	 Group	 and	 the	 Company’s	
ability	 to	 continue	 as	 a	 going	 concern.	 The	 successful	
outcome	 to	 the	 rights	 issue	 announced	 on	 5	 November	 2009,	
the	 improving	 outlook	 for	 the	 Group’s	 properties,	 as	 evidenced	
by	 the	 positive	 revaluation	 movement	 in	 the	 year	 and	 the	
results	 of	 the	 programme	 for	 the	 repatriation	 of	 funds	 through	
the	 disposal	 of	 investment	 properties	 and	 non-current	
investments,	 have	 reduced	 the	 gearing	 ratio,	 as	 defined	
within	 the	 banking	 loan	 documentation	 and	 have	 enabled	 	
the	 directors	 to	 conclude	 that	 there	 is	 no	 longer	 material	
uncertainty	 which	 may	 cast	 significant	 doubt	 on	 the	 ability	
of	 the	 Group	 to	 continue	 as	 a	 going	 concern.	 The	 directors	
therefore	 consider	 it	 appropriate	 to	 prepare	 the	 financial	
statements	 on	 a	 going	 concern	 basis.

Internal controls
The	 Board	 is	 ultimately	 responsible	 for	 the	 Group’s	 system	 of	
internal	 control	 and	 for	 monitoring	 its	 effectiveness	 although	
day	 to	 day	 responsibility	 for	 this	 is	 delegated	 to	 the	 Audit	
Committee.	 However,	 such	 a	 system	 is	 designed	 to	 manage,	
rather	 than	 eliminate,	 the	 risk	 of	 failure	 to	 achieve	 business	
objectives	 and	 can	 provide	 only	 reasonable	 and	 not	 	
absolute	 assurance	 against	 material	 misstatement	 or	 loss.	 	
In	 accordance	 with	 the	 Code,	 the	 Board	 has	 in	 place	 an	
ongoing	 system	 of	 identification,	 evaluation	 and	 management	
of	 significant	 risks.	 The	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Group’s	 system	 	
of	 internal	 controls	 was	 monitored	 during	 the	 period,	 both	 	
by	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 and	 by	 the	 Board.	 Areas	 considered	
included	 financial,	 operational,	 compliance	 and	 risk	
management.	 During	 the	 year	 and	 up	 to	 the	 date	 of	 this	
report,	 the	 Board	 was	 not	 aware	 of	 any	 material	 risks	 or	
incidents	 not	 previously	 assessed.	
Risk	 identification:	 managers	 are	 responsible	 for	 ongoing	
identification	 and	 evaluation	 of	 key	 risks	 applicable	 to	 their	
areas	 and	 for	 taking	 appropriate	 action.	 Risks	 may	 be	
associated	 with	 a	 variety	 of	 internal	 or	 external	 sources	
including	 control	 breakdowns,	 disruption	 in	 information	
systems,	 competition,	 natural	 catastrophe	 and	 regulatory	
requirements.	 The	 risks	 identified	 and	 the	 actions	 taken	 to	
minimise	 or	 eliminate	 them	 are	 assessed	 on	 a	 regular	 basis	
by	 the	 internal	 auditors	 who	 report	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee.	
Significant	 findings	 are	 presented	 to	 the	 Board	 and	 can	 result	
in	 refinements	 to	 internal	 procedures.	
Control	 environment:	 the	 Group	 is	 committed	 to	 the	
highest	 standards	 of	 business	 conduct	 and	 seeks	 to	 maintain	
these	 standards	 across	 all	 of	 its	 operations.	 The	 Board	
considers	 it	 has	 an	 appropriate	 organisational	 structure	 for	
planning,	 executing,	 controlling	 and	 monitoring	 business	
operations	 in	 order	 to	 achieve	 the	 Group’s	 objectives.
Lines	 of	 responsibility	 and	 delegation	 of	 authority	 are	
documented.
Information	 and	 communication:	 periodic	 strategic	
reviews	 are	 carried	 out	 which	 include	 the	 consideration	 	
of	 long	 term	 projections	 and	 the	 evaluation	 of	 business	
alternatives.	 Periodic	 forecasts	 support	 the	 active	 monitoring	
of	 the	 Group’s	 performance	 against	 plan.	 Both	 results	 and	
forecasts	 are	 consolidated	 and	 presented	 to	 the	 Board	 on	 	
a	 regular	 basis.
The	 other	 key	 elements	 of	 the	 Group’s	 system	 of	 internal	
control	 are	 as	 follows:
•	 	 regular	 meetings	 of	 the	 Board	 and	 the	 Audit	 Committee,	
whose	 overall	 responsibilities	 are	 set	 out	 in	 this	 Report	
and	 the	 Audit	 Committee’s	 Terms	 of	 Reference;
•	 	 a	 management	 structure	 designed	 to	 enable	 effective	
decision	 making	 with	 clearly	 defined	 responsibilities	 and	
limits	 of	 authority.	 An	 important	 part	 of	 this	 structure	 is	 a	
weekly	 meeting	 of	 the	 executive	 directors	 to	 review	 the	
ongoing	 business	 and	 decide	 on	 proposed	 acquisitions/
divestments	 and	 capital	 expenditure;
•	 	 agreed	 operational	 procedures,	 both	 internal	 and	 in	
dealings	 with	 external	 bodies,	 which	 assist	 in	 the	
maintenance	 of	 uniformly	 high	 standards;
•	 	 the	 measurement	 of	 financial	 performance	 at	 least	 	
once	 every	 six	 months	 against	 forecasts	 and	 long	 term	
financial	 plans;
•	 	 consideration	 by	 the	 Risk	 Committee	 of	 issues	 which	 may	
affect	 the	 Group	 on	 a	 wider	 basis;	 and
•	 	 investigation	 by	 the	 internal	 auditor	 of	 areas	 of	 specific	 risk.
The	 Group	 has	 entered	 into	 a	 number	 of	 joint	 ventures,	 	
the	 most	 material	 being	 the	 Quercus	 Healthcare	 Property	
Partnership	 and	 Greenwich	 Peninsula	 Regeneration	 Limited,	
which	 are	 not	 controlled	 by	 the	 Company.	 These	 have	
therefore	 not	 been	 included	 as	 part	 of	 the	 Group	 for	 the	
purposes	 of	 the	 internal	 control	 assessment.
The	 Board	 is	 committed	 to	 following	 corporate	
governance	 best	 practice	 wherever	 possible	 and	 has	
undertaken	 to	 review	 its	 position	 annually.	 It	 has	 considered	
its	 system	 of	 internal	 control	 and	 its	 effectiveness	 for	 the	
financial	 year	 and	 up	 to	 the	 date	 of	 this	 report	 and,	 in	 its	
opinion,	 the	 process	 accords	 with	 the	 current	 guidance.

Land holdings at Greenwich Peninsula,  
Silvertown and Wembley 
We	 confirm	 that	 we	 have	 inspected	 the	 above	 properties	 	
and	 made	 all	 relevant	 enquiries	 in	 order	 to	 provide	 you	 	
with	 our	 opinion	 of	 Market	 Value	 as	 at	 31	 March	 2010	 	
of	 the	 various	 property	 interests	 which	 Quintain	 Estates	 	
&	 Development	 plc	 hold.	
We	 confirm	 that	 our	 valuations	 have	 been	 carried	 out	 in	
accordance	 with	 the	 Royal	 Institution	 of	 Chartered	 Surveyors	
Valuation	 Standards	 and	 that	 we	 have	 carried	 out	 the	
valuation	 as	 External	 Valuers,	 qualified	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 the	
valuation	 in	 accordance	 with	 those	 Standards.	
Our	 valuations	 have	 been	 made	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 the	
definition,	 terms	 of	 reference,	 information	 sources,	
assumptions	 and	 conditions	 as	 noted	 in	 our	 formal	 Valuation	
Certificate	 dated	 5	 May	 2010.	 In	 particular,	 no	 allowance	 has	
been	 made	 in	 our	 valuations	 for	 any	 expenses	 of	 realisation	 or	
any	 taxation	 liability	 arising	 from	 a	 sale	 of	 any	 property	 and	 all	
figures	 are	 expressed	 exclusive	 of	 Value	 Added	 Tax.
Our	 valuations	 are	 on	 the	 basis	 that	 each	 property	 has	 a	
good	 and	 marketable	 title	 and	 is	 free	 from	 any	 undisclosed	 of	
any	 undisclosed	 burdens,	 outgoings,	 restrictions	 or	 charges.	
We	 have,	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 our	 valuations,	 been	 provided	 with	
plans	 and	 particulars	 as	 to	 tenure	 and	 the	 terms	 of	 leases	 as	
have	 been	 contained	 within	 various	 documents	 supplied	 to	
us	 by	 the	 Company	 or	 its	 professional	 advisers.
Having	 carefully	 considered	 this	 matter,	 we	 have	
reported	 our	 opinion	 of	 Market	 Value	 as	 at	 31	 March	 2010	
of	 the	 freehold	 and	 other	 interests	 held,	 subject	 to	 and	 with	
the	 benefit	 of	 the	 existing	 leases	 and	 otherwise	 with	 vacant	
possession,	 at	 an	 aggregate	 of	 £783,585,000	 (Seven	 hundred	
and	 eighty-three	 million	 five	 hundred	 and	 eighty-five	 thousand	
pounds).	 All	 of	 the	 properties	 are	 held	 for	 redevelopment	
although	 some	 parts	 form	 investments	 that	 are	 capable	
of	 separate	 sale.
The	 above	 total	 includes	 a	 100%	 share	 of	 the	 interest	
at	 Silvertown	 of	 £17,500,000.	 The	 figure	 reflecting	 the	 terms	
of	 a	 Joint	 Venture	 Agreement	 with	 the	 London	 Development	
Agency	 at	 that	 property	 is	 £12,000,000	 with	 the	 aggregate	
reducing	 to	 £778,085,000	 (Seven	 hundred	 and	 seventy-eight	
million	 and	 eighty-five	 thousand	 pounds).
Our	 Valuation	 Certificate	 comments	 on	 the	 high	 degree	
of	 subjectivity	 in	 this	 instance	 for	 all	 of	 the	 properties	 and	
various	 other	 property	 specific	 matters.	 In	 particular,	 our	
valuation	 of	 Wembley	 includes	 the	 additional	 value	 derived	
from	 the	 portfolio	 effect	 and	 synergies	 arising	 from	 the	 legal	
right	 to	 acquire	 the	 freehold	 and	 long	 leasehold	 interests	 in	
land	 pursuant	 to	 the	 terms	 of	 a	 Development	 Agreement	 	
with	 the	 London	 Development	 Agency	 notwithstanding	 that	
this	 Agreement	 is	 non-assignable.	 As	 discussed	 with	 the	
Company	 and	 its	 auditors,	 our	 valuation	 specifically	
disregards	 this	 restriction.
Our	 valuation	 for	 Greenwich	 reflects	 the	 direct	 real	 estate	
rights,	 obligations	 and	 benefits	 arising	 from	 various	
agreements	 entered	 into	 by	 the	 Company	 including	 the	 	
Land	 Assembly	 Agreement,	 the	 Land	 Disposal	 Agreement,	
the	 Master	 Implementation	 Agreement	 and	 the	 Shareholder’s	
Agreement	 relating	 to	 the	 property	 at	 Greenwich.	 This	
includes	 certain	 parcels	 which	 are	 currently	 held	 freehold	 	
by	 the	 Company	 but	 which	 remain	 subject	 to	 these	 and	 other	
agreements.	 We	 have	 valued	 the	 right	 to	 receive	 the	
Company’s	 share	 of	 the	 potential	 beneficial	 property	 based	
cashflows	 that	 could	 be	 achieved	 from	 these	 agreements	
based	 on	 information	 provided	 to	 us	 by	 the	 Company.
This	 letter	 is	 a	 short-form	 confirmation	 of	 our	 valuation	
for	 inclusion	 in	 the	 Company’s	 Report	 and	 Accounts.	
No	 reliance	 should	 be	 placed	 upon	 it	 without	 simultaneous	
reference	 to	 our	 formal	 Valuation	 Certificate,	 copies	 of	 which	
have	 been	 provided	 to	 you.

by	 the	 Royal	 Institution	 of	 Chartered	 Surveyors.
This	 statement	 is	 a	 short-form	 confirmation	 of	 our

No	 reliance	 should	 be	 placed	 on	 it	 without	 simultaneous

We	 confirm	 that	 the	 properties	 are	 inspected	 annually	
but	 not	 all	 properties	 are	 inspected	 internally.	 We	 are	 not	
instructed	 to	 undertake	 a	 structural	 survey.
We	 have	 not	 made	 any	 adjustments	 to	 reflect	 any	
liability	 to	 taxation	 that	 may	 arise	 on	 disposals,	 nor	 for	
any	 costs	 associated	 with	 disposals	 incurred	 by	 the	 owner.

funding	 that	 may	 arise	 on	 disposals.	 Our	 valuations	 are	
expressed	 as	 exclusive	 of	 any	 Value	 Added	 Tax	 that	 may

other	 relevant	 matters.
Unless	 disclosed	 to	 us	 to	 the	 contrary,	 our	 valuation	 is	 on	 the	
basis	 that:
(a)		 the	 Properties	 each	 possess	 good	 marketable	 title	 free	 from	
any	 unusual	 encumbrances,	 restrictions	 or	 obligations;
(b)		 nothing	 would	 be	 revealed	 by	 any	 local	 search	 or	 replies	
to	 usual	 enquiries	 of	 the	 seller	 which	 would	 materially	
adversely	 affect	 the	 respective	 values	 of	 the	 Properties;	 and
(c)		 in	 respect	 of	 leasehold	 property,	 consent	 (if	 required)	 to	
assign	 the	 leasehold	 interest	 would	 not	 be	 withheld	 or	
delayed	 by	 the	 relevant	 landlord	 if	 requested.

The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 preparing	 the	 Annual	 Report	
and	 the	 Group	 and	 parent	 company	 financial	 statements	 in	
accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 regulations.
Company	 law	 requires	 the	 directors	 to	 prepare	 Group

year.	 Under	 that	 law	 they	 are	 required	 to	 prepare	 the	 Group	
financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRSs	 as	 adopted	 by	
the	 EU	 and	 applicable	 law	 and	 have	 elected	 to	 prepare	 the	
parent	 company	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	
Standards	 and	 applicable	 law	 (UK	 Generally	 Accepted

a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 of	 the	 state	 of	 affairs	 of	 the	 Group	 and	
Parent	 Company	 and	 of	 their	 profit	 or	 loss	 for	 that	 period.	
In	 preparing	 each	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 parent	 company	 financial	
statements,	 the	 directors	 are	 required	 to:
•	 	 select	 suitable	 accounting	 policies	 and	 then	 apply	
them	 consistently;
•	 	 make	 judgements	 and	 estimates	 that	 are	 reasonable	
and	 prudent;
•	 	 for	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements,	 state	 whether	 they	
have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRSs	 as	 adopted

•	 	 for	 the	 parent	 company	 financial	 statements,	 state	
whether	 applicable	 UK	 Accounting	 Standards	 have	 been	
followed,	 subject	 to	 any	 material	 departures	 disclosed	 and	
explained	 in	 the	 parent	 company	 financial	 statements;	
and
•	 	 prepare	 the	 financial	 statements	 on	 the	 going	 concern	
basis	 unless	 it	 is	 inappropriate	 to	 presume	 that	 the	 Group	
and	 the	 Parent	 Company	 will	 continue	 in	 business.	
The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 keeping	 adequate	
accounting	 records	 that	 are	 sufficient	 to	 show	 and	 explain	 the	
Parent	 Company’s	 transactions	 and	 disclose	 with	 reasonable	
accuracy	 at	 any	 time	 the	 financial	 position	 of	 the	 Parent	
Company	 and	 enable	 them	 to	 ensure	 that	 its	 financial	
statements	 comply	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006.	 They	 have	
general	 responsibility	 for	 taking	 such	 steps	 as	 are	 reasonably	
open	 to	 them	 to	 safeguard	 the	 assets	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 to	
prevent	 and	 detect	 fraud	 and	 other	 irregularities.
Under	 applicable	 law	 and	 regulations,	 the	 directors	 are	
also	 responsible	 for	 preparing	 a	 Directors’	 Report,	 Directors’	
Remuneration	 Report	 and	 Corporate	 Governance	 Statement	
that	 complies	 with	 that	 law	 and	 those	 regulations.

may	 differ	 from	 legislation	 in	 other	 jurisdictions.
We	 confirm	 that	 to	 the	 best	 of	 our	 knowledge:
•	 	 the	 financial	 statements,	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	
applicable	 set	 of	 accounting	 standards	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair

structures	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 financial	 statements.

by exception
We	 have	 nothing	 to	 report	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 following:
Under	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	 to

the	 directors’	 Remuneration	 Report	 to	 be	 audited	 are	 not	
in	 agreement	 with	 the	 accounting	 records	 and	 returns;	 or

Overview Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Notes to the Accounts
For the year ended 31 March 2010
1 Accounting policies
i) Basis of preparation
In the statutory accounts for the financial year ended 31 March 2009, the directors concluded that there was a material uncertainty arising from the 
impact on loan covenants of the continuing fall in property values which appeared to cast doubt on the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern. The successful outcome to the rights issue announced on 5 November 2009, the improving outlook for the Group’s properties, as 
evidenced by the positive revaluation movement in the year, and the results of the programme for the repatriation of funds through the disposal of 
investment properties and non-current investments, have reduced the gearing ratio, as defined within the banking loan documentation, and have 
enabled the directors to conclude that there is no longer a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to 
continue as a going concern. The directors therefore consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Further information regarding the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position is set out in the Operational and Financial Review. In addition, note 19 to these financial statements sets out the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its 
exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Board in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) 
and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements are presented in Sterling and 
have been prepared on an historical cost basis except that investment properties, other non-current investments and certain financial instruments 
described in section xv below have been stated at fair value.
IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, requires the presentation of a Statement of Changes in Equity as a primary statement, 
separate from the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income. As a result, a Statement of Changes in Equity has been included in 
the primary statements, showing changes in each component of equity for both the current and comparative periods.
One of the amendments which forms part of the International Accounting Standards Board annual improvements project and has effect for 
accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009 relates to the accounting treatment for development properties, previously accounted for 
under IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’. Under the amendment, such properties are now accounted for under IAS 40, ‘Investment Property’ 
with revaluation movements recognised in the Income Statement rather than through equity. The change has had no impact upon the Group’s net 
assets or cashflows and as it has been applied prospectively, prior periods’ results have not been restated. The cumulative balance of £172,922,000 
included within the revaluation reserve in respect of development properties as at 1 April 2009 has been transferred to retained earnings in the 
current year.
In addition, the Group has applied IFRS 2 (amended), ‘Share-based Payments – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations’, and IFRS 8, ‘Operating 
Segments’, both of which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Neither has had a material impact on the 
financial statements. 
The Group has also adopted the amendments to IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’, to expand the disclosures required in respect of 
fair value measurements and liquidity risk. The Group has elected not to provide comparative information for this disclosure in the current year, in 
accordance with the transitional reliefs included in the amendment.
IAS 23 (amended), ‘Borrowing Costs’, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 had no impact on the financial 
statements.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective for the financial year and 
have not been adopted early:
IFRIC 15, ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010.
IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business Combinations’, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Amendments to IAS 27, ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Amendments to IAS 28, ‘Investment in Associates’, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
None of these standards and interpretations, when applied, is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements, other than in 
relation to disclosure or presentation.
The majority of amendments made as part of the IASB’s 2009 Annual Improvements Programme affect accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2010.
ii) Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
accounting policies, the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. However, the actual results may differ from these estimates.
The measurement of fair value constitutes the main area of judgement exercised by the Board in respect of the Group’s results. In relation to the 
Group’s investment properties, the Board has relied upon the external valuations carried out by professionally qualified valuers in accordance with 
the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The principal valuers of the Group’s investment properties are 
Savills Commercial Limited and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited while Christie + Co have valued the investment properties within Quercus, the Group’s 
healthcare joint venture, and Savills Commercial Limited the investment properties within iQ, the Group’s student accommodation fund. 
The changes in the market values of investment properties are disclosed in notes 9 and 11 and discussed in the Risk Management section of 
the Financial Review.
Copies of the valuation reports of Savills Commercial Limited and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited, which together account for 99.0% of the Group’s 
directly held investment properties are contained on pages 56 and 57.
In relation to the Group’s investment properties, the key assumptions relate to the amount and timing of future income streams, anticipated 
maintenance costs and other landlord’s liabilities and an appropriate yield. Valuers also have regard to market evidence generated by transactions 
involving similar properties.
In relation to properties in the course of development shown under investment properties, the valuers have regard to relevant legal rights and 
synergies, the discount rate appropriate to the current stage of the masterplan, the implementation strategy, the timing and conditions of planning 
consent, future development costs, the likely completed sales values, cost and value inflation and current market dynamics. 68 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Notes to the Accounts
continued
1 Accounting policies continued
In respect of derivative financial instruments, the Board has relied on the valuation carried out by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, financial risk 
consultants, and the basis for this exercise is referred to below in section xv of this note and in note 20. 
The Board has also exercised its judgement in relation to the recognition of certain deferred tax assets, which is discussed in further detail  
in note 6iv, and in assessing the recoverability of trade receivables by reference to their age and the ability of debtors to pay.
The carrying value of trading properties is routinely assessed by the executive directors supported where necessary by an independent 
external assessment of their net realisable value. 
Other areas of judgement, risk and uncertainty which are relevant to an understanding of these results and the Group’s financial position are 
referred to in the Operational and Financial Review.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
iii) Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the Group, and equity account the 
Group’s interest in joint ventures and the associate. The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate 
entity and not about its Group. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP. 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements  
from the date that control commences until the date it ceases.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control. An associate is an  
entity in which the Group has significant influence but not control over financial and operating policies. The Group equity accounts for its share of 
net profit after tax of its joint ventures and associate including any change in the fair value of investment properties through the Income Statement. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cashflow hedges within joint ventures less any related tax is recognised directly in equity.  
The Group’s interest in the net assets of joint ventures and the associate is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Where an asset is transferred to an existing joint venture or the Group disposes of an interest in a subsidiary, the Group recognises a share  
of the profit equivalent to the interest it has sold to an external party. All such transactions occur at fair value.
iv) Foreign currency
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Operating income and 
expenses are translated at average exchange rates. The year end and average rates used for these purposes were as follows:
Year end Average
£1= 2010 2009 2010 2009
France €1.12 €1.08 €1.08 €1.20
United States $1.51 $1.42 $1.54 $1.72
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are reflected in the translation reserve and released to 
the Income Statement upon the disposal of the foreign operation.
v) Revenue and cost of sales
Revenue is stated net of VAT and comprises rental income, proceeds from sales of trading properties, income from hotel operations, fees, 
commissions and other income.
Rental income from investment and development properties leased out under operating leases is recognised in the Income Statement on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent rents which comprise turnover rents are recognised as income in the periods in which they are earned. Rent reviews are recognised 
when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Lease incentives are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease, or the period to the first tenant break, if shorter.
Property operating costs are expensed as incurred including any element of service charge expenditure not recovered from tenants.
Sales of trading properties are recognised in the accounts on the date of unconditional exchange or where an exchange is conditional, on the 
date that conditions have been satisfied, except for contracts with affordable housing associations for development and eventual sale which are 
recognised on a percentage of completion basis under IAS 11, ‘Construction Contracts’. Where a land sale occurs prior to the development, the profit 
is recognised at the point of the original sale. 
Income from hotel operations represents income receivable from the Plaza Hotel, Wembley prior to the redevelopment of the site, for which 
outline planning permission has been obtained. Hotel revenue is recognised when the relevant services are provided.
Fees from fund management relate to base and performance fees receivable in respect of asset management together with property 
procurement fees. Performance fees are recognised when it is likely that performance criteria have been met. All other fees are recognised on a 
receivable basis.
Other income comprises tenant lease surrender premiums, insurance commission, car parking receipts, property management fees and 
miscellaneous income.
vi) Purchase and disposal of properties held as non-current assets
Property purchases and sales are recognised in the accounts on the date of unconditional exchange or where an exchange is conditional, on the date 
that conditions have been satisfied.
Profits or losses arising on disposal are calculated by reference to the carrying value of the asset at the last revaluation, adjusted for subsequent 
capital expenditure.
The acquisition or disposal of shares in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures where properties constitute the only or main asset are 
accounted for as property transactions unless the fair values attributed to other assets and liabilities within the entity differ from their carrying value. 69
Overview Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
1 Accounting policies continued
vii) Impairment 
The carrying values of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such 
indication becomes evident, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment loss recognised whenever the carrying amount of the 
asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. The value-in-use is determined as the 
net present value of the future cashflows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
viii) Employee benefits
Pensions
Contributions to employees’ personal plans are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Share-based payment schemes
The fair value of equity rights is estimated using the Black Scholes and binomial models at the date of grant to directors and staff and is dependent 
on factors such as the exercise price, expected volatility, option price and risk free interest rate. The fair value is then amortised through the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Expected volatility is determined based on the historic share price volatility (market 
price) for the Company on the grant date over a period matched to the expected life of the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to 
the share price not achieving the threshold for vesting.
ix) Capitalisation of borrowing costs
Net borrowing costs in respect of capital expenditure on properties under development or undergoing refurbishment are capitalised. Interest is 
capitalised using the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowing from the commencement of development work until the date of practical 
completion. The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted. Tax relief on 
interest capitalised on properties under development is reflected in the Income Statement. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income 
Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
x) Tax
Tax is included in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is 
recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date. 
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated 
deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences, except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures where the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amount used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised.
xi) Investment properties
Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held either for long term rental growth or for capital appreciation or 
both. This includes property held for development and for long term retention. Investment properties are initially recognised at cost including related 
transaction costs and valued bi-annually by professionally qualified external valuers. In relation to completed properties, the valuations are prepared 
by considering the aggregate of the net annual rents receivable from the properties and where relevant, associated costs. Investment properties 
under development are valued on the basis of their future cashflows. A yield which reflects the specific risks inherent in the net cashflows is then 
applied to the net annual rentals to arrive at the property valuation.
Properties held under operating leases are accounted for as investment properties where the other criteria for recognition are met.  
Such operating leases are accounted for as if they are finance leases.
Additions to investment properties consist of costs of a capital nature and in the case of investment properties under development,  
capitalised interest.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the Income Statement of the year in which they arise.
xii) Leases
Where a Group company is the lessee:
a) Operating leases – lease in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another party, the lessor, are classified as 
operating leases. Payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the 
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
b) Finance leases – leases of assets where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the property and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in current and non-current borrowings. The finance charges 
are charged to the Income Statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability for each period. The investment properties acquired under finance leases are subsequently carried at their fair value. 70 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Notes to the Accounts
continued
1 Accounting policies continued
xii) Leases continued
Where a Group company is the lessor:
a) Operating leases – properties leased out to tenants under operating leases are included in investment properties in the Balance Sheet with 
rental income recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
b) Finance leases – when assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a 
receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income.  
Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax which reflects a constant periodic rate of return. 
Where only the buildings element of a property lease is classified as a finance lease, the land element is shown within operating leases. 
xiii) Owner-occupied properties, plant and equipment
Owner-occupied properties are held at cost less, in the case of leasehold assets, accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the lease. 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the 
useful life of these assets estimated at between three to five years.
xiv) Trading properties
Trading properties are properties acquired or developed and held for sale and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of 
trading properties is determined on the basis of specific identification of their individual costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price  
in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
xv) Financial instruments
The Group initially recognises all financial instruments at fair value.
Other non-current investments
Other non-current investments are non-derivative investments that are designated as available for sale and are shown at fair value. Adjustments to 
fair value are recognised in equity except for impairments which are reflected in the Income Statement. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the agreed terms of the receivables concerned.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand, deposits with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the Income Statement 
over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk. These financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value 
and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge 
accounting as cashflow hedges in which case the effective element of the gain or loss is recognised directly through equity in a hedging reserve.
The Group’s derivative financial instruments are shown in these accounts at fair value as derived by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, financial 
risk consultants, based on market prices, estimated future cashflows and forward rates as appropriate.
Other derivative instruments
From time to time, the Group invests in derivatives to mitigate or enhance its exposure to a particular class or a spectrum of property assets and 
related businesses. Such instruments are accounted for initially at fair value with subsequent recognition in the Balance Sheet at fair value being 
reflected through the Income Statement.
xvi) Own shares held by ESOP Trusts and treasury shares
Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP Trusts, The Quintain Group Employee Benefit Trust and the Quintain Estates and Development 
Deferred Bonus Plan Trust, are included in the Group financial statements. In particular, the Trusts’ purchases of shares in the Company and shares 
acquired as treasury shares are debited to equity. 71

2 Segmental analysis
The Group has the following reporting segments by which the Board monitors the business and allocates resources. Urban Regeneration includes a 
number of properties with similar characteristics, risks and rewards in connection with mixed-use redevelopment in urban locations. The Group 
also invests in a number of property funds with differing characteristics, each of which is treated as a separate segment. References to QFM relate 
to the Group’s Quintain Fund Management division. All activities are based in the United Kingdom and Channel Islands. The analysis of the

In November 2009, the Company issued 390,160,296 new shares through a rights issue (note 22). To reflect the rights issue, the number of shares 
previously used to calculate the 2009 earnings per share data has been amended in the table shown above. An adjustment factor of 2.1214 has been 
applied, based on the ratio of the Company’s share price of 166 pence per share on 24 November 2009, the day before the record date for the rights 
issue, and the theoretical ex-rights price at that date of 78.25 pence per share.

Although not required under IFRS, net asset value per share is considered a key performance indicator in the sector in which the Group operates.
The number of shares in issue has been adjusted for the 2,773,568 (2009: 2,059,388) shares held by ESOP Trusts and by the Group as  
treasury shares.
Apart from allocations which have vested but not been released, entitlements under the Executive Directors’ Performance Share Plan have  
been excluded from the calculation in ii) above as the commitments relate to contingently issuable shares where the conditions had not been met  
at the balance sheet date. 
The 2009 net asset value per share has been adjusted to reflect the impact of the rights issue as this gives a more informative number for 
comparative purposes.

The Board does not propose to pay a final dividend. The dividend of £10,872,000 included in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity

Impairment (7,790)

Disposals (6,685)
Impairment (150)
Revaluation loss (60)
Fair value 31 March 2010 3,925
In the year to 31 March 2009, an impairment loss was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to the whole of the Group’s investment in 
Serrastone SA following a revision to the cashflow forecasts of the business in the light of prevailing economic conditions. For similar reasons, in the 
current year, an investment held in a company which was operating a hotel in the United Kingdom has been fully impaired. The remaining 
investment at the balance sheet date is shown at the value at which it is quoted on AIM.
During the year, the Group redeemed one of its investments with proceeds of £6,759,000 and a profit over book value of £74,000.
12 Trading properties
As at 31 March 2010, five properties were held for resale and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value and include capitalised interest 
of £1,969,000 (2009: £1,113,000). As at that date, the directors have assessed that the net realisable value of the Group’s trading properties exceeds 
the carrying value. During the year, an impairment of £8,114,000 (2009: £nil) was recognised in respect of one of the Group’s trading properties. 
During the year, the Group sold residential units at Wembley which had a book value of £11,018,000 (2009: £19,381,000) (note 3).

Overview Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
19 Financial assets and liabilities
The Group is exposed to the following types of risk from its use of financial instruments:
Credit risk
Liquidity risk
Market risk
This note presents information about the nature of the Group’s exposure, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and 
the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has 
established a Risk Committee which meets four times a year and is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management 
policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board in relation to its activities.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a 
disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures 
and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group Audit Committee is assisted in 
its oversight role by Internal Audit. This function is currently outsourced to Grant Thornton. The internal auditor undertakes both regular and ad hoc 
reviews of risk management control and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. It relates principally to the Group’s receivables from tenants and other third parties. The credit rating of counterparties to 
financial instruments is kept under review, particularly in light of the current economic climate. Given that the majority of positions are significantly 
out of the money, this does not represent a major risk at the current time. 
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s activities are focused exclusively in Great Britain and the Channel Islands and within this geographical area, its exposure to credit risk 
arising from trade and other receivables is influenced by the individual characteristics of each tenant. As at 31 March 2010, the Group’s 20 largest 
tenants within its directly held properties and its joint ventures accounted for 39.2% (2009: 34.6%) of the passing rents from these properties.
The Group operates a policy whereby the creditworthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to lease or pre-lease terms being agreed.  
The process includes seeking external ratings where available and reviewing financial information in the public domain. In certain cases,  
the Group will require collateral to support these lease obligations. This usually takes the form of a rent deposit, parent company guarantee  
or a bank guarantee.
Rent collection is outsourced to managing agents who report regularly on payment performance and provide the Group with intelligence on the 
continuing financial viability of tenants. Arrears are monitored internally on a weekly basis by the internal property management teams and a 
strategy for dealing with significant potential defaults is presented on a timely basis by the Head of Investment Portfolio or the property managers 
of the Group’s various joint ventures to the weekly meeting of the executive directors.
Outstanding tenant balances are reviewed on a quarterly basis for impairment with an allowance of £803,000 being made in the current year 
(2009: £412,000) as shown in note 3.
In addition to input from its managing agents, the Quercus fund uses an external organisation for monitoring the credit strength of its 
healthcare tenants.
In relation to iQ, the student accommodation fund in which the Group has a 49.98% share, rents are either collected directly from universities 
or are underpinned by deposits received in advance from students.
Guarantees
Where Group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of obligations of other companies within the 
Group, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the guarantor will be required to make 
a payment under the guarantee. In the current and comparative periods, such guarantees did not have any impact on the financial statements.
In respect of the development of the two office buildings on the Greenwich Peninsula as part of the N0204 joint venture, the Group’s 
outstanding contingent liabilities relate to the joint venture banking facilities and comprise: 
i) an interest guarantee in respect of 50% of all interest, costs and commitment fees or equity injection (see below); and 
ii) a contingent equity guarantee in respect of 50% of any repayment obligation or equity injection (see below) up to a maximum of £30m.
If at 30 November 2010, interest cover is less than 1.0 times and/or the loan to value covenant is less than 70%, the Group and Lend Lease Europe 
Limited must provide sufficient funds by way of an equity injection to ensure compliance with these covenants. 
In respect of iQ, if the loan to value covenant of 65% is not met, or the interest cover covenant of 1.25 times is not met, then the Group would be 
required to inject equity alongside its partner, Wellcome, to restore the covenants.  88 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as these fall due.
Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Group’s operational requirements. The Group has a £20m 
working capital facility to manage day to day cash movements. Surplus cash is used to reduce debt. 
The Group’s policy is to finance its activities using equity and medium term debt, the proportions depending on the profile of the operational 
and financial risks to the business. The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant but with floating charges 
over the assets of its subsidiaries. 
The Group’s bilateral banking facilities carry an average interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 115 basis points. The key covenants negotiated 
with the banks included interest cover of 1.25 times after taking account of capitalised borrowing costs and gearing of 110% based on net assets as 
shown in the Group’s balance sheet adjusted for deferred tax on revaluation surpluses and fair value adjustments on financial instruments. 
Following renegotiation, in March 2009 the Group was granted an option exercisable annually over a three year period to extend the gearing 
limit to 150% with a ratcheted margin rate and payment on each occasion of the exercise of the option of an amendment fee. The option was 
exercised in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2010 but following receipt of the proceeds of the rights issue, not for the financial year 
ending 31 March 2011. On not exercising the option, the margin increased by 25 basis points.
During the year, the Group also negotiated a new secured facility of £51.7m with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2% and a final 
maturity date of September 2014. 
At the year end, the Group had unutilised facilities of £263m (2009: £134.5m). Subsequently, £15m of these facilities have been cancelled. 
Market risk
In relation to the Group, market risk arises mainly from the impact that changes in interest rates might have on the Group’s cost of borrowing.  
The weighted average rate of interest relating to the Group’s debt as at 31 March 2010 was 6.2% (2009: 4.0%).
The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these only to limit potential interest rate fluctuations. It usually borrows at floating 
rates of interest and uses hedging instruments to achieve an interest rate profile where the majority of borrowings are fixed or capped. As at 
31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, all of the Group’s net debt was fixed or protected. Further information on the Group’s financial instruments is 
given in note 20. 
The fair value of the Group’s outstanding financial instruments, as shown in note 20, have been estimated by JC Rathbone, financial risk 
consultants, by calculating the present value of future cashflows, using appropriate market discount rates. The derivatives have all been deemed to 
be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. All other financial liabilities and assets are deemed to be Level 3. 
Since 31 March 2010, the Group has re-set the swap rate relating to £150m of the swaps in existence at the year end with a termination date of 
22 April 2013 to the current market rate of 1.735%. 
The Group is also exposed to market rate risk through the activities of its joint ventures, which borrow at variable rates and use financial 
instruments to safeguard against market movements in rates. This is disclosed in note 20 in respect of the Group’s interests in its Quercus, iQ and 
N0204 (Greenwich) investments. 
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base with a view to underpinning investor, creditor and market confidence and sustaining the 
future development of the business. The Board receives ongoing reports on the demographic spread of shareholders and maintains regular contact 
with the principal investors of these in order to discuss performance and communicate strategy. The Board monitors the Group’s performance in 
terms of its main financial indicator, total return, at both a corporate and individual asset level, and sets internal guidelines for interest cover and 
gearing. The executive directors monitor the Group’s current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
In the interest of the shareholders, the Board has in the past pursued a progressive dividend policy but has currently deferred the payment of 
dividends until the business becomes cash positive again.
The Board also encourages employees to participate in the share ownership structure through savings investment plans, the share-based 
element of bonus arrangements and the various performance related employee share option schemes, all of which it considers best align the interest 
of employees with those of the Group and its shareholders. Shareholder approval for proposals relating to new employee share participation schemes 
is to be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
From time to time, the Group purchases its own shares in the market. Such purchases can take the form of treasury shares with the aim of 
using these to cover entitlements under bonus arrangements and options schemes but also for cancellation on occasions when the Board considers 
that this course of action would enhance the value of the Group for the shareholders. No shares were purchased during the year.
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are 
subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than those referred to above in connection with the Group’s financing arrangements.  89

ii) Sensitivity analysis
As at 31 March 2010, it is estimated that an increase of 50 basis points in interest rates would have increased the Group’s loss before tax by  
£536,000 (2009: £1,132,000) and that a decrease of 50 basis points would have reduced the Group’s loss before tax by £536,000 (2009: £1,132,000). 
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
These estimates have been compiled by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings net of interest rate swaps in 
existence during the year.
The impact on the fair value of the Group’s interest rate swaps and caps in existence as at 31 March 2010 of an increase in 50 basis points in 
interest rates would have been to reduce the loss before tax by £100,000 with a credit directly to equity of £4,980,000. A decrease in interest rates 
by 50 basis points would have increased the Group’s loss before tax by £80,000 with a debit directly to equity of £4,980,000.
In relation to the year ended 31 March 2009, the impact on the fair value of interest rate swaps held at that year end of an increase in interest 
rates of 50 basis points would have been to reduce the loss before tax by £446,000 with a credit directly to equity of £6,846,000. A decrease in 
interest rates of 50 basis points would have increased the Group’s loss before tax by £308,000 with a debit directly to equity of £6,846,000.

The Sterling balance included £23,792,000 (2009: £nil) held by solicitors to the order of the Group in relation to the purchase of a property completed 
after the balance sheet date. The remainder principally comprises deposits placed with banks at market rates for maturities of not more than one 
month, at an average rate of 1.3% (2009: 2.8%). Such deposits are considered to be cash equivalents.
iv) Fair value of financial instruments
As at 31 March 2010, the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities were equal to their book values with the exception of non-current 
liabilities: bank loans and other borrowings which have a negative fair value adjustment as assessed by JC Rathbone Associates Limited of 
£1,055,000 (2009: negative £194,000).  90 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010

The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under non-cancellable operating leases. The majority of properties are 
let for terms from five to 35 years at a market rent. Standard lease provisions include service charge recovery and upward only rent reviews every five 
years. On review, rents are increased either by a contractual formula or to current market rent (estimated rental value or ERV). Typically, single let 
properties are leased on terms where the tenant is responsible for repair, insurance and running costs while multi-let properties are leased on terms 
which include recovery of a share of service charge expenditure and insurance. Only one of the Group’s properties is let on terms which include a 
turnover based element.

Notes to the Company Accounts
For the year ended 31 March 2010
28 Loss for the year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Profit and Loss Account of the Company is not presented as part of these financial 
statements. The loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders dealt with in the financial statements was £22,692,000 (2009: profit of 
£60,035,000). The Company had no employees in the year (2009: none).
Amounts paid to the Company’s auditor in respect of services to the Company, other than the auditor of the Company’s financial statements, 
have not been disclosed as the information is required instead to be disclosed on a consolidated basis (note 4).
29 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial 
statements:
i) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) and under the historical cost accounting rules except that other fixed asset investments and derivative financial instruments 
have been stated at fair value.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own Profit and Loss Account.
ii) Going concern
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will continue to meet its 
liabilities as these fall due. As the Company is party to the loan agreements of the Group similar risks and uncertainties apply and therefore the 
going concern paragraphs on page 67 of the Group financial statements are equally relevant to the Company. 
iii) Turnover and cost of sales
Turnover is stated net of VAT and comprises fees and commissions receivable from participating interests. Fees from fund management relate to 
base and performance fees receivable in respect of asset management and procurement fees. Performance fees are recognised when it is certain 
that performance criteria have been met.
iv) Tangible fixed assets
These assets comprise long leasehold property, fixtures, fittings and equipment and are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. 
Depreciation is charged on fixtures, fittings and equipment on a straight-line basis over the useful life of these assets estimated at between 
three and five years. 
v) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and the associate are held in the company Balance Sheet at cost and reviewed for impairment. 
Impairments are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
Other investments are designated as available for sale and are shown at fair value. Revaluation movements are recognised through equity. 
vi) Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are stated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
vii) Impairment of non-financial assets
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
viii) Taxation
The credit for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, for all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19, ‘Deferred Taxation’. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
ix) Own shares held by Company 
Purchase of own shares held by the Company are debited directly to equity.
x) Own shares held by ESOP Trusts
Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP Trust are included in the financial statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in the 
Company are debited directly to equity.
xi) Financial instruments
Investments
Other investments are non-derivative investments that are designated as available for sale and are shown at fair value. Revaluation movements are 
recognised through equity.  101
Overview Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
29 Accounting policies continued
xi) Financial instruments continued
Debtors: amounts falling due within one year
Debtors are recognised at invoiced values less provisions for impairment. A provision for impairment of debtors is established where there is 
objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the agreed terms of the receivables concerned.
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand consists of cash in hand, deposits with banks and other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities  
of three months or less.
Creditors: amounts falling due within one year
Creditors due within one year are non-interest bearing and are recognised at invoiced amounts.
Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year
These creditors consist of interest bearing borrowings, which are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to help manage its interest rate risk. These derivative financial instruments are recognised 
initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Profit and  
Loss Account, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as cashflow hedges in which case the effective element of the gain or loss is 
recognised directly through reserves in a hedging reserve.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the instrument 
at the balance sheet date, taking account of current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties. 
The Company’s derivative financial instruments are shown in these accounts at fair value as derived by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, 
financial risk consultants, based on market prices, estimated future cashflows and forward rates as appropriate.
Other derivative instruments
From time to time, the Company invests in derivatives to mitigate or enhance its exposure to a particular class or a spectrum of property assets and 
related businesses. Such instruments are accounted for initially at cost with subsequent adjustments to fair value being reflected through the Profit 
and Loss Account.
xii) Share-based payments
The fair value of equity rights is estimated using the Black Scholes and binomial models at the date of grant to the directors and staff and is 
dependent on factors such as the exercise price, expected volatility, option price and risk free interest rate. The fair value is then amortised to the 
Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Expected volatility is determined based on the historical share price 
volatility (market price) for the Company on the grant date over a period matched to the expected life of the awards.
xiii) Guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of obligations of its subsidiary companies, the 
guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the guarantor will be required to make payments 
under the guarantee.  102  Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010

41 Related party disclosure
During the year, the Company had related party transactions with Greenwich Peninsula Regeneration Limited, Greenwich Peninsula N0204 Blocks 
A&B Unit Trusts and BioRegional Quintain Limited. Details of these transactions are included within note 25. 
42 Commitments
The Company had no material operating lease or other commitments at 31 March 2010 (2009: £nil).
Guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of obligations of its subsidiary companies, the 
guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the guarantor will be required to make a payment 
under the guarantee. In the current and comparative periods, such guarantees did not have any impact on the financial statements. 
In respect of the development of the two office buildings on the Greenwich Peninsula as part of the N0204 joint venture, the Company’s 
contingent liabilities relate to the joint venture banking facilities and comprise:
i) interest guarantee in respect of 50% of all interest, costs and commitment fees or equity injection (see below) and;
ii) a contingent equity guarantee in respect of 50% of any repayment obligation or equity injection (see below) up to a maximum of £30m. 
If at 30 November 2010, interest cover is less than 1.0 times and/or the loan to value covenant is less than 70%, the Company and Lend Lease Europe 
Limited must provide sufficient funds by way of an equity injection to ensure compliance with these covenants. 
In respect of iQ, if the loan to value covenant of 65% is not met, or the interest cover covenant of 1.25 times is not met, then the Company would 
be required to inject equity alongside its partner, the Wellcome Trust, to restore the covenants. 
43 Directors’ benefits
Details of the directors’ emoluments, pension contributions and entitlements to share options and rights are set out in the Remuneration Report on

It comprises two forms:
• social rented housing – at low rents for households on lowest income; and

with rented accommodation. This form of affordable housing is targeted at households which are 
generally working but have lower than average incomes and in some cases will include  
key workers

Section 106 agreement 
 
 
 
 
 A Section 106 agreement (derived from the relevant section of the Town and Country Planning Act 
1990) is typically an agreement between a local planning authority and a developer negotiated in 
the context of granting planning permission. It provides a means of ensuring that developers 
contribute towards the infrastructure and services that the local authority believes to be necessary 
to facilitate the proposed development. Contributions may be either in cash or in kind. A Section 
106 agreement can also be used to deliver affordable housing  112  Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010

What we do
Quintain’s ultimate aim is to own, promote 
and manage ground leased estates that are 
run as businesses, balanced by a large scale 
fund management operation where the rents 
are primarily linked to the retail price index.
Retention of the freehold of our estates 
means that we have a vested interest in 
engineering their long term success.
The diversification of our model seeks to 
offset the higher risk of development against 
the significantly more stable sectors in 
which our funds operate. It is a model 
designed to lead to robust income and 
capital growth.

2013 has been the year we can start to see the rewards of all 
our hard work with the fastest revenue growth since 2009. 
This is the welcome result of all our investments in our 
brands, our online services and technologies, high street 
stores and international expansion.
Behind the scenes, we’ve been busy testing, refining and 
developing our initiatives, and as sales continue to rise, we’re 
seeing positive results across the business. But there’ll be no 
resting on our laurels – we’ll be redoubling our efforts in all areas, 
and putting every effort into delighting our customers.
Our online channels now account for 55% of our overall 
business, with 26% (and counting) of website traffic arriving 
via mobile devices. Good news too from America, where 
annual sales have risen by 75%. High street stores for 
Simply Be and Jacamo are looking promising.
Finally, we have changes in our management team. 
Lord Alliance, after 49 years as the Chairman and major 
shareholder of the business, has stepped down, and our 
new Chairman is Andrew Higginson, former Executive 
Director of Tesco. Our Chief Executive, Alan White, will also 
retire later this year. In his place will stand Angela Spindler, 
currently the Chief Executive of The Original Factory Shop. 
We warmly welcome both Andrew and Angela aboard and 
wish them every success going forward.

OUR SUCCESS STORIES
Agility has become a key business skill in 
this new age of retail progress. But as the 
figures show, being flexible and receptive  
to change hasn’t meant getting smaller. 
On the contrary. We’ve seen good growth 
in sales, with plenty more exciting 
developments across the business.
A bigger US reach
Things stateside are just getting better, 
with 75% annual sales growth in the 
US. Simply Be is going from strength 
to strength. We’ve launched Marisota 
online, and we’ll also be launching 
Jacamo for direct mail.
These are exciting times for our 
brands overseas, and we’ve got  
every reasonable expectation of  
their ongoing success. 
We’re going places 
on the high street
We’ve opened five new Simply Be 
stores and introduced the Jacamo 
brand to five of the seven stores now 
open. The dual fascia format has 
shown encouraging results so far, 
attracting new customers both to the 
stores and online. We are reviewing 
the business model in preparation for 
further expansion.

New faces at the top
Progress brings positive change, and 
as our business adapts, so does our 
leadership team. Lord Alliance remains 
on our board of directors, but has 
stepped down as Chairman to make 
way for Andrew Higginson, former 
Executive Director of Tesco. Andrew 
is a strong commercial strategist, and 
his experience in modern-day retailing 
is sure to serve us extremely well.
Our Chief Executive, Alan White, 
will also leave us later this year. Alan 
has led the business since 2002, and 
his legacy is a thriving and progressive 
business which is one of the leading 
online retailers.
In his place will stand Angela Spindler, 
the Chief Executive of The Original 
Factory Shop, who has had a blue 
chip retail career with Debenhams, 
Asda, Coca Cola and Mars.
Our people and our success are 
intertwined, and every achievement 
past, present and future is a direct 
result of our leadership strengths 
and retail strategy. We warmly 
welcome Andrew and Angela onto 
our leadership team, and we wish 
Alan all the very best for the future. N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 08
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
We are pleased to report that the group made good trading 
progress throughout last year and that this has continued 
into the new financial year. This is despite the continuing 
difficulties in the economy as a whole and for consumers 
and retailers in particular.
We have achieved these positive results by maintaining a clear focus on improving 
the product, presentation, value and service to our customers. In addition 
we have invested heavily in our online systems, new customer recruitment, 
international expansion and concept stores which have the potential to be 
significant growth drivers in the medium term, although they reduce profits in 
the short term. The early signs from these activities look promising.
Financial Results
Total group revenue increased by 
6.0% to £784.7m versus the 52 week 
comparative and by 5.5% on a like-
for-like basis, excluding the non-
comparable periods for newly opened 
stores. Having seen a reduction in the 
rate of gross margin in the first half of 
1.6%, an equivalent increase in the 
second half resulted in an unchanged 
rate for the year of 53.0%.
Operating profit was up by 3. 1% to 
£102.2m, after accounting for losses 
of £6.8m from the expanded customer 
recruitment programme, international 
trading and the Simply Be/Jacamo 
stores. Excluding these items core UK 
home shopping profit rose by 7 .9% to 
£109.0m, despite the tough economic 
environment for consumers.
Profit before taxation was £96.4m 
(2012, £96.9m) but was up 2.6% to 
£95.1m after excluding the impact of 
the 53rd week last year and the fair 
value adjustments to financial 
instruments.
Adjusted earnings per share were 
28. 15p, almost identical to last year 
despite a slightly higher tax charge 
of 1 7 .6% (2012, 16.4%). The board is 
proposing a final dividend of 8.23 pence 
per share, up 6.3% on last year , giving a 
total dividend for the year of 13.68 pence 
up by 5.0%, and covered 2. 1 times. 
Net borrowings at 2 March 2013 
reduced to £188.7m (2012, £192.5m) 
despite the continuing higher level of 
capital expenditure of £25.0m, primarily 
for online and stores development.
Net finance costs increased from 
£6.4m to £7 . 1m, covered 14 times by 
operating profit. Gearing has fallen 
from 48% to 42% on net assets which 
have risen by 10.9% to £446.0m.
Trading Highlights
The results for the year show the 
benefit of a portfolio of brands and 
the breadth of our product range 
which has enabled us to allocate our 
marketing investment to those areas 
giving the best return. Consequently 
we have seen the fastest growth, 
15%, from our younger brands, such 
as Simply Be, Jacamo and Fashion 
World, as it has been easier both to 
recruit new customers, predominantly 
online, and get higher sales from the 
existing customers. Conversely the 
brands targeted at the over 50’s, 
such as JD Williams, Fifty Plus, 
Marisota and Julipa have exhibited 
slower growth, 1%, as these customers 
have continued to be cautious with 
their spending. However this group 
did increase revenue by 3% in the 
second half compared to flat sales in 
the first half.

The continued investment to make our 
websites match best practice has been 
rewarded with an increase of 15% in 
online revenue to £424m, which now 
represents 55% of home shopping 
revenue. The increase also reflects the 
cultural changes we are making in the 
business to have everyone thinking 
from a multi-channel perspective.
Revenue grew in all our major product 
categories. Ladieswear recovered from 
a first half decline to grow by 4% in the 
second half, and by 1% for the year as 
a whole. Footwear and menswear grew 
by 5% and 8% respectively, capitalising 
on our size and fit expertise. However 
the fastest growth came from the home 
and gift category where sales grew 
by 15% and now account for 30% of 
group revenue. The more aggressive 
pricing policy on key value indicator 
lines in home and gift drove sufficient 
incremental volume to cover the lower 
rate of gross margin and, coupled 
with extensions to the product ranges, 
especially online exclusives, resulted in 
an encouraging performance.
Our international expansion is focused 
on building a presence in the USA, 
where revenue rose by 75% to £8.4m. 
We continue to believe there is a major 
strategic opportunity for the group to 
win a share of the $35 billion plus size 
ladieswear market in the USA, and 
we are building the marketing and 
operational capability to achieve this. 
We traded from seven Simply Be 
stores in the UK, three of which had a 
Jacamo menswear section, and these 
dual fascia stores have been the most 
successful. We are now evaluating the 
potential for rolling out this format in 
other major UK cities, recognising that 
they help to build brand awareness 
and online penetration in addition to 
the revenue transacted in the store.
Current Trading and Outlook
Sales for the 7 weeks to 20 April 
2013 are up by 6.3% on last year and 
by 6. 1% on a like-for-like basis. The 
cold weather in this period has had a 
significant negative impact on the sales 
of summer clothing but we have seen 
good performances from menswear 
and home and gift which have more 
than offset this issue. 
We started the new financial year with a 
stronger customer base than a year ago 
as a result of the increased investment 
in customer recruitment. We intend to 
maintain this higher level of recruitment 
activity and continue to drive the 
proportion of our revenue transacted 
online through positive trading actions, 
whilst at the same time reducing the 
volume of catalogue mailings through 
our contact optimisation programme. 
The trading teams are being reorganised 
to give greater focus on the key brands 
and the product development required 
to deliver growth in market share. In 
addition we are looking to give our 
customers more choice by offering 
more options for payment, delivery 
and ways to contact us.
Dedicated websites for Marisota and 
Jacamo are being launched in the USA 
to complement Simply Be to deliver a 
more segmented offer and maintain 
high growth momentum, and Figleaves 
is also looking to boost sales there. 
We will identify possible new sites for 
UK store expansion in the autumn 
once we have fully evaluated the 
potential of this channel and developed 
the essential features for a roll-out.
There are also major projects 
underway to assess the requirements 
of our information technology systems 
and processes and the operational 
capacity to ensure we can manage our 
anticipated growth in the medium term.
Although we expect market conditions 
to remain challenging, based on the 
stronger customer file and the planned 
activities to drive further growth, the 
board remains confident in the outlook 
for the business. I would like to thank 
all stakeholders in the business for their 
contribution, and especially all of the 
staff for their hard work and dedication 
throughout the year.
Board Composition
My appointment to the board in July 
2012 and accession to chairman in 
September 2012 was the start of 
a significant transformation of the 
board which will be completed during 
2013. I succeeded Lord Alliance of 
Manchester CBE when he stepped 
down to the role of non-executive 
director after over 40 years as 
chairman of the group. I have very 
much appreciated his wise counsel 
over the last few months.
Angela Spindler , currently the chief 
executive of The Original Factory Shop, 
will join N Brown Group as chief executive 
on 1 July 2013. She has had extensive 
retail and consumer experience at Coca 
Cola, Pedigree Petfoods, Asda and 
Debenhams. Angela will take over from 
our current chief executive, Alan White, 
who will retire to a plural career after 
1 1 successful years as chief executive 
and after an appropriate handover period 
to effect a smooth transition.
Nigel Alliance OBE retired in December 
2012 having been a director of the 
board since 1969 and Lord Stone of 
Blackheath stepped down after 10 years 
service on the board. We thank them 
both for an outstanding contribution.
We have now announced three new 
non-executive directors who will 
enhance the diversity of the board as 
well as ensure we comply with best 
practice in corporate governance. Ron 
McMillan was deputy chairman of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Middle 
East and will become chair of audit later 
this year and also our senior independent 
director. Fiona Laird, the senior vice 
president of human resources at 
Unilever PLC, will chair the remuneration 
committee. Simon Patterson, managing 
director at Silver Lake, will chair the 
nominations committee and brings 
extensive knowledge of the global 
technology industry including digital 
media and e-commerce. 
There has been significant change at the 
Board in the last few months. I wish to 
record my thanks and congratulations 
to the departing directors, particularly 
Alan White as CEO, who have delivered 
strong growth and returns for investors 
over the years. As the business 
continues its migration online, they 
have left strong foundations and I am 
confident that the new board has the 
right blend of skills and experience to 
build on those foundations and deliver 
growth in the future. 
Andrew Higginson N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 10
CHIEf Ex ECUTIv E’S REv IEw The group has made good progress this year with 
the fastest rate of revenue growth since 2009. 
This has been achieved by investing in high levels 
of new customer recruitment, improving our product 
and promotional offers, especially online, and making 
progress with our key strategic initiatives. 
The 53rd week last year delivered revenue of £12.9m 
and operating profit of £2.9m. The commentary below 
is all based on a comparison of 2012/13 with the 
52 week version of 2011/12.
Revenue
Revenue growth has been delivered 
in our core home shopping business 
supplemented by increased 
contributions from our international 
and stores operations. For the 52 
weeks ended 2 March 2013 group 
revenue was £784.7m, up by 6.0% 
in total and by 5.5% on a like-for-
like basis. The growth in revenue 
accelerated as we progressed 
throughout the year, culminating in 
a strong second half which was up 
by 7 .1% on a like-for-like basis.
Customer Groups
The key objective of our marketing 
activity this year was to restore growth 
to the customer file, and this has been 
successfully achieved. Sales from new 
customers increased by 24% during 
the year benefitting from an extra £6m 
of marketing investment in media costs 
compared with the previous year. 
The additional investment has been 
spent with the online search engines 
on “pay per click” recruits, which is 
now our single largest channel of 
recruitment, and for television airtime 
for direct response advertisements. 
Inevitably these methods of 
recruitment bring in younger than 
average customers. 
In addition to the increased sales from 
new customers we also saw a 1% 
increase in orders from our established 
database and a 2% increase in the 
amount spent by each customer. We 
entered the new financial year with an 
active database of 6.4m customers, 
who are predominantly female with an 
average age of 57 . 
The number of those customers who 
had placed an order in the last year 
was up by 6%, a key indicator of 
future growth.

Under 50 Customer Group
The brands in this customer segment 
continue to be the main contributors 
to the group’s overall revenue growth.
Simply Be is the largest brand in 
this segment with sales in excess of 
£122m and growth of 14% across all 
channels and geographies. It has the 
most fashion-conscious customers 
and our expertise is in recognising 
the latest trends and designing 
our clothing range to look good on 
customers whether they are size 
14 or size 32. On average Simply Be’s 
customers are visiting the website 
every few days looking for new lines.
Jacamo is targeted at the brand-
conscious thirty-something male 
who wants the convenience of online 
shopping and branded clothing in 
their size, and identifies with the fun-
loving image of the brand, exemplified 
by Freddie Flintoff as our brand 
ambassador. This continues to be 
our fastest growing brand with sales 
up by 36%.

revamp of the product range, a more 
contemporary feel to the catalogue 
and website and the use of celebrities 
such as Claire Sweeney and Claire 
Richards to promote the brand, have 
resulted in revenue growth of over 4%.
Figleaves, the leading online lingerie 
brand, has seen strong growth in 
profitability, managing its cost base 
extremely well on revenues which 
were slightly up.
50 Plus Customer Group
The 50 plus customer group has had 
a difficult time during the recession 
but there were signs of improvement 
in the second half, when revenue grew 
by 3%, resulting in a positive sales 
outcome for the year as a whole.
The strongest growth in this segment 
came from House of Bath, which 
sells an eclectic range of items for the 
home and garden, where revenue 
grew by 34%, built on very successful 
recruitment campaigns. There was 
also strong growth from Marisota 
which targets customers in their early 
50’s with a catalogue and website 
offering fitting solutions for clothing 
and footwear. The menswear brands, 
High & Mighty and Premier Man, saw 
modest growth. Our largest brand, 
JD Williams and its associated titles, 
which supply a wide range of products 
to customers who are typically retired, 
saw revenue fall by 5%, partly due to 
reductions in the recruitment budget in 
previous seasons. Julipa, focussed on 
our most traditional customers, 
had flat sales year on year.

In light of the lacklustre economy 
and the adverse weather conditions 
throughout most of last year it is 
pleasing that we have managed 
to grow revenue in all four product 
categories.
Ladieswear revenue grew by 1%. 
The global supply chain has settled 
down after the turbulent conditions in 
2011 and this has helped us to have 
better balanced stock levels, resulting 
in higher full margin sales but fewer 
discounted sales. The impact of a 
very wet summer followed by a cold 
start to 2013 depressed sales but in 
between we had strong sales from 
our autumn ranges. We exploited our 
online capabilities to create fashion 
stories and capsule ranges to reflect 
the latest trends. In contrast the sales 
of occasionwear and higher priced 
garments were disappointing.
Footwear sales were up by 5% with 
the strongest growth from Viva La 
Diva, our online footwear portal, and 
men’s footwear. The weather patterns 
resulted in strong boot sales but weak 
sandal sales. 
Menswear continued its strong growth 
as it has done for each of the last 5 
years, and broke through the £100m 
barrier for the first time. 
The use of Freddie Flintoff as a 
celebrity ambassador for Jacamo, 
including strong sales from his own 
range, contributed to the growth of 
younger menswear.
Home and gift sales had an excellent 
year with growth of 15%. Our strategy 
across all product groups was to 
sharpen our price points on easily 
comparable lines and this had the 
greatest effect on the home and gift 
revenue. In addition we have been 
using our supplier integration portal 
to significantly increase the number of 
lines available online with the product 
being despatched directly from the 
supplier. The aggregate impact of 
these changes was to drive much 
higher volumes at a lower rate of 
gross margin with a net benefit in 
terms of cash contribution. Within this 
category there were some excellent 
performances from electrical, furniture,

Online sales have increased as a 
proportion of our home shopping 
revenues by five percentage points 
or more for each of the last 8 years. 
Last year the proportion rose from 
50% to 55% with online revenue 
rising by 15% to £424m, maintaining 
our position in the top division of 
internet retailers. The growth of 
online purchasing is partly down to 
global acceptance of digital media by 
consumers and we aim to accelerate 
this trend with our customers as it 
delivers increased revenue and lower 
operating costs. To this end we now  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 12

recruit most customers through online 
campaigns, sponsoring approximately 
five million key words and phrases 
through online search engines coupled 
with sophisticated optimisation 
techniques. We also link our direct 
response television campaigns and 
our newspaper advertisements into 
our websites. We continue to expand 
the number of internet exclusive 
product lines and last year had 84,000 
stock options which were never 
featured in a catalogue generating 
an incremental £42m of revenue. 
Last year saw an explosion in mobile 
access to the internet through the 
burgeoning sales of smartphones and 
tablet computers. We quickly adapted 
all our websites to be “mobile friendly” 
and by the year end 26% of all online 
sessions were being accessed from 
mobile devices, which accounted for 
23% of the value of sales transacted. 
There is much evidence that the 
older consumer is adapting to tablet 
computers at a fast rate which will help 
to accelerate the switch from paper to 
digital media in the coming years.
The ideal scenario for the customer 
is to be able to switch seamlessly 
between channels without noticing 
any variation in the branding or service 
offer. As an example we saw the 
number of inbound calls to our contact 
centre decline by 9% but by offering 
the same affinity products to our 
telephone orderers as we do to our 
online customers we increased 
our add-on sales by £15m.
To be truly multi-channel requires a 
store portfolio and we are testing this 
concept for our younger brands in 
targeted locations. During the year 
we opened a further five Simply Be 
stores and in addition we utilised 
some of the space in three of the 
stores for the Jacamo menswear 
range, which has done exceptionally 
well. Total revenue from the Simply 
Be/Jacamo stores was £4.6m with 
start-up losses of £2.2m. We are 
in the process of evaluating the 
incrementality of these sales, the 
positive halo effect on online sales 
and the projected return on capital 
achievable. Assuming this evaluation 
is positive we will look to open a  
limited number of stores in high 
footfall locations.
Our High & Mighty stores had revenue 
of over £9m, up by 5% despite tough 
trading conditions in many of the 
locations where they are trading. 
However more promotional activity 
resulted in a loss of £0.7m compared 
with our aspiration to reach breakeven.
International
Simply Be and Figleaves allow 
international orders to be placed 
on their websites from many parts 
of the world, but our overseas 
marketing is focussed on USA, Ireland 
and Germany. International sales 
amounted to £30.2m with losses of 
£1.9m (2012, £1.5m). Simply Be’s sales 
in the USA grew by 75% to £8.4m with 
an acceleration in the second half. We 
are still testing a variety of marketing 
and recruitment techniques, and have 
found that the Marisota product range, 
which is slightly less fashionable than 
Simply Be, yields better results from 
direct mail recruitment. Consequently 
we will launch a dedicated Marisota 
website in April 2013 as well as one for 
Jacamo menswear.
Our marketing expenditure in Germany 
has been significantly reduced and 
focussed wholly online. Whilst this has 
reduced revenue by 38% to £2.2m 
it has reduced losses and gives an 
expectation of breakeven next year.
Oxendales is our primary brand in 
Ireland, where we have traded for 
many years. The continuing economic 
woes have seen a decline in both sales 
and profits since the recession hit, and 
last year revenues fell a further 15% to 
£14.2m and operating profit was down 
49% to £1.7m.
Figleaves derives 22% of its total 
revenue of £24.7m from overseas, 
with the USA the main market, and 
has ambitions to grow sales further 
in this region.
Gross Margin and Credit
The rate of gross margin was level 
with the previous year at 53.0%. 
However this masks a 1.6% increase 
in the rate of gross margin in the 
second half to offset an equivalent 
reduction in the first half. There have 
been three key features which shaped 
the gross margin. The “Amazing Value” 
lines throughout the various product 
categories successfully traded gross 
margin rate for volume growth, but this 
was more than offset by a significant 
reduction in the level of product and 
marketing discounts compared with 
the high level in the second half of 
2011/12 when we had excess levels 
of stock to clear. The ratio of bad

debts to sales rose by 0.4% to 8.1% 
due to the high level of customer 
recruitment. The underlying level 
of arrears and write-offs was level 
with the prior year and the increase 
in the ratio is wholly due to this 
customer mix. 
The services revenue associated with 
our credit accounts rose by 6.1% to 
£226.9m, 29% of our total revenue.
Overheads
A 5% increase in average item values 
helped contain the rise in distribution 
costs to 3.9%. To build up the 
customer database we invested an 
extra £6m in recruitment campaigns, 
offset by a £2.5m reduction in 
catalogue costs through our contact 
optimisation programme. In addition 
we had invested further to support 
our strategic initiatives to drive 
international revenue and develop 
the stores channel.
Customer Service
We are continually looking to improve 
the customer service experience. 
During the last twelve months we 
have made more of the product range 
available for next day delivery and 
moved the cut-off time from 2pm to 
6pm. We have improved the online 
self-service “My Account” facility 
and the automated service emails 
are keeping the customers’ better 
informed and generating revenue. 
The end result has been a reduction 
in the number of enquiries and claims 
from our customers, keeping us in the 
top quartile for service amongst our 
peer group.
Current Trading and Outlook
We have made good progress with 
our strategic plan in the last year but 
there are still many opportunities to 
develop in the new financial year. 
The trading processes and organisation 
have been revamped to recognise the 
pre-eminence of the online channel 
and also to strengthen the focus 
on our key brands, both from 
product development and marketing 
perspectives. We will offer more choice 
in payment options to attract those 
customers who do not wish to open 
a credit account. The transition from 
paper contacts to online communication 
will be managed carefully to drive sales 
and reduce costs. The higher level of 
customer recruitment investment will be 
maintained. Strong revenue increases 
are anticipated from our operations in 
the United States, and from our Simply 
Be/Jacamo stores, and we expect 
lower levels of operating losses as these 
operations develop.
Revenue in the first 7 weeks of the 
new financial year is up by 6.3% 
and by 6. 1% on a like-for-like basis. 
The strength of our customer base 
is the most positive influence in 
delivering this rate of growth which 
has been achieved despite the cold 
spell in March which has significantly 
impacted the sales of ladies summer 
clothing. However sales of footwear 
and menswear have been positive and 
home and gift has continued its strong 
performance. This product mix has 
impacted the achieved rate of gross 
margin so far but we hope that we 
will enjoy better weather than the wet 
summer of 2012 to redress this issue.
Change of Chief Executive
This is my last Chief Executive’s report 
before starting to hand over to Angela 
Spindler from 1 July 2013. I have had a 
hugely enjoyable career with N Brown 
Group in two spells totalling 25 years, 
the last 11 years as chief executive, 
and I must especially thank David 
Alliance and Jim Martin for both these 
opportunities. It is almost impossible 
to believe that the business I joined 
with sales of £42m in 1985 could 
deliver these results in 2013. The 
talent, enthusiasm and dedication of 
everyone in the group has delivered 
this long-term transformation and 
I sincerely thank everyone for their 
contribution.
The business is in good shape 
today with a strong management 
team and I firmly believe that the 
group has an excellent strategic 
position with an exciting future 
ahead of it. I offer Angela my full 
support and best wishes to realise 
this potential and I am sure the group 
will continue to prosper under Andrew 
Higginson’s and Angela’s guidance.

Group Trading Summary
Group sales increased by 4.2% 
to £784.7m (2012, £753.2m) with 
operating profit rising by 0.2% to 
£102.2m (2012, £102.0m). Operating 
margins have fallen by 50bps from 
13.5% to 13.0% analysed as follows:
Net operating margin last year 13.5%
Impact of gross margin 
– Product  +70bps
Impact of gross margin 
– Financial Income/Bad Debt -70bps
Increase in operating costs -50bps
Net operating margin this year 13.0%
The rate of gross margin of 53.0% 
remained flat against last year. 
This was due to a combination of 
higher product margins as a result 
of lower promotional discounting 
especially in the second half, offset 
by an expected increase in the rate 
of charge for bad debts and a slight 
reduction in financial income yield. 
Overhead costs increased as a 
consequence of the store expansion 
and the recruitment drive of new 
customers. Group net finance charges 
increased from £6.4m to £7 . 1m. 
This was primarily due to a £0.4m 
decrease in the expected return on 
the group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme assets. The financial costs 
relating to group borrowings were 
broadly flat year on year and were 
covered 14 times by operating profit. 
Therefore profit before taxation and 
fair value adjustments to financial 
instruments was slightly down by 
0.5% to £95. 1m (2012, £95.6m). 
The movement in the fair value of 
the group’s forward foreign currency 
contracts contributed a gain of £1.3m 
(2012, £1.3m). The fair value of these 
forward contracts is based on external 
factors which are beyond the control 
of management. Profit before  
taxation was down 0.5% to £96.4m 
(2012, £96.9m).
Taxation
The effective rate of corporation 
tax for the year was 17 .6% (2012, 
16.4%) and was below the statutory 
rate, predominantly as a result of the 
favourable settlement of certain prior year 
initiatives. The tax charge for the year 
was £1 7 .0m (2012, £15.9m) which meant 
that profit after taxation and attributable 
to shareholders was down by 2.0% to 
£79.4m (£81.0m). The effective tax rate 
for the year ahead is expected to return 
towards the UK statutory rate.
Balance Sheet And Cashflow
The balance sheet continues to grow 
in strength. Net assets increased by 
10.9% to £446.0m at the year end 
(2012, £402.3m).
Capitalised expenditure for the year 
was £25.0m (2012, £24.9m) which 
included £5.0m on the Simply Be & 
Jacamo concept stores. The majority 
of the remaining expenditure relates 
to our continuous investment in our 
online systems.
The working capital requirements of the 
group grew broadly in line with revenue 
growth. Trade receivables at the year 
end had increased by 5.2% to £527 .8m 
(2012, £501.8m), and stock levels by 
4.7% to £86.5m (2012, £82.6m). 
The bad debt provision increased to 
£55.7m (2012, £49.3m) which equates 
to 9.5% (201 1, 8.9%) of gross debtors.
The deficit position of the group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme has 
increased to £3.3m compared to 
£1.0m at the prior year end. 
The movement predominately arises 
from a net actuarial loss of £4.0m 
together with service costs of £2.1m 
and net finance costs of £0.2m offset 
in part by contributions of £4.0m. 
Net cash generated from operating 
activities increased from £56.5m to 
£72.4m and after funding increased 
capital expenditure, finance costs and 
dividends, net debt reduced by £3.8m 
to £188.7m (2012 £192.5m). Gearing 
levels once again improved from 
48% last year to 42% at the year end.
Key Financial Performance

key performance indicators (KPIs) 
to monitor progress including:

Risk And Uncertainties
There are a number of risks and 
uncertainties which could have an 
impact on the group’s long-term 
performance. These include:
•	 co n s i der a t i o n 	 o f 	 t h e 	 gen er al	
economic climate and the impact 
it has on the provision of credit to 
our customers and their ability to 
maintain payment terms;
•	 t h e 	 p o t en t i al 	 t h r ea t 	 fr o m 	 o u r	
competitors;
•	 o u r 	 r el a t i o n sh i p 	 wi t h 	 k e y 	 s u p p l i ers ;
•	 t h e 	 l o ss 	 o f 	 k e y 	 pers o n n el ;
•	 p o t en t i al 	 d i sru p t i o n 	 t o 	 o u r 	 k e y	
information systems, warehousing or 
call centre facilities, which may arise 
from events beyond our control, 
and which could have a detrimental 
impact on sales and profit; and
•	 ch an ges 	 t o 	 t h e 	 r eg u l a t o r y	
environment in which the business 
operates, primarily with regard to the 
Financial Conduct Authority and the 
Office of Fair Trading. 15
The directors routinely monitor all 
these risks and uncertainties taking 
appropriate action to mitigate where 
necessary. Business continuity 
procedures are in place, together 
with a dedicated team assessing 
regulatory developments and ensuring 
that we treat our customers fairly. 
Regular reviews are carried out with 
all of our strategic partners. The board 
are also committed to the investment 
in systems and infrastructure to keep 
pace with new technology.
Treasury
There has been no change during 
the year to the group’s banking 
facilities which were renewed last year 
to support its ongoing trading and 
development activities. The group 
has committed borrowings of £370m 
of which £250m (2012, £250m) was 
utilised at the year end. The primary 
facilities are a £250m securitisation 
programme through an HSBC A-1/
P1 rated conduit that has a matching 
standby facility. This facility is in place 
until March 2016. Additionally, the 
group has two revolving credit loan 
facilities of £50m each with HSBC 
Bank plc and the Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc which also expire in 
March 2016. All current facilities in 
place at the year end are arranged at 
floating interest rates at margins which 
were negotiated at more favourable 
rates at the time of renewal. Where 
appropriate, exposure to interest 
rate fluctuations on indebtedness is 
managed by using derivatives such 
as interest rate swaps. There were no 
interest rate swaps used in the year.
Foreign exchange requirements for 
the purchase of stocks denominated 
in US dollars may be hedged for up to 
three years ahead to fix the costs of 
sterling. This hedging activity involves 
the use of spot, forward and option 
contracts. At the year end the group 
had outstanding forward foreign 
exchange contract commitments of 
$35m (2012, $69m).
Accounting Standards And 
Going Concern
Group accounting policies reflect 
current professional standards and 
related guidelines issued by the 
International Accounting Standards 
Board and are prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted for use in the 
European Union.
In determining whether the group’s 
accounts can be prepared on a going 
concern basis the directors consider 
the group's business activities together 
with factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance, and 
financial position. These include cash 
flows, liquidity position, borrowing 
facilities and the principal risks and 
uncertainties relating to its business 
activities. These are set out within 
this report and discussed further in 
the Chairman’s Statement and the 
Chief Executive’s Review.
The group has considered carefully 
its cash flows and banking covenants 
for the next twelve months from the 
date of signing of the group’s audited 
financial statements. These have been 
appraised in the light of uncertainty 
in the current economic climate. 
Conservative assumptions for working 
capital performance have been used 
to determine the level of financial 
resources available to the company 
and to assess liquidity risk. The key 
trading risk identified by the directors 
for these assumptions is the impact 
that a further deterioration in the 
economic climate might have on 
the performance of the group’s 
sales and debtor book.
The group’s forecast and 
projections, after sensitivity to take 
account of all reasonably foreseeable 
changes in trading performance, 
show that the group will have 
sufficient headroom within its current 
loan facilities of £370m which are 
committed until March 2016.
After making appropriate enquiries 
the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the company and the 
group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we 
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in the preparation of the annual 
report and accounts.
Shareholder Return
The share price of 238.8p at the 
start of the year has risen to 397 .0p 
at the year end giving a market 
capitalisation of £1,125.2m (2012, 
£676.8m). In addition the group’s five 
year performance measured by Total 
Shareholder Return compared with 
the FTSE Mid-250 index, of which the 
group is a member, show that we have 
outperformed the market in the last 
twelve months. A final dividend 
of 8.23p (2012, 7 .74p) per share has 
been recommended by the board 
giving a total dividend for the year 
of 13.68p (2012, 13.03p) per share 
up by 5.0% and covered 2.1 times 
(2012, 2.2 times).

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Directors’ Report
The directors present their annual report 
and accounts for the 52 weeks ended 
2 March 2013. 
Activities and results 
The principal activity of the group is 
multi-channel retailing. The activities are 
more fully explained and reviewed in 
the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 
10 to 13. Group profit before taxation 
from continuing operations for the 52 
weeks ended 2 March 2013 amounted to 
£96.4m (2012, £96.9m). No geographical 
segmentation is provided because, other 
than small operations in the Republic of 
Ireland, Germany and the United States, all 
activities take place in the United Kingdom. 
Business Review
The company is required by the 
Companies Act 2006 (‘Companies Act’) 
to set out in this report a fair review of the 
business of the group during the 52 weeks 
ended 2 March 2013 and the position 
of the group at the end of that period to 
enable shareholders to assess how the 
directors have performed the duty under 
Section 172 of the Companies Act (duty to 
promote the success of the company). 
The company is also required to set 
out a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the group. 
The information fulfilling these 
requirements can be found within 
this report, the Chairman’s Statement, 
the Chief Executive’s Review and the 
Financial Review (pages 8 to 15), all of 
which information is incorporated by 
cross-reference into this report and is 
deemed to form part of it.
The board continuously strives to identify 
and review key business risks and 
monitors a number of financial and non-
financial Key Performance Indicators. 
The financial KPIs are detailed on page 
14 and non-financial KPIs are discussed 
further below. The board oversees the 
development of processes to manage risks 
appropriately. The executive directors and 
operating board directors implement and 
oversee risk management processes and 
report to the board on them.
As required by the Code, pages 4 to 15 
provide an explanation of the basis on 
which the company generates value and 
preserves it over the long-term and its

hospitality has been adopted by the group. 
All senior managers and employees of the 
group are required to comply with both the 
letter and the spirit of the code in all their 
dealings for and on behalf of the group. 
In dealings with each other, shareholders, 
customers, suppliers, competitors, 
regulatory authorities and the wider 
community, all employees are required to: 
•	 conduct 	 deal ings 	 wit h 	 honest y , 	 int egrit y ,	
respect and fairness;

Directors of all group companies are 
required to disclose details of related party 
transactions for review and authorisation 
by the audit committee and by the board. 
A gifts and hospitality register requires all 
employees to record any gift or hospitality 
offered by suppliers and other parties. 
Monthly returns are required from all 
directors and employees declaring any 
offer with a value of £25 or more, and 
stating whether any offer was accepted 
or declined. 
A “whistleblowing policy” and confidential 
‘hotline’ provides employees with a secure 
and private means of reporting any ethical 
concerns that they may have regarding 
the way the group or any employee is 
behaving in day-to-day activities. 
No ‘whistleblowing’ events were 
reported in the year.
Environment 
Overview
Our sustainability strategy and 
environmental performance has become 
an integral element of our core business 
strategy. As a responsible multi-channel 
retailer, we have formally committed to 
reduction targets and continually strive to 
exceed expectations of our customers, 
staff and investors. Group-wide 
sustainability responsibility has been 
assigned to Ian Carr, director of logistics, 
who sits on the operational board of 
J D Williams & Company Limited and who 
reports to the Chief Executive Officer and, 
through him, to the board of directors.
Since 2007, the group has been actively 
working alongside its environmental 
partners, Envantage Limited and 
Viridor Limited, to boost environmental 
performance and increase group-
wide environmental awareness and 
accountability. Ongoing investment 
into energy, carbon, waste and water 
minimisation initiatives has led to a 
considerable reduction in our carbon 
emissions and water footprint profiles. 
for the directors in respect of liabilities 
incurred as a result of their office, to the 
extent permitted by law. Both the insurance 
and indemnities applied throughout the 
financial year ended 2 March 2013 and 
through to the date of this report.

Absolute energy and emissions 
evaluation
The tables below illustrate group wide 
electricity, natural gas and diesel 
consumptions and related GHG emissions 
from 07/08 to 12/13. Figures are expressed 
on an absolute basis.
Achievements
Annual measurement and reporting of full 
Green House Gasses (“GHG”) emission, 
water and waste footprint profiles are 
carried out. In this report we have focused 
on key emissions and water figures 
and achievements against our imposed 
reduction targets.
As referred to above, we have committed 
to an emissions reduction target which 
includes group wide electricity, natural gas 
and diesel associated GHG emissions. The 
reduction target is founded on a base year 
of performance during the financial year 
2007/08. Calculated GHG emissions are 
evaluated against annual turnover figures 
expressed in tCO2e / £. We have also 
committed to further waste and 
water reduction targets across some 
of the group which are evaluated on an 
absolute basis.
The table below illustrates achieved 
targets to date and on-going targets:
As a continually growing company, with an 
expanding property portfolio, an emissions 
increase of only 2% is lower than would 
have been achieved if the group had 
not taken any action. There was a slight 
increase in 2012/2013 on the previous year 
due to an increased property portfolio 
(Simply Be stores) and longer operating 
hours across our logistic sites.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Employees
The Chief Executive has board level 
responsibility for employment matters.
Employee involvement - Our success 
has been substantially contributed to by 
an engaged, enthusiastic, motivated and 
well-trained workforce. Considerable 
resources are devoted to employee 
training, with a large dedicated training 
team based in the contact centre with 
around 40 people providing customer 
service and systems training to ensure 
our customers receive the highest 
possible levels of service. This year we 
have launched a new certified bespoke 
leadership programme for all 50 Team 
Leaders. 
A management development team 
based at head office provides learning 
and development support for both the 
head office teams and all subsidiary and 
support divisions. The entire management 
team undergoes a bespoke 360° process 
every two years with the intention of 
ensuring every employee understands the 
impact they have on the teams around 
them. The Customer Services Division 
also runs an engagement survey every 
two years to check engagement level 
at a team level across the group. 
A consultative forum operates within the 
logistics division where employees from 
all levels contribute and share ideas that 
help shape the culture of the business. 
This year the Logistics and Customer 
Services divisions have also achieved 
Investors in People accreditation at Silver 
and Gold standard. Over 500 group 
employees either hold shares in the 
company or have options/awards to acquire 
them through the group’s various share 
option and long-term incentive schemes. 
A large proportion of the group’s training 
and development work is delivered by the 
HR learning and development team, which 
is supplemented by external training in 
specialist technical and IT training areas 
where necessary as well as individually 
tailored training, there is also a suite of 
self-training tools available and an online 
database, “simply development” which 
enables employees to access a wide 
range of self-development activities, 
tools and information.
The company has developed close 
relationships with local universities to retain 
talent within the northwest. We now offer 
graduate schemes in Buying, Quality & IT. 
In addition we offer placements within the 
Buying and Merchandising function. 
In 2012/2013, 13% of our recruitment 
was achieved through our Employee 
Referral Programme which is a 
programme whereby existing 
employees can recommend friends 
and relatives to fill vacancies.
An employee profit share scheme has 
been introduced to enable employees 
to participate in the company’s success. 
Bonus levels for the 2013/14 scheme 
provide an enhanced bonus entitlement 
for certain junior grades, providing 
greater benefit differentials for employees 
promoted to non-management grades. In 
addition the company’s grading structure 
has been enhanced by the introduction of 
two new grades to allow enhanced career 
progression and better alignment of pay 
and benefits.
Consultation - Constructive relationships 
with the trade unions that represent the 
group’s employees (principally USDAW 
and SATA) exist. Elements of the group 
are covered by a collective bargaining 
arrangement with USDAW. Union 
membership is encouraged and regular 
communication with the union is facilitated 
through ‘partnership forums’ established 
on the principle of shared commitment to 
business success, employment security 
and development with a particular 
emphasis on quality of life, openness and 
adding value.
Equal opportunities - The group supports 
the principle of equal opportunities in 
employment and is opposed to all forms 
of discrimination, including those on the 
grounds of colour, race, nationality, ethnic 
or national origin, religion, gender, age, 
sexual orientation, marital status 
or disability. 
Our selection processes for recruitment, 
promotion, training and development are 
non-discriminatory. We believe it is in 
the best interests of employees and the 
group to provide these opportunities to the 
most suitable candidates, and to achieve 
a balanced working population spread 
across a diverse range of ethnic origins, 
gender and age groups.
Applications for employment by 
disabled persons are thoroughly and 
sympathetically considered, with 
the aptitude of the applicant being 
regarded as foremost. In the event of 
any employee becoming disabled during 
their employment, every effort is made 
to ensure that their employment with 
the group continues and the group will 
endeavour to assist the employee by 
offering additional training, adapting the 
job if appropriate or by offering a transfer 
to another position. It is the policy of the 
group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, 
as far as possible, be identical to that of 
other employees. 
Health and safety - The health, safety 
and welfare at work of its employees, 
contractors and visitors is paramount as 
is ensuring compliance with all relevant 
legislation. The group is also committed 
to best practice initiatives. 
As we increase the number of our retail 
outlets, we have increased Health & Safety 
resources to ensure that all areas of the 
business meet the same exacting safety 
standards that we demand throughout.
Cumulative group accident statistics show 
that for the year in review, reportable 
accidents under Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences 
Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR) have reduced. 
The ratio of employee number to RIDDORs 
has fallen from 0.04% to 0.03% from the 
previous year in review.
In the year in review, the group ratio of 
accidents per employee remain static at 
0.6%. This reflects the work completed to 
ensure that our new retail sites maintain 
the tight safety standards expected within 
the group to retain this figure.
 
The group’s Health & Safety and 
Human Resources departments are 
complimented by the Occupational Health 
Department, whose focus is to look after 
the well-being of the group’s employees. 
The department provides advice, guidance 
and support on people’s fitness to work, 
on-site physiotherapy, chiropody and a 
counselling service. 
We endeavour to ensure that all products 
and services sold by the group or used 
in the workplace are safe and without 
risk to employees and customers when 
used properly. N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 23
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Customers 
A key factor of the group’s success is 
the strength of relationships with our 
customers and their levels of satisfaction 
with our group products and services. 
We aim to attract and retain customers 
through a highly competitive product and 
service offering, regularly monitoring retail 
and home-shopping sector developments 
to stay in touch with our marketplace. 
Insights into our customers’ needs and 
expectations are regularly updated 
through customer satisfaction surveys 
conducted both directly and through 
third parties. 
Our overall strategy is to adopt a 
"multi-channel" approach to managing 
customer contacts, with the key aim 
of a joined-up and consistent customer 
experience across channels. 
Our multi-channel service platforms 
cover web, telephone, mobile/tablet, 
post, and will extend to our relatively 
new UK store operations.
We continually develop our web sites for 
richer product content, ease of use, and 
improved performance. Optimisation for 
mobile/tablet devices is a priority due 
to the rapid growth of demand in this 
channel. Web self-service capabilities 
are delivered through a "my account" 
facility for customer order and account 
management information. Web-enabled 
contact centre capabilities are being 
deployed to support our web-trading 
customers, including multimedia, web 
chat, click-to-call and social media. 
The group operates both in-house 
and outsourced contact centres, 
predominantly located in the UK. Our 
international businesses are supported 
through local contact centres in the 
U.S.A., Germany and Eire. Enquiries 
and complaints have been pro-actively 
reduced over recent years as a proportion 
of customer order transactions, reflecting 
the introduction of more customer-
oriented policies, processes and product/
service standards. Telephone, email and 
letter contacts received from customers 
are analysed and remedial actions taken 
to improve our levels of service.
Our speed of answering calls and 
responding to emails has been improved 
and made more consistent. Automated 
speech services handle a significant 
proportion of customer telephone 
payments and parcel collection requests. 
We continue to invest in improved speed 
of product deliveries to our customers 
and to offer more delivery service options 
such as next-day or nominated day of 
delivery. E-mails inform customers about 
their order and account status.
Service developments are planned 
to further enhance our multi-channel 
customer experience with new 
capabilities to offer personalisation and 
choice. Individual customer needs and 
preferences will drive their relationship 
with us across brands, products, services, 
channels, offers, trading terms, and 
communications. 
Suppliers
Ethical trading policies and compliance
The group is aware of its impact on 
communities all over the world, wherever 
we manufacture the products that we 
sell. As part of this we have a strict 
Code of Conduct that we expect all our 
suppliers to adhere too. This Code of 
Conduct is based on the ETI (Ethical 
Trading Initiative) Base Code. This is a 
global Code of Conduct that is used 
as a standard by retailers across the 
world and especially within the UK. 
This is in turn based on the standards 
set out by the ILO (International Labour 
Organisation), which is the United Nations 
body that oversees international labour 
standards. This Code of Conduct is 
incorporated into our standard terms 
and conditions for dealing with suppliers. 
The Code of Conduct is available in 
6 languages (Chinese, Thai, Urdu, 
Vietnamese, Turkish and English) and we 
encourage all suppliers to display this 
Code of Conduct in their factories. Our 
Code of Conduct is also being rolled 
out across all transactional websites to 
inform customers of our policy, as well as 
being displayed in all stores. The Code of 
Conduct includes the following principles:
1. Employment is freely chosen
2. Freedom of association and the right 
to respect collective bargaining are 
respected
3. Working conditions are safe and 
hygienic
4. Child labour shall not be used
5. Living wages are paid
6. Working hours are not excessive
7. No discrimination is practiced
8. Regular employment is practiced
9. No harsh or inhumane treatment is 
allowed
As an integral part of ensuring that 
our suppliers comply with the Code of 
Conduct and implement processes and 
procedures to enable this, we regularly 
audit and risk assess our suppliers. 
This is done with a combination of 
external audits carried out by external 
parties and also some due diligence 
checks from our internal ethical trading 
team. The audits are always carried out 
to either the SMETA (SEDEX Members 
Ethical Trade Audit) or to SA8000 (Social 
Accountability International) standards. 
These standards are recognised across 
the world by most retailers and NGO’s 
(Non-Governmental Organisations). 
We have joined SEDEX this year to assist 
us in our ethical trading programme. 
This is a database that holds audits and 
risk assessments for factories. All our 
suppliers are encouraged to join the 
system as this enables them to share their 
information with any members across 
the world. This is a cost effective way 
of sharing audit information with other 
retailers, cuts down on audit duplication 
and helps to increase transparency across 
supply chains. We also upload our own 
audits into the system for factories to be 
able to share this information. In addition 
to this we have developed our own “swift 
audit” system. This is designed to be 
used after a risk assessment has been 
carried out and it is felt that a full audit 
is not necessary. Currently we have 866 
suppliers operating from approximately 
2,260 factories, of which 87% are 
currently compliant with our Code of 
Conduct. Suppliers are requested on at 
least a quarterly basis for accurate audit 
information and to check the progress 
on outstanding CAPS (Corrective Action 
Plans). This information is also discussed 
by the wider buying and merchandise team 
when they travel to visit the suppliers. We 
have also completed a trial of giving our 
suppliers an “ethical score” on our supplier 
scorecard. This helps to increase visibility 
of ethical trading within buying and 
merchandising and also encourages the 
long term relationship with the suppliers. 
This will be rolled out to the rest of the 
buying teams later this year. N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 24
The group is a member of the ETI. 
This is a ground breaking alliance of 
retailers and suppliers, trade unions and 
non-governmental organisations. Members 
include major companies, trade unions 
such as the TUC and non-governmental 
organisations such as Oxfam and Women 
Working Worldwide. The idea is that by 
working together we can influence change 
for the better in all our worldwide supply 
chains. Members also share policies and 
best practice which has enabled us to 
introduce our own policies on banning 
sandblasting within our denim supply chain 
and also joining the Kimberley Process 
on Conflict Diamonds. Members are open 
about shared supply chains and work 
together to influence collective change. 
Annually we compile a detailed report on 
our supply chain at factory level on 6 key 
management benchmarks:
1. Commitment to ethical trading
2. Integrating ethical trade into the 
company culture and practices
3. Capacity building for suppliers
4. Identifying problems in our supply chain
5. Projects and work undertaken
6. Public transparency
We are currently in the process of 
compiling the 2012/13 report. We 
submitted our first annual report for 
2010/2011. We had risk assessed 1,126 
sites and audited 249 sites. This figure 
has considerably improved for 2012/13 
with us having risk assessed 2,010 sites 
and audited 749 sites. We estimate that 
our risk assessments and audits have 
covered over 500,000 workers. The report 
is graded by an independent consultancy 
firm and also assessed by a non-
governmental organisation. Our results are 
then benchmarked against other retailer 
members and a final grade is given. 
We were very pleased in our first year of 
reporting to be graded from a Foundation 
level, which is the entry level membership 
to the Improver level, which is the 
second level of membership. This further 
demonstrates our commitment to ethical 
trading and our swift progress has been 
noted by the Ethical Trade Initiative. 
Further information on the 2012/13 will be 
released when available later in the year.
Following a recent factory fire in 
Bangladesh ETI members have agreed 
some concrete measures to improve fire 
and electrical safety within our supply 
chains. These include:
1. the setting up of a task force, of which 
we are members, to co-ordinate a 
joint approach to fire and electrical 
safety which will include agreeing joint 
standards which will apply to all factories 
by involving experts in the area;
2. immediate review of all our factories 
regarding all aspects of fire safety and 
electrical safety; and
3. lobbying the government of Bangladesh 
to improve the safety standards across 
the garment sector and also improve the 
policing of the relevant laws.
We have reviewed all our main agents’ 
factories in Bangladesh, which account 
for 66% of our production in the country, 
and have also developed an additional fire 
and electrical safety check which will be 
rolled out to the rest of our suppliers in 
the country.
We are continually working to improve 
working conditions in garment factories in 
Bangladesh. 
We have rolled out a Chain of Custody 
system in order to comply with EU Timber 
Regulations 2013. This will enable us to 
trace back to source all the timber used 
in our supply chain and suppliers have to 
keep auditable and reportable records to 
fit in with this system.
Our ethical trading manager has travelled 
to key markets this year both to audit 
current suppliers and to also gain a greater 
understanding of these markets. This 
has been achieved by working closely 
with UKTI (UK Trade and Investment), 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ILO 
(International Labour Organisation), IHRB 
(International Human Rights Board) and the 
ITUC (International Trade Union Congress). 
The group has also joined the All 
Parliamentary Group on International 
Corporate responsibility.
We have also launched an “intranet” 
site within the group to improve 
communication and visibility of ethical 
trading across the group.
Future work
Much of our future work will encompass 
the new UN Guidelines for Business and 
Human Rights, also known as the “Ruggie 
Principles”. These place responsibilities 
on all businesses to have policies and 
procedures in place which should include:
•	 pol ic y 	 commit ment 	 from 	 t he 	 most	
senior level to stipulate the human rights 
expectations of the group and also other 
related parties;
•	 human 	 rights 	 due 	 d i l igence 	 which	
should cover all aspects of the groups’ 
operations either directly or indirectly; 
and
•	 processes 	 t o 	 be 	 in 	 place 	 wit hin 	 t he	
business to ensure any remediation that 
is required can be acted upon.
The UK government is currently working 
on guidelines for businesses which we 
will adopt and report on in the future. 
We will also conduct relevant human rights 
assessments within our supply chains. 
We will continue to ensure that our suppliers 
and the group companies have a positive 
and open relationship regarding ethical 
trading and we will undertake more project 
work with suppliers as deemed appropriate.
As part of our continued commitment 
to ethical trading and corporate social 
responsibility ('CSR'), the board has 
decided to establish a CSR Committee.
This committee will report to the board on 
all matters relating to CSR, specifically:
• 	 loo ki ng 	 a f t e r 	 ou r 	 en v i r o nm en t ;
•	 et hical ly 	 sourcing 	 our 	 products ; 	 and
•	 w orking 	 wit h 	 t he 	 wider 	 communit y 
and our employees.
The committee will be chaired by Anna 
Ford and will comprise one other non-
executive director, the Finance Director, 
the Company Secretary and the group 
Ethical Trading Manager. The committee 
will set SMART (Specific Measurable 
Achievable Relevant Timed) targets in 
CSR areas, and will report on progress 
to these targets annually once established. 
The committee will have a specific budget 
and will pass recommendations to the 
board. It is anticipated that the CSR 
committee will be established in the 
second half of 2013. Further information 
can be obtained from 
ethical.trading@nbrown.co.uk. 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 25
Paying our suppliers
The group’s policy for the payment 
of suppliers is to ensure that terms of 
payment are negotiated with suppliers 
when agreeing the terms of each 
transaction and to ensure that all suppliers 
are made aware of and accept agreed 
payment terms. The group continually 
reviews payment procedures and liaises 
with suppliers to eliminate difficulties and 
to maintain good working relationships. 
Agreed payment terms are then abided 
by and payment is made in accordance 
with those terms. Trade creditors of the 
group at 2 March 2013 represented 
38 days (2012, 40 days) of purchases. 
Trade payables days is calculated by 
dividing the trade payables by the 
aggregate of trade purchases and non 
inventory expenditure multiplied by 365.
Community relations
The group takes great pride in its links with 
local communities and actively supports 
the communities in which it operates.
It maintains close links with the Christie 
Hospital in Manchester and the Retail Trust 
and also regularly encourages employees 
to participate in fundraising activities 
for these, and other worthwhile causes. 
The group matches the money raised 
by employees to double the size of the 
donation. The logistics division provide 
Christmas presents and Easter Eggs for 
children’s wards at local hospitals, sponsor 
the local bonfire and firework display and 
Christmas lights, make donations to local 
schools and work closely with charities 
close to home to help raise much needed 
funds for good causes. £134,000 was 
raised for good causes in this way in the 
year in review.
The family, health and well-being 
programme, now in its ninth year, 
continues to provide support and real 
assistance for all of our employees.
Charitable and political donations 
During the year, the group made charitable 
donations of £40,070 (2012, £71,011). 
No political donations have been made 
(2012, nil). No contributions have been 
made to non-EU political parties (2012, nil).
Pension fund
The company has a defined benefit 
scheme The N Brown Group Pension 
Fund (“Pension Fund”). Its assets are 
administered by a trustee company 
(the “Trustee”) which is controlled by a 
board of directors and which includes 
an independent trustee and others who 
represent the interests of pension fund 
members (including pensioners) and the 
company.
The Trustee has appointed Mercer Limited 
to provide various services including 
actuarial advice, investment advice, 
administration services and fiduciary 
management services.
The Pension Fund is required to undertake 
an actuarial valuation every 3 years and 
the Trustee has instructed the actuary 
to undertake the valuation due as at 
30 June 2012.
The company (and some of its associated 
companies) are required to indemnify the 
Trustee company and its officers in respect 
of certain liabilities incurred by them in the 
performance of their obligations relating 
to the Pension Fund or in administration 
of the Pension Fund. This amounts to a 
“qualifying indemnity provision” (as defined 
in section 236 of the Companies Act).
The Pension Fund was closed to new 
entrants with effect from 31 January 2002. 
New employees joining the group after 
31 January 2002 and existing employees 
who had not joined the Pension Fund 
as at that date, are entitled to join a 
stakeholder pension scheme providing 
a defined contribution pension 
arrangement, administered by Prudential 
Stakeholder Pensions.
The company is currently working towards 
the introduction of pension auto-enrolment 
to ensure full compliance across the group. 
‘The People Pension’ has been selected 
as the auto-enrolment provider for weekly 
paid employees, whilst Prudential will 
auto-enrol monthly paid employees and 
continue to run the Stakeholder Pension 
for weekly employees already in the 
scheme. The company has chosen to 
defer its staging date from 1 July 2013 to 7 
September 2013 for weekly employees and 
1 October 2013 for monthly employees.
Financial risk management, objectives 
and policies 
The group is exposed to certain 
financial risks, namely interest rate risk, 
currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk 
Information regarding such financial risks is 
detailed in note 19 on page 61. The group’s 
risk management policies and procedures 
are also discussed in the Financial Review 
on page 15. 
Change of control
There are a number of agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the company such 
as commercial contracts, bank loan 
agreements, property lease arrangements 
and employee share plans. None of these 
are considered to be significant in terms 
of their likely impact on the business of 
the group as a whole. Executive Directors’ 
service contracts are terminable by the 
company on giving 12 months’ notice. 
There are no agreements between the 
company and its directors or employees 
that provide for additional compensation 
for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid. 
No events were reported in the year.
Essential contracts
The group has a number of contractual 
arrangements with suppliers (both of 
goods and services) and occupies 
leasehold premises for the purpose of 
conducting its business. Whilst these 
arrangements are important to the 
business of the group, individually none of 
them are essential to the business of the 
group and do not require disclosure under 
section 417(5)(c) of the Companies Act.
Tax status 
The company is not a close company 
within the meaning of the Corporation
Tax Act 2010.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 26
Auditor 
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as 
auditor to the company and to authorise 
the directors to fix remuneration will be 
proposed at the annual general meeting 
on 2 July 2013.
Voting rights and restrictions on 
transfer of shares
None of the ordinary shares carry any 
special rights with regard to control of 
the company.
There are no restrictions on transfers of 
shares other than:
•	 cer tain 	 rest rict ions 	 which 	 ma y 	 from	
time to time be imposed by laws or 
regulations such as those relating to 
insider dealing;
•	 pur suant 	 t o 	 t he 	 compan y ' s 	 code 	 f or

company’s shares has been served with 
a disclosure notice and has failed to 
provide the company with information 
concerning interests in those shares.
The directors are not aware of any 
arrangements between shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or voting rights. The rights and 
obligations attaching to the company's 
ordinary shares are set out in the Articles 
of Association.
Employee share schemes – 
rights of control
The trustees of the N Brown Group plc 
Employee Share Ownership Trust hold 
shares on trust for the benefit of the 
executive directors and employees of the 
group, which are used in connection with 
the company's various share incentive 
plans. The trustees currently abstain from 
voting but have the power to vote for or 
against, or not at all, at their discretion 
in respect of any shares in the company 
held in the relevant trust. The trustees 
may, upon the recommendation of the 
company, accept or reject any offer 
relating to the shares in any way it sees fit, 
without incurring any liability and without 
being required to give reasons for their 
decision. In exercising their trustee powers 
the trustees may take all of the following 
matters into account:
• 	 t he 	 lo ng- t e r m 	 i n t e r e st s 	 o f 	 benefi c iarie s ;

Companies Act.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the group 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Standards 
and applicable law. Under company 
law, the directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the company and of the profit or 
loss of the company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• 	 sele ct 	 s u i tab le 	 accou n t i ng 	 pol i c ie s 	 an d	
then apply them consistently;
•	 mak e 	 j udgments 	 and 	 account ing	
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•	 stat e 	 whet her 	 appl icable 	 I FRS ’ s 	 as	
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
•	 prepare 	 t he 	 financial 	 stat ements 	 on	
the going concern basis, unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Each person who is a director at the date 
of the approval of this report confirms that:
•	 so 	 far 	 as 	 t he 	 d irect or 	 is 	 a w are , 	 t here 	 is	
no relevant audit information of which 
the group’s auditors are unaware; and
•	 t he 	 d irect or 	 has 	 tak en 	 al l 	 st eps 	 t hat 	 he	
ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the group’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE REPORT 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Andrew Higginson (Chairman of the Board)
Dear Shareholder,
The board is committed to meeting a high 
standard of corporate governance and 
compliance with the principles in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code issued by 
the UK Financial Reporting Council in 2010 
(the “Code”). 
Statement of compliance with the Code
For the year under review the board 
considers that it and the company have 
complied with the provisions of the 
Code except for provision B6.1 and B6.2 
as the board has decided that an informal 
review of board effectiveness 
was appropriate. All other provisions of 
the Code have been complied with. 
The following paragraphs explain how 
the main principles of the Code have 
been applied. The Remuneration Report 
contains further details on pages 33 to 42.
In September 2012, the Financial Reporting 
Council published a new edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, effective 
from the company’s next financial year (the 
‘New Code’). The changes largely relate to 
Accountability, Part C of the Code, which 
covers areas such as financial and business 
reporting, audit committees and auditors. 
The intention of the board is that the 
company will fully comply with the changes 
introduced in the New Code in 2013.
Board composition 
A new non-executive chairman, Andrew 
Higginson, was appointed a director on 
3 July 2012 taking over as chairman from 
Lord Alliance of Manchester, who remains 
a non-executive director, on 1 September 
2012. Lord Alliance of Manchester was not 
involved in the selection process for the 
appointment of Andrew Higginson as his 
successor as Chairman.
During the year there were a number of 
other significant appointments to the board 
of directors. As they had both served for 
terms beyond which the Code regarded their 
independence to be impaired, Lord Stone 
of Blackheath and Nigel Alliance stepped 
down from the board on 2 January 2013. In 
March 2013 three new non-executive directors 
were appointed to the board effective 1 April 
2013. Ron McMillan joined the company as 
Senior independent non-executive director 
in place of Ivan Fallon who will relinquish the 
role of Senior independent non-executive 
director later in 2013 but will remain on the 
board. Ron McMillan will become chair of the 
audit committee in October 2013 when John 
McGuire will relinquish his role but also remain 
on the board.
Simon Patterson will assume the chair 
of the nomination committee with 
immediate effect, taking over from 
Lord Stone of Blackheath and finally, 
Fiona Laird will become chairman of the 
remuneration committee on 1 October 
2013 when Ivan Fallon relinquishes that role 
(but remains on the board as a director).
Alan White, Chief Executive Officer, indicated 
at last year’s annual general meeting his 
intention to retire from the company. After 
a search for suitable candidates, Angela 
Spindler was selected to become CEO and 
will join the company on 1 July 2013 and will 
be appointed a director after the 2013 annual 
general meeting.
The board now comprises of ten members, 
eight of whom are non-executive. There is 
a clear division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman, Andrew Higginson, who is 
responsible for the effective operation of 
the board and the Chief Executive, Alan 
White, who is responsible for the group’s 
operational performance. 
The board is sensitive to the need for 
non-executive directors to remain 
independent of the management in order 
to be able to exercise proper oversight 
and effectively challenge the executive 
directors. The non-executive directors 
who served during the financial year 
ended 2 March 2013 were: 
•	 A ndre w 	 Higginson 	 ( Chair man ) ;
•	 Lord 	 A lliance 	 o f 	 Manche st e r 	 CBE ;
•	 I v an 	F al lon 	( deput y 	ch ai rman 	and 	sen ior	
independent non-executive director);
•	 John 	 McGuire 	 ( chair 	 o f 	 audit 	 commit t e e ) ;	
and 
•	 A nna 	 F ord.
• 	 L o rd 	 S t o ne 	 o f 	 B lack he at h 	 ( r e s ig ne d 	 2	
January 2013)
•	 N i g e l 	 A l l i a n c e 	 O B E 	 ( r e s i g n e d 	 2 	 J a n u a ry 	 2 0 1 3 )
Of these Ivan Fallon and Lord Alliance of 
Manchester CBE are no longer regarded 
by the board as independent owing to 
their length of service on the board and, in 
the case of Lord Alliance, his position as 
a major shareholder. All of the other non-
executives are considered by the board to 
be independent. 
In order to address any issues of 
independence and to bring board 
composition in line with Code 
requirements, the three new non-executive 
director appointments reported above 
were made.
Ivan Fallon and John McGuire will 
remain as members of the board for the 
foreseeable future as the board considers 
that both still have much to offer in terms 
of their knowledge and experience which 
will be of immense value to the new non-
executive directors. 
In view of the foregoing, the board 
considers that it now has a majority of 
independent non-executive directors and 
that the composition of the board has 
the necessary balance of executive and 
non-executive directors to provide the 
requisite skills, experience and judgement 
appropriate for the requirements of the 
business and full board effectiveness. 
Pursuant to recent amendments to the 
Code, the company now requires all 
directors retire and submit themselves for 
re-election annually and, again this year, 
each of the directors will again retire at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
All directors, including those appointed 
since the last annual general meeting, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for 
reappointment at that meeting. 
With the exception of Ivan Fallon and 
John McGuire who are on a three month 
rolling arrangement, all non-executive 
directors serve on letters of appointments 
stipulating three year terms. All non-
executive appointments are terminable, 
without compensation, on between 
three and six months’ notice by either 
party and are subject to other early 
termination provisions, for example without 
compensation in the event a director is not 
re-elected upon retirement by rotation in 
accordance with the articles of association, 
or at the annual general meeting.
The board, having carried out a 
performance evaluation, considers that 
the performance of all directors and 
their commitment to the role of director 
continues to be effective. 
Biographical detail of each director 
is provided on page 16 of this annual 
report to enable shareholders to make 
an informed decision on the re-election 
resolutions. All appointments to the board 
are made on merit against objective criteria 
and with the intention of ensuring that 
all appointees have the requisite skills 
and sufficient time to devote themselves 
effectively to the business of the board 
and to discharge their duties.  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 29
CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE REPORT 
Details of directors’ contract terms are 
shown in the Remuneration Report on 
page 37. In accordance with the Code, 
the company has made the terms and 
conditions of appointment of the non-
executive directors available for inspection.
Diversity
The board recognises the importance of 
diversity, including gender, at all levels 
of the company as well as on the board. 
The company is committed to equal 
opportunities and increasing diversity 
across our operations. Since the last 
report two further female members have 
been appointed to the board. Fiona Laird 
joined the board on 1 April 2013 as a non-
executive director and Angela Spindler 
was appointed to succeed Alan White 
as the company’s new Chief Executive 
Officer with effect from 1 July 2013. Once 
Angela takes up her post the board will 
have female members equating to 30% 
of its directors. The board considers 
that significant progress has already 
been made towards meeting the goals 
of its diversity policy but will continue to 
consider how diversity can be enhanced 
through the board and the senior 
management teams and across the group 
generally, whilst ensuring that it appoints 
only the most appropriate candidates to 
the board. 
Board operation and evaluation
An effective board of directors leads and 
controls the group. The members of the 
board are shown on page 16 of this report. 
The board met eight times during the year. 
Directors' attendance at board meetings 
was as follows:

The board is responsible for all major 
policy decisions and for determining the 
operational and strategic risks it is willing to 
take in achieving its objectives. The board 
has delegated operational matters to those 
of its committees and sub-committees, 
the executive and operational directors 
and senior officers, where necessary. 
The board is collectively responsible 
for providing effective leadership and 
promoting the success of the group and 
works to a formal list of matters reserved 
for the board (a copy of which is available 
on the company’s website, www.nbrown.
co.uk). Matters reserved to the board 
include, amongst other things, decisions 
on business strategy, the approval of 
financial statements, the annual capital and 
operating expenditure plans, investment, 
treasury and dividend policies, governance 
issues, major capital projects, overseeing 
the group’s risk control procedures, board 
membership and the composition of its 
committees and the group’s ethical, social 
and environmental policies. 
In January of each year the members of 
the board meet with the operational board 
members over a two day period to review 
the progress being made against, and the 
future development of, the group’s long-
term rolling strategic plan. 
Day-to-day management of the group 
is delegated to the operational board of 
JD Williams & Company Limited, known 
as the Home Shopping board, on which 
both Alan White and Dean Moore sit 
as chief executive and finance director 
respectively.
The board governs through clearly 
mandated committees, accompanied by 
robust monitoring and reporting systems. 
Further detail is given below. 
Board papers include detailed 
management reports from the Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director, 
management accounts, broker analyses, 
compliance and regulatory briefings and 
bespoke reports. A comprehensive pack 
of papers is circulated to each director not 
less than seven days prior to each board 
meeting. Non-executive directors are 
encouraged to meet and talk to operational 
teams and the Home Shopping board and 
undertake regular site visits to ensure that 
they have the most up-to-date knowledge 
and understanding of the company and 
its activities and also so that the broader 
population of the group can derive benefit 
from the skills and experience of the non-
executive directors. 
All board members are permitted to obtain 
independent professional advice in respect 
of their fiduciary duties and obligations 
and have full and direct access to the 
Company Secretary, who is a qualified 
solicitor and who sits on all board and 
committee meetings as secretary. 
The Company Secretary regularly 
briefs the board on legal, regulatory 
and compliance matters, shareholder 
engagement issues and the statutory 
duties and obligations of the directors. 
In the last year (as in previous years) 
the board has undertaken an informal 
appraisal of its own performance and 
effectiveness and also that of the 
Chairman and the board’s committees. 
The engagement of an external body 
to manage the performance evaluation 
process was considered but the board 
concluded that, in view of the changes to 
the board composition and the advent of 
a new chief executive officer it was not 
appropriate to employ the services of an 
externally facilitated evaluator but that the 
approach adopted in the previous year 
remained sufficiently robust, appropriate 
and cost effective for the company. 
The evaluation process consisted of the 
individual completion of a questionnaire 
containing 26 detailed questions ranging 
from the effectiveness of individual 
members, the size and number of board 
reports, relationships with management, 
the mix of skill-sets, individual contribution 
at board meetings to the effectiveness of 
the Company Secretary. The questionnaire 
was completed by all directors in relation 
to the board and also any committee of 
which they were a member. The process 
is designed to establish whether each 
director continues to meet the board’s 
requirements in terms of effective 
contribution, skills and devotion to the role. 
The evaluation results were collated by 
the Company Secretary for review by the 
Chairman and then a joint review by the 
board. The performance of the Chairman 
was reviewed and appraised by the senior 
non-executive director in consultation 
with the other board members. The Chief 
Executive’s performance was reviewed 
and appraised by the Chairman and the 
non-executive directors. The performance 
of the Finance Director (the only other 
executive director on the board) was 
carried out in a similar manner to the 
Chief Executive. 
The evaluation concluded that the board 
and committees continue to perform 
well and are effective and that robust, 
free and frank discussion and challenge  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 30
CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE REPORT 
to the operational directors and the 
executive directors exists at all levels. 
The survey also found that the board and 
committees continue to be effectively 
led by their respective Chairmen and 
that information provided to the directors 
was comprehensive and sufficient 
for the director’s needs. It was also 
concluded that each director is individually 
contributing to the overall effectiveness 
and success of the group. No material 
issues were raised.
Beyond the formal annual evaluation, 
the performance of the executive directors 
is continuously monitored throughout the 
year by the Chairman and the Deputy 
Chairman. 
The board acknowledges the provisions 
of section B.6.2 of the Code require that 
an externally facilitated evaluation be 
carried out at least once in every 3 years 
and an external evaluation of board 
effectiveness will be carried out for the 
financial year 2013/14.
The Chairman reviews and agrees 
with each director their training and 
development needs.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The articles of association of the company 
give the directors the power to consider 
and, if appropriate, authorise conflict 
situations where a director’s declared 
interest may conflict or does conflict with 
the interests of the company.
Procedures have been set in place by the 
board to regularly report and record any 
potential or actual conflicts which arise in 
a register which is then reviewed by the 
board at least annually.
No conflicts of interest were reported in 
the year under review.
Committees of the Board
The board has delegated specific 
authority to a number of committees 
to deal with specific aspects of 
management and to maintain supervision 
over the internal control procedures 
of the group. These committees meet 
regularly and have formal written terms 
of reference which are available for 
inspection on the company’s website. 
The minutes of the meetings of these 
committees are circulated to all 
committee members in advance of the 
next following committee meeting, at 
which they are ratified. The following 
committees of the board have been 
established: 
• 	 aud it 	 commit t ee ;
• 	 r em u ne rat io n 	 co m m i t t e e ;
• 	 n om i n a t i on 	 com m i t t e e ; 	 and
• 	 f i n an ce 	 co m m i t t e e	
After each committee meeting the 
chairman of that committee makes a 
formal report to the board of directors 
detailing the business carried out 
by the committee and setting out its 
recommendations.
Audit committee 
The audit committee currently consists of 
the chairman John McGuire, Ivan Fallon 
and Anna Ford. Lord Stone of Blackheath 
served on the committee up to and 
including the date he retired from the 
board on 2 January 2013. Ron McMillan 
joined the audit committee on 1 April 
2013 and will succeed John McGuire as 
chairman with effect from October 2013. 
Fiona Laird and Simon Patterson also 
joined the committee with effect from 1 
April 2013.
The chairman of the committee and a 
sufficient number of other members of 
the committee are regarded as having 
recent and relevant financial experience. 
By invitation, the audit committee meetings 
are also attended by the Chief Executive, 
the Finance Director, the group’s head 
of internal audit and the group’s external 
auditors. 
The committee met twice in the year under 
review. Committee attendance was as 
follows:

Fiona Laird, Ron McMillan and Simon 
Patterson joined the audit committee with 
effect from 1 April 2013.
The audit committee is charged with 
overseeing the nature and scope of the 
group’s audit process (both internal and 
external) and their effectiveness. The 
committee’s work in the year includes:
•	 re vie wing 	 and 	 appro ving 	 t he 	 annual	
internal audit programme and resources;
•	 meet ing 	 wit h 	 t he 	 int ernal 	 and 	 e x t ernal	
auditors both with and in the absence of 
the executive directors;
•	 receiving 	 and 	 re vie wing 	 t he 	 annual	
and interim financial statements and 
reviewing the audit reports and audit-
related reports provided by the external 
auditor;
•	 re vie wing 	 and 	 assessing 	 t he 	 group ’ s	
system of internal risk control and 
sources of assurance;
•	 receiving 	 repor ts 	 from 	 t he 	 compan y	
secretary on environmental, social or 
governance issues; and 
• 	 maki ng 	 r e co m m en dat io ns 	 t o 	 t he 	 boar d	
in respect of its findings in respect of all 
of the above matters.
In addition to the above scheduled 
meetings, the chairman of the committee 
also regularly attends the group’s head 
office to meet with the Finance Director 
and, separately, the group’s head of 
internal audit. 
The audit committee also oversees the 
management of the group’s whistleblowing 
procedure which contains procedures for 
the committee to receive, in confidence, 
complaints on all operational matters. 
The committee has established a 
continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks the group faces. This monitoring is 
principally based on reviewing reports 
from senior management to consider 
whether significant operational risks are 
being identified, evaluated, managed and 
controlled and whether any significant 
weaknesses exist which need to be 
addressed. Again this year, the committee 
members have received, considered and 
approved an updated risk evaluation from 
the operational directors. Further details 
are given later in the Risk Management 
section of this report. 
The board considers that the processes 
of the audit committee continue to be 
reasonably robust and effective and in 
compliance with the guidance issued by 
the Smith Committee. During the year 
under review the board has not been 
advised by the audit committee of, nor 
identified itself, any failings or weaknesses 
in internal control which it has determined 
to be material. 
The audit committee periodically reviews 
the appointment of the external auditors 
as well as their relationship with the group, 
including monitoring the group’s use of 
the auditors for non-audit services and the 
balance of audit and non-audit fees paid 
to the auditors. Non-audit services are  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 31
CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE REPORT 
generally subject to tender and decisions 
on the allocation of work are made on the 
basis of competence, cost effectiveness, 
relevant legislation and knowledge of the 
group’s business. Deloitte LLP has been 
the group’s auditor for a number of years. 
Having reviewed the independence and 
effectiveness of the external auditor, the 
committee has not considered it necessary 
to require them to tender for the audit work. 
Deloitte LLP has during the year also 
provided some non-audit services to the 
company in the form of corporate tax, VAT 
and regulatory compliance advice. The 
audit committee is aware that providing 
audit and non-audit services could give 
rise to a potential conflict of interest. To 
address this concern, the company has 
also appointed independent advisers to 
provide advice on taxation, executive 
remuneration, regulatory and pension 
matters where appropriate. These advisers 
do not provide the group with any other 
services which could bring into question 
their independence or provide any conflict 
of interest (further details of other advisers 
are set out in the Remuneration Report on 
page 33). 
During the year fees paid to Deloitte LLP 
for audit and non-audit services were as 
follows:-
Audit: £0.3m 
Non-audit/tax: £0.9m
The audit committee has considered 
the level of fees paid to Deloitte LLP to 
enable it to consider and report to the 
board any concerns it may have that 
the auditor’s independence is being 
compromised. The majority of non-audit 
work was tax advisory services and it was 
considered that Deloitte LLP was best 
placed to provide such advice in view of its 
knowledge of the group’s financial affairs.
The audit committee has concluded that 
the committee has acted in accordance 
with its terms of reference and has 
addressed and reasonably ensured the 
independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors.
Ron McMillan will assume chair of the 
audit committee on 1 October 2013.
There are no contractual obligations 
restricting the group’s choice of external 
auditor. The committee has recommended 
that the existing auditors, Deloitte LLP be 
reappointed. Deloitte LLP have signified 
their willingness to continue in office and 
ordinary resolutions appointing them as 
auditors and authorising the directors to 
set their remuneration will be proposed at 
the 2013 annual general meeting.
Remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee consists 
entirely of non-executive directors. 
The current chairman is Ivan Fallon. 
The other members are John McGuire 
and Anna Ford. By invitation the chairman 
Andrew Higginson and the Chief Executive 
Officer Alan White also attended committee 
meetings during the year. Lord Stone of 
Blackheath served on the committee up to 
and including the date of his retirement on 
2 January 2013. Fiona Laird has joined the 
remuneration committee with effect from 
1 April 2013 and will succeed Ivan Fallon 
as the chairperson in October 2013. Ron 
McMillan and Simon Paterson also joined 
the committee with effect from 1 April 2013.
The remuneration committee met on three 
occasions during the year. Member’s 
attendance was as follows:

The remuneration committee reviews, 
formulates and determines the reward and 
remuneration package of each executive 
director and other senior members of the 
company including the Home Shopping 
board. It also considers how the company 
is applying the principles of the Code in 
respect of directors’ remuneration. 
The Remuneration Report is included in 
this Annual Report on pages 33 to 42. 
The report will be put to an advisory vote 
by the members at the company’s 2013 
annual general meeting. 
Nomination committee 
The nomination committee was chaired 
by Lord Stone of Blackheath throughout 
the year up to the date of his resignation 
in January 2013. Simon Patterson joined 
the committee and took on the role of 
chairman on 1 April 2013. The other 
members are currently Lord Alliance 
of Manchester CBE, Ivan Fallon, John 
McGuire, Anna Ford, Ron McMillan 
and Fiona Laird. The formal terms of 
reference for this committee require it to 
make recommendations to the board for 
appointments of directors including, when 
appropriate, the Chairman of the board 
and also directors of the operating board 
and other senior executive staff of the 
operating company. Where appropriate, 
the Chief Executive and Company 
Secretary attend meetings of 
the nomination committee. 
The committee had a busy year in 
searching for, identifying and appointing 
replacements for the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer and the appointment of 
three new non-executive directors. In this 
task the committee was assisted in its 
executive search role by MWM Consulting 
LLP. MWM Consulting LLP has no other 
connection with the company. 
Andrew Higginson was announced as the 
new Chairman at the last AGM at which 
time it was also announced that Alan White 
would be retiring in the latter half of 2013. 
Angela Spindler was chosen to replace 
Alan White as the new chief executive 
officer and Fiona Laird, Simon Patterson 
and Ron McMillan were all appointed to 
bring more independent oversight to the 
board.
The nomination committee evaluates board 
candidates on merit, against objective 
criteria, taking into account the skills and 
experience required to perform the duties 
of the post with due regard to diversity 
and gender. Where appropriate, external 
search consultants are engaged. 
The nomination committee was active in 
considering the Davies Report into Women 
on Boards and its response to the issues 
it raised. The appointments mentioned 
above bring the female quotient on the 
board to 30%. 
The Company Secretary is responsible 
for the induction of new directors. New 
directors are provided with a comprehensive 
pack of information (including terms 
of reference, information regarding the 
business and guidance on their roles and 
duties as directors) and meetings/site visits 
with key employee contacts are arranged 
as appropriate. The Company Secretary 
provides an on-going programme of 
briefings for directors covering legal and 
regulatory changes and developments 
relevant to the group’s activities and 
director’s areas of responsibility. 
During the year the nomination committee 
met on four occasions with full attendance 
by the current members.  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 32

Finance committee
So that actions may be taken promptly 
a finance committee comprising the 
chairman of the audit committee, the 
Chief Executive and the Finance Director 
(together with such other non-executive 
directors as the board may appoint from 
time to time) operates between scheduled 
board meetings and is authorised to make 
decisions, within limits defined by the 
board, regarding certain finance, treasury 
and tax or investment matters.
Corporate social responsibility 
committee 
As reported in the Directors' report it is 
intended to establish a corporate social 
responsibility committee in 2013.
Internal control 
The directors have overall responsibility 
for ensuring that the group maintains a 
sound system of internal control. 
There are inherent limitations in any 
system of internal control and no 
system can provide absolute assurance 
and management against material 
misstatement, loss or failure. Equally, 
no system can guarantee elimination of 
the risk of failure to meet the objectives 
of the business. Against this background, 
the board has established a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks the group 
faces in order to give it reasonable 
assurances regarding its operations and 
compliance with laws and regulations.
Risk management 
In order to ensure key business 
developments and emerging risks are 
appropriately factored into the group’s 
risk management process, internal audit 
facilitated two board-level risk sessions 
in the year. The Chief Executive Officer 
of the group and the Finance Director 
along with operational directors identified, 
ranked and reviewed the key risks facing 
the business and appraised the structure 
of internal controls and identified current 
and proposed activities to mitigate these 
risks. The audit committee was provided 
with the output from this process and 
given the opportunity to conduct its own 
assessment of risks across strategic, 
financial and operational areas. The results 
have been collated by internal audit and 
used as a key driver in the annual internal 
audit plan. 
An enterprise wide mapping of activities 
across business functions was also 
undertaken by internal audit during the 
year to assess the level of risk within each 
activity. Output from this process has also 
been reflected in the annual audit plan.
A risk committee has been established as 
a sub-committee of the audit committee 
on which the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Finance Director (chair of risk committee), 
the Company Secretary and head of 
internal audit sit, to focus on reviewing 
management's activities and to continually 
monitor and manage the risks identified. 
Operational management is asked to 
present to the risk committee on a 
cyclical basis on the progress of agreed 
actions against the major risks identified 
by the process. The output from the 
risk committee is then shared with the 
audit committee and the board. The risk 
committee met on two occasions during 
the year and received presentations from 
operational management covering group 
security, information security including 
PCI compliance, risk management and PPI 
regulatory compliance. 
The board of directors (through and 
with the benefit of the reports and 
recommendations of the audit committee) 
has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control for the year 
under review. The board (through the audit 
committee) discusses with the external 
auditors and the internal audit department, 
the results of audit work and any resulting 
internal control issues, including the 
implementation of action points arising 
from previous audits. 
The internal audit function is independent 
of management and the head of the 
function has direct access to the chairman 
of the audit committee and the chief 
executive of the group. Internal audit 
plans are discussed and agreed annually 
between the group head of internal audit 
and the audit committee. 
Appropriate internal financial controls 
are in place throughout the group, some 
of which have already been referred 
to in this statement. Other examples 
include the existence of a well-defined 
group organisation structure, with 
clear lines of responsibility and explicit 
authority delegated to divisional boards 
and executive management, and a 
comprehensive financial reporting system 
which communicates plans, budgets 
and monthly results to relevant levels of 
management, including the board. 
The company has complied, and continues 
to comply, with the provisions of the Code 
on internal controls. There is an on-going 
process in place for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks 
facing the group that has been in place 
throughout the year under review and to 
the date of approval of the accounts. 
This process has been reviewed by the 
audit committee and the board, and 
accords with guidance appended to 
the Code. The board has not identified 
nor been advised of any failings or 
weaknesses which it has determined to 
be material.
Relations with investors 
The company places considerable 
importance on good communication with 
all shareholders, be they institutional or 
individual investors. Institutional investors, 
fund managers and analysts are kept 
informed of the company’s overall strategy 
through regular meetings and investor 
‘road-shows’ and site visits. All non-
executive directors are kept informed 
of shareholders’ views through detailed 
feedback on surveys and polls and 
analyst and broker reports are tabled 
at each board meeting. The senior non-
executive director is available to meet 
with, and understand, the views of major 
shareholders. 
The company aims to ensure that all 
shareholders have full and timely access 
to the information it discloses in the 
annual report, the yearly and half yearly 
announcements and interim management 
statements and that shareholders 
have the opportunity to meet with the 
executive management team (and certain 
members of the operating division) 
at the announcement of the group’s 
results and also at the annual general 
meeting. Non-executive and executive 
directors also attend meetings with 
shareholders on request. As well as 
being provided with a copy of the annual 
report and results announcements, the 
group recently overhauled its website to 
provide shareholders with up to date and 
comprehensive material about the group 
and its activities and also real-time market 
information and prices. Shareholders also 
have the opportunity to ask questions, 
make observations or represent their views 
to the board of directors by constructive 
use of the annual general meeting. N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 33
REMUNERATION REPORT
Introduction 
This report has been prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 to 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008. This report also meets 
the relevant requirements of the listing 
rules of the UK Listing Authority and 
describes how the board has applied the 
principles relating to directors’ 
remuneration set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2010 (“the Code”).
This report will be put to an advisory vote 
of the company’s shareholders at the 
annual general meeting on Tuesday 2 July 
2013. The auditors are required to report 
on certain parts of this report and to state 
whether, in their opinion, that part of the 
report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
The report is therefore divided into 
separate sections for audited and 
unaudited information. 
 
Unaudited information: 
Remuneration committee 
The board has a remuneration committee 
(“the committee”) in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Code.
During the financial year, the committee 
comprised Ivan Fallon (chairman), John 
McGuire and Anna Ford, all of whom are 
non-executive directors. Lord Stone of 
Blackheath also served on the committee 
up to and including the date of his 
retirement as a director on 2 January 
2013. Lord Alliance of Manchester, Andrew 
Higginson and Alan White also attended 
the committee by invitation. Fiona Laird 
joined the committee on 1 April 2013 and 
will succeed Ivan Fallon as chairman of the 
committee in October 2013. 
The committee members have no 
personal financial interest (other than as 
shareholders) in matters to be decided, 
no potential conflicts of interest arising 
from cross-directorships and no day-to-
day involvement in running the business 
and are considered by the company to be 
independent. The committee has formal 
written terms of reference which are 
available for shareholders to inspect and 
on the corporate website. The committee 
met four times during the year, with full 
attendance on each occasion.
Recommendations and reports were 
provided to the committee during the 
year by Alan White, the Chief Executive 
Officer and Andrew Higginson, the 
Chairman of the board. No director played 
any part in discussion about his or her 
own remuneration. The committee also 
received advice from external advisers 
during the year which materially assisted 
their consideration of remuneration matters 
as follows:
•	 Ne w 	 Bridge 	 St reet 	 pro vided	
benchmarking services in setting 
executive remuneration;
• 	 r em u ne rat io n 	 ben chmarki ng 	 an d 	 o t he r	
remuneration data taken from various 
publications of Deloitte LLP were also 
used; 
•	 E rnst 	 & 	 Y oung 	 LLP 	 and 	 P insent 	 Masons	
LLP provided advice in respect of 
certain executive remuneration matters 
and in respect of the company's share 
incentive plans and aspects of directors' 
pension arrangements; and
• 	 M e r ce r 	 Hu man 	 Re sou rce 	 Co ns u l t i ng	
Limited provided advice in relation to the 
Chief Executive's pension arrangements.
New Bridge Street, Ernst & Young LLP 
and Mercer Human Resources Consulting 
Limited were appointed by the committee 
and provided no other services to the 
company. Pinsent Masons LLP are 
the group's general legal advisers and 
were not specifically appointed by the 
committee. These advisers have no other 
connections with the group other than as 
set out above.
The advisers' terms of engagement are 
available on request from the Company 
Secretary.
The board and the committee have reviewed 
the group’s compliance with the Code on 
remuneration-related matters. It is the opinion 
of the board that the group complied with the 
remuneration-related aspects of the Code 
during the financial year ended 2 March 2013. 
The company has, however, agreed a long-
term incentive arrangement in connection 
with Angela Spindler's recruitment, without 
shareholder approval, as permitted by the 
Listing Rules and as described in more detail 
on page 36.
In setting the remuneration policy for 
2013 the committee considered the 
structure and quantum of the basic pay 
award for senior executives against 
that available for all other grades of 
staff and concluded that other than 
in cases of additional responsibilities 
being undertaken the same structure 
be applied to the senior executives. The 
committee also considered whether it was 
appropriate to introduce a ‘claw-back’ 
into any of the group’s incentive schemes. 
The committee considered in light of the 
provisions of Schedule A to the Code 
and has concluded that, in view of the 
existing safeguards built into the review 
mechanisms of the incentive schemes 
(which ensure they only pay out on the 
achievement of tangible deliverables 
set into the performance conditions), 
a claw-back is not required. However, 
the committee has resolved to keep 
the overall position on claw-back under 
review. It was decided, after reviewing 
the matter, that the previous structure of 
the group’s annual bonus scheme split 
between the achievement of a profit target 
and the achievement of personal and 
corporate objectives would be retained. 
The committee also decided to leave the 
long-term incentive share plan ("LTIP") 
unchanged for 2013. A detailed review 
of the LTIP scheme is scheduled to take 
place during 2013, following which a 
resolution for its renewal in updated form 
will be proposed at the annual general 
meeting in 2014.
Remuneration policy for executive 
directors and senior executives 
The committee’s policy is designed to 
ensure that the main elements of the 
remuneration package are linked to 
the company’s annual and long-term 
strategy and are appropriate in amount 
and capable of attracting, motivating and 
retaining executive directors. It is the aim 
of the policy to reward executive directors 
and senior executives by offering them 
competitive remuneration packages, which 
are prudently constructed, sufficiently 
stretching and linked to long-term 
profitability and which do not encourage 
excessive risk taking.
In particular the committee strives to 
ensure that its remuneration package is:
•	 al igned 	 wit h 	 t he 	 group ’ s 	 st rat egic 	 plan ;
• 	 al ig ne d 	 t o 	 shar ehol de r ’ s 	 i n t e r e st s ;
• 	 m eas ure d 	 a gainst 	 st re t chin g 	 tar ge t s ,	
both in absolute and relative terms;
• 	 com pe t i t i v e 	 and 	 s uf fi c i e n t l y 	 fl e x i bl e 	 t o	
support the recruitment needs of the 
business;
•	 paid 	 in 	 a 	 combinat ion 	 o f 	 cash 	 and 	 share	
options; and
•	 calculat ed 	 o v er 	 an 	 annual 	 and 	 t hree - y ear	
performance period.
The normal remuneration package for 
executive directors comprises basic 
salary, an annual performance-related 
bonus (including a deferred element with a 
matching share award subject to a further  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 34
REMUNERATION REPORT
performance condition, in the case of 
current directors), long-term share based 
incentives, a pension, a company car 
allowance and private medical insurance.
The committee strives to ensure that 
the structure of executive remuneration, 
including the balance between fixed and 
variable pay, is linked to the achievement 
of the long-term success of the group 
compatible with the company's prudent 
risk policies and systems.
All pay and incentives are subject to 
the individual review and scrutiny of 
the committee, particularly in the case 
of share incentives both at the award 
stage and at the vesting stage to ensure 
that performance has been correctly 
adjudicated and to safeguard against 
excessive overall reward. Variable pay and 
remuneration is normally linked to both 
improvements in corporate and individual 
performance and is benchmarked to 
attract and retain the highest quality 
people. The committee reviews the policy 
on an annual basis and recommends 
changes as and when appropriate, 
guided in this process by external 
consultants it appoints from time to time. 
The remuneration policy will undergo a 
comprehensive review ahead of the annual 
general meeting in 2014.
The committee considers the group’s 
performance on Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) issues when settling 
the remuneration of any executive director 
and is of the opinion that the incentive 
arrangements for senior managers do not 
raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour or the taking of 
undue risks with the business.
The charts which follow demonstrate the 
potential achievable balance between fixed 
and variable performance based pay for 
each executive director.

Basic salary 
When determining the salary of the 
executive directors the committee takes 
into account the levels of base salary for 
similar positions with comparable status, 
responsibility and skills in competitor 
organisations of broadly similar size and 
complexity, in particular those existing 
in the home shopping and retail market 
sectors; the performance of the individual 
executive director; the individual executive 
director’s experience and responsibilities; 
and the pay and conditions throughout 
the group. Salaries and conditions are 
reviewed on an annual basis and are 
subject to absolute improvements in group 
profitability and individual performance 
against personal and corporate objectives 
and peer-group benchmarking. Salary 
reviews also take into account salary levels 
within the workforce as a whole.
The current salaries of the executive 
directors are shown in the table below: 
Salaries
Alan White £534,250
Dean Moore £338,400
The above salaries represent a 2.5% 
increase on the respective executive 
director’s salary in June 2012, which 
is broadly in line with the percentage 
increase awarded to the workforce as 
a whole during the same period. 
Dean Moore also received an additional 
12.5% pay rise on 1 March 2013 to reflect 
additional responsibilities. 
Annual performance-related bonus 
The executive directors and senior 
executives participate in one of a number 
of annual performance-related bonus 
schemes at the invitation of the committee. 
Each scheme is designed to thoroughly 
stretch the performance of the executive 
and is linked to absolute growth in annual 
profit, the achievement of certain business 
targets and of personal objectives. 
These targets are reviewed and agreed 
by the committee at the beginning of 
each financial year to ensure that they 
are appropriate to the current market 
conditions, the long-term strategy of the 
company and that they continue to remain 
stretching and challenging. The targets are 
linked to KPIs which are drawn from, and 
relate to, the achievement of ‘milestones’ 
contained in the company’s strategic long-
term plan. They are therefore aligned to 
the strategic objectives of the company 
and aimed at increasing shareholder value, 
whilst being prudent and safeguarding the 
long-term future of the company. 
The components of the normal annual 
bonus scheme are made up as follows:-
•	 group 	 pro fitabi l it y 	 (7 0 % ) ;
•	 corporat e 	 ob ject iv es 	 ( 1 5 % ) ; 	 and
• 	 i n d ivi d u al 	 o b je ct iv e s 	 ( 1 5 % ) .
The maximum potential bonus payable to 
current executive directors for 2012/13 and 
2013/14 is 100% of basic salary. 75% of 
any bonus earned is payable in cash and 
(in the case of current directors) 25% is 
deferred net of tax into company shares 
for two years under the Deferred Annual 
Bonus scheme and is eligible for a 1:1 
match on the pre-tax value of the shares. 
Awards of matching shares are made two 
years from their date of award, subject to 
terms of the employee's contract, provided 
the executive remains in employment and 
are subject to a financial performance 
condition requiring that growth in the  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 35
REMUNERATION REPORT
company’s earnings per share must at 
least equal the growth of the retail price 
index over the deferral period.
The performance targets used for 2012/13 
were based on a combination of a 
profit target, improvements in customer 
service and the achievement of personal 
objectives. The performance targets for 
current directors for 2013/14 have recently 
been reviewed and, once again, will be 
based upon a combination of a profit 
target and the achievement of personal 
and corporate objectives. 
For 2012/13 the achievement of each 
element the bonus was scored as follows 
for both executive directors:
(a) Group profit (70% of bonus)
 The targeted adjusted profit before tax 
range for bonus purposes was £92.9m 
to £97.8m to reflect the impact of the 
53rd week in the prior year, compared 
with the prior year’s adjusted result of 
£97.0m. Adjusted profit before tax for 
2012/13 was £95.1m, therefore the bonus 
payment due under this element of the 
scheme was 50.4% (of a maximum of 
70%) for both the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Finance Director.
(b) Corporate objectives (15% of bonus)
 The corporate objective for the year in 
review was related to improvements 
in online trading performance. 
This was measured against twenty 
leading service measures and 
benchmarked against a range index 
totaling 100 points. A score of 65.0% 
was achieved and therefore the 
payment due under this element of 
the bonus scheme was 9.75 % (of a 
maximum of 15%) for both executive 
directors. 
(c) Individual performance objectives 
(15% of bonus)
 Several individual performance objectives 
are established for each senior executive. 
These are stretching objectives designed 
to achieve exceptional improvements 
against the prior year, or budgeted 
results, or the delivery of a key strategic 
project linked to corporate strategy. In 
the year in review amongst Alan White’s 
personal objectives were to oversee 
implementation of the strategic plan, 
improve customer choice of available 
delivery and return options, increase 
online and affinity sales, progress 
business development activities and 
update strategic options for the group. 
Amongst Dean Moore’s personal 
objectives were to manage the Simply 
Be store start-up, deliver agreed targets 
for the bad debt charge, review the 
group’s cost base and recommend areas 
of reduction. The achievement for the 
individual performance objective elements 
of the bonus scheme for the executive 
directors was adjudged by the committee 
and the group Chairman to be as follows:
•	 Al a n 	W h i t e 	1 1 .2 5 % 
(of a maximum of 15%)
•	 D e a n 	M o o r e 	1 1 . 4 0 % 
(of a maximum of 15%)
 
Based on the results of the three elements 
comprised in the annual bonus scheme, the 
bonus payable for the year under review, 25% 
of which is compulsorily converted into shares 
and deferred for two years, is as follows:
Share incentives 
Subject to the review of the committee, 
executive directors and senior executives 
are considered for participation in one of 
either the company’s long-term incentive 
plan or its executive share option schemes. 
The committee’s policy is that combined 
awards (ie awards under both the plan 
and the schemes) shall not be made 
other than where individual contribution 
to the performance of the group has been 
exceptional or on recruitment. In addition, 
it is the committee’s policy only to make 
combined grants where full consideration 
has been given to the following:
• 	 t he 	 accou n t i ng 	 i mpac t 	 an d 	 cost 	 f or	
the company and the dilutive cost 
for shareholders for a given share

•	 d if f erent 	 per f ormance 	 cond it ions 	 t hat	
might apply to awards and options; or 
•	 t he 	 recruit ment 	 o f 	 a 	 senior 	 e x ecut iv e .	
For the year under review no combined 
awards were made.
Existing schemes
Long-term incentive share plan (“LTIP”)
At the discretion and invitation of the 
committee, executive directors and certain 
senior executives are eligible to participate 
in the group’s LTIP. The plan provides 
appropriate incentives to reward sustained 
success through the achievement of 
challenging business targets, thereby 
better aligning the interests of shareholders 
and executives. It is the intention of the 
committee to recommend that LTIP awards 
are made again in 2013/14 and that the 
LTIP be reviewed before being renewed at 
the 2014 annual general meeting.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Performance condition
The normal LTIP performance condition is 
based upon TSR. TSR as a performance 
condition is considered appropriate for the 
following reasons: 
•	 mark et 	 research 	 ind icat es 	 t hat 	 TSR 	 is 	 an	
appropriate and common measure for 
long-term incentive arrangements within 
FTSE 250 companies; 
•	 a 	 TSR 	 per f ormance 	 cond it ion 	 is 	 in 	 t he	
opinion of the committee closely aligned 
with shareholder interests; and
•	 a 	 TSR 	 per f ormance 	 cond it ion 	 more	
closely evaluates company performance 
against a basket of comparator 
companies in the same sector.
 
The committee determines whether the 
TSR performance conditions for share 
awards are satisfied by ranking the 
company over a three-year performance 
period measured from the date of grant 
against a group of comparator companies 
currently comprising: ASOS, Debenhams, 
Dixons Retail, Dunelm, Findel, Flying 
Brands, French Connection, Halfords, 
HMV, Home Retail Group, J.D. Sports, 
JJB Sports, Darty, Laura Ashley, Marks & 
Spencer, Moss Bros Group, Mothercare, 
Next, Provident Financial and Supergroup. 
The committee determines from time 
to time which companies are to be 
added or removed from this comparator 
group, including the treatment of any 
company which ceases trading during 
any performance period. For 2013, Sports 
Direct and Carpetright will replace HMV 
and JJB Sports in the comparator list.
Vesting of awards
For awards vesting in 2013 and beyond 
100% of the award will vest if the company’s 
TSR is ranked in the upper quartile. 
Depending on rank, where the company’s 
TSR is ranked between the median and 
upper quartiles, between 25% and 85% 
of the award will vest. The percentage award 
vesting at median performance is 25% of 
the maximum award.
The company’s TSR performance against 
these targets is measured by reference to 
publicly available data produced by the 
company’s brokers, Credit Suisse, and by 
Datastream. The results are then reviewed 
and ratified by the committee before any 
final award is made.
There are currently 3 LTIP awards extant. 
Based on TSR performance as at 30 
April 2013, the company is situated in the 
relevant quartiles as follows:
2010/13 award – 2nd quartile
2011/14 award – 2nd quartile
2012/15 award – 1st quartile
Recruitment awards
The committee has agreed a recruitment 
package for Angela Spindler, who is 
expected to take up her appointment 
as Chief Executive Officer on 1 July 
2013. This includes special provisions 
for financial year 2013/2014. For the 
period from her joining until the end of 
the 2013/2014 financial year, she will be 
eligible to receive a time pro rated bonus 
based on 125% of salary, subject to 
the achievement of personal objectives 
agreed with the Chairman on behalf of the 
Remuneration committee. In subsequent 
years it is anticipated that she will be 
eligible for a cash bonus up to a maximum 
of 125% of salary, with 40% of any bonus 
outcome deferred into an award of shares 
exercisable after a period of two years, 
subject to employment conditions, but 
without any additional matching awards.
On an exceptional basis, and only to the 
extent necessary to compensate her for 
awards made by her former employer 
which are forfeited as a result of taking up 
her appointment with the company, Angela 
Spindler is eligible to receive two one-off, 
share awards. The first award, over shares 
to a value of up to 100% of salary, will be 
subject to employment conditions over two 
years. The second award, over shares to 
a value of up to 200% of salary will also 
be subject to the achievement of strategic 
objectives measured over a period of 
three years, which will be agreed by the 
Chairman on behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee. In addition, she is expected to 
participate in the LTIP in accordance with 
the policy agreed by the Remuneration 
committee. 
The performance conditions for her 
LTIP awards for financial year 2013/14, 
over shares to a value of up to 125% of 
salary, will be 50% by reference to Total 
Shareholder Return, as described above 
and 50% by reference to stretching 
conditions that will be set relating to 
growth in earnings per share, requiring 
substantial improvement in financial 
performance in order to achieve maximum 
vesting, in each case measured over a 
period of 3 years. Earnings per share 
is considered appropriate because it is 
easily understood and is a key measure 
of financial performance, closely aligned 
to the company's objectives of driving 
profitable growth.
Executive share option schemes 
The company operates both Unapproved 
and CSOP share option schemes, 
permitting annual awards of up to 200% 
of remuneration, although there is no plan 
to make any CSOP or unapproved option 
awards to executive directors in 2013/14, 
and none of the executive directors 
have any options outstanding under the 
executive share option schemes.
All employee share schemes 
The group operates an HM Revenue & 
Customs approved savings related share 
option scheme for the benefit of group 
employees, provided that they have 
completed at least six months’ service. 
Eligible employees, including executive 
directors and senior executives, may be 
granted options over the company’s shares 
at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing 
market price at the time of grant of the 
option, which (subject to certain conditions) 
can be exercised after either three or five 
years. There is currently no intention to 
invite eligible employees to participate in 
the company’s share incentive plan (SIP). 
Shareholding guidelines
The company has introduced formal share 
ownership guidelines under which the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Finance 
Director are respectively required to hold 
company shares equal in value (at the time 
of acquisition) to 200% and 100% of their 
base salary respectively. As at the year end 
the respective holdings are as follows (as a 
% of base salary).
Alan White 572%
Dean Moore 339%
Angela Spindler will be expected to attain 
her shareholding requirement over a 
5 year period.
Pension
Defined benefit scheme 
Alan White is a member of the N Brown 
Group Pension Fund (“the fund”), which 
is an HM Revenue & Customs registered 
defined benefit scheme. The group has also 
made an unregistered promise of benefits in 
addition to those of the fund such that the 
overall group provides for him, at his normal 
retirement age of 60, a pension accrual 
rate of 1/40th of pensionable salary, which 
is defined as base salary only, (to give a 
maximum pension of 2/3 pensionable salary 
at normal retirement age, including retained 
benefits and benefits earned in the fund prior 
to 1999). He is also provided with a lump 
sum death benefit of four times pensionable 
salary. The pension is calculated on a final 
salary basis for service prior to 30 June 2005 
and from then on a career average revalued  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 37
REMUNERATION REPORT
earnings basis. As Alan White remained in 
service until August 2010, his previous period 
of service with the group from 1985 to 1999 
will be included in full in the calculation of his 
current pension, subject to the above two-
thirds maximum.
No part of a director’s pensionable salary 
includes remuneration other than basic pay.
All members of the fund currently pay 
contributions (or sacrifice salary) at the 
rate of 6% or 8% of pensionable salary. 
The group bears the cost of providing the 
lump sum death benefit and the balance 
of contributions necessary to finance fund 
benefits.
The fund is now closed to new entrants. 
Eligible employees who would otherwise 
have been entitled to join the fund are now 
able to join a new defined contribution 
pension scheme.
Defined contribution scheme 
Dean Moore is a member of the defined 
contribution scheme. Members of 
this scheme pay contributions up to a 
maximum rate of 6% of pensionable salary, 
with the company matching the level of 
employee contribution. The company 
contributes 6% of Dean Moore’s annual 
salary into the defined contribution 
scheme.
Benefits in kind 
Executive directors receive the following 
additional benefits: 
•	 a 	car 	and 	fuel 	al lo w ance ; 	and	
• 	 pri v a t e 	 m ed i ca l 	 i n s u r an ce	
Directors’ contracts 
It is the company’s policy that executive 
directors should have contracts with an 
indefinite term providing for a maximum 
of 12 months' notice. 
The policy is that the company does not 
make payments beyond its contractual 
obligations on termination. In addition, 
executive directors are expected to 
mitigate their loss or, within existing 
contractual constraints, accept phased 
payments. The committee seeks to ensure 
that there are no unjustified payments for 
failure. None of the executive directors’ 
contracts provides for liquidated damages. 
There are no special provisions contained 
in any of the executive directors’ contracts 
that provide for longer periods of notice 
on a change of control of the company. 
Further, there are no special provisions 
providing for additional compensation 
on an executive director’s cessation of 
employment with the company. 
Potential termination payments are 
summarised below:
Non-executive directors are retained on 
letters of appointment. All non-executive 
appointments are on three year terms 
terminable upon up to six months' notice, 
save for Ivan Fallon and John McGuire who 
are on three month rolling terms. 
All appointments are subject to successful 
re-election upon retirement at the annual 
general meeting. Termination carries no 
right to compensation other than that 
provided by general law. This policy also 
applies to non-executive directors.
Brief details of non-executive and 
executive directors’ contracts are 
summarised below: 
Additional directorships
Executive directors are encouraged 
by the company to hold non-executive 
directorships in listed businesses. Fees 
for such directorships are retained by the 
executive director. Alan White currently 
holds a non-executive directorship with 
Topps Tiles Plc for which he is paid a fee 
of £41,000 per annum and with Direct 
Wines Limited for which he is paid a fee of 
£40,000. Alan White is permitted to retain 
both of these fees. 
Non-executive directors 
All non-executive directors have 
specific terms of engagement and their 
remuneration is determined by the board 
within the limits set by the Articles of 
Association and based on independent 
surveys of fees paid to non-executive 
directors of similar companies. 
The basic fee paid to each non-executive 
director in the year was within the range 
£17,000–£38,000 per annum. A further fee 
of £5,000 was payable for additional work 
performed in respect of the chairmanship 
of the remuneration committee, £6,500 for 
the chairmanship of the audit committee 
and £3,000 for chairing the nomination 
committee. The Deputy Chairman also 
receives an additional fee of £7,000 in 
recognition of the further duties which 
that post entails. Non-executive directors 
cannot participate in any of the company’s

based plans and are not eligible to join the

Following a review by New Bridge 
Street in December 2012 the committee 
recommended to the board that the non-
executive directors' fees be revised. 
Acting on the recommendations of the 
committee, the board (acting by those 
directors not interested in the matter) 
resolved to increase the basic non-
executive fee to £47,000 with a 
supplement of between £5,000 and 
£8,000 for chairing a committee and 
£5,000 for acting as senior independent 
non-executive director.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
members of N Brown Group plc.
We have audited the group financial 
statements of N Brown Group plc for 
the 52 weeks ended 2 March 2013 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, the Reconciliation of Operating 
Profit to Net Cash Flow from Operating 
Activities and the related notes 1 to 29. 
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the 
company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

statements:

Opinion on other matter prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006

for which the group financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the group 
financial statements.

1 General information
N Brown Group plc is a company 
incorporated in the United Kingdom under 
the Companies Act 2006. The address of 
the registered office is listed at the end 
of the report. The nature of the group’s 
operations and its principal activities are 
set out on page 18 of the directors’ report. 
These financial statements are presented 
in pounds sterling because that is the 
currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the group operates. 
Foreign operations are included in 
accordance with the policies set out  
in note 2. 
The group's financial statements for  
the 52 weeks ended 2 March 2013 
have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted for use in the EU.
The accounting policies have been applied 
consistently in the current and prior 
periods, other than that as set out below.
Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year, the following new and 
revised Standards and Interpretations 
have been adopted and have affected 
the amounts reported in these financial 
statements.
 
Standards affecting the financial 
statements
The following amendments were made as 
part of Improvements to IFRSs (2010). 
 
Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures. The amendment clarifies the 
required level of disclosure around credit 
risk and collateral held and provides relief 
from disclosure of renegotiated financial 
assets. The impact of this amendment 
has been to reduce the level of disclosure 
provided on collateral that the entity holds 
as security on financial assets that are past 
due or impaired.
Standards not affecting the reported 
results nor the financial position
The following new and revised Standards 
and Interpretations have been adopted in 
the current year. Their adoption has not 
had any significant impact on the amounts 
reported in these financial statements but, 
with the exception of the amendment to 
IFRS 1, may impact the accounting for 
future transactions and arrangements.
Amendment to IFRS 1 - Limited Exemption 
from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures 
for First-time Adopters. The amendment 
provides a limited exemption for first-time 
adopters from providing comparative fair-
value hierarchy disclosures under IFRS 7.
 
IAS 24 (2009) - Related Party Disclosures. 
The revised standard has a new, 
clearer definition of a related party, 
with inconsistencies under the previous 
definition having been removed.
Amendment to IAS 32 - Classification of 
Rights Issues. Under the amendment, 
rights issues of instruments issued to 
acquire a fixed number of an entity’s own 
non-derivative equity instruments for a 
fixed amount in any currency and which 
otherwise meet the definition of equity are 
classified as equity.
Amendments to IFRIC 14 - Prepayments  
of a Minimum Funding Requirement.  
The amendments now enable recognition 
of an asset in the form of prepaid minimum 
funding contributions.
Improvements to IFRSs 2010. Aside from 
those items already identified above, the 
amendments made to standards under 
the 2010 improvements to IFRSs have had 
no impact and will not have any impact on 
the group.
Standards in issue not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these 
financial statements, the following 
Standards and Interpretations which 
have not been applied in these financial 
statements were in issue but not yet 
effective (and in some cases had not yet 
been adopted by the EU):
 
•	 I FRS 	 1 	 ( amended) : 	 Se v ere 	 Hyperin flat ion	
and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-
time Adopters
•	 I FRS 	 7 	 ( amended) : 	 Disclosures 	 –

•	 I FRS 	 9 : 	 F inancial 	 I nst ruments
•	 I FRS 	 1 0 : 	 Consol idat ed 	 F inancial

•	 I FRS 	 1 1 : 	 Joint 	 A rrangements
•	 I FRS 	 1 2 : 	 Disclosure 	 o f 	 I nt erests 	 in

•	 I FRS 	 1 3 : 	 F air 	 V al ue 	 Measurement
•	 IA S 	 1 	 ( amended) : 	 P resentat ion 	 o f 	 I t ems	
of Other Comprehensive Income
•	 IA S 	 1 2 	 ( amended) : 	 Def erred 	 T a x :

•	 IA S 	 1 9 	 ( re vised) : 	 E mplo y ee 	 Benefits
•	 IA S 	 2 7 	 ( re vised) : 	 Separat e 	 F inancial

•	 IA S 	 2 8 	 ( re vised) : 	 I n v est ments 	 in	
Associates and Joint Ventures
•	 I FRIC 	 2 0 : 	 St ri pping 	 Costs 	 in 	 t he	
Production Phase of a Surface Mine
 
The directors do not expect that the 
adoption of the standards listed above which 
are not yet effective will have a material 
impact on the financial statements of the 
group in future periods, except as follows:
- IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement 
and disclosures of Financial Instruments. 
It is likely that the transition to an effective 
loss provisioning basis will potentially 
increase the overall provision for trade 
receivables but the group has not yet 
finalised the assessment of likely impact;
- IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of 
interests the group has in other entities;
- IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of 
fair value for certain assets and liabilities 
as well as the associated disclosures; and
- IAS 19 (revised) will impact the 
measurement of the various 
components representing movements 
in the defined benefit pension obligation 
and associated disclosures, but not the 
group’s total obligation. It is likely that 
following the replacement of expected 
returns on plan assets with a net 
finance cost in the income statement, 
the profit for the period will be reduced 
and accordingly other comprehensive 
income increased.
Beyond the information above, it is not 
practicable to provide a reasonable 
estimate of the effect of these standards 
until a detailed review has been completed.
2 Accounting policies
Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting and Accounting Standards 
(IFRS).
The group has adopted Standards and 
Interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the 
IASB that are relevant to its operations.
Individual standards and interpretations 
have to be adopted by the European 
Commission (EC) and the process leads 
to a delay between the issue and adoption 
of new standards and interpretations 
and in some cases amendments by the 
EC. Where the group has applied a new 
standard or interpretation in advance of  
EC adoption this will be noted below in  
the relevant policy statement.
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS.  
The financial statements have also  
been prepared in accordance with  
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 49
IFRSs adopted by the European Union  
and therefore comply with Article 4 of  
the EU IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis, 
except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments. The principal accounting 
policies adopted are set out as follows. 
Accounting period 
Throughout the accounts, the directors 
report and financial review, reference to 
2013 means at 2 March 2013 or the  
52 weeks then ended; reference to 2012 
means at 3 March 2012 or the 53  
weeks then ended unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements  
of the company and entities controlled  
by the company (its subsidiaries) made  
up to the Saturday that falls closest to  
28 February each year. The Employee 
Share Ownership Trust is also made up 
to a date co-terminus with the financial 
period of the parent company. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the period are included 
in the consolidated income statement 
from the effective date of acquisition or 
up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate. Control is achieved where 
the company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is 
accounted for using the purchase method. 
The cost of the acquisition is measured  
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the 
date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised  
at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is 
recognised as an asset on the date 
control is acquired and initially measured 
at cost, being the excess of the cost 
of the business combination over the 
group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
exceeds the cost of the business 
combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed 
for impairment at least annually. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately 
in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss  on disposal.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions 
before 1 March 1998 was charged against 
reserves in the year of acquisition in 
accordance with UK GAAP and has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining 
any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable 
and represents the total amount receivable 
for goods and services provided in the 
normal course of business net of returns, 
VAT and sales related taxes. 
Sales of goods are recognised when goods 
are delivered and title has passed and it 
is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to 
the entity. Sales of rendering of services 
include interest, administrative charges 
and arrangement fees. Interest income is 
accrued on a time basis, by reference to 
the principal outstanding and the applicable 
effective interest rate which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the 
financial assets to that assets’ net carrying 
amount. Such revenues are recognised only 
when collectability is reasonably assured. 
Revenue from non-interest related financial 
income is recognised when the services 
have been performed. 
Property, plant & equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated  
at cost, less accumulated depreciation  
and any provision for impairment in value. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write 
off the cost of assets to their estimated 
residual values, based on current prices 
at the balance sheet date, over their 
remaining useful lives, using the straight-
line method. No depreciation is charged on 
freehold land. In this respect the following 
annual depreciation rates apply:
Freehold buildings 2% 
Leasehold property  over the period  
and improvements of the lease 
Motor vehicles 20% 
Computer equipment 20% 
Plant and machinery  between  
5% and 20% 
Fixtures and fittings  between  
10% and 20%
Assets held under finance leases are 
depreciated over their expected useful 
lives on the same basis as owned assets 
or, where shorter, over the term of the 
relevant lease. 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an asset is determined as 
the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognised in income. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to  
the acquisition, construction or production 
of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of 
time to get ready for their intended use 
or sale, are added to the cost of those 
assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use 
or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised 
in profit or loss in the period in which they 
are incurred. 
Intangible assets 
Computer software development costs 
that generate economic benefits beyond 
one year are capitalised as intangible 
assets and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over five years. 
Customer databases arising on 
acquisitions assessed under the 
requirements of IFRS 3 are amortised  
over their useful economic lives, which 
have been assessed as being five years. 
Legally protected or otherwise separable 
trade names acquired as part of a 
business combination are capitalised at 
fair value on acquisition. Brand names are 
individually assessed and are assumed 
to have an indefinite life and are not 
amortised, but are subject to annual 
impairment tests.
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 50
Impairment of tangible and intangible 
assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the group 
reviews the carrying value of its tangible 
and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent 
from other assets, the group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which the estimate of 
future cash flows have not been adjusted.
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or 
cash-generating unit) is estimated to be 
less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating 
unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount of the asset 
(cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Leasing 
Leases are classified as finance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases 
are charged to income on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease 
even where payments are not made on 
such a basis.
Assets held under finance leases are 
included in tangible fixed assets at a value 
equal to the original costs incurred by the 
lessor less depreciation, and obligations to 
the lessor are shown as part of creditors. 
The interest element is charged to the 
income statement over the period of the 
lease to produce a constant rate of charge 
on the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding. 
Inventories 
Inventories have been valued at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises direct materials and 
those overheads that have been incurred 
in bringing inventories to their present 
location and condition based on the 
standard costing method. Cost has been 
calculated on a first-in-first-out basis.  
Net realisable value means estimated 
selling price less all costs to be incurred  
in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the 
tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on 
taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be 
payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the group 
is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period 
when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except 
when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of 
each group company are presented in 
the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its 
functional currency). For the purpose of 
the consolidated financial statements, the 
results and financial position of each group 
company are expressed in pounds sterling, 
which is the functional currency of the 
group, and the presentation currency for 
the consolidated financial statements. 
In preparing the financial statement of 
the individual companies, transactions in 
currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded 
at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the date 
when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the 
settlement of monetary items, and on 
the retranslation of monetary items, are 
included in profit or loss for the period. 
Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of non-monetary items 
carried at fair value are included in profit 
or loss for the period except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of non-
monetary items in respect of which gains 
and losses are recognised directly 
in equity. For such non-monetary items, 
any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain 
foreign exchange risks, the group may 
enter into forward contracts and options 
(see below for details of the group’s 
accounting policies in respect of such 
derivative financial instruments).
 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated 
financial statements, the assets 
and liabilities of the group’s foreign 
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 51
operations are translated at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average exchange rates 
for the period, unless exchange rates 
fluctuate significantly during that period, 
in which case the exchange rates at the 
date of transactions are used. Exchange 
differences arising, if any, are classified 
as equity and transferred to the group’s 
translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or 
as expenses in the period in which the 
operation is disposed of. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised on the group’s balance sheet 
when the group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Profits and losses on financial instruments 
are recognised in the income statement as 
they arise. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. Appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in profit or loss when there 
is objective evidence that the asset is 
impaired based on specific customer 
patterns of behaviour which may be 
affected by external economic conditions. 
The allowance recognised is measured 
as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted 
at the effective interest rate computed at 
initial recognition.
Trade receivables are assessed for 
impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment could 
include the group's past experience of 
collecting payments and observable changes 
in national and local economic conditions 
that could correlate with a default event.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash 
on hand and demand deposits, and other 
short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
are classified according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangements entered 
into. An equity instrument is any contract 
that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the group after deducting all of 
its liabilities. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts 
are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accrual basis in 
the income statement using the effective 
interest method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing 
and are stated at their nominal value. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the company 
are recorded at the proceeds received, net 
of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments 
The group’s activities expose it primarily 
to the financial risks of changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates relating to the 
purchase of overseas sourced products, 
and interest rates relating to the group’s 
debt. The group uses foreign exchange 
forward contracts and interest rate swap 
contracts where appropriate to hedge 
these exposures. In accordance with 
its treasury policy, the group does not 
use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed 
by the group’s policies approved by 
the board of directors, which provide 
written principles on the use of financial 
derivatives. 
Derivatives are stated at their fair 
value. The fair value of foreign currency 
derivatives contracts is their quoted market 
value at the balance sheet date. 
Market values are based on the duration 
of the derivative instrument together with 
the quoted market data including interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates and market 
volatility at the balance sheet date. The 
fair value of interest rate contracts is the 
estimated amount that the group would 
receive or pay to terminate them at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account 
prevailing interest rates. 
Changes in the fair value of currency 
derivative financial instruments are 
recognised in the income statement  
as they arise. 
Share-based payments 
The group issues equity-settled share-
based payments to certain employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on 
the group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. Fair value is measured  
by use of a Black-Scholes model. 
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution 
retirement benefit schemes are charged 
as an expense as they fall due. Payments 
made to state-managed retirement benefit 
schemes are dealt with as payments to 
defined contribution schemes where the 
group’s obligations under the schemes 
are equivalent to those arising in a defined 
contribution retirement benefit scheme. 
For defined benefit retirement benefit 
schemes, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the Projected Unit Credit 
Method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at each balance sheet date. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
in full in the period in which they occur. 
They are recognised outside income 
statement and presented in the statement 
of comprehensive income. 
Past service cost is recognised 
immediately to the extent that the benefits 
are already vested, and otherwise is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over  
the average period until the benefits 
become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation 
recognised in the balance sheet represents 
the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation, as reduced by the fair value  
of scheme assets. Any asset resulting 
from this calculation is restricted to the 
past service cost plus the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions.
Critical judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the 
future and other sources of estimation 
uncertainty at the year end date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below. 
Trade receivables 
An appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable trade receivables is derived 
where there is an identified event which, 
based on previous experience, is evidence 
of a potential reduction in the recoverability 
of future cash flows. This estimation is

An analysis of the group’s revenue is as follows:
Sale of goods   557.8 534.8
Rendering of services   226.9 218.4
Revenue   784.7 753.2
Investment income   3.9 4.3
Total revenue   788.6 757.5
 
based on assumed collection rates which, 
although based on the group’s historical 
experience of customer repayment 
patterns, remains inherently uncertain.
As a result this is continually assessed 
for relevance and adjusted appropriately. 
Further information is given in note 16. 
Inventory 
Provision is made for those items of 
inventory where the net realisable value 
is estimated to be lower than cost. Net 
realisable value is based on both historical 
experience and assumptions regarding 
future selling values, and is consequently  
a source of estimation uncertainty. 
Pensions
The liability recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of the group’s defined 
benefit pension obligations represents the 
liabilities of the group’s pension scheme 
after deduction of the fair value of the 
related assets. The scheme’s liabilities 
are derived by estimating the ultimate 
cost of benefits payable by the scheme 
and reflecting the discounted value of 
the proportion accrued by the year end. 
The rate used to discount the resulting 
cash flows is equivalent to the market 
yield at the balance sheet date on high 
quality bonds with a similar duration to the 
scheme’s liabilities. This rate is potentially 
subject to significant variation and changes 
to these rates could have a significant 
impact on the net deficit.
Going concern
In determining whether the group’s 
accounts can be prepared on a going 
concern basis, the directors considered 
the group’s business activities together 
with factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and its financial 
position including cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities and the 
principal risks and uncertainties relating to 
its business activities. These are set out 
within the Financial Review and discussed 
further in the Chairman’s Statement and 
Chief Executive’s Review.
The group has considered carefully 
its cash flows and banking covenants 
for the next twelve months from the 
date of signing the audited financial 
statements. These have been appraised 
in light of the uncertainty in the current 
economic climate. As such, conservative 
assumptions for working capital 
performance have been used to determine 
the level of financial resources available 
to the company and to assess liquidity 
risk. The key trading risk identified by 
the directors for these assumptions is 
the impact that a further deterioration in 
the economic climate might have on the 
performance of the group’s debtor book.
The group’s forecasts and projections, 
after sensitivity to take account of all 
reasonably foreseeable changes in trading 
performance, show that the group will  
have sufficient headroom within its current 
loan facilities of £370m, which are 
committed until 2016. After making 
appropriate enquiries, the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the 
company and the group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in the preparation  
of the annual report and accounts.

Assets in the course of construction included in intangible assets at the year end total £12.4m (2012 £13.8m). No depreciation  
is charged on these assets.
All software additions relate to internal development. The brand additions of £0.1m relate to the acquisition of Dannimac  
and the Diva brand names.
Amortisation of intangible assets is split equally between cost of sales and administration costs and is disclosed in note 5.

The brand names arising from the acquisition of Gray & Osbourn Limited, High and Mighty, Slimma, Figleaves, Diva and Dannimac 
are deemed to have indefinite lives as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which they are expected to generate cash 
inflows and are subject to annual impairment tests.
The carrying value of the brand names have been determined from a value in use calculation. The key assumptions for this 
calculation are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the forecast cash flows.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent three year financial budgets approved by management and 
thereafter extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity (with 2.7% growth assumed) to reflect that there is no foreseeable limit to the 
period over which cash flows are expected to be generated. The rate used to discount the forecast post tax cash flows is 5.7% 
(2012, 5.7%). The directors consider that the value in use calculation has sufficient headroom above the carrying value of the 
brand names. Should there be a materially adverse change in the key assumptions noted above this could result in an impairment.

Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost. 
The average credit period given to customers for the sale of goods is 246 days (2012, 243 days). Interest is charged at 39.9%  
(2012, 39.9%) on the outstanding balance. Generally, receivables over 150 days past due are written off in full. Trade receivables 
that reach the trigger point of 56 days past due are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts, determined by 
reference to past default experience. The carrying amount of trade receivables whose terms have been renegotiated but would 
otherwise be past due totalled £68.8m at 2 March 2013 (2012, £66.5m).
Before accepting any new customer, the group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s  
credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Credit limits and scores attributed to customers are reviewed every  
28 days. The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, with regard to the historical default  
rate has remained stable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated and comprising 1.5 million  
(2012, 1.5 million) customers. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess  
of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows:   % %

The principal features of the group’s borrowings are as follows:    
(i) Bank overdrafts which are nil at the current and prior year ends are repayable on demand, unsecured and bear interest 
 at a margin over bank base rates.
(ii)  The group has a bank loan of £220m (2012, £220m) secured by a charge over certain ‘eligible’ trade debtors (current and  
0-28 days past due) of the group and is without recourse to any of the group’s other assets. The facility has a current limit of 
£250m for which finance costs are linked to US commercial paper rates which is committed until March 2016.
  In addition the group has unsecured bank loans of £30m (2012, £30m) drawn down under a medium term bank revolving credit 
facility, which was renegotiated in November 2011, of £100 million committed until March 2016.
(iii)  All borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow interest rate risk. The group use derivatives 
such as interest rate swaps where appropriate. Based on weighted average interest rates and the value of bank loans at  
2 March 2013 the estimated future interest cost per annum until maturity would be £1.8m (2012, £2.1m).
  Financial liabilities other than financial instruments include bank loans and overdrafts and trade and other payables. Other than 
as disclosed above, all are due within one year. The maturity analysis of the group’s financial liability on an undiscounted basis, 
assuming that the facilities are retained until the end of the committed period are as follows:

At 2 March 2013, the group had available £120m (2012, £120m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which  
all conditions precedent had been met.
The Financial Review on page 15 summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and  
similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of the group’s borrowings and other financial assets  
and liabilities.

 Changes in the fair value of assets/liabilities recognised, being non-hedging currency derivatives, amounted to a credit of £1.3m 
(2012, credit of £1.3m) to income in the period.
The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are all grouped into Level 2 (2012, same).
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year (2012, same).

Capital risk management 
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the group consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 17, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 24 and equity attributable to  
equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 22 to 23 and the 
statement of changes in equity.

Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 17. 
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
Externally imposed capital requirement 
The group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant accounting policies 
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and 
equity instrument are disclosed in note 2.
Financial risk management objectives 
The financial risks facing the group include currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The group seeks 
to minimise the effects of certain of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures as governed 
by the group’s policies. The group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for 
speculative purposes.
Foreign currency risk management 
The group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations 
arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments for the 
purchase of overseas sourced products. Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to three years ahead.

Interest rate risk management 
The group is exposed to interest rate risk, as entities in the group borrow funds at floating interest rates. Where appropriate, 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations on indebtedness is managed by using derivatives such as interest rate swaps.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
If interest rates had increased by 0.5% and all other variables were held constant, the group’s profit before tax for the 52 weeks  
ended 2 March 2013 would have decreased by £1.25m (2012, £1.25m). 
This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and assuming the net 
debt outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
Credit risk management 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the group. 
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are made through banks which are approved by  
the board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures, supplied by independent rating 
agencies. Customer debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated, and did not exceed five 
percent of gross monetary assets at any one time during the period.
Liquidity risk management 
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring  
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 17 is a 
description of additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its disposal and details of the group’s remaining contractual 
maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial instruments 
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted 
interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate 
their fair values.

The awards outstanding at 2 March 2013 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.9 years (2012, 1.7 years).
The fair value of management and sharesave options/awards granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes  
option pricing model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
    2013 2012
Weighted average share price at date of grant (pence)   239 278
Weighted average exercise price (pence)   102 135
Expected volatility (%)   32.6 - 39.4 37.9 - 41.0
Expected life (years)   2.5 - 5.5 2.5 – 5.5
Risk-free rate (%)   0.4 1.5
Dividend yield (%)   5.4 4.4
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the group’s share price over a period equivalent to the 
expected life of the option. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the

28 Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes 
The group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.  
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £2.1m (2012, £2.0m) represents contributions payable to the schemes by the group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 2 March 2013, contributions of £0.2m (2012, £0.2m) due in respect of the current reporting 
period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme 
The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund. Under the scheme, the employees are entitled  
to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002. No other  
post-retirement benefits are provided. The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 30 
June 2009 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service 
cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal actuarial assumptions used in 
determining the group’s net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows:
    2013 2012
Discount rate   4.55% 4.8%
Expected return on scheme assets   4.5% 4.6%
Expected rate of salary increase   4.5% 4.4%

Pensioner aged 65   23.8 23.8
Non-pensioner aged 45   26.8 26.8
    2013 2012 
Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows:  £m £m
Current service cost   2.1 1.8
Interest cost   4.0 3.9
Expected return on scheme assets   (3.8) (4.2)
   2.3 1.5
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income. The cumulative actuarial losses since 
transition to IFRS were £4.1m (2012, actuarial losses of £0.1m).
The actual return on scheme assets was a gain of £6.3m (2012, gain of £8.4m).
The scheme is a closed scheme and therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost would be expected  
to increase.

to contribute £2.5m to the defined benefit scheme by 31 March 2013, as agreed following the 2009 valuation. Contributions for the 
next financial year will be determined once the 30 June 2012 valuation is finalised.

is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the

the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those

Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’

Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s

Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information 
in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

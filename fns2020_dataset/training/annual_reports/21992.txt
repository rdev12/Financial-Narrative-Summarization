management service to private high net 
worth individuals, charities and trusts. It also

Brooks Macdonald Financial Consulting is

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Profit before tax has increased by 
28% from £5.68 million to £7.29 
million, on turnover which has 
increased by 49% to £52.18million. 
Earnings per share were 51.92p, 
compared with 38.10p for the 
previous year, an increase of 36%. 
As I reported in my interim statement, 
these results are after a charge of 
£545,000, being the levy imposed on 
Brooks Macdonald (in common with all 
other wealth managers) under the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme. 
The board has recommended a final 
dividend of 10p per share. If approved by 
shareholders this will result in total 
dividends for the year of 15p, an increase of 
67% over the dividends of 9p per share paid 
for the previous financial year.
Funds under management (FUM) at 30 June 
2011 were £2,969 million, an increase of 
£783 million or 36% over the figure a year 
earlier. When our shares were listed on AIM 
in 2005, our FUM were £315 million. This 
nine-fold increase in six years is a remarkable 
achievement and one, we believe, which 
reflects both the excellent service we 
provide to our clients and the strength of 
our relationship with our partners and 
professional introducers.
Since the year-end we have launched our 
funds business, initially consisting of the 
three funds we acquired as part of Braemar 
Group and four existing Brooks Macdonald 
funds. We are now marketing our funds to a 
wider group of potential investors. 
In November we plan to open our sixth 
private client regional office in Taunton, 
where we have recently announced the 
acquisition of the investment management 
department of Clarke Willmott LLP. The 
acquisition will add over c. £120 million to 
our FUM. Our regional offices are closely 
associated with our Strategic Alliance 
partners and hence are an important part of 
our growth strategy.
We are pleased to welcome Diane Seymour- 
Williams as a non-executive director. Diane 
has had a distinguished career in investment 
management having spent over twenty 
years at Morgan Grenfell/Deutsche Asset 
Management. She is now an executive 
director of Lloyd George Management and 
a non-executive director of both Calculus 
Capital and of Witan Pacific Investment 
Trust and will undoubtedly be a valuable 
addition to the Brooks Macdonald Board.
The UK economy faces significant economic 
challenges, the eurozone is in turmoil and 
the US has a balance of payments problem 
that it is struggling to address. In 
challenging markets our approach remains 
unchanged: we look to invest our clients’ 
funds with caution while providing them 
with an efficient and transparent service. We 
believe that this approach will continue to 
stand them and Brooks Macdonald in good 
stead as we continue to build our business.

growth for the Group”

Chief Executive’s Review
Introduction
In spite of a volatile macroeconomic 
backdrop this has been another highly 
successful year for the Group. We have 
delivered value to our clients, shareholders 
and staff whilst critically maintaining our 
strong corporate ethos and culture. 
Funds under management 
Discretionary funds under management 
over the period rose from £2,186 million to 
£2,969 million representing an increase of 
36%. As a comparison the APCIMS balanced 
index rose by 14% over the same period. 
This rise comes as a result of a combination 
of continuing strong new business and very 
solid investment performance across all risk 
mandates. Our principal areas of investment 
management are the management of 
private portfolios, self invested personal 
pensions and charities and trusts and I am 
pleased to report that we have seen growth 
in all three areas. 
Strategies for growth 
We have, and will continue to pursue, a 
number of strategies for growth, principally 
as follows: expanding by organic investment 
in our core businesses, acquiring investment 
management teams, expanding our 
regional presence and developing our 
product and service offering. 
Organic investment continues apace. We 
have expanded all parts of the business over 
the reporting period with growth in 
professional staff, senior hires in Compliance 
and Risk, Marketing, Trainees, Operations 
and New Business Development. Total staff 
numbers increased from 164 to 247, 
including an increase in investment 
managers from 35 to 43. Two trainees 
qualified as Investment Managers over the 
year. We remain firmly committed to our 
trainee programme and currently have 13 
trainees who give us considerable capacity 
for the future as well as allowing us to recruit 
high quality graduates into the sector. 
We continue to develop our product and 
service offering. We currently undertake 
around 85% of the back office functionality 
within Asset Management and over the next 
nine months we will be looking to 
undertake 100% in house. Whilst this will 
involve additional capital investment, it will 
improve further our service offering to 
clients and appropriately position the 
business to handle further growth. Service 
development and robust transparent 
investment performance are key beliefs of 
the business.
We have six offices throughout the UK with 
our office in Hale being the focus for our 
Estates and Funds business. All other offices 
are focussed on private clients and our 
growth has been strong across each 
location. Outside London our Hampshire 
and Manchester offices are the oldest 
(opening in 2005 and 2007 respectively) 
and these two offices have both had an 
exceptionally strong year.
New Taunton Office
In addition, as announced on 5 August 
2011, we will be opening a new office in 
November in the South West of England, 
based in Taunton. This is as a result of our 
acquisition of the investment management 
department of Clarke Willmott LLP, the 
national law firm. As well as being a strong 
fit in terms of culture, the investment 
management team is a talented one. 
Forming a relationship with Clarke Willmott 
also gives the Group the opportunity of 
working closer with the legal practice in all 
their regional offices. We are excited not only 
about the acquisition but by the opportunity 
of this new potential avenue for growth. 
“We have delivered value 
to our clients, shareholders 
and staff whilst critically 
maintaining our strong 
corporate ethos and culture“

Chief Executive’s Review
Strategic Alliances
Our new business is supported by both 
Strategic Alliances and introductions from 
other professional services sectors. We now 
have nine strategic partners and have 
commercial arrangements with over 240 
quality professional services firms 
(Independent Financial Advisors, private client 
legal or accountancy practices). This number 
has risen by over 33% over the reporting 
period which represents our strongest period 
of growth since inception. I would like to go 
on record thanking all our professional 
connections for their continued support.
Braemar and launch of  
Funds business 
The acquisition of Braemar Group plc 
completed in the last financial year and 
comprised of two businesses: Estates and 
Securities. The Estates business has continued 
its growth, now managing over £750 million 
of property assets, and gives the Group 
another avenue for recurrent income growth. 
The Securities business has been used as the 
‘launch pad’ for our Funds Business which 
we announced in July 2011. As a Group we 
have a highly successful Managed Portfolio 
Service (‘MPS’) that offers clients with 
£200,000 or less to have access to our fund 
management service by investing into a 
portfolio managed by risk mandates.  
A natural extension of this was to launch a 
unitised version and this together with the 
existing three Braemar funds and our 
Structured Growth fund forms the basis of 
the new Funds business. Whilst clearly early 
days, initial progress is encouraging.
Financial Consulting 
Our Financial Consulting arm continues to 
grow organically. It has been another year of 
progress developing and maintaining alliances 
with solicitors, accountants and investment 
managers allowing us to work as part of a 
team in the management of client affairs.
Regulation 
The Retail Distribution Review (RDR) comes 
into force in January 2013. Transparency of 
charges, high professional standards, clarity 
of services and an industry that engages 
with consumers are some of the key 
outcomes of RDR. These are outcomes that 
we fully support and we are excited by the 
opportunities both before and beyond the 
implementation of RDR. 
Brooks Macdonald Foundation 
During the year we established the Brooks 
Macdonald Foundation that supports a 
range of charities that our staff have 
connections with. I would like to thank the 
trustees for their hard work in establishing 
the Foundation and all the staff involved in 
making this happen. 
Summary and Outlook
In September of this year we will have been 
trading for 20 years. We are proud of what 
has been achieved in that period and look 
ahead with confidence. Since the period 
end and despite challenging markets, we 
have witnessed continued inflows of funds 
through our private client offices and 
professional contacts and our funds business 
continues to progress well.
This is in the main due to the quality of our 
staff. I would like to end this report by 
thanking them all for their continued hard 
work, drive and professionalism over the  
last year.

Risks and uncertainties 
The principal risks and uncertainties that face the group are:
Financial risks
The group’s principal financial risks and the measures and policies 
for the management of those risks are set out in note 28 to the 
consolidated financial statements. Brooks Macdonald Group plc’s 
Pillar III disclosure is presented on our website at  
www.brooksmacdonald.com. Further details on capital 
management processes can be found in note 29. 
Non–financial risks
The significant non-financial risks faced by group are as follows:
Reputational risk
The group has a growing reputation as provider of high quality 
investment and wealth management services. There is a risk that 
significant damage to reputation could lead to the loss of existing 
clients as well as impacting on the ability to gain new clients which 
would lead to a fall in financial income. 
Such risk could arise from events such as poor investment 
performance or poor client service or regulatory censure. This risk is 
minimised by ensuring the group maintains a culture of high ethical 
and professional standards whilst focussing on delivering a first class 
service to all of our clients. The group maintains an independent 
compliance department which ensures conformity with the 
regulations of the Financial Services Authority as well as relevant 
statutes in all of our dealings with our clients. This compliance 
function is monitored by the compliance and risk committee of the 
group board.
Regulatory risk
The sector in which the group operates is heavily regulated and any 
breach of regulations could lead to fines or disciplinary action 
against the group or its staff. The group monitors actual and 
impending changes in regulations in order to assess the impact on 
the business and to ensure that the group has sufficient resources to 
implement any necessary changes. 
Competition risk
Operating in a competitive market there is a risk of loss of existing 
clients due to poor performance, failure to respond to changes in 
the market place, or the loss of key investment professionals. To 
minimise this risk, the group continues to invest in its employees 
and monitors developments in the marketplace in which it operates 
to ensure that the group continues to offer a wide range of services. 
Recruitment policies are designed to attract high quality staff and 
the group regularly reviews and benchmarks its remuneration 
packages and contractual arrangements in order to retain and 
motivate staff. A dedicated training manager provides structured 
training plans in order to ensure all staff continue to develop their 
careers within the group.
Technology risk
A key part of the high quality service delivered to clients is facilitated 
by a flexible and robust IT infrastructure.
New IT projects are regularly reviewed and appraised at board 
meetings in order to ensure that the group continues to develop its 
IT capabilities. As well as our offices in Hampshire, Manchester, 
Tunbridge Wells and most recently Edinburgh providing back up 
facilities we have a fully tested disaster recovery plan which would 
facilitate remote working capabilities. 
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk that the group suffers a loss resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or 
from external events that impact the operation of processes and 
systems. The group’s policy to minimise these risks is to 
continuously monitor and review the controls in place and maintain 
a robust procurement process, good contract governance and 
regular reviews and management of our key suppliers.

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union, and the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the 
profit or loss of the group and company for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	
consistently;
•	 	 make	judgements	and	accounting	estimates	that	are	reasonable	
and prudent;
•	 	 state 	 whether 	 IFRSs 	 as 	 adopted 	 by 	 the 	 European 	 Union 	 and	
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the group 
and parent company financial statements respectively;
•	 	 prepare	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	concern	basis	
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and 
the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in  
page 10 confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge  
and belief:
•	 	 the	financial	statements,	prepared	in	accordance	with	IFRSs	as	
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the group and 
company; and
•	 t 	 he 	 directors’ 	 report 	 contained 	 in 	 the 	 annual 	 report 	 includes 	 a 	 fair	
review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the company and group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

We have audited the group financial statements of Brooks 
Macdonald Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which 
comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flow, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 9, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
•	 	 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	group’ s	affairs	as	 
at 30 June 2011 and of its profit and cash flows for the year  
then ended;
•	 	 have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	IFRSs	as	
adopted by the European Union; and 
•	 	 have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	the	
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•	 	 certain	disclosures	of	directors’	remuneration	specified	by	law	
are not made; or 
•	 	 we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	
require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Brooks Macdonald Group plc for the year ended  
30 June 2011.

  IFRS 2 (Amendment) – ‘Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions’ (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2010). In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8 – ’Scope of FRS2’ and IFRIC 11 IFRS 2  – ‘Group treasury share transactions’, the 
amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that 
interpretation. This has no material impact on the current year’s results.
  IFRIC 19 – ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity Instruments’ (effective for accounting periods on or after 1 July 2010). The IFRIC clarifies 
that the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a 
creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt for equity swap). It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit 
or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments 
issued. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the equity instruments should be measured to reflect the 
fair value of the financial liability extinguished. This has no material impact on the current year’s results.
  Annual improvements to IFRSs (2009) (effective 1 January 2010) This is a collection of amendments to 12 standards as part of the ISAB‘s 
programme of annual improvements. This has no material impact on the current year’s results.
 (2)  New and amended standards, and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2010 but not 
currently relevant to the group.
  The following standards are also mandatory for the group’s accounting for the financial year beginning 1 July 2010 but which, in the opinion of 
the directors, are not relevant to the operations of the group:
  Amendment to IAS 32 - ‘Financial instruments: Presentation - classification of rights issues’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 February 2010).
 IFRS 1 (Amendment), ‘First time adoption on financial instrument disclosures’ (effective 1 July 2010).
 IFRIC 15 - ‘Agreements for construction of real estates’ (effective 1 January 2009; EU-endorsed for 1 January 2010).
  IFRIC 18 - ‘Transfer of assets from customers’ (effective for transfers of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009; EU-endorsed for 
use in annual periods beginning on or after 31 October 2009).

(c) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
  The preparation of financial information requires the use of assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions. Use of available 
information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future may differ from those reported. 
In this regard, management believes that the accounting policies where judgement is necessarily applied are those that relate to; the 
measurement of intangible assets, business combinations per below and estimating the fair value of share based payments.
  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision only affects both current and future periods.
 Further information about key assumptions the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below:
 Business combinations
  As described in note 8, the group has deferred consideration in respect of the acquisition of Lawrence House Fund Managers Limited which has 
been calculated as £725,719 allowing for an estimated growth in acquired funds discounted by the cost of capital. The group does not consider 
that the potential changes to these assumptions would result in the deferred consideration being materially different.  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
1. Principal accounting policies - continued
(c) Critical accounting estimates and judgements - continued
 Share based payments
  The group engages in share-based payments in respect of services received from certain employees. Estimating fair value for these payments 
requires determining the most appropriate valuation model and the inputs to that model. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair 
value are disclosed in notes 18 and 23. The charge to the income statement in respect of share based payments is calculated using assumptions 
over the number of eligible employees leaving the group and the number of employees satisfying the relevant performance conditions. These 
estimates are reviewed regularly.
 Intangibles
  The group has acquired client relationships and new teams of fund managers as described in note 10 and in assessing the fair value of those 
assets the group has estimated the finite life based on the experience of existing client relationships. Acquired client relationship contracts and 
contracts acquired with fund managers are amortised over three and five years on a straight line basis respectively.
  Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually or when other occasions or changes in circumstances 
indicate that it might be impaired. Any impairment is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
 Provisions 
  Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the group will be required 
to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 
  In the ordinary course of business, the group can receive complaints from clients in relation to the services provided. Complaints are assessed 
on a case by case basis and provisions are made where judged necessary.
(d) Business combinations
 Basis of consolidation
  The group’s financial statements comprise a consolidation of the financial statements of the parent company (Brooks Macdonald Group plc) 
and its subsidiaries. The underlying financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, 
using consistent accounting policies. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company and control exists when the company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are 
included from the date on which control is transferred to the group to the date that control ceases.
 All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the aggregate 
amount of the consideration transferred, at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. Acquisition costs incurred are 
charged to the income statement.
  When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. If the business combination 
is acquired in stages, the fair value of the groups’ previously held equity interest is re-measured as at the acquisition date and the difference is 
charged or credited to the income statement. Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition are brought on to the balance sheet at 
either their fair value at the date of acquisition.
  Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the 
fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in the 
income statement or as a change to other comprehensive income.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

1. Principal accounting policies - continued
(d) Business combinations - continued
  Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the consideration transferred over the group’s net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. If the consideration is lower than fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in income statement.
 Impairment
  After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s cash generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquisition are assigned to those units.
   Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the 
operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash 
generating unit retained.
(e)  Fees, commissions and interest
  Portfolio and other management advisory and custody services are billed in arrears and are recognised over the period the service is provided. 
These fees are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the value of the portfolio over the period the service is provided. Dealing charges are 
levied at the time the deal is placed for the client. Fees are recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the 
fee will be receivable.
   Financial consulting fees are charged to clients on an hourly fee rate or by a fixed fee arrangement and are recognised over the period the 
service is provided. Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period which they are earned.
  Where amounts are due conditional on the successful completion of fund raising for investment vehicles revenue is recognised where in the 
opinion of the directors, there is a reasonable certainty that sufficient funds have been raised to enable the successful operation of that investment 
vehicle. Amounts due on an annual basis for the management of third party investment vehicles are recognised on a time apportioned basis.
  Interest is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial instrument) to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
(f)  Cash and cash equivalents 
   Cash comprises cash in hand and cash on demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty. Cash equivalents comprise short term 
highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
 (g)  Share based payments
  The group provides equity and cash settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees. The fair 
value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant. The cost 
of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the service 
period, with a corresponding credit to equity or accruals depending on the nature of the scheme.
   The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the 
current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the company’s share price over the life of the option/award and other 
relevant factors.
  The group also operates a phantom cash settled share based scheme. On the grant date, the liability incurred is measured at fair value. The 
liability is re-measured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement.

(h)  Segmental reporting 
  The group determine and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the group board which is the 
group’s chief operating decision maker. 
 (i)  Fiduciary activities 
  The group commonly acts as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, 
trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements,  
as they are not assets of the group.
  The group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Services Authority. Such monies 
and the corresponding liability to clients are not included within the balance sheet as the group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
(j)  Property, plant and equipment 
  All property plant and equipment is included in the balance sheet at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for 
impairment. Costs include the original purchase cost of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use.
   Provision is made for depreciation rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected 
useful life, using a straight line method as follows:
Fixtures and fittings   15%-25% per annum
Equipment   20% per annum
Leasehold improvements   over the term of the lease
Long leasehold property    50 years 
  The assets’ residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by 
comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included in the income statement. 
(k) Intangible assets
 Client relationships 
   Client relationships are recognised when acquired by the group as part of a business combination or when separate payments are made to 
acquire funds under management by adding teams of investment managers. Client relationships are initially recognised at cost and are 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. If acquired as part of a business combination the 
initial cost of client relationships is the fair value at the acquisition date.
  The amortisation of client relationships is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives (five to 
fifteen years).
  Acquisition of new teams of fund managers
 Payments made acquire new teams of fund managers are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over five years.
 Computer software
  Software costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of four years straight line basis.

  Goodwill 
  Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at date of acquisition. In 
accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations, goodwill is not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment and as such, is stated at cost 
less any provision for impairment of value. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and not subsequently reversed. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. On acquisition, any goodwill 
acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
(l) Financial assets 
  The group classifies financial assets in the following categories; available for sale, held to maturity and as loans and receivables. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at the 
initial recognition.
  Loans and receivables 
   Loans and receivables are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They included in 
current assets except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non- current assets.  
The group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade and other receivables”.
 Available for sale
  Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They are included in non current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of 
the reporting period. Available for sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at fair value and their value is 
based on the current bid prices of the asset as quoted in active markets. 
 Held-to-maturity investments
  Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinate payments and fixed maturities that the group’s 
management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the group were to sell other than an insignificant amount of held-to 
maturity financial assets, the whole category would be tainted and reclassified as available for sale. Held to maturity assets investments are 
measured at amortised cost. 
(m) Provisions
   Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of 
economic benefits that can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to 
settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
  Client compensation 
 Complaints are assessed on a case by case basis and provisions for compensation are made where judged necessary.
(n) Foreign currency translation
   The company’s functional and the group’s presentation currency is sterling. Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange 
rate prevailing at the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation of period end monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Annual Report & Accounts 2011

1. Principal accounting policies - continued
(o) Retirement benefit costs
 Contributions in respect of the group’s defined contribution retirement scheme are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
(p)  Taxation 
  Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
  Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the group financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on its tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either authority on 
either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle on a net basis.
(q)  Trade receivables 
  Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. Doubtful debts are 
provided for when the collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts are written off when identified.
(r)  Trade payables 
  Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts 
payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer).  
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
  Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(s) Operating lease payments 
  Rents due under operating leases are charged to income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Where leases which have 
lease incentives, such as rent- free periods, the benefit of these incentives is recognised over the lease term.
(t)  Investment properties 
  Investment property comprises non owner occupied buildings held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation. Investment property is carried at 
fair value and is restated at each balance sheet date. Changes in fair values are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the 
period in which the changes arises.
(u)  Financial instruments 
  The group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity 
instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet at fair 
value when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Brooks Macdonald Group plc
26
1. Principal accounting policies - continued
(v)  Carried interest receivable 
  The group earns a performance fee, carried interest receivable, on funds it manages on behalf of its investors. Carried interest receivable is 
recognised where, at the balance sheet date, the performance criteria have been met based on the valuations of funds. Carried interest that has 
been earned, but where the amounts are not yet for payment, is discounted to its present value. They are included in the current liabilities on 
the balance sheet.
(w)  Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
  The company provides finance to an EBT to purchase the company’s shares on the open market to meet its obligation to provide shares when 
an employee exercises certain options or awards. The administration and finance costs connected with the trust are charged to the income 
statement. The cost of the shares held by the EBT is deducted from equity. A transfer is made between other reserves and retained earnings over 
the vesting periods of the related share options or awards to reflect the ultimate proceeds receivable from employees on exercise. The Trustees 
have waived their rights to receive dividends on the shares.
  The EBT is considered to be a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) where the substance of the relationship between the group and the SPE indicates that 
the SPE is controlled by the group - in substance, the activities of the trust are being conducted on behalf of the group according to its specific 
business needs in order to obtain benefits from its operation. On this basis, the assets held by the trust are consolidated into the group’s 
financial statements.
(x)  Share capital
 Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. 
  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax from  
the proceeds.
  Where the group company purchases the company’s equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly 
incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or 
reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects is included in the equity attributable to the company’s equity. 
2.  Segmental information
  For management purposes the group’s activities are organised into three operating divisions: investment management, financial planning, and 
with the acquisition of Braemar Group Limited on 6 July 2010, niche fund and property management. The group’s other activity, offering 
nominee and custody services to clients, has been included in investment management. These divisions are the basis on which the group 
reports its primary segmental information. There has been no impact on the comparative figures.
  Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction. Revenues and expenses that are not directly 
originated by a business segment are reported as unallocated. Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length. Centrally incurred 
expenses are allocated to business segments on an appropriate pro-rata basis. Segmental assets and liabilities comprise operating assets and 
liabilities, being the majority of the balance sheet.
  In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, disclosures are required to reflect the information which the board uses internally for 
evaluating the performance of its operating segments and allocating resources to those segments. The information presented in this note 
follows the presentation for internal reporting to the group board.

and this amount has been charged to the income statement. 
The group has been advised that a further levy in respect of the 2010/2011 may be made. However, no provision has been set aside for this as the

7. Taxation - continued
The deferred taxation credit of £328,219 (2010: credit of £393,964) represents a credit of £227,114 (2010: credit of £429,833) arising out of the 
share option reserve at the balance sheet date and a credit of £101,105 (2010: charge £35,869) relating to accelerated capital allowances.
From 1 April 2011, the Finance Act 2011 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011. As a result the 
effective rate of corporation tax applicable to the company during the year ended 30 June was 27.5% (2010: 28%). 
The tax rate used in respect the determining the deferred tax assets and liabilities is 26% (2010: 28%).
In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above a number of further changes to the UK Corporation tax system were 
announced in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement. Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012 is 
expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23%  
by 1 April 2014. These further changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore are not included in these 
financial statements.

Current period
On 6 July 2010, Brooks Macdonald Group plc completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Braemar Group plc (BG) at a price of 
2.25p for each ordinary share. The price of 2.25p for each share was determined by the directors using the discounted cash flows of the future 
income of BG and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of BG. BG has two core divisions: Braemar Securities which designs, promotes and 
manages niche structured financial products in the property sector through open ended investment companies and closed end residential funds; 
and Braemar Estates (BE) which manages property assets on behalf of the funds and other clients. At the date of the acquisition the value of the 
funds was approximately £45million and BE managed approximately 3,100 properties in the UK with a combined value of over £500 million.
The acquisition of this range of property funds has enabled the group to strengthen its position in the specialist fund management market. 
Acquisition costs of £400,279 have been expensed in the income statement. 
The total consideration of £4,118,780 of was satisfied by cash of £3,032,977 in respect of 123,868,959 ordinary shares and outstanding share 
options in BG and by the issue of 139,851 new shares in Brooks Macdonald Group plc, with a value of £1,085,803, to the management of BG in 
exchange for their aggregate holding of 48,257,421 ordinary shares. The fair value of the 139,851 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration 
for Braemar Group plc was based on the published market price of £7.764 per share, being the volume weighted average price of Brooks Macdonald 
Group plc shares over the five dealing days prior to the announcement date, 8 June 2010. Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

Provisions for client compensation payments relate to the potential liability resulting from client complaints against the group. The complaints are 
assessed on a case by case basis and provisions for compensation are made where judged necessary. Complaints are on average settled within eight 
months (2010: eight months) from the date of notification of the complaint.
Deferred contingent consideration relates to the funds acquired by Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited from Lawrence House Fund 
Managers Limited (now called Brooks Macdonald Asset Management (Tunbridge Wells) Limited). The final amount payable is dependent on the value 
of the funds acquired after 24 months from the date of acquisition, 4 September 2009, and is therefore classified as a current liability at 30 June 2011.

connection with the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LITS), as detailed below, and for other long term awards to employees. The EBT acquired 86,904 
1p ordinary shares in Brooks Macdonald for a consideration of £980,364. At the balance sheet date the market value of the shares was £1,129,752.

24. Equity settled share based payments
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme 
Under the approved share option scheme, certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the company at prices ranging from 140p to 
775p. Options are conditional on the employee completing a three year’s service (the vesting period) and are exercisable three years from the grant 
date. The options have a contractual option term of seven years from the date they become exercisable. The group has no legal or constructive 
obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Employee Sharesave Scheme 
Under the scheme, employees can contribute up to £250 a month to acquire shares at the end of the three years savings period. At the end of the 
savings period, employees can elect to acquire shares or receive their savings, including interest, in cash.
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) and Employee Benefit Trust
The company has made annual rewards based on certain criteria made under the LTIS to executive directors and senior executives. The conditional 
awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction of specified performance criteria, measured over three year performance 
period. All conditional awards are at the discretion of the remuneration committee.  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

The options granted under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, the EMI Scheme and the Phantom Scheme (note 18) were valued on the basis of 
market prices at the time the options were granted and were calculated using the Black Scholes model with a volatility ranging between 15% and 
49%, on an historic price, covering the period to the end of the contractual life. The expected volatility was estimated on the basis of the share price 
history subsequent to flotation. The risk free interest rate was assessed as the yield on gilt edged security with a maturity term of 10 years.
The options were valued at prices from £1.40 to £9.16 per share. The charge for the period was £311,083 (2010: £251,164). The weighted average 
remaining contractual life of the equity settled scheme for share options at the end of the year was 3.87 years (2010: 3.92 years). The weighted 
average share price at the date of exercise for options exercised during the period was £11.613. The total charge for the equity based schemes and 
phantom schemes was £4,533,084 (2010: £1,507,182). Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

In respect of those equity options granted during the year, the Black Scholes model was used to calculate the fair value of the options. The 
assumptions used were the market price of the share price at the grant date, a volatility of 50%, no dividend yield, an expected option life of three 
years and an annual risk-free interest rate of 2%.
The phantom scheme options use the same assumptions in calculating the fair value but are re-calculated on a quarterly basis.

The group holds client money and assets on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Services Authority and other 
regulatory bodies. Such money and the corresponding liabilities to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the group is not 
beneficially entitled thereto.
28. Financial risk management 
The group has identified the risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures as part of a formal structure for managing 
risk, including established risk lines, reporting lines, mandates and other control procedures. The structure is reviewed regularly. The group does not 
use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
(a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due.
The primary objective of the group’s treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements and to ensure that the group maintains a surplus 
of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met.
The table below presents the cash flows payable by the group under non-derivative financial liabilities together with cash and balances at bank on demand.

Net liquidity gap 14,374,719 (5,596,222) (74,340) (2,209,513) 6,494,644
(b)  Market risk
Interest rate risk 
The group’s cash and short term deposits mature in the short term, no longer than three months. As a result the group is subject to limited exposure 
to fair value interest rate risk due to fluctuations at prevailing levels of market interest rates. Excess cash and cash equivalents of the group are 
invested in short-term cash deposits with the term of maturity no longer than three months.
A 1% fall in the average monthly interest rate obtained by the group’s cash and cash equivalents would reduce interest receivable and profit before 
taxation by £168,000 (2010: £143,000). An increase of 1% would have an equal but opposite effect.
Foreign exchange risk
The group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and therefore no foreign exchange risk analysis is provided.
Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than 
those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk). The group is exposed to a price risk through its holdings of equity securities which are reported 
at fair value (note 13). Given the short term nature of the holding of this asset the group does not consider the price risk to be material.

28. Financial risk management - continued
Credit risk
The group may invest some of its surplus funds in highly liquid market instruments. Such investments have a maturity no greater than three months. 
The difference between the book and the fair value of these instruments is not significant. To reduce the risk of a counterparty default the group 
deposits the rest of its funds in approved high quality banks. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.

29. Capital management 
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves. Total capital at 30 June 2011 was £19,051,127 
(2010: £12,410,068). Regulatory capital is derived from the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which is a requirement of 
the Capital Requirements Directive. The ICAAP draws on the group’s risk management process which is embedded within the individual businesses, 
function heads and executive committees within the group.
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the FSA, to safeguard the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a strong 
capital base to support the development of the business.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the group’s management. 
The 2011 ICAAP was approved in March 2011. There have been no capital requirement breaches during the course of the year.
30. Guarantees and contingent liabilities 
During the year the company entered into a guarantee to the Royal Bank of Scotland plc to guarantee settlement for trading with CREST stock on 
behalf of clients. The company holds client assets to fund such trading activity.
In addition to the Financial Services Compensation scheme levy charged in the year (note 4), further levy charges may be incurred although the 
ultimate cost remains unknown.

is an investment of 1,440,230.43 shares in Braemar PCC Limited Student accommodation cell. This transaction was at market value.
32.  Events since the end of the year 
In August 2011, the company ‘s subsidiary company Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited signed an agreement to purchase the investment 
management activities of a national law firm, Clarke Willmott LLP , based in Taunton, Somerset for an initial consideration of £1.56 million, in cash. The 
transaction is expected to be completed on 31 October 2011 subject to the completion of legal formalities and client communications. 
An additional amount of cash will be payable on completion in two tranches, 12 months and 24 months after completion. The total consideration 
(including the initial payment of £1.56 million) will be based on a maximum of 3.25% in total of the relevant discretionary funds under 
management, split across the respective payment dates. The total consideration will be subject to a maximum of £6 million.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Brooks 
Macdonald Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise 
the Balance Sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set 
out on page 9 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of  
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report and financial statements to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we

33. Principal accounting policies
(a) Basis of accounting
  These financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of listed 
investments and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. The principal 
accounting policies of the company which have been applied consistently throughout the year are set out below:
(b) Investments in subsidiary companies 
 Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions for impairment.
 (c) Share based payments
  The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payments and has adopted the requirements of UITF 44. Equity settled share 
based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the equity settled share based instrument is expensed on a straight line basis over the 
period for which related services are provided based on the number of shares that will eventually vest.
(d) Operating lease payments
  Rents due under operating leases are charged to profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The company 
benefited from a rent-free period under the terms of the current property lease. In accordance with UITF 28 Operating Leases Incentives, the 
benefit is being allocated over the shorter of the lease term and the date of the market review specified in the lease. During the rent-free period 
a rental charge has been recognised in the profit and loss account and accrued as a liability in the balance sheet.
(e) Retirement benefit costs
 Contributions in respect of the group’s defined contribution retirement scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
(f) Employee benefit trust
  Where the company holds its own equity shares through an Employee Benefit Trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any 
consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown as a reduction in the reconciliation of movements in 
shareholders’ funds and no gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains or losses on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of these shares.
(g) Treasury shares 
  Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the 
purchase, issue or cancellation of the company’s own equity instruments. 
(h) Other investments 
 Other investments are listed investments. They are stated at market value.
34. Profit for the year 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the financial 
year. Brooks Macdonald Group plc reported profit after tax for the financial year ended 30 June 2011 of £1,691,998 (2010: profit £1,350,405). 
Auditors’ remuneration for audit and other services to the company are set out in note 4.The average monthly number of employees during the year 
was ten (2010: nine). Directors’ emoluments are set out in note 5 of the group accounts.  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

Explanation of AGM Business
Enclosed with this document is a notice convening the annual general 
meeting of the company for 19 October 2011. This explanatory note 
gives further information on resolutions numbered 2 to 10 set out in the 
notice of AGM.
Resolution 2 – To declare a final dividend
The directors recommend a final dividend of 10 pence per ordinary 
share. Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will  
be paid on 24 October 2011 to shareholders on the register on  
23 September 2011.
Resolutions 3 to 6 – To re-elect certain of the directors
Diane Seymour-Williams has been appointed as an additional director 
since the annual general meeting in 2010 and, accordingly, the 
company’s articles of association requires her to retire from office at this 
annual general meeting and to offer herself for re-election.
In addition, the company’s articles of association state that one third of 
the other directors (or the nearest whole number closest to one third) 
must retire from office at each annual general meeting and offer 
themselves for re-election. In addition, any director who has been in 
office for more than three years since their last appointment or 
re-appointment should also retire and offer themselves for re-election. 
Simon Jackson, Jonathan Gumpel, and Richard Spencer are therefore 
offering themselves for re-election on this basis.
Information on each of the directors standing for re-election is set out 
below. The Chairman confirms that each of the directors offering 
themselves for re-election has extensive relevant experience of the group 
and its business. The board is therefore of the opinion that all such 
persons should be re-elected to the board.
Simon Jackson (52) is responsible for the group’s management accounts. 
In addition to the finance function, Simon has Board responsibility for 
the back office functions of the group with the managers of IT, training 
and personal development and human resources reporting to him. He is 
a Chartered Accountant and joined the Group in 2000 having worked 
for a number of both public and private companies at director level.
Jonathan Gumpel (44) was a founder director of the company in 1991, 
having worked in the industry since 1986. During his career, he has won 
a number of investment management awards and sits on both the Asset 
Management and Group boards. Jonathan is one of the investment 
directors responsible for overseeing investment management strategy 
and asset allocation for Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Ltd
Richard Spencer (48) is the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Brooks 
Macdonald Asset Management where he is responsible for overseeing 
the investment management strategy and asset allocation. Richard is 
also a member of the Group Board as well as a fund manager 
specialising in private client and pension portfolios. Richard joined the 
company in 1991 as a founder director, having worked in the industry 
since 1985
Diane Seymour-Williams (52) has recently been appointed as a 
non-executive director. Diane has had a distinguished career in 
investment management: she spent over twenty years at Morgan 
Grenfell/Deutsche Asset Management and is now an executive director 
of Lloyd George Management and a non-executive director of Calculus 
Capital Limited and of Witan Pacific Investment Trust 
Resolution 7 – To appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  
as auditors
This Resolution proposes that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP should be 
appointed as the company’s auditors and authorises the directors to 
determine their remuneration.
Resolution 8 – Authority to allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 prevents directors from allotting unissued 
shares without the authority of shareholders in general meeting. In 
certain circumstances this could be unduly restrictive. The directors’ 
existing authority to allot shares, which was granted at the annual 
general meeting held in 2010, will expire at the end of this year’s annual 
general meeting.
Resolution 8 in the notice of annual general meeting will be proposed, as 
an ordinary resolution, to authorise the directors to allot ordinary shares of 
1 pence each in the capital of the company up to a maximum nominal 
amount of £35,960 (i.e. up to 3,596,000 ordinary shares) representing 
approximately 33% of the ordinary shares in issue on 21 September 
2011. The company does not currently hold any shares in treasury.
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
is fifteen months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at the 
end of next year’s annual general meeting.
The directors have no present plans to allot unissued shares other than 
on the exercise of share options under the company’s employee share 
option schemes. However, the directors believe it to be in the best 
interests of the company that they should continue to have this 
authority so that such allotments can take place to finance appropriate 
business opportunities that may arise. Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Brooks Macdonald Group plc
58
Resolution 9 – To disapply pre-emption rights
Unless they are given an appropriate authority by shareholders, if the 
directors wish to allot any of the unissued shares for cash or grant rights 
over shares or sell treasury shares for cash (other than pursuant to an 
employee share scheme) they must first offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This is known as 
pre-emption rights.
The existing disapplication of these statutory pre-emption rights, which 
was granted at the annual general meeting held in 2010, will expire at 
the end of this year’s annual general meeting. Accordingly, resolution 9 
in the notice of annual general meeting will be proposed, as a special 
resolution, to give the directors power to allot shares without the 
application of these statutory pre-emption rights: first, in relation to 
offers of equity securities by way of rights issue, open offer or similar 
arrangements; and second, in relation to the allotment of equity 
securities for cash up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of 
£5,390 (i.e. up to 539,000 ordinary shares) (representing approximately 
5% of the ordinary shares in issue on 21 September 2011).
The authority sought and limits set by this resolution will also apply to a 
sale by the company of any shares it holds as treasury shares. The 
Treasury Share Regulations allow shares purchased by the company out 
of distributable profits to be held as treasury shares, which may then be 
cancelled, sold for cash or used to meet the company’s obligations 
under its employee share based incentive schemes. Any subsequent 
transfers of treasury shares by the company to satisfy the requirements 
of employee share-based incentive schemes will be counted towards the 
anti-dilution limits for such share issues to the extent required by the 
Association of British Insurers guidelines.
The power conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
falls fifteen months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at 
the end of next year’s annual general meeting.
Resolution 10 – Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
Resolution 10 in the notice of annual general meeting, which will be 
proposed as a special resolution, will authorise the company to make 
market purchases of up to 1,000,000 ordinary shares. The existing 
authority to make market purchases of ordinary shares, which was 
granted at the annual general meeting held in 2010, will expire at the 
end of this year’s annual general meeting.
The number of ordinary shares stated in this resolution equals 
approximately 10% of the company’s ordinary shares in issue on  
21 September 2011. The minimum price that may be paid is the 
nominal value of an ordinary share (i.e. 1 pence), and the maximum 
price shall not exceed 5% above the average of the middle market 
quotations for an ordinary share for the five business days before each 
purchase is made (exclusive of expenses).
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
falls fifteen months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at 
the end of next year’s annual general meeting.
The directors are committed to managing the company’s capital 
effectively. Although the directors have no plans to make such 
purchases, buying back the company’s ordinary shares is one of the 
options they keep under review. Purchases would only be made after 
considering the effect on earnings per share, and the benefits for 
shareholders generally.
The company may hold in treasury any of its own shares that it purchases 
pursuant to the Treasury Share Regulations and the authority conferred by 
this resolution. This would give the company the ability to re-issue 
treasury shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the 
company with greater flexibility in the management of its capital base.

Directors’ authority to allot shares
To resolve as an ordinary resolution:
8  That the directors be generally and unconditionally authorised 
pursuant to section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”) to 
exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the 
Company and to grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any 
security into, shares in the Company (“Relevant Securities”), up to a 
maximum aggregate nominal amount of £35,960, for a period 
expiring (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) on the date 
which is fifteen months after the passing of this resolution or, if 
sooner, the end of the next annual general meeting of the 
Company. However, in each case the Company may, before such 
expiry, make an offer or agreement which would or might require 
Relevant Securities to be allotted after this authority expires and the 
directors may allot Relevant Securities in pursuance of such offer or 
agreement as if this authority had not expired.
 
 All previous unutilised authorities given to the directors pursuant to 
section 551 of the Act shall cease to have effect at the conclusion of the 
annual general meeting, save to the extent that those authorities are 
exercisable pursuant to section 551(7) of the Act by reason of any offer 
or agreement made prior to the date of this resolution which would or 
might require shares to be allotted or rights to be granted on or after 
that date.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
To resolve as a special resolution:
9  That, subject to the passing of resolution 8 above, the directors be 
generally empowered pursuant to sections 570 and 573 of the Act 
to allot equity securities (within the meaning of section 560 of the 
Act) for cash, pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 8, 
as if section 561 of the Act did not apply to such allotment, 
provided that this power shall expire on the date which is fifteen 
months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, the end of 
the next annual general meeting of the Company. This power shall 
be limited to the allotment of equity securities:
 9.1  in connection with an offer of equity securities (including, without 
limitation, under a rights issue, open offer or similar arrangement) 
in favour of holders of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the 
Company in proportion (as nearly as may be practicable) to their 
existing holdings of Ordinary Shares but subject to such exclusions 
or other arrangements as the directors deem necessary or 
expedient in relation to fractional entitlements or any legal, 
regulatory or practical problems under the laws of any territory, or 
the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange; and 
9.2  otherwise than pursuant to paragraph 9.1 up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £5,390;
  but the Company may, before such expiry, make an offer or 
agreement which would or might require equity securities to be 
allotted after this power expires and the directors may allot equity 
securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if this power 
had not expired.

equity securities by virtue of section 560(2)(b) of the Act as if in the first 
paragraph of this resolution the words “pursuant to the authority 
conferred by resolution 8” were omitted.
  All previous unutilised powers given to the directors pursuant to 
sections 570 and 573 of the Act shall cease to have effect at the 
conclusion of this annual general meeting.
Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
To resolve as a special resolution:
10  That the Company be generally authorised pursuant to section 701 
of the Act to make market purchases (within the meaning of section 
693(4) of the Act) of its Ordinary Shares of £0.01 each on such 
terms and in such manner as the directors shall determine, 
provided that:
10.1  the maximum number of Ordinary Shares hereby authorised to be 
purchased is 1,000,000;
10.2  the maximum price which may be paid for each Ordinary Share 
shall be 5% above the average of the middle market quotations 
for an Ordinary Share (as derived from The Stock Exchange Daily 
Official List) for the five business days immediately before the day 
on which the purchase is made (in each case exclusive of 
expenses);
10.3  the minimum price which may be paid for each Ordinary Share 
shall be £0.01; and
10.4  this authority (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) shall 
expire on the date which is fifteen months after the passing of this 
resolution or, if sooner, the end of the next annual general meeting

from attending the annual general meeting and voting in person if 
he or she wishes to do so.
Record date
5  In accordance with Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Act 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the annual general 
meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the 
Company of the votes they may cast), members must be registered 
in the register of members of the Company at 6.00 p.m. on 
Monday 17 October 2011 (or, in the event of any adjournment,  
48 hours before the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to 
the register of members after the relevant deadline will be 
disregarded in determining the right of any person to attend and

corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to 
the same shares.
Other rights of members
7  Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. 
The Company must cause to be answered any such question 
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no 
such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly 
with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of 
confidential information, (b) the answer has already been given on 
a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is 
undesirable in the interests of the company or the good order of 
the meeting that the question be answered.

Notes:
Your rights to appoint a proxy
1   As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend and to speak and vote at a meeting of the Company. A proxy does not need to 
be a member of the Company. You may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by you.
2   You may appoint a proxy in respect of all or some only of the shares held by you. If you do not want to appoint a proxy in respect of all of the shares held by you, delete the word “all” in 
square brackets and insert the number of shares in respect of which you wish to appoint your proxy in the box provided. If you sign and return this proxy form with no number inserted, you 
will be deemed to have appointed your proxy in respect of all of the shares held by you.
3   If you require additional proxy forms in order to appoint more than one proxy, please contact the Company’s registrar, Capita Registrars Limited, or you may copy this form. Please indicate by 
ticking the box provided if the proxy appointment is one of multiple appointments being made. You must also indicate in the separate box the number of shares in relation to which the proxy 
holder is authorised to act as your proxy. All proxy forms must be signed and should, wherever possible, be returned together in one envelope.
4  If you appoint a proxy, this does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person.
Procedure for appointing a proxy
5  Please insert your full name and address in block capitals in the box.
6   To appoint as your proxy a person other than the chairman of the meeting, delete the words in square brackets and insert the full name and address of your chosen proxy in block capitals in 
the box. If you sign and return this proxy form with no name inserted in the box, the chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be your proxy. Where you appoint as your proxy someone 
other than the chairman of the meeting, it is your responsibility to ensure that that person attends the meeting and is aware of your voting intentions. If you wish your proxy to make any 
comments on your behalf, you will need to appoint someone other than the chairman of the meeting and give that person your directions.
Directing your proxy how to vote
7   To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box with a “ ✔”or an “X”. If no voting direction is given, your proxy can vote or abstain from voting as he or she 
chooses. Your proxy has the right to vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she chooses in relation to any other business (including a resolution to adjourn the meeting or to amend a 
resolution) which may properly come before the meeting.
8    The “vote withheld” option is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. However, it should be noted that a “vote withheld” is not a vote in law and will not be counted 
in the calculation of the proportion of the votes “for” and “against” a resolution.
Other

10   In the case of joint holders of any share, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy in respect of the same share, only the appointment submitted by the person 
whose name stands first in the register as one of the joint holders will be accepted.
11   This proxy form must be signed and dated by the member or his or her attorney duly authorised in writing. In the case of a member which is a company, this proxy form must be executed 
under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or other authority under which this proxy form is signed, or 
a copy of such power or authority, must be included with the proxy form.

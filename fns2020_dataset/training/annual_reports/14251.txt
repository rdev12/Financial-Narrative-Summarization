What we do
The Group has a proven track record within
the construction sectors for the majority 
of major contractors working on small 
and large scale works. We operate in
commercial, retail, financial and property
sectors providing both asbestos and
enabling solutions.
The Group has a proven track record in 
the nuclear industry, currently operating 
a primary decommissioning project at
Chapelcross for scaffolding and asbestos
and a three year framework at Dounreay
secured in 2008. Works at other sites 
have also been undertaken as part of the
decommissioning agenda driven by the
Government; with Redhill Analysts
successfully entering the market with
consultancy works provided at two sites.
Solutions in housing maintenance as part
of the Government ʼs Decent Homes 
initiative have featured strongly - particularly
in relation to asbestos management and
removal. Works in the education sectors
continue and our links with public sector
authorities provide an excellent platform for
growth. Our organisation features strongly
within health with two of the largest projects
in the UK secured. We support some major
defence contracts as part of continued
capital improvements to their infrastructure.
Power Generation

Construction and
Refurbishment
Our scaffolding and access solutions support
maintenance contracts and redevelopment
projects on industrial infrastructure and
commercial buildings. Our insulation
solutions for lagging and storage tanks
provide the environmental link to improve
efficiency, reduce energy costs and increase
the life of plant, and have been installed in
many refineries in the UK.
Our consultancy division have developed
from asbestos management to include
wider compliance support solutions.
Remediation and waste stream solutions
have been developed to create a wider

3 Report and Accounts 2008
Trading in the first two months of the current
financial year has been satisfactory and we
are confident of our prospects and see
plenty of potential ahead for the further
development of our company.
Results
For the year ended 30 September 2008, our Company
achieved turnover of £61.4m compared with £38.5m in
the previous year. Pre tax profits reduced from £1.4m in
the previous year to a loss of £16.8m and basic loss per
share was (37.2)p compared with 2.1p of earnings in
the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share, stripping
out amortisation of intangible assets, intangibles
impairment, share-based payment charges, finance
charges on deferred consideration and non-recurring
expenses, was 0.6p (2007: 7.7p). 
As with last year your Directors do not recommend the
payment of a dividend. 
The loss is mainly caused by a material impairment of
the goodwill value of acquisitions. In light of the current
economic environment, where acquisition multiples have
diminished, it was deemed prudent to reduce the
carrying value of these acquisitions. This has no cash
impact on the Group; it merely places a more prudent
valuation on its subsidiaries. The performance of the
acquisitions has in fact been good; it has been Silverdell
(UK), the original business, where results have
disappointed.
The Board and management
Following a disappointing first half, your Directors made
a number of changes to ensure that the prospects for
the business can be maximised. Management changes
have included Danny Spicer moving from the lc board
to become Chairman of Silverdell (UK), where we retain
the benefit of Danny’s customer relations and experience. 
Chris Sims also stood down as Finance Director with
effect from 22 October 2008. Sean Nutley was
promoted to the Chief Executive role on the 22 October
2008 and an interim Group Finance Director recruited.
In addition, the Group’s subsidiary management
structure was strengthened with several new
appointments and the benefits of these changes 
should be evident in due course. 
During the year a number of acquisition opportunities
were reviewed. We were close to making a substantial
acquisition but market conditions deteriorated causing
the Directors to reconsider its merits. Our profits have
been affected by the costs incurred, although our
decision not to proceed proved to be prudent. 
Given all these changes, I particularly wish to thank our
staff for all their efforts during this period. It goes without
saying that we also appreciate the loyalty and support of
our customers.
P
Financing
As at 30 September 2008, debt of £11.2m (2007:
£7.4m) is long term and is expected to mature in 2011.
In addition the Group has short term borrowings of
£3.2m comprising primarily of bank overdrafts and 
loans of £2.8m. Subsequent to the year end, the 
Group concluded its discussions with Barclays Bank to
restructure its existing facilities, which includes a short
term loan of £3.25m due for repayment at 30 June
2009. These restructured facilities combined with the
planned intention to raise additional finance by way 
of equity placing, which certain shareholder’s have led
the Group to believe will be achievable, will provide
sufficient resources, based on projected trading, to allow
the Group to meet is liabilities as they fall due (please
refer to Note 2).   
The Directors, in their consideration of going concern,
have reviewed the Group’s revenue and cash
projections, which they believe are based on prudent
market data and past experience and believe, based on
those forecasts and projections, that it is appropriate to
prepare the financial statements of the Group on the
going concern basis. 
David Williams
Non-Executive Chairman
81733 PRE:81733 PRE  28/3/09  11:57  Page 3 4 Silverdell Plc
My appointment as Chief Executive Officer has come 
at a time when market conditions have become
increasingly challenging and competitive, which have
impacted this year’s trading performance. I concur with
the Chairman’s comments that 2008 was a difficult year
and re-iterate the belief that the changes made put the
Company in a much stronger position.
Despite this, the Group has an excellent track record
working with a wide range of clients in diverse markets.
These range from construction, rail, public sector, retail,
industrial, nuclear, defence, health and education.
We are committed to developing our strategic focus 
to embrace the growth opportunities within the
environmental sector (both the consultancy and
contracting), to develop our presence in the industrial
sector and to penetrate waste and remediation 
markets further.
Silverdell (UK), Redhill Analysts and Kitsons all have 
a strong presence in their respective markets and
locations. We have continued to develop the number 
of framework contracts we manage to improve the
forward order book. In addition, we remain committed 
to excellence on site to reinforce our status as preferred
contractor among existing clients. New service offerings
have been identified as part of our market and product
development strategies which will further improve the
positioning of the Group.
We will continue to develop each of the businesses
organically. This will be achieved through a balanced
exposure to both public sector and commercial markets
designed to respond to both changing markets and the
economic environment. To deliver this strategy, we will:
■ ensure we work collaboratively with our clients 
so that the quality of service delivery always 
meets expectations
■ develop each business through profitable and
secure income streams;
■ attract, develop and retain employees who add
value to our skills base and service offering; and
■ generate cash to develop our business and improve
gearing levels.
The role of the Board will be to implement our strategy,
ensure the right leadership is in place to deliver agreed
business plans and monitor performance against set
targets. Certain functions will be co-ordinated centrally
including finance, information systems, health and
safety and sales and marketing as we continue to evolve
as a Group in the forthcoming year. We have further
strengthened our management team in respect of
environmental and remediation expertise to realise 
new opportunities through vertical market integration. 
The Chairman’s statement refers to the current financing
position of the Group. From an operational perspective,
the aim for the forthcoming year is to build on the
healthy forward order book, despite an environment 
of economic uncertainty. We have started the new
trading year with confidence and, operationally, are 
well positioned to take advantage of the challenges 
and opportunities during the year.

award winning project
5 Report and Accounts 2008
The Group has developed into a leading environmental
services and regeneration organisation from its origins 
in asbestos and licensed waste. This has been achieved
through both acquisitions and organic growth in key
market sectors, including health, education, transport
retail, construction, industrial, defence, power and
petrochemical.
Our values
The Group’s success is based on a culture of working
collaboratively with clients  and an ability to deliver a
diverse range of solutions consistently. We believe in
building teams to deliver an unrivalled experience,
working closely with clients, partners, stakeholders and
communities to ensure that practical and cost effective
solutions are delivered.
Our people
Our people are our most important asset and our aim 
is to create: 
■ a clear and demonstrable culture where people,
both the Group’s staff and its customers count;
■ an environment which encourages teamwork, 
trust, respect and honesty;
■ an expectation of both innovation and a passion 
for excellence; and
■ an atmosphere of energy and dynamism.
We are proud of what our people have achieved,
passionate about the projects we undertake and 
highly committed to making a positive difference 
in each area of our work. Our expertise is based 
on improving efficiency, effective planning and
communication and we strive to reduce wasted
resources in all aspects of our work, from management
to design and production.
Our SAFE training unit is unique, developed to equip
our staff and those of our supply partners with superior
technical and soft skills such as project, environmental
and customer relations management, thereby ensuring
consistent solutions are delivered.
Working safely
Our award winning systems are accredited to
Occupational Health and Advisory Services (OHSAS):
18001 standards and are designed to protect our
employees and those living and working in close
proximity to our works. Safer systems are more efficient
and cost effective, helping us to reduce defects and
improve productivity. We achieved two Royal Society for
the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Gold Awards and 
1 Silver RoSPA Award in 2008.
Quality assured solutions
The Group provides services which meet the 
most demanding accreditation criteria including 
ISO: 9001:2000, 14001, 18001, ISO: 17025, ISO: 17020
and United Kingdom Accreditation Services (UKAS),
recognised internationally. Our stringent auditing
systems are designed to ensure the agreed milestones
are achieved first time and without compromise.
Review of activities
We provide solutions to the rail industry;
both trackside and for station refurbishments
81733 PRE:81733 PRE  30/3/09  14:19  Page 5 6 Silverdell Plc
Review of activities continued
Cutting edge innovation
We invest to develop new solutions that lead the way 
in technological advancement. Our visual method
statements were an industry first and raised safety
standards to new levels. CCTV infrastructure in asbestos
enclosures has been revolutionary in monitoring quality,
reducing risk and assisting regulatory bodies through
remote viewing of works in contaminated environments.
This concept has been subsequently adopted by the
HSE as an industry standard.
Working collaboratively through partnership
We place significant emphasis on  building relationships
with clients, partners and stakeholders based on trust,
commitment and open communication.
We are open and structured in our approach to each
project, framework or partnering agreement and are
highly committed to ensure the objectives set are
achieved ensuring that high levels of service are
consistently delivered.
Corporate Social Responsibility
We recognise the fact that our employees, customers,
suppliers and other stakeholders may contribute towards
developing a sustainable business which has a positive
impact on the environment in which we work and live.
Our commitment to this philosophy is exemplified by,
among other things, compliance with current legislation,
investment in community initiatives where we work,
engaging supply chain partners to drive best practice
forward and managing our environmental footprint.  
Key risks
The identification, assessment, pursuit and
management of opportunities and the associated risks is
an integral and inseparable part of management skills
and processes. The following highlights the key business
risks, and how they are addressed.
Market related risks
We are affected by general macro economic conditions
and government spending priorities.
We monitor the forward order books of each business,
deploying the appropriate resources to secure works
through both formal and informal sources whilst leveraging
additional work from our existing client base.
Regulatory risks
There is continuous change to the regulatory
environment in which we trade and operate and we 
are fully committed to remaining  compliant, thereby
avoiding both financial penalties and associated
reputational damage, as a result of non-conformity.
Contract related risks
As a Group, we undertake hundreds of projects each
year and the commercial risk of each is dependent 
on the nature and complexity of the works. We are
committed to evaluating each contract opportunity
carefully to ensure our capabilities and resource
planning are appropriate to meet all deliverables.
Financial risks
The key financial risks facing the Group are discussed 
in detail in the Directors’ Report on page 13.
People risks
The retention and recruitment of staff for an organisation
that is continually growing is a challenge faced by the
Group and the industries in which it operates. The
Group utilises a range of recruitment processes relevant
to its specific labour markets. In addition remuneration
and incentive policies and programmes are designed 
to be market competitive and while locally determined,
are centrally co-ordinated.

Redhill Analysts is renowned as one of the leading 
asbestos consultancies in the UK, which continues to 
develop a wider environmental service offering to cover
compliance and energy management. We work with 
an extensive portfolio of clients, all of whom have
responsibility for estate and property management.
Surveys, asbestos management strategies, project
management and testing are the key asbestos related
services offered. Environmental management, energy,
carbon, geotechnical and remediation solutions have
been developed to augment these and to cater to the
wider environmental and waste management markets.
Our IT based compliance management systems have

of our vertical integration strategy.
Retail
We act as the favoured consultant to a number of 
blue chip high street retail chains, providing project
management and analytical services to ensure 
full regulatory compliance in respect of their
refurbishment and remodelling projects.
Utilities and energy

Geotechnical remediation
We address the legacy issues of buildings and
brownfield sites by providing practical solutions 
to decommissioning, remediation design and the
delivery of waste management solutions. These 
include encapsulation to state of the art process
treatment including bioremediation, vacuum extraction
and soil washing.  We offer intrusive contaminated 
land surveying, remediation and geotechnical services
and quantitative risk assessments on a cost effective
and practical basis with single source accountability.
Liability transfer
The liability transfer concept has a long track record 
in releasing corporations from historic environmental
liabilities and is now a mainstream solution.  We focus
on the transfer of liability without relinquishing control 
of an asset, giving clients certainty as part of their
environmental asset cost planning, supporting their
divestment programmes and providing a means of
removing liabilities from the balance sheet. 
SAFE COMPLIANCE TRAINING
Responding to the growing demands of the asbestos
industry to raise its standards, Silverdell (UK) has
developed SAFE, a well structured, thorough and
exhaustive training programme that all of its operatives
and supervisors are required to attend.
Silverdell’s mobile training suite (SAFE) provides the
ability to deliver site-based training in a working
environment. Our clients can also therefore receive 
the same level of compliance training on-site as a part 
of the service we offer.  We deliver asbestos awareness
training to those wishing to comply with Regulation 10 
of the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 (CAR 2006)
and are currently under consideration for accreditation
by City and Guilds as the first modular unit for asbestos

Directors’ report
The Directors present their annual report on the affairs of the Group, together with the financial statements and auditors’ report for the year
ended 30 September 2008.
Principal activities
Silverdell Plc is the parent company of a Group of companies providing asbestos, industrial and environmental solutions from consulting 
and contracting perspectives. The principal subsidiaries are shown in note 34 to the accounts.
Business review
The Group reported a loss for the year; which reflects a number of special, non-recurring items, including a goodwill impairment loss of
£14.7m, resulting from more challenging market conditions. The 2008 reported loss was £16.6m (2007: profit of £0.8m). The loss per 
share was 37.2p (2007: earnings per share of 2.1p). The adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-recurring items, impairments and
amortisation, was 0.6p (2007: 7.7p). As explained in the Chairman’s Statement on page 3, these results are disappointing and have led 
to changes in the structure and management of the Group explained in that Statement.
Group revenue for the year increased by 59% to £61.4m (2007: £38.5m). The increase reflects the full year effect of Redhill Analysts
Limited and Kitsons Environmental Europe Limited, which were acquired in the prior year, together with growth of 12% in the revenue 
of Silverdell (UK) Limited. Due to challenging market conditions, the Group’s gross profit margin reduced from 36% to 24%.
Administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment, intangibles amortisation, share-based payments and non-recurring costs, increased
by 40% to £12.9m (2007: £9.2m), representing 21% of Group revenue (2007: 24%). Non-recurring costs of £0.5m (2007: £Nil) arose from
abortive acquisitions and the renegotiation of the Group’s banking facilities.
The Group produced a cash outflow from operating activities of £1.4m (2007: inflow of £2.3m), and spent £3.5m (2007: £11.6m) on
investing activities, principally the payment of consideration for current year acquisitions. New funds from bank loans of £4.2m (2007:
£9.0m) were drawn down during the year and loan repayments of £1.1m (2007: £Nil) were made. The resulting net decrease in cash and
cash equivalents was £1.8m (2007: decrease of £1.4m).
The Group’s financial gearing ratio, calculated as the ratio of net debt to total capital, was 43% at 30 September 2008 (2007: 20%).  
The Group’s debtor days for amounts due from customers at 30 September 2008 was 66 days (2007: 82 days). Subsequent to the year 
end the Group agreed revised borrowing terms (see Note 2). 
Despite the challenging market conditions being faced at present, the Directors consider that the Group is well placed in terms of its 
position in the environmental sector to capitalise on future opportunities.
Key performance indicators
The principal key performance indicator monitored by the Board is “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is defined as earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation, amortisation, share based payment charge and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA for 2008 was £2,501,000 
(2007: £5,058,000), reflecting an operating loss of £15,883,000 (2007: profit of £2,201,000) adjusted for the add back of depreciation
£848,000 (2007: £556,000), amortisation and impairment charges of £16,804,000 (2007: £2,130,000), share based payment charge 
of £212,000 (2007: £171,000) and non-recurring expenses of £520,000 (2007: £Nil).
Results and dividends
The financial results of the Group for the year are set out on page 18. The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend 
(2007: £nil ).

Charitable donations
During the year, the Group made charitable donations of £14,645 (2007: £7,752). There were no political contributions (2007: £nil).
Disabled employees
The Group makes every reasonable effort to provide opportunities for work, training, and career development for disabled applicants and
employees who become disabled, commensurate with their abilities. In the recruitment and subsequent career development of employees,
consideration is given only to individuals’ aptitudes and abilities irrespective of race, gender, marital status or disability.
Employee involvement
By means of formal announcements and informal discussions, the Group has a policy of keeping employees informed of all matters that
concern them so that employees’ views can be taken into account when making decisions that affect their interests.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors, which were made during the year and
remain in force at the date of this report.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy concerning payment of suppliers is either to agree terms of payment at the start of business with each supplier or to
ensure that the supplier is made aware of the Group’s standard payment terms and in either case to pay in accordance with its contractual
or other obligations. The average number of days credit taken at 30 September 2008 was 43 days (2007: 52 days).
Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the Group’s activities are credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. The policies for managing each of these risks
are summarised below.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, trade and other receivables and amounts receivable from clients under contracts.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and contract receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are approved financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and bank borrowings. The Group borrows only in sterling, at both fixed and
floating rates of interest to meet short term funding requirements and for financing acquisitions.
At the year end the Group had finance leases/hire purchase agreements at fixed interest rates, and a bank overdraft at floating interest
rates. The long term bank loans were at both a rate fixed by an interest rate swap, and at floating rate. The Group’s policy is to review
interest rate risks regularly in relation to their materiality compared to other operational risks.

Liquidity risk management and going concern
The Group closely monitors, and has a number of treasury policies to manage, its liquidity risk. Cash forecasts identifying the Group’s
liquidity requirements are produced regularly. The Group seeks to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists.  The short term flexibility
required to address liquidity risk is achieved by overdraft facilities.
As at 30 September 2008, debt of £11.2m (2007: £7.4m) is long term and is expected to mature in 2011. In addition the Group has short
term borrowings of £3.2m comprising primarily of bank overdrafts and loans of £2.8m. (Please refer to Note 21). The Group obtained a
waiver for the period under review from its lenders in respect of testing of the financial covenants contained within its borrowing agreements
as at 30 September 2008. In addition, as a consequence of the economic climate a breach of the Group’s covenants is possible, when
tested for each of the relevant quarters for the year ended 30 September 2009. 
Subsequent to the year end, the Group has concluded its discussions with the relevant lenders for the amendment of terms included within
its borrowing agreements. As part of the amendments to the borrowing agreements a bridging facility of £3m has been provided and is due
for repayment on 30 June 2009. This facility will be repaid from the proceeds of an equity placing planned in 2009. (Please refer to note 2).  
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not have significant exposure to foreign currency risk.

81733 PRE:81733 PRE  28/3/09  11:57  Page 15 The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS Regulation
to prepare the Group financial statements under IFRSs (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The Group financial statements are also
required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the company’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International
Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. Directors are also required to:
■ properly select and apply accounting policies;
■ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and 
■ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent company financial statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
■ make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
■ state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements; and
■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent Auditors’ report
to the members of Silverdell PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Silverdell PLC for the year ended 30 September 2008 which comprise the Consolidated
Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 32. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Silverdell Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2008. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, and have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is
consistent with the Group financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Director’s remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited Group financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the
Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the Group financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of
the Group’s affairs as at 30 September 2008 and of its loss for the year then ended;
■ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; 
■ the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – going concern
In forming our opinion on the financial statements which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of disclosures made in Note 2
to the financial statements concerning the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern.
The Group is likely to breach its covenants, in the absence of any mitigating plans, when tested for the relevant quarters in the period ended
30 September 2009. If such a covenant breach were to occur the lenders would be able to request early repayment of all outstanding
borrowings and cancel their commitments. Subsequent to the year end, the Group concluded discussions with its lenders which resulted in
a £3.25m bridging facility being provided and due for repayment on 30 June 2009. These conditions, along with other matters as set out in
Note 2 to the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to
continue as a going concern.

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement

81733 PRE:81733 PRE  28/3/09  11:57  Page 20 1. General information
Silverdell Group plc is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered office 
is given on page 12. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 13.
2. Basis of preparation
The annual consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared for the first time in accordance with International
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), (IFRS as adopted by the EU), International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” has been applied. The Group’s transition date for
the adoption of IFRS 1 is 1 October 2006. The Group is required to establish its IFRS Accounting Policies for the year ended
30 September 2008 and apply these retrospectively to determine its IFRS balance sheet at the transition date of 1 October 2006 
and the comparative information for the year ended 30 September 2007. Hence the financial statements have been prepared 
using accounting policies which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position and financial performance of the Group is
provided in Note 32. There has been no impact on the Group cash flows.
Going concern 
As at 30 September 2008, debt of £11.2m (2007: £7.4m) is long term and is expected to mature in 2011.  In addition the Group 
has short term borrowings of £3.2m comprising primarily of bank overdrafts and loans of £2.8m (see note 21).  
The Group obtained a waiver for the period under review from its lenders in respect of testing of the financial covenants contained
within its facilities agreement for year ended 30 September 2008. Subsequent to the year end the Group has obtained further 
waivers from its lenders in respect of testing of the financial covenant and has agreed revised facilities with its lenders, including 
the re-structuring of existing facilities, re-profiled repayments and revised covenants. As part of these restructured facilities a short
term facility of £3.25m has been provided, which is due for repayment on 30 June 2009. This facility will be repaid from the
proceeds of a planned equity placing in 2009, which certain shareholders have led the Group to believe will be achievable. 
If the Group does not undertake the equity placing, and in the absence of other funding alternatives, the Group would be unable 
to repay the short term facility. As a result there exists an uncertainty that casts significant doubt about the ability of the Group 
and Company to continue as a going concern such that the Group could be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities 
in the normal course of business. Accordingly, assets may be realised at significantly less than book value and additional liabilities
may arise.
Based on the Group raising additional equity finance in 2009 and the projected trading for the Group, the directors’ have a
reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, these
financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the going concern basis of preparation is inappropriate.
3. Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” which is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendments to “Presentation of Financial Statements”.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial
statements regarding the Group’s financial instruments and management of capital (see Note 21).
Two Interpretations issued by IFRIC are effective for the current period. These are:
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment; and
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions
The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any material changes in the Group’s accounting policies.

on the financial statements of the Group.
3.1 Accounting policies 
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs). The consolidated financial information has also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European
Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain
financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
IFRS 1 permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS
accounting policies. Described below are the applicable instances where the Group has not opted for these exemptions:
(a) Business combinations: The Group has chosen to restate business combinations that occurred prior to 1 October 2006 
to comply with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. As a result that carrying value of goodwill recorded under UK GAAP as 
at 1 October 2006 has been amended at transition date.
(b) Financial instruments: The Group has applied IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 October 2006.
In accordance with IFRS 1 the Group has not revised estimates required under IFRS that were also required under UK GAAP
as at 31 September 2006 and 2007, and, in addition where estimates were not required under UK GAAP, they have been
based on information known at that time, and not on subsequent events.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 30 September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line
with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and 
is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed
for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of
each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Profit is recognised on long-term contracts if the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty by including in the
income statement revenue and related costs as contract activity progresses. Revenue is calculated by reference to the value 
of work performed to date as a proportion of total contract value.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. 
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are
apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
23 Report and Accounts 2008
81733 ACCOUNTS:81733 accounts  28/3/09  11:58  Page 23 3.1 Accounting policies (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and assets under construction, over
their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Leasehold property 10% on cost
Plant and machinery 10% on cost
Office equipment 16.6%-25% on cost
Motor vehicles 25% on reducing balance
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to
which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there
is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an
expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated 
as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued
amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories and work in progress
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, 
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Work in progress on service contracts is stated at cost plus, where the outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty,
estimated profits attributable to the stage of completion less provision for any expected losses and progress payments received
on account. Amounts recoverable on long term service contracts, which are included in trade and other receivables, are stated 
at the net sales value of the work done less progress payments received on account. Excess progress payments are included on
trade and other payables. Cumulative costs incurred, less amounts transferred to cost of sales, less provision for contingencies
and expected future losses on service contracts, are included as long-term service contract balances in inventories
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

81733 ACCOUNTS:81733 accounts  28/3/09  11:58  Page 24 3.1 Accounting policies (continued)
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts
are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of 
its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit
or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in interest rates. The Group uses interest rate swap
contracts to hedge this exposure. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of Directors, which provide written
principles on the use of financial derivatives. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows 
are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow
hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the
asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity 
are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or 
a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item
affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the
income statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is
retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based 
vesting conditions.
25 Report and Accounts 2008
81733 ACCOUNTS:81733 accounts  28/3/09  11:58  Page 25 3.1 Accounting policies (continued)
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Intangible assets
Customer relationships
Customer relationships are measured as the present value of cash flows attributable to the relationship after deduction of
appropriate contributory assets charged. The relationship is amortised over its expected useful life, typically 3 years.
Order book
Order book is the value of confirmed orders on the date of acquisition after appropriate costs have been deducted. The order
book is amortised over the period in which it is expected to unwind.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the amount of income and revenue recognised in the period.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below. 
Revenue and profit/margin recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition, turnover and long term contracts policies are set out in the notes above. Management exercises
judgement to estimate the total expected contract costs and determine the percentage of completion in order to recognise the
appropriate revenue and profit in the period. The assessment of profitability and recognition is assessed on an ongoing basis, 
which ensures adequate controls are in place that appropriate amounts are calculated.
Recognition and measurement of intangible assets under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’
In order to determine the value of the separately identifiable intangible assets on the acquisition of a business combination,
management are required to make estimates on secured customer contracts, other contracts and customer relationships and goodwill.
The Group engaged outside independent parties to perform these calculations and determine the fair value and estimated useful lives
of these assets.
Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration relating to acquisitions has been included based on management estimates of the most likely outcome, as set
out in Note 23.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the
cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Note 12 details the assumptions that have been
applied for goodwill.
5. Segmental information
Management consider that the Group comprises two segments – asbestos remediation and consultancy services.

The tax rate used for 2008 is the corporate tax rate of 30% until April when the tax rate changed to 28% (2007: 30%) payable by
corporate entities in United Kingdom on taxable profits under tax law in that jurisdiction. 
The Group incurs its (loss)/earns its profits primarily in the UK. Therefore the tax rate used for (loss)/profit on ordinary activities is the
standard rate for UK corporation tax. The weighted average standard rate for 2008 was 29% (2007: 30%).
The Group’s planned level of capital investment is expected to remain at similar levels of investment. Therefore, it expects to be able 
to claim allowances in excess of depreciation in future years, at a similar level to the current year.
There were no unrecognised deferred tax assets.

Non recurring items, impairments and amortisation are shown separately on the face of the income statement in order to reflect the
Group’s underlying financial performance. The items comprise the following:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Goodwill impairment (14,653) –
Amortisation of intangible assets (2,151) (2,130)
Non-recurring expenses (520) –
(17,324) (2,130)
Related income tax credit – –
Impact on post tax loss (17,324) (2,130)
The goodwill impairment loss is explained in Note 13. Non-recurring expenses comprise abortive acquisition costs and costs
associated with the renegotiation of the Group’s banking facilities.
12. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares during the year, determined in accordance with the provisions of IAS 33 “Earnings per share”.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being share
options granted where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributed to ordinary shareholders, before intangible assets
amortisation, share-based payment charges, non-recurring expenses and finance charges on deferred consideration, by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares during the year.

Asbestos remediation 15,690 30,742
Consultancy services 5,286 6,385
20,976 37,127
The Group tests goodwill bi-annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing to cash generating units (CGU) which reflects how it is monitored for internal management
purposes. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in
use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period. Management estimates discount rates using
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs, equivalent to a
real post tax discount rate which average 8.5% (2007: 7.5%). The discount rate has been determined on the basis of the current rate
of debt borrowings. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three
years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on an estimated annual growth rate of 2.4%. The rates do not exceed
the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. The rates used to discount the cash flows in both 2007 and 2008 for all
CGUs have been based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.  
At 30 September 2008, before impairment testing goodwill was allocated to the Kitsons Environmental Europe Limited (“Kitsons”),
Silverdell (UK) Limited (“Silverdell UK”) and Redhill Analysis Limited (“Redhill”) CGUs. In the light of challenging market conditions,
the Group has revised its cashflow forecasts for these CGUs. 
The goodwill relating to these CGUs has therefore been reduced to its recoverable amount by recognising impairment losses as follows:

The average credit period taken on sales is 66 days (2007: 82 days). The Group has different provision policies for its various divisions
which have been determined by references to past default experience and specific provisions are raised after taking an individual view
to debts recoverability. 
Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, it is normal practice for customers to hold retentions in respect to contracts completed.
Retentions held by customers as at 30 September 2008 were £904,000 (2007: £390,000).
The Group’s exposure to credit risk and impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are disclosed in Note 21.
Under the normal course of the business, the Group does not charge interest on its overdue receivables.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Further information on the principal features of the Group’s borrowings is set out in Note 21.
The Group‘s bank overdraft and loan facilities are secured by debentures over the assets of the Group. Hire purchase liabilities are
secured on the assets to which the contracts relate.
The bank loan is at both fixed and variable rates of interest. £3,750,000 is subject to an interest rate swap; the amount amortises 
by £250,000 per quarter and the rate on the amortised amount is fixed at 5.8%. The remainder of the loan is at a variable rate over
LIBOR. The overdraft is at variable rate over Bank base rate. The debentures agreement includes a fixed and floating charge over the
assets of the Group. The finance leases are at variable rates of interest. The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate facilities 
is 5.8% for a weighted average period of 4 years. No interest is payable on the deferred consideration.
The Group had the following committed undrawn borrowing facilities at 30 September 2008:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Expiry date
In one year or less 1,152 8,000
As at 30 September 2008, the Group had an undrawn committed revolving credit facility of £1,152,000 (2007: £6,000,000) and an
overdraft facility of £Nil (2007: £2,000,000), all of which expires within one year.
The Group obtained a waiver for the period under review from its lenders in respect of the testing of the financial covenants contained
within its borrowing agreements as at 30 September 2008. Subsequent to the year end, the Group concluded its discussions with
lenders for the amendment of its borrowing agreements (please refer to Note 2).  
21. Financial instruments
(a) Financial Risk Management 
All companies are exposed to capital and market risk, but the Board considers the Group’s key elements of financial risk to be: 
■ Credit risk
■ Foreign currency risk 
■ Liquidity risk
■ Interest rate risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s management of capital, and the
Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. Please refer also to the principal business risks in the
Directors’ report on pages 13 to 15.

Capital risk management
The Board is responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects
and consideration of significant financing matters. The Board manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to
continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the
business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 20, cash and cash equivalents
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in 
Notes 24 and 25 respectively.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market
risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Board reviews and agrees the policy for
managing interest rate risk and foreign currency risk and the potential impact of any significant economic changes are discussed at
monthly Board meetings. 
The Group reviews its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term deposits. 
(b) Categories of inancial nstruments
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity
instrument are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.

(c) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income,
which represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts presented in the consolidated balance
sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their
assessment of the current economic environment.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial 
loss from defaults. 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions
concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.

(c) Credit risk (continued)
Trade receivables
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas and the Group’s exposure to
credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s customer base,
including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar
characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other
receivables and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The main components of this allowance are 
a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for Groups 
of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined by
references to past default experience and historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets. 
Before accepting any new customer, the Group runs credit checks to assess the potential customer’s credit quality. The company
monitors exposure to individual clients and all customers are subject to standard terms of payment for each division. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, which are non-interest bearing, approximates to their
fair value.

Trade receivables that are less than three months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired. Included in the Group’s
trade receivables are debtors with a carrying amount of £5,642,000 (2007: £6,533,000) which are past due at the reporting date for
which the Group has not made provision as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the amounts are
considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables has been included in ‘adminsitrative expenses’ in the income statement.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer 
base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the
above amount.
(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Responsibility for liquidity risk
management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities
and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring bank covenant compliance, forecast and actual cash flows and matching
the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in Note 20 is a listing of additional undrawn facilities that the Group
has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.

(d) Liquidity risk (continued)
The Group obtained a waiver for the period under review from its lenders in respect of the testing of the financial covenants contained
within its borrowing agreements as at 30 September 2008. However, as a consequence of the economic climate a breach of the
Group’s covenants is likely, when tested for the relevant quarters for the year ended 30 September 2009. As part of the negotiations 
a bridging facility of £3.25m has been provided and is due for repayment in June 2009. The facility will be repaid by a planned equity
placing and will reduce the Group’s level of gearing. Full details of the impact of this uncertainty on the financial statements are
disclosed in Note 2.

(e) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument, will fluctuate due 
to changes in market interest rates. The Group’s only interest-bearing asset is cash, which is invested in short-term deposits. As 
the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent 
of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily though borrowing funds at floating interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable
rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages interest rate risk on borrowings by ensuring access to
diverse funding and through monitoring interest rate movements with weekly reports. 
Interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis and if considered necessary a strategy to minimise any potential risk through interest
rate swaps will be discussed and implemented.

(e) Interest rate risk (continued)
Based on the various scenarios, the Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. 
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. Generally the Group
raises long term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed
at fixed rates directly. Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (primarily
quarterly), the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate instrument amounts calculated by reference to the agreed
notional amounts.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed below. 
(f) Interest rate risk
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year
would increase or decrease by £107,000 (2007: £55,000) in respect to exposure to the Group’s borrowings. For floating rate liabilities
the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole period.
(g) Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated at the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear interest 
at rates approximate to the market.

In 2006, the Group recorded a provision of £1.0m in respect of a contingent liability arising on the acquisition of Silverdell (UK)
Limited. The Company has a corresponding asset relating to the indemnities from the vendors of Silverdell (UK) Limited in respect 
of this provision.

An analysis of the maturity of debt is given in Note 21(d). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value. 
The Group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction. It is the Group’s general policy to pay
suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those terms. 
Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing cost and they include
retention amounts held over defect liability periods. The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 43 days (2007: 52 days)
for the Group. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit
timeframe.
There are no suppliers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade creditors in either 2008 or 2007.
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timeframe. 
Therefore, under the normal course of business, the Group is not charged interest on overdue payables.

Under the terms of the acquisition agreements in respect of Silverdell (UK) Limited and of Redhill Analysts Limited, there was
provision for the payment of deferred consideration. Deferred consideration also forms part of the consideration for the acquisition 
of Swift Asbestos (Holdings) Limited during 2008, further details of which are given in note 30.
The acquisition in agreement of Silverdell (UK) Limited provided for a payment of up to £6m in two equal tranches depending on
certain performance criteria of Silverdell (UK) Limited in the years ended 30 September 2007 and 2008.The deferred consideration
may be satisfied by the issue of loan notes and ordinary shares in equal proportions. During the year £3.0m (£1.5m in cash and the
remainder through the allotment in additional shares) was paid as additional consideration.
The vendors of Redhill Analysts Limited may be paid up to £1.5m to be satisfied by £1.125m in cash and £375,000 in issue of
ordinary shares based on certain performance criteria in the year to 31 December 2007. Subsequent to the year end £150,000 
was paid as additional consideration.
The vendors of Swift Asbestors (Holdings) Limited may be paid up to £0.2m in cash based on the outcome of completion accounts
mechanism.
In accordance with the requirements of FRS 25 deferred consideration has been discounted back to its present value at the date 
of acquisition. The discount is treated as a finance charge as time elapses until the date the consideration is paid. 
The provision for deferred consideration of £334,000 included in current liabilities at 30 September 2008 represents amounts
payable for the acquisitions of Redhill Analysts Limited and Swift Asbestos (Holdings) Limited, since paid.

The company has adopted the following share incentive arrangement plans:
Equity-settled share option scheme
The company has a share option scheme for certain employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average
quoted market price of the company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised
after a period of five years from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the
options vest.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows:
2008 2007
Weighted Weighted
average average
Number of exercise price Number of exercise price
share options £ share options £
Outstanding at beginning of year 3,606,552 0.953 2,762,592 0.805

Forfeited during the year (446,080) (0.893) (71,040) (0.805)
Outstanding at the end of the year 3,610,472 1.028 3,606,552 0.953
Exercisable at the end of the year –– ––
The options outstanding at 30 September 2008 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.14 years (2007: 6.01 years).
In 2008, options over 450,000 shares were granted on 3 October 2007. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options
granted on that date is £0.1m. In 2007, options were granted on 4 January 2007, 12 June 2007 and 25 September 2007. The
aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is £1.27m.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model are as follows:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Weighted average share price 103p 95p
Weighted average exercise price 103p 95p
Expected volatility 21.01 21.04
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Risk-free rate 5.14% 5.22%
Expected dividend yield 0% 0%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous 1.5 years. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds
with a term similar to the expected life of the option.
28. Contingent liabilities
There are Group cross guarantees from the company for all monies due to certain of the Group’s banks and surety lenders. No
monies were outstanding at 30 September 2008 (2007: nil). In the normal course of business there are contingent liabilities including
the provision of bonds in respect of completed and uncompleted contracts.
29. Related party transactions
During the year to 30 September 2008, the Group paid £261,000 (2007: £641,000) to Marwyn Capital LLP for corporate finance
services and directors’ fees and £60,000 (2007: £6,000) to Marwyn Partners Limited for office services.
David Williams and Mark Watts are partners in Marwyn Capital LLP and Marwyn Investment Management LLP and shareholders 
in Marwyn Investments Group Limited, which owns 100% of Marwyn Partners Limited. Marwyn Neptune Fund LP is managed by
Marwyn Investment Management LLP and beneficially owns shares and warrants in the Group.
During the year to 30 September 2008, Kalistar LLP, a partnership of certain executive Directors of Silverdell (UK) Ltd, charged
£39,000 (2007: £36,000) for the provision of cars used by some of the Directors of Silverdell (UK) Ltd. At the end of the year,
£nil (2007: £nil) remained outstanding.
One property occupied by Silverdell (UK) Limited is owned by the pension fund in which Danny Spicer and Sean Nutley have an
interest. The property is subject to a market rent of £29,000 (2007: £18,000) paid during the year.

On 1 October 2007 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Swift Asbestos Holdings Limited (“Swift”), for a fair value
consideration including expenses of £1,905,000 satisfied by cash of £1,738,000 and deferred consideration of £167,000 (subject 
to the business achieving certain profit targets). The aggregate net assets acquired and their fair values, based on the board’s initial
assessment of net realisable value, are detailed below.

The trade, assets and liabilities of Swift were transferred to Silverdell (UK) Limited immediately following the company’s acquisition by
the Group, such that it is not possible separately to identify the contribution to revenue and operating loss made by Swift between the
date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. Neither is it possible to determine the impact on Group revenues and operating loss 
for the period if the acquisition of Swift had been completed on the first day of the financial year.
31. Subsequent events
Subsequent to the year end, the Group concluded its discussions with lenders for revised facilities including re-structuring of existing
facilities, re-profiled repayment and revised convenants (see note 2).
43 Report and Accounts 2008
81733 ACCOUNTS:81733 accounts  28/3/09  11:58  Page 43 32. Transition to IFRS
For all periods up to and including the year to 30 September 2007 the Group has prepared its financial statements in accordance
with UK generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). For the year to 30 September 2008 the Group is required to prepare
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union.
The Group’s transition date to IFRS is 1 October 2006. This has been determined in accordance with IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption 
of International Financial Reporting Standards”, being the start of the earliest period of comparative information.
To explain the change to IFRS, a reconciliation has been provided of the equity at 1 October 2006 and 30 September 2007 and
the net income for the year to 30 September 2007 from the previously published consolidated financial statements, prepared in
accordance with UK GAAP to the accompanying consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. An explanation
of the principal adjustments required by the Group on conversion to IFRS is set out below. 
None of the IFRS adjustments relevant to the Group relate to cash and therefore there is no impact on cash flows. IAS 7 “Cash Flow
Statements” changes the definition of cash used in the cash flow statement to cash and cash equivalents. 
The UK GAAP figures have been restated to take account of any presentational changes required by IFRS adoption, where for
instance items are required to be shown on the face of the primary statements rather than in the notes and where existing items 
are now split current/non-current or shown on different lines (e.g. intangible asset).
Effects of transition to IFRS
IAS 36 and IAS 38: Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires recognition of separately identifiable intangible assets. These intangible assets are amortised over their expected
useful lives. Previously under UK GAAP, these intangibles would have been classified as goodwill and amortised over their useful 
lives (typically between 10 and 20 years).
The Group has applied IAS 38 Intangible Assets to acquisitions, which has resulted in the recognition of customer relationships and
order backlog intangible assets. These intangible assets would not have qualified for recognition under UK GAAP. These are being
amortised over 1 to 3 years.
IFRS 3: Business combinations and goodwill
Under UK GAAP goodwill was amortised on a straight line basis over its economic useful life of up to 20 years, tested for impairment
and provided for as necessary. Under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, goodwill is no longer amortised but is carried and subject to
annual review for impairment. Accordingly the goodwill amortisation charged of £1,391,000 in the year to 30 September 2007 has
been reversed.
A full impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill is required at the date of transition (1 October 2006) and any impairment
losses treated as a reduction in retained earnings. Goodwill impairment losses may not be reversed.

49 Report and Accounts 2008
81733 ACCOUNTS:81733 accounts  28/3/09  11:58  Page 49 We have audited the parent company financial statements of Silverdell PLC for the year ended 30 September 2008 which comprise the
Balance Sheet and the related notes 33 to 40. These parent company financial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Silverdell PLC for the year ended 30 September 2008. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent
company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent 
with the audited parent company financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further
information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 September 2008;
■ the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
■ the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – going concern
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of disclosures made in Note 2
to the financial statements concerning ability of the Group to continue as a going concern.
The Company is likely to breach its covenants, in the absence of any mitigating plans, when tested for the relevant quarters in the 
period ended 30 September 2009. If such a covenant breach were to occur the lenders would be able to request early repayment of 
all outstanding borrowings and cancel their commitments. Subsequent to the year end, the Company concluded discussions with its 
lenders which resulted in a £3.25m bridging loan being provided; due for repayment on 30 June 2009. These conditions, along with 
other matters as set out in Note 2 to the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would
result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.

81733 ACCOUNTS:81733 accounts  30/3/09  14:52  Page 51 33. Significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. The accounting policies are summarised below and 
have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year. The separate financial statements of the Company are
presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. As permitted by that Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards. 
Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, the validity of which is dependent upon the raising of finance by the
issue of additional share capital, referred to in Note 2 in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, 
or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
not discounted.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, 
FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
The Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the Directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. 
The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model. For 
all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the date of grant. For all share
schemes with non-market related vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the
associated charge. Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
The company also makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees of certain subsidiary undertakings. Equity settled
share-based payments that are made to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting
period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the
number of shares that will eventually vest.
Any payments received from subsidiaries are applied to reduce the related increases in investments in subsidiaries.
Accounting for share-based payments is the same as under IFRS 2 and details on the schemes and option pricing models relevant to
the charge included in the Company financial statements are set out in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group
for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Investments
Investments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and are held at cost less provision for impairment.
34. Parent company profit and loss account
The company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The loss for the year dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company is £16,650,000 (2007: loss £1,629,000).

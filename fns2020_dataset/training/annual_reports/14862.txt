300% StatPro is a global provider of 
portfolio analytics for the 
investment community.  
We aim to become the leading supplier of portfolio analytics in the world.
We aim to extend the use of portfolio analytics to every part of every business involved  
in portfolio management or distribution. Our mission is to provide this analysis in  
a sophisticated yet simple way that is useful as well as secure. 
It should enable investment managers to do more, faster and for less.
Portfolio analysis provided by StatPro utilises cloud-based software and almost 20 years of expertise. 
StatPro Seven provides detailed portfolio analytics for the front and middle office. In 2012, our efforts 
were focused on StatPro Revolution, our cloud-based portfolio analytics platform, which enables 
analysis of portfolio performance, attribution and risk through detailed and accurate data, visual charts 
and reports. Today our clients access this analysis with a simple log on, or through a fund administrator/
partner. In 2013, our focus includes StatPro Revolution Plus (‘R+’) which will replace StatPro Seven. 
StatPro has grown its annualised recurring revenue from less than £1 million in 1999 to just under 
£30 million at end December 2012 and currently enjoys a renewal rate of approximately 93%. StatPro 
floated on the London Stock Exchange in May 2000 and transferred its listing to AIM in June 2003.  
The Group has operations in Europe, North America, South Africa, Asia and Australia and around  
350 clients in 30 countries around the world. Approximately 80% of recurring revenues are  
generated outside the UK.

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Statpro strategy
We aim to become the leading supplier of portfolio 
analytics in the world. We also aim to extend the use 
of portfolio analysis to every business involved in 
portfolio management. We will achieve this through 
three strategic routes.
1
 Partnerships: 
distribution and product
Distribution partners
Over the next three to five years, 
we will expand our network of fund 
administrators and other partners 
that can sell portfolio analysis services 
to their clients. This will increase our 
sales capacity significantly, as we can 
leverage the existing relationships 
that these partners already have with 
asset managers of all types (mutual 
funds, hedge funds, pension funds, 
private wealth, family offices, corporate 
accounts and insurance companies). 
The key to success is the automation of 
portfolio data feeds from our partners 
to StatPro Revolution. Making this 
process simple and comprehensive will 
help us remove barriers to sales and 
help our growth. This process is already 
proving its worth with a number of our 
partners who have already automated 
the “on-boarding” of new clients.
Product partners
The more services (data and applications) 
we can supply in the StatPro Revolution 
App Store (online store which sells 
additional products - ‘Apps’), the 
more reasons there will be for users 
to subscribe to the service. The more 
clients and portfolios we have in StatPro 
Revolution, the greater the opportunity 
for any potential partner to sell their 
services through our platform. This 
mutually beneficial, symbiotic relationship 
is underpinned by our openness and 
transparency with respect to partners and 
clients. The first steps towards achieving 
this are in place with a data module from 
Interactive Data Corporation (‘IDC’) and 
an Index module from Russell Indexes. 
2
 Migrating StatPro 
Seven clients to StatPro 
Revolution and StatPro 
Revolution Plus ('R+')
StatPro Seven will be replaced with a 
combination of StatPro Revolution and R+. 
R+ will be launched as a beta in July 2013 
and will be fully functional by the end of 
2014. However, existing clients of StatPro 
Seven can already reap the benefits of 
StatPro Revolution to improve their client 
communications, sales and governance 
of portfolios. We aim therefore to cross-
sell StatPro Revolution to as many of 
our existing clients of StatPro Seven as 
possible as an add-on sale. As our clients 
get a taste for the benefits of StatPro 
Revolution and its ease of use, so we hope 
that they will be happy to migrate to R+ 
which will replace StatPro Seven fully.
The combination of StatPro Revolution 
and R+ will greatly improve our clients’ 
productivity. Not only will their total cost 
of ownership drop dramatically, but they 
will be able to increase the level of service 
they offer their clients greatly; with 
online, on-demand performance analysis 
and super efficient data management.
3
 Increase the usage of 
StatPro Revolution and the 
number of portfolios 
purchased
Our development plans include the 
improvement of the sharing functionality 
to encourage fund managers to share 
their portfolios with partners and clients. 
A fund manager might share his portfolios 
with a pension fund, a pension consultant, 
a fund of funds manager, a private bank, 
an advisor or a client. Each time one of 
these partners gains access to StatPro 
Revolution, so there is a potential for 
that partner to consider subscribing to 
StatPro Revolution themselves. It is this 
process that could help spread sales of 
StatPro Revolution to prospects to whom 
we would not otherwise have easy access.   5
Increase the use of sharing
By increasing the use of the advanced 
sharing functionality clients will be 
able to share their portfolios internally 
with colleagues and externally with 
their clients. Internally, users can 
share with the legal team, the sales 
and marketing departments and the 
board, to improve transparency and 
communication on the portfolio and its 
performance. Clients are demanding 
greater transparency too; money 
managers can share their performance 
externally as well. The more a portfolio 
is shared with people inside and outside 
the client’s company, the more likely 
we are to receive follow up orders. 
Simplifying our processes
By providing a comprehensive integration 
guide for our partners and their sales 
teams, sales of StatPro Revolution will 
increase globally. We offer sophisticated 
analytics and our partners need 
our support and help to sell it. By 
documenting a tried and tested process 
as well as offering training and support, 
we can help our partners sell more. With 
the standardisation of StatPro Revolution 
we have an opportunity to rethink and 
standardise how we support our clients 
globally. We have also simplified our 
sales process to reflect the fact that we 
are now promoting just one service: 
StatPro Revolution. This will mean 
that we can expand our sales force 
and standardise our sales training.
Development of StatPro 
Revolution and R+ 
Our vision is in three parts: making 
StatPro Revolution better, building R+ to 
be the ultimate tool for data management 
and enabling data partners to join us (as 
discussed above). Together this makes 
a pretty compelling proposition. We’ve 
learnt much from providing StatPro 
Revolution as a cloud-based service, so 
we are combining all the best features 
from StatPro Seven with the cloud. Finally, 
with PaaS (Platform as a Service), we 
can enable data and analytics providers 
to offer our customers a wider range 
of solutions. As a result of the placing 
in November 2012, we can invest more 
and speed up this development.
Marketing 
In 2013 we will continue to promote our 
message about StatPro Revolution (“More, 
Faster, for Less”) to as many people as 
possible via the web, conferences, white 
papers, PR and advertising. StatPro 
Revolution’s name, brand and message 
are all designed to stand out from the 
crowd and get noticed. We continue to 
receive positive feedback that this singular 
and consistent message is working.
Training
To encourage usage of StatPro Revolution, 
we aim to train as many people as 
possible within each client organisation. 
With a little training, individuals will learn 
how to incorporate StatPro Revolution 
into their daily work flow and so spread 
the word. We hope this will increase the 
number of portfolios clients subscribe to 
and keep them renewing year after year.

OUTSOURCED
Market overview
Our geographical spread has ensured the Company’s 
success as we share market knowledge and client 
feedback across territories. 
StatPro is proud to be agile and flexible enough to add relevant and timely features to 
StatPro Revolution to suit our clients’ and investors’ needs. This is important as there 
are different regulations in each country, as well as varying demand for outsourcing and 
cloud-based solutions. The following topics pervade the market we operate in today:
Transparency
As the impact of the credit crisis 
continues, clients’ trust in their fund 
manager has fallen and the demand for 
greater transparency has increased. If 
the fund manager cannot provide this 
transparency through more detailed, 
more accurate, easier to understand 
analysis and reports, clients’ assets can 
easily be moved to another fund manager. 
In order to preserve wealth and acquire 
new business the fund manager needs 
to have access to analysis whenever 
and wherever they are to satisfy client 
demand. As this drive for transparency 
builds momentum in the industry, the 
requirement for increased oversight 
rises too. With StatPro Revolution, 
because it’s cloud-based, the fund 
manager can access his analysis online 
at any time ensuring he can provide an 
up to date dialogue with his clients.
Increased regulation/
governance
StatPro constantly reviews the latest 
regulations that affect our clients 
and partners to ensure our product 
development and marketing message are 
current and relevant to the challenges 
experienced in the marketplace.
In 2012/13 UCITS IV (Undertakings for 
Collective Investment in Transferable 
Securities) and AIFMD (Alternative 
Investment Fund Managers Directive) are 
the big issues affecting the investment 
community. The aim of AIFMD is to reduce 
and manage exposure to illiquid assets 
and also to ensure that appropriate 
checking measures and contingency 
plans are in place. UCITS IV introduces 
five key modifications, requiring fund 
managers to undertake a strategic review 
of their product range and management 
structure. There are also compulsory 
measures to enhance investor protection. 
As we develop our cloud-based products 
we are monitoring these regulations 
to ensure StatPro Revolution and R+ 
provide features that help our users 
manage risks when investing in illiquid 
stocks, as well as providing accurate, 
transparent analysis and reporting.
Competition
We divide our competition into 
three types: 
a) System providers – with back, middle 
and front office capabilities, these large 
players may have the components 
needed to compete with StatPro (the 
data, the software and the means to 
acquire or build the analytics packages). 
However, the technology used by these  7
competitors is similar to StatPro Seven 
and is superseded by the new cloud-
based technology. The new technology 
also permits us to develop new features 
and deliver them far more efficiently 
than in the past. We believe it would take 
a number of years for system providers 
to build analysis that can comply with 
market regulations such as UCITS and 
AIFMD. By partnering with industry 
giants, such as TD Ameritrade, StatPro 
can access a wider net of clients (such 
as TD Veo
®
 users) and they, in turn can 
improve their analytics packages. 
b) Data and analytics providers –  
provide complete solutions and are a 
greater threat to StatPro Revolution 
than the system providers. However, 
the underlying technology is also much 
older and so less flexible to develop. 
More importantly, the price point of 
these solution providers is much higher 
than StatPro Revolution. By partnering 
with data providers such as IDC, StatPro 
is able to give our clients access to 
more prices through a one-stop-shop 
environment and immediately “plug” 
new data into their portfolios for more 
accurate performance and risk analysis. 
c) Start ups – have the advantage of 
using the latest technology, but the 
disadvantage that they lack scale. It 
is also unlikely that they can boast 
such a wide asset coverage as StatPro 
Revolution. It is quite likely that we would 
seek to partner with many start-ups as 
this would fit our open platform model. 
Most start ups we have come across are 
focused on the private wealth market. 
Outsourcing
Fund managers will continue to focus 
on managing money and so look to 
outsource any process that can be done 
as well or better by someone else. Fund 
administrators are ideally placed to 
fulfil this role, but they generally lack 
the required expertise in analytics. 
By partnering with StatPro they can 
create a powerful outsourcing offer 
to their clients by combining data 
management with our cloud-based 
technology to deliver a superior service.
Adoption of the cloud
A year ago StatPro had to explain to 
some clients and partners what “the 
cloud” is and indeed what the benefits 
are. Concerns included cost, accessibility 
and security. Today when speaking to 
clients, demonstrating StatPro Revolution 
at exhibitions or presenting at shows, 
we have often found the audience is 
now expecting a cloud-based product 
and more often than not is proactively 
seeking an online solution. We expect 
this trend to continue in 2013.

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Chairman’s Statement
In the midst of a perfect storm of increased regulation, 
higher costs, making market outperformance ('alpha') 
more challenging... StatPro Revolution is ideally placed  
to help. 
Progress
I am pleased to report that your Company 
increased total annualised recurring 
revenue by 4% to £29.5 million (2011: 
£28.5 million at constant currency) 
including a greatly increased contribution 
from StatPro Revolution of £1.5 million 
(2011: £0.5 million). Total revenue 
increased by 1% to £32.0 million (2011: 
£31.7 million) and despite continued 
expenditure on StatPro Revolution, 
adjusted profit before tax increased by 
14% to £5.0 million (2011: £4.4 million).
Financing
Your Company raised £5.8 million (net 
of expenses) in a placing in November 
2012 and, combined with another year 
of strong operating cash flow, the Group 
had net cash of £3.7 million at year end 
(2011: net debt of £3.4 million). The 
purpose of raising further equity was 
to allow increased investment in cloud 
services. Your Board believes that StatPro 
Revolution has immense potential with 
‘first mover’ advantage and the plan 
is to capitalise on this opportunity. 
Dividend
Your Board is proposing a final dividend of 
1.9p per share for 2012 payable on 22 May 
2013 to all shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 26 April 2013 
taking the total dividend to 2.7p per share 
(2011: 2.6p) an increase of 4%. We intend 
to maintain a progressive dividend policy.
Products
In 2012, total research and development 
expenditure was £4.2 million (2011: 
£5.0 million) representing 13% of Group 
revenue. Although total research and 
development expenditure decreased by 
17%, following your Board’s decision to 
develop solely cloud-based solutions, 
research and development expenditure 
increased for StatPro Revolution and 
StatPro Revolution Plus (the cloud 
upgrade path for StatPro Seven). The 
total cash expenditure on StatPro 
Revolution including marketing and 
other costs incurred in 2012 amounted 
to £3.7 million (2011: £3.3 million).
Corporate governance
As previously announced, Charles 
Fairbairn resigned from the Board of 
Directors with effect from 31 December 
2012. Charles has been a Non-Executive 
Director of StatPro since April 2000 
and helped prepare the Company for 
its stock market flotation successfully 
achieved in May 2000. I would like to 
express my deep gratitude to Charles for 
his contribution, advice and invaluable 
support over these past 12 years and wish 
him well in his other business ventures. 
I was delighted to welcome Jane Tozer 
OBE MBE to the Board on 1 October 
2012. Jane brings with her a wealth 
of experience in both large and small 
companies, the asset management and 
software industries. Jane was appointed 
Chairman of the Audit Committee 
with effect from 1 January 2013. 
People
In what has been a transformational 
year for your Company, our employees 
have again done a fantastic job and 
I take this opportunity to thank 
them for their contribution to this 
transformation and for ensuring that 
the objectives of both the Company 
and of our clients are achieved. 
Prospects
The asset management industry in 
its broader sense, including asset 
owners, asset managers, advisors, 
administrators and custodians, is in the 
midst of a perfect storm of increased 
regulation, reducing fees, higher costs, 
greater demands for transparency, 
increased global competition, making 
market outperformance (‘alpha’) more 
challenging. Your Company, with its 
StatPro Revolution service, is ideally 
placed to provide solutions to the 
asset management industry to help 
cope with this storm. I look forward 
to capitalising on StatPro Revolution’s 
undoubted appeal in 2013.

Chief Executive’s Review
We believe we will see growth in StatPro Revolution 
sales from direct efforts, growing our network of 
partners and from the viral effect of people sharing 
portfolio access with others.
We are pleased with the excellent 
progress made in 2012 towards our 
strategy of becoming a purely cloud-
based analytics service provider. The 
existing business has continued to provide 
us with a strong, profitable platform 
from which we can drive StatPro forward, 
capitalising on cloud computing to enter 
new regions and market tiers, as well as 
revitalise our existing customer base. 
By the end of the year, StatPro Revolution, 
our cloud-based portfolio analysis 
service, was being used by over 156 
organisations, in 22 countries (2011: 
9). We have successfully completed the 
switchover of development work from 
StatPro Seven to StatPro Revolution and 
begun development of R+, to be launched 
in mid-2013 as a beta, allowing upgrades 
over the next three to five years.
The cloud-based nature of StatPro 
Revolution means it can be shared 
between colleagues, businesses and 
customers. We are confident that, with 
the 21 fund administrators signed up as 
partners by the year end, we are now 
on the verge of seeing the start of a 
‘network effect’, with each new customer 
of the service potentially driving uptake 
by others. We therefore believe the 
outlook for StatPro to be positive.
Financial highlights
We are pleased to report that revenue 
for 2012 increased to £32.00 million 
(2011: £31.72 million) and adjusted 
EBITDA increased by 10% to £6.73 
million (2011: £6.12 million). Taking 
into account exceptional costs of £0.98 
million (2011: nil) due to the restructuring 
in January 2012, profit before tax was 
down 2% at £3.78 million (2011: £3.86 
million). Cash flow from operations 
(before exceptional items) was also 
strong at £10.18 million (2011: £10.37 
million) and, following a successful 
placing in November 2012, net cash was 
£3.67 million at the end of December 
2012 (2011: net debt £3.40 million). 
Adjusted earnings per share was up 4% 
to 5.9p (2011: 5.7p) and the Board has 
recommended an increase in the dividend 
of 4% for the year to 2.7p (2011: 2.6p).
Other KPIs that improved in 2012 include 
the contract renewal rate, increasing to 
93% (2011: 92%) and annualised recurring 
contract revenue, up 4% (on a constant 
currency basis) to £29.52 million. As 
the Group is going through a complex 
transformation of technology platforms 
this is a pleasing result. In early 2012, we 
took the decision to focus all active sales 
efforts on our new cloud-based service 
StatPro Revolution rather than StatPro 
Seven. The result has been a marked 
increase in sales of StatPro Revolution in 
2012 with annualised recurring revenues 
rising over 200% at constant currency 
to £1.51 million (2011: £0.45 million) 
and the number of clients of StatPro 
Revolution increasing to 156 (2011: 50).
Strategic focus
The strategic focus for StatPro is to 
work with partners both for distribution 
channels and for up-selling additional 
products. Our secondary focus is to 
migrate our existing clients of StatPro 
Seven to StatPro Revolution and R+ over 
the next three to five years. In the short 
term, progress towards that goal will be 
manifest by the proportion of our existing 
clients of StatPro Seven who have also 
subscribed for StatPro Revolution.
Partnerships
Our strategy is to leverage the clients, 
relationships and expertise of other 
companies. StatPro offers its own 
unique expertise in the form of StatPro 
Revolution and this is something that 
many companies desire but would be 
hard pressed to achieve themselves 
due to the complexity of the underlying 
technology and the access to data. 
The design of StatPro Revolution also 
makes this a practical proposition and 
results in mutual benefits. At the end 
of 2012, we had 21 companies acting 
as distributors for StatPro Revolution 
including six major operators.
The key objective for many of our clients 
is to source as much as possible from one 
supplier. It is, however, impossible for 
any single company to offer everything, 
since mastering the required expertise in 
numerous fields becomes too complex. 
This is where product partners play a

crucial role. We have already partnered 
with IDC to offer their data through the 
StatPro Revolution platform. Now, with a 
simple click of the mouse, a user can buy 
coverage of his portfolio from over 3.2 
million assets. We have also entered into 
an agreement with Russell Investments 
to provide their widely popular indexes 
through StatPro Revolution’s App store, 
uniquely charging on a per portfolio 
basis. This is a significant step for an 
index vendor to take, embracing StatPro 
Revolution’s disruptive business model 
and we are delighted to have secured 
the partnership. We intend to expand 
these services further with other data 
offerings, especially in the area of 
compliance and to work with a number 
of software suppliers using our new web 
application programming interface (‘API’).
Existing clients
For StatPro’s larger clients, the move to 
the cloud represents an opportunity to 
improve productivity and the quality of 
the service they provide to their clients. 
We have kept up a constant dialogue 
with our clients to explain our strategy 
and objectives and this transparency 
has reaped rewards. We now have a 
significant number of existing clients 
using StatPro Revolution and many 
more testing it. Clients can see that 
StatPro Revolution is a quantum step 
up in sophistication and a quantum 
step down in complexity. We have also 
shared our plans for R+, which promises 
to simplify their operations even more.
As StatPro Revolution is a platform for 
distributing analytics and StatPro Seven 
is a system to produce performance 
calculations this means that StatPro 
Revolution cannot replace StatPro Seven, 
but it can certainly enhance it. Only when 
Chief Executive’s Review ...continued
The migration route for StatPro Seven clients 11
we have all R+ modules in full production 
(expected to be by the end of 2014), 
will we be able to replace StatPro Seven 
fully with a cloud-based version. In the 
meantime therefore we are focused 
on maximising the uptake of StatPro 
Revolution by clients of StatPro Seven.
Spreading the service
Sharing is the key functionality that 
will drive StatPro Revolution sales. The 
uniquely simple way of allowing a fund 
manager to share access to a portfolio 
with other people and organisations, sets 
StatPro Revolution apart from anything 
else in the market. As more and more 
people have a portfolio shared with them, 
so they will become aware of StatPro 
Revolution. The depth of analysis available 
in StatPro Revolution and its speed is also 
unique in its sophistication and with each 
release it is getting more sophisticated.
As we emphasise the core benefits of 
the service, so we hope that the product 
will become more and more desirable 
to fund managers and thus also to fund 
administrators. Many fund administrators 
lack specific knowledge of performance or 
risk, but their larger competitors have this 
edge. For them to get all that expertise 
packaged in such a simple way is a real 
benefit. In addition, they can generate 
additional revenues via data services 
for their clients. For clients of fund 
administrators the small fee they would 
pay is well worthwhile to gain access to 
StatPro Revolution without having to do 
any data management. Several of our 
smaller fund administrator partners are 
making great use of StatPro Revolution 
to help sell their overall services.
Training and support
In order to help our many new 
distributors (largely fund administrators), 
we are producing a handbook that 
sets out the key methods of selling 
and supporting analytics. We will be 
offering training courses for their sales 
teams to get familiar with our services 
and help them avoid potential pitfalls. 
Equally, we will offer training courses 
for their support teams to familiarise 
them with common client queries. 
We will also assist in actual sales 
processes in order to promote StatPro 
Revolution as much as possible.
Development
In 2013, we will be focusing on improving 
the sophistication of the sharing function 
and also of our compliance products. 
We will launch a UCITS IV module 
shortly which will target the many 
UCITS funds that exist. The offer greatly 
simplifies the compliance process as 
well as significantly reducing the cost. 
Towards the end of 2013 we plan to 
release an enhanced cloud-based risk 
module, which will effectively replace 
all the current functions available in the 
risk module of StatPro Seven. Clients 
that only have the Risk module of 
StatPro Seven, will be able to upgrade 
to StatPro Revolution at that point.
R+ will have its beta release in the 
middle of 2013 and we will initially target 
clients with significant numbers of small 
portfolios. R+ is designed to handle 
massive amounts of data in an efficient 
manner. It is less the brute force of 
calculation that is often the problem with 
large datasets and more the manner in 
which the user interface enables efficient 
interaction with so much data. Our unique 
graphical interface is specifically designed 
to allow performance teams to handle 
vastly more data, far more efficiently 
than has ever been possible before.
Marketing
We aim to continue to promote StatPro 
Revolution’s strongly differentiated brand 
to increase awareness and generate 
interest in StatPro Revolution. The new 
improved StatPro Store will be launched 
mid-year and it will soon have additional 
modules available for purchase. As the 
number of clients and products grows, 
so marketing will become an increasingly 
important part of our business. The 
barrier to purchase for an existing client 
of StatPro Revolution is significantly lower 
when it comes to an extra module, than 
it is to win the client initially. Whilst these 
things take time to put in place, 2013 
will be a year when we expect significant 
strides to be made towards building the 
underlying foundations for future success.
People
I remain constantly impressed at the 
expertise and resourcefulness of the 
people that work at StatPro. In 2012 I have 
seen even higher levels of motivation and 
pride in working on such an ambitious 
solution like StatPro Revolution. I would 
like to thank each employee for their 
hard work in 2012 and I look forward 
to an even more successful 2013.
Dividend
In line with our policy of paying a 
progressive dividend, which aims 
to balance return to investors 
with our investment needs, we are 
pleased to announce an increase 
in our full year dividend to 2.7p 
per share in 2012 (2011: 2.6p).
Outlook
Transforming the business from one 
technology platform to another is no 
simple task, but it is one that is largely 
done from a product and organisational 
perspective. We believe that over the next 
two to three years we will see continued 
growth in our StatPro Revolution sales. 
In part this will come from our direct 
efforts, but increasingly it will come 
from our growing network of partners 
and also from the viral effect of people 
sharing portfolio access with each 
other. As a result we remain confident 
of a successful outcome for the year.

Chief Executive’s Q&A
Discussion on business and strategy with CEO
Q
 What do you mean by 
doing more, faster , for less?
Cloud computing offers a quantum leap 
forward in productivity for portfolio 
analytics. Clients can do more because 
we have brought together all our 
expertise in one product and added 
more functions. It is faster because the 
processes that have slowed things down 
in the past have been removed or made 
so efficient that you don’t notice them 
any more and it costs less because the 
economies of scale we are able to gain 
by being cloud-based are amazing. The 
gain can be a factor of 30 or more.
Q
 What's so important 
about sharing and what 
does this mean for the 
future of StatPro?
Every portfolio is a network. You have 
the owner of the portfolio, the advisor, 
the manager, the regulator and other 
experts who all have an interest or 
responsibility in that portfolio. So a 
fund manager shares with a pension 
fund, a pension fund might share with 
a pension consultant, a fund of fund 
manager shares with private wealth 
companies, private wealth companies 
will share with their clients. Each needs 
to do this in a safe and secure way and 
StatPro Revolution does it brilliantly.
How StatPro Revolution
allows sharing internally 
and externally across 
organisations 13
Q
 What benefits can 
existing clients get from 
StatPro Revolution today?
StatPro Revolution provides a wonderful 
method of communicating with your 
clients as well as with other people in your 
business. StatPro Seven was designed to 
produce analysis, not really to distribute 
it. Do you remember when we used to 
get monthly printed bank statements 
only by post? Now we can just go online 
and see our account. The same benefits 
are now available for portfolio analysis 
and our clients of StatPro Seven will 
find it easy to add StatPro Revolution 
and start reaping those benefits now.
Q
 What makes StatPro 
different?
I think it is our vision and our ambition. 
We could not have built StatPro 
Revolution without a desire to build the 
best, most efficient, most useful portfolio 
analytics system in the world. Without 
the stubbornness to ignore the naysayers 
and overcome all the many complex 
physical challenges, it would also have 
been impossible. But today we have a 
service that has 3.2 million asset histories, 
thousands of indexes and a rapidly rising 
number of clients and portfolios. We’re 
different because we sit across the whole 
platform, we encompass every level of 
the supply chain. It is what people want.
Q
 What does the future 
hold for StatPro?
Our vision is that our clients will be 
able to use not only all the analytics we 
provide through StatPro Revolution, but 
also access the products and services of 
our current and future partners. What 
is more, we hope that our clients will 
take increasing advantage of the sharing 
functionality to enable their clients 
and colleagues to see their portfolios. 
StatPro Revolution is to monthly client 
reports what online banking is to 
monthly bank statements: the future.
Q
 What corporate and 
social responsibilities does 
StatPro take part in?
It is a firm belief of the people in StatPro 
that education is one of the most valuable 
gifts any of us can have. In the West we 
take this for granted, but in Africa it is 
a privilege. Specifically in South Africa, 
a college education can increase your 
potential salary five to 10 times. This is 
why StatPro has pledged to contribute 
1% of annual revenue from StatPro 
Revolution to fund the education of 
school children in and around Cape Town. 
Our sponsorship has enabled 23 students 
in 2012 to get an education that would 
otherwise have been impossible. We have 
been gradually increasing sponsorship 
over the last five years and we have some 
wonderful success stories. Our view is 
that the imbalance between the rich and 
poor is largely one of unequal opportunity 
and access to education. Over the next 
50 years, we hope that South Africa can 
transform its society and make it better 
balanced through the spread of higher 
education. The students we are helping to 
educate today, will join the growing ranks 
of taxpayers, effectively paying back the 
investment being made in them through 
their taxes. StatPro can’t do much, but 
we can do something and we believe 
that the compound effect of sustained 
support for education will make its mark. 
On a sadder note, Mike Walsh, who was 
our leading US salesman, was struck 
down by a brain tumour around Easter 
2011. He had surgery and intensive care, 
but after a long fight, he succumbed to 
the illness in May 2012. Mike was only 44 
years old, in great form and married with 
two daughters who were two and three 
years old when he died. Mike was not only 
a great salesman, but also someone who 
led by example and worked extremely 
hard. It was not by accident that he was 
always our best or second best salesman 
each year. We decided that in memory 
of Mike we would create the Mike Walsh 
Award for the top selling salesman each 
year. A prize of 1% of the value of the 
sales made by the winner is split between 
the salesman and a foundation we have 
set up for his two daughters. The hope 
is that over the years, the value of the 
foundation will grow to help fund the 
college education of his daughters.

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Financial Review
We now have a very focused business with a 
strong foundation for highly scalable expansion.
Overview 
In January 2012, the Board made 
the decision to develop solely cloud-
based technology solutions. The result 
of this decision means that we now 
have a very focused business with a 
strong foundation for highly scalable 
expansion. The concentration of the 
sales and client services teams’ efforts 
on StatPro Revolution resulted in a more 
than three-fold increase in annualised 
recurring revenue for the cloud-based 
service to £1.51 million (2011: £0.45 
million at constant currency). We 
are no longer actively promoting our 
traditional StatPro Seven products 
to new prospects, nevertheless, we 
achieved some new business and 
extensions and StatPro Seven software 
revenue increased by 1% at constant 
currency. The restructuring in 2012 
resulted in an exceptional restructuring 
charge of £0.98 million (2011: nil).
The StatPro Seven and data products 
achieved an 8% increase in underlying 
adjusted EBITDA (at constant currency), 
as shown in the table below, while 
the StatPro Revolution service, still in 
investment mode, achieved a reduced 
EBITDA loss of £2.28 million (2011: 
£2.54 million). The Group thus achieved 
a 10% increase overall in adjusted 
EBITDA to £6.73 million (2011: £6.12 
million) and an adjusted EBITDA margin 
of 21.0% (2011: 19.3%) whilst continuing 
to invest in cloud technology.
Share placing and planned 
investment
The Company raised £5.81 million (net 
of expenses) in a placing in November 
2012 and, combined with another year 
with strong operating cash flow, the 
Group had net cash of £3.67 million at 
year end (2011: net debt of £3.40 million). 
The purpose of raising fresh equity 
was to allow increased investment in 
cloud services from a stronger balance 
sheet. The Board believes that StatPro 
Revolution has immense potential with 
‘first mover’ advantage and the plan 
is to capitalise on this opportunity. 
Therefore, in 2013 more will be invested 
in the sales team and building on 
partnerships with fund administrators. 
StatPro will also increase its development 
and web design team as well as 
strengthening our client services team.
Key performance indicators
The key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) 
that are monitored by the Board, and 
by the Group Executive Board as part 
of the regular monthly management 
reporting are shown in table 2.
 
The KPIs are discussed in detail 
below in the relevant sections 
of this Financial Review.
Revenue
Overall, Group revenue increased by 1% 
to £32.00 million (2011: £31.72 million).  
At constant currency the revenue growth 
was 4%.
Revenue by segment
Revenue increased in the EMEAA 
region by 3% at constant currency 
but at actual rates was 2% lower 
than the prior year at £20.08 million 
(2011: £20.40 million). In the North 
American region revenue increased 
by 5% (both at constant currency and 
at actual rates) to £11.92 million (2011: 
£11.32 million) as shown in table 3.
Revenue by type
As anticipated, our decision to focus on 
cloud technology and not proactively 
market StatPro Seven had an impact on 
StatPro Seven software licence revenue, 
which grew by only 1% at constant 
currency and at actual rates fell by 2% 
to £24.60 million (2011: £25.01 million). 
StatPro Revolution revenue increased by 
324% to £0.72 million (2011: £0.17 million). 
Data fees increased by 2% for the year 
as a whole to £4.69 million (2011: £4.61 
million) but data fees were lower in H2 
2012 as the level of data overage, which 
was higher than usual in H1 2012, reduced 
in the second half of the year. Professional 
services revenue increased slightly by 
3% to £1.99 million (2011: £1.93 million).

Recurring revenue 
The Group’s business model of Software 
as a Service (‘SaaS’) and recurring 
revenue contracts continues to provide 
excellent visibility of revenue with the 
recurring revenue element being a 
high percentage (94%) of total revenue 
(2011: 94%). The annualised recurring 
revenue from software licences and data 
fees at the end of December 2012 was 
£29.52 million (2011: £28.45 million at 
constant currency). New contracts signed 
in the year amounted to £3.11 million 
(2011: £3.47 million) and the renewal 
rate was higher at 93% (2011: 92%).

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Financial Review ...continued
The Board believes that StatPro Revolution has immense 
potential with 'first mover' advantage and the plan is to 
capitalise on this opportunity.
Approximately 71% of new recurring 
contracted revenue arose from existing 
clients (2011: 70%). The proportion by 
value of recurring software licences and 
data clients at the end of 2012 secured 
to the end of 2013 or beyond amounted 
to 81% (2011: 78%); the weighted 
average length of contracts committed 
was 17 months (2011: 17 months). 
StatPro Revolution revenue 
profile
Whilst recurring revenue relating to 
StatPro Revolution is currently only 
5% of the Group total it is growing at a 
higher rate as the service is developed 
on a highly scalable technology platform. 
The total recurring revenue from clients 
whose subscription includes StatPro 
Revolution was £4.04 million (2011: £1.62 
million) representing 16% (2011: 7%) of 
our total software recurring revenue, 
a KPI we are focusing on increasing.
The profile of our client numbers and 
revenues is a skewed distribution. At 
one extreme are a number of fund 
administrator partners (typically large 
custodian banks) who have contracted 
for, say, a minimum of 100 portfolios and 
we expect the number of portfolios (and 
hence recurring revenue) to increase as 
they promote the service to their wide 
client base. At the other end are a large 
number of clients who have signed for 
just one portfolio. Whilst the revenue 
per client for these smaller clients is 
much lower than our current average 
there is a larger market of potential 
clients and we are focusing on growing 
both these target markets in addition 
to prospecting existing clients.
The revenue distribution profile for 
StatPro Revolution is shown in table 6.
Operating expenses 
Operating expenses (before amortisation 
of intangible assets and exceptional 
items) reduced by 4% (1% at constant 
currency) to £23.02 million (2011: 
£24.03 million). The average number 
of employees reduced by 5% to 253 
(2011: 266), and we ended the year with 
242 employees, 14% fewer than the 
previous year’s staffing level (2011: 280). 
Adjusted operating margin
As a result of increased investment in 
our products and the restructuring in 
2012, the operating profit reduced in 2012 
to £4.28 million (2011: £4.49 million), 
although the adjusted operating profit 
increased by 9% year on year to £5.53 
million (2011: £5.06 million) as shown 
in note 3, with the adjusted operating 
margin increasing to 17.3% (2011: 15.9%). 
The adjusted EBITDA (note 3) increased by 
10% to £6.73 million (2011: £6.12 million).
Research and development 
and capex
Following the decision to develop solely 
cloud-based solutions, we focused the 
development team on StatPro Revolution 
and StatPro Revolution Plus (the cloud 
upgrade path for StatPro Seven). As a 
result total research and development 
expenditure reduced overall by 17% 
to £4.18 million (2011: £5.01 million), 
equating to 13% of Group revenue

(2011: 16%), but our expenditure 
dedicated to cloud computing increased. 
The total expenditure on StatPro 
Revolution including marketing and other 
costs incurred in 2012 was £3.70 million 
(2011: £3.32 million), which had an EBITDA 
impact in the year of approximately £2.28 
million (2011: £2.54 million), after taking 
into account associated revenue and the 
impact of capitalised development costs. 
Development costs of £3.21 million were 
capitalised in the year (2011: £3.45 million) 
and amortisation on internal development 
increased to £3.06 million (2011: £2.64 
million). Expenditure on other intangible 
assets was £0.34 million (2011: £0.36 
million) and total capital expenditure 
on property plant and equipment was 
£0.64 million (2011: £0.99 million). 
Finance income and expense 
Net finance expense reduced to £0.49 
million (2011: £0.63 million) as a result 
of lower average net debt in 2012.
Profit before tax 
Profit before taxation in 2012 decreased 
by 2% to £3.78 million (2011: £3.86 
million). After adjusting for amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets, share 
based payments and exceptional items, 
the adjusted profit before taxation 
increased by 14% to £5.04 million 
(2011: £4.43 million). The impact of 
currency movements reduced adjusted 
profit before taxation by £0.37 million 
(i.e. approximately 7% impact). 
Taxation
The tax charge is £1.10 million (2011: 
£0.96 million) giving an effective tax 
rate of 29% (2011: 25%). This is higher 
than the prevailing UK rate largely due 
to unrelieved losses in our development 
company StatPro International Sarl.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share decreased by 
10% to 4.3p (2011: 4.8p). Diluted earnings 
per share decreased to 4.3p (2011: 4.7p) 
based on 0.25 million (2011: 1.02 million) 
potentially dilutive shares outstanding. 
Adjusted earnings per share (note 10)

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Financial Review ...continued
The purpose of raising fresh equity was to allow 
increased investment in cloud services from a 
stronger balance sheet.
Balance Sheet
The Group’s net assets increased to 
£49.62 million at 31 December 2012 
(2011: £43.83 million), mainly as a 
result of the placing of shares, which 
raised £5.81 million (net of expenses). 
Cash flow and financing
2012 was another year of positive 
cash generation with cash inflow from 
operating activities (before exceptional 
payments) of £10.18 million (2011: £10.37 
million). The Directors believe that 
the financial risk profile has reduced 
significantly following the extension 
of the financing facility in May 2012, 
the placing in November 2012 and the 
general improvement in trading over the 
last year. The Group was in a net cash 
position amounting to £3.67 million as 
at 31 December 2012 (2011: net debt of 
£3.40 million). The Group nevertheless 
retains its long-term financing facility 
which was undrawn at 31 December 2012. 
Dividends
The Directors are recommending an 
increased final dividend for 2012 of 
1.9p per share (2011: 1.85p) making 
a total dividend for 2012 of 2.7p per 
share (2011: 2.6p). It is intended to pay 
the final dividend on 22 May 2013 to 
all shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 26 April 2013. Total 
dividends paid in 2012 amounted to 
£1.63 million (2011: £1.50 million). The 
Board intends to maintain a progressive 
dividend policy reflecting the balance 
between the investment needs of the 
business and the growth in underlying 
earnings per share. When proposing the 
dividend, the Board satisfies itself that the 
current and projected level of dividend 
cover is appropriate. The dividend cover 
(calculated as adjusted eps: dividends per 
share) in 2012 was 2.2 times (2011: 2.2).
Principal risks and uncertainties 
The principal business risks and 
uncertainties affecting the Group 
are described on pages 33 to 35. For 
each category of risk, the Directors 
have identified means by which the 
risk can be managed or reduced in a 
cost effective way, whilst accepting 
that some risks cannot be completely 
eliminated. Details of key financial 
risks are considered below.
Financial risk management 
The current and projected financial 
risks of the Group are managed by 
the Group finance team. The primary 
risk relates to financing facilities and 
this is mitigated by ensuring very 
tight control of cash and detailed 
forecasting of business cash flows. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s cash position is closely 
monitored with weekly updates from all 
overseas operations and daily updates 
of cash collected from customers. Any 
aged debtor balance that is overdue 
is investigated to ascertain the reason 
and to resolve the situation promptly. 
Monitoring procedures for short term 
cash projections allow the Group Finance 
team to closely monitor the key liquidity 
and other financial ratios to ensure that 
there is sufficient liquidity in the business 
at all times and sufficient headroom in 
relation to the banking covenants.

Financing facilities
The Company retains its senior debt 
facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc (‘RBS’), which is committed to 
May 2015, subject to compliance with 
agreed covenants. The Company has 
the option to extend the facility for a 
further two years to May 2017 (subject 
to RBS Credit Committee approval). At 
31 December 2012, the Group had both 
net cash of £3.67 million and undrawn 
credit facilities of approximately 
£9.50 million available to support its 
business operations and therefore the 
Board believes that the Group is well 
positioned to manage the business risks.
Foreign exchange risk 
management
The Group is exposed to exchange rate 
fluctuations given that the majority of 
its revenue is non-sterling based. The 
Group also has a significant proportion 
of its costs in the same currencies 
as its revenues and therefore there 
is a reasonable degree of natural 
reduction in overall currency risk. 
All material foreign currency transaction 
exposures (i.e. sales and purchase 
contracts denominated in a different 
currency to the local reporting currency) 
are hedged through use of foreign 
exchange contracts as soon as the 
amount and timing of the exposure is 
identified with reasonable certainty. 
The Group’s policy is not to hedge 
profit and loss translation exposures. 
As part of our liability management, we 
have made use of currency swaps with 
a total principal value of approximately 
£5.23 million denominated in USD, CAD, 
and EUR, to create synthetic currency 
hedges in order to provide a partial hedge 
against movements in the fair value of 
investments in overseas subsidiaries. 
As the Group continues to grow and 
generates increased profits overseas in 
foreign currencies this exchange rate 
exposure is expected to increase. 
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate 
risk and an increase in interest rates 
would increase the interest payable on 
the Group’s banking facility. Given the 
Group’s current net cash position and 
the benign outlook for interest rates, 
the Board has decided not to undertake 
any interest rate hedging but will review 
the position from time to time.
The risk to rising interest rates (should 
the Group return to a net debt position) 
would be partly mitigated by an increase 
in interest income from surplus cash 
and deposits, where the policy is 
to seek to maximise interest return 
without exposure to inappropriate 
liquidity or counterparty risk.

Operational Review
Our efforts to build additional partnerships  
with software and wealth platforms generated 
positive new relationships.
The strategic direction taken at the 
start of 2012 enabled our service and 
relationship teams around the world 
to focus more and more on providing 
excellent service, which resulted in the 
high client retention we achieved in 2012. 
In addition, the continual investment 
in our global operations, specifically 
around our data centres and compliance 
with such standards such as ISO 27001 
and SSAE16 Type II, has meant we 
continue to offer a world class service. 
Our efforts to build additional 
partnerships with software and wealth 
platforms generated positive new 
relationships with Linedata, Pacific 
Fund Systems, TD Ameritrade, CACEIS, 
the Way Group, APEX and others, all 
of which are now actively promoting 
StatPro Revolution to clients, generating 
additional revenue for us. Following 
the agreement with Interactive Data we 
also look forward to being able to offer 
award winning fixed income evaluations 
data on a per portfolio basis through 
the StatPro Revolution App Store in 
March 2013. I am also pleased to report 
a major European asset service provider 
and a large North American custodian 
bank signed significant deals in 2012. 
Marketing continued to promote 
StatPro’s brand around the world 
resulting in a greater number of people 
contacting us through our website 
and associated channels. On the 
business side we more than doubled 
our strategic partnerships with fund 
administrators, software vendors and 
data suppliers, all of which are looking 
to offer a better quality of service to 
their clients. Through our transparent 
business model our partners are able to 
understand clearly their profit potential.
We move into 2013 with confidence 
knowing that our strategic direction is 
the right one for the Group. Our focus 
continues to be on simplifying and 
standardising our processes, enabling 
us to deliver an unparalleled level of 
service to our clients. Global sales are 
being standardised with the 2013 launch 
of our sales training course; a three 
month full time training course that will 
run twice a year for all our new sales 
staff. The course content is based on our 
almost 20 years of experience and will 
produce a sales force that is well versed 
in StatPro, its product, and its clients. 
Content from this course will also be 
used to supply our partners with an even 
greater knowledge of StatPro Revolution, 
thus enabling them to sell more. 
Simplification and standardisation to 
promote best practice is also the theme 
for our global Client Service team. As we 
standardise the way we implement and 
support our clients globally we’ll be able 
to operate more efficiently and deliver 
StatPro Revolution faster to our clients. 
We’ll do this while being ever mindful not 
to lose the local touch we have in each 
regional market that we operate in. 
Marketing will work even more closely 
with the development, sales and service 
teams to ensure our messaging is 
correct and well delivered. Sophisticated 
tracking tools enable us to determine 
how successful our tactics are. We’ll 
continue to attend conferences globally 
so we don’t miss key opportunities to 
meet clients and prospects face to face.
     We move into 2013

StatPro Revolution is a great product 
and has been consistently delivering 
new functionality with high levels of 
quality. This is due to our great team, 
great technology and great vision. We are 
therefore looking forward later this year 
to deliver the beta version of R+, that not 
only offers the migration path for existing 
StatPro Seven clients, but also opens 
up some exciting new opportunities.
Our strategy of offering high quality 
analytics via the cloud, with an open 
and transparent business model, and 
open architecture, is well placed for 
continued success in 2013. As our clients 
continue to feel the pressure from 
their clients to offer more services at a 
lower price, with a quicker ROI (return 
on investment) and with the flexibility 
to offer third party integrations, 
we feel well placed to support our 
clients in meeting those needs.

market bond ETF.  Even within equities, exposure 
is well diversified across geography and sector.  
 Turning to the top ten performance detractors, 
as illustrated by figure 2, they also tell a story about 
our approach to portfolio construction.  Again, it’s 
pleasing to see the detractors spread fairly evenly 
across the ten positions, including varied exposure,
such as a Korean equity ETF and a Cotton ETF.  
 That said, there are three European banks in the 
top ten detractors, namely, SocGen, 
Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.  
These three positions reflected 
the entire exposure to European 
banks over the period, with the 
average weights standing at 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.6%, 
and with maximum weights capped at 1%, 1.5% and 
2%, respectively.  Importantly, our risk management 
argues for keeping weights low when faced with 
a higher volatility profile.  As such, while damage 
can never be avoided entirely, it can be limited.  
 In terms of sell discipline, David Jane looks 
to sell negative surprises.  For example, of the 
ten detractors, he has sold three of them.  There 
will of course be situations when holding, or 
even buying more, is appropriate when a stock 
has underperformed.  However, when faced 
with a negative surprise, the general preference 
for ‘cutting losses and moving on’ is consistent 
with an objective approach to risk control.  
 Cutting up the numbers in a different way 
shows that performance has not been generated 
by one asset class, as illustrated by figure 3, 
taken from StatPro Revolution.  For example, 
equities, bonds, index-linked bonds and REITs 
have all been working to contribute to the 
outperformance.  Commodities detracted from 
performance but, with a more volatile profile, our 
risk management limits exposure to this asset class.  
 The consistent and disciplined approach to 
portfolio construction is encouraging and should 
contribute to repeatable outperformance.  
ANTHONY RAYNER, 
PORTFOLIO ANALYST, 
DARWIN INVESTMENT 
MANAGERS
It’s been a difficult few years for 
financial markets and it was against this backdrop, in 
June 2011, that the TM Darwin Multi Asset Fund was 
launched.  Fund manager David Jane, above all else, 
targets capital preservation and real returns over the 
medium term.  In order to achieve these objectives 
in a repeatable manner, we believe that a disciplined 
approach to portfolio construction is crucial.  
 So, with portfolio construction in mind, we’ve 
been dissecting the fund’s performance since 
tenure, a period that saw the fund increase by 
9.5%, vs the IMA Mixed Investment 20-60% sector 
average return of 7.1% (to 13th August 2012).  
 Drilling down into the headline numbers, figure 
1, taken from StatPro Revolution,  illustrates the 
top ten contributors to performance since launch.  
It’s encouraging to note that outperformance has 
not come from one or two stocks but builds fairly 
consistently across the top ten contributors to 
performance.  This suggests a 
disciplined and rational approach 
to portfolio construction.  
 Furthermore, the top ten isn’t 
dominated by one asset class 
but includes exposure to equities, a US government 
long bond, an index-linked gilt and an emerging 
“performance has not been 
generated by one asset class”

Our marketing strategy continues to focus 
on the StatPro Revolution brand and the 
benefits of our cloud-based platform 
to clients. StatPro.com is the key vessel 
for this message and hosts a variety of 
content for our marketplace as well as 
the online store where we sell StatPro 
Revolution. Short videos and thought 
leadership pieces help position StatPro 
as the expert in portfolio analytics. 
In September 2012 we hosted our cloud 
summit event in London which attracted 
clients, partners, fund administrators 
and prospects keen to hear how cloud 
technology is transforming the way 
software is being developed and delivered 
with tangible business benefits for all.
To support our global campaigns we 
attend and speak at targeted industry 
events in key locations globally. This helps 
us connect with our target audience and 
build relationships with partners; it’s also 
a great way to show off the product with 
live demos and presentations as well as 
raise the profile of our senior team.
We continue to support our sales 
teams with local initiatives ranging 
from client user groups to breakfast 
briefings and webinars. This ensures 
client transparency, generates valuable 
product feedback and new leads which 
can be nurtured into sales opportunities.

Product distribution
The 2013 StatPro sales strategy is 
focused on our partnership programmes 
built around two main pillars: 
increasing the number of available 
services within StatPro Revolution and 
easing portfolio data integration.
•	 E x t e n d i n g 	 o u r 	 o f f e r i n g 	
 Adding value to our analytics content 
via third party data or software 
providers gives our clients access 
to best of breed solutions. Linking 
providers such as IDC or Linedata, 
to our open-platform, together with 
a ‘pay as you go business model’, 
is a real game changer. Clients are 
no longer restricted to a single 
product or provider anymore. This 
open-platform concept will impose 
itself as the model of the future.
 
•	 H a s s l e - fr e e	i nte g r ati on	
 Client portfolio integration is key to 
ensuring the rapid deployment of 
StatPro Revolution to end-user clients. 
StatPro has defined a partnership 
programme with Fund Administrators 
for the mutual benefit of all parties. We 
now have multiple partner data feeds 
in place including APEX as well as a 
major European asset service provider 
and a large global North American 
custodian bank. This shows StatPro 
is a business partner rather than a 
service provider or a competitor, as 
highlighted in Market Overview.
Sales strategy
The StatPro sales team is active on all 
continents promoting our platform of 
services, directly and with our partners. 
This joint marketing will accelerate in 
2013. As we continue to deliver the 
strategy and the business model set out 
in 2012, 2013 is the year of deployment as 
we intend to expand our sales capacity. 
The world of technology is definitely 
changing. StatPro Revolution is the right 
product coming just at the right time.

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Product strategy
In 2012 we ramped up data coverage within StatPro Revolution. We focused 
on two areas: asset classes not supported by the platform and data quality. 
During the year the development team successfully delivered full cross -
asset coverage, strengthened the platform, extended its reach and prepared 
it for the ongoing functional acceleration. 
Highlights include:
New asset classes
StatPro Revolution is now a full 
cross-asset class platform. During 
2012 we increased fixed income 
coverage and added a number 
of new asset classes such as:
• Futures
• CFDs
• Deposits
• FX forwards
• Hedge funds
• Options
• OTCs (i.e. CDS, IRS, equity swaps).
Fixed income
Coverage of fixed income instruments was 
extended to several hundred asset types, 
adding option-adjusted risk numbers 
(including yield-to-maturity, modified 
duration and convexity for all types). At 
the same time, the functional offering 
was expanded with the calculation of a 
range of exposures, e.g. DV01, CDV01.
Data quality
We’ve undertaken data cleansing 
within many different asset classes, 
reinforcing the day-to-day procedures 
of quality assurance and we have 
cut dramatically the time taken to 
resolve and correct data errors.
Portfolio aggregation
The capacity of aggregating portfolios 
and analysing them with look-through 
functionality is one of the key elements 
for satisfying pension funds and 
wealth managers and enables us to 
extend our market reach to these 
sectors. With portfolio aggregation, 
we have introduced a superior piece of 
functionality, not fully available in our 
previous platform, StatPro Seven.
Long/short strategies
The addition of long/short strategy 
management has been an important 
element to make StatPro Revolution 
attractive to hedge funds and, more 
generally, to alternative asset managers.
Carve-outs
Being able to produce carve-outs is 
important in many ways. For instance, 
a balanced portfolio can be carved out 
into several portfolios and analysed 
separately. The introduction of 
benchmark carve-outs lets our clients 
segment indexes with great flexibility. 
Enrichment of performance 
statistics
2012 has also seen many improvements 
to our traditional strength in performance 
measurement, with the addition of many 
new statistics and the improvement of 
the so-called ‘NAV-only’ portfolios. 27
XYZ
Dario Cintioli
StatPro Revolution App store
During March 2013, we activated the first 
optional and payable module, introducing 
IDC bond prices. Subscribers of this 
module will run portfolio analytics with 
IDC bond prices. IDC is a world leader in 
bond pricing, adding millions of bonds 
to StatPro Revolution’s coverage.
In Q2 2013, we will introduce the UCITS 
IV analysis to address regulations. 
Subscribers will be able to comply with 
the complex regulation on Value-at-Risk 
(‘VaR’) imposed by the European Union 
on collective investments, without the 
hassle of further implementation.
During 2013 we expect to integrate 
a cloud-based compliance solution, 
improving our offering related 
to European regulations.
Functionality
We have already released, in 
January 2013, an innovative stock-
level attribution dashboard.
During the course of the year we will 
add the ability of attributing relative 
performance against a benchmark 
for fixed income portfolios.
Towards the end of the year, we will 
release another set of added-value 
analytics, including risk factor 
decomposition.
All these developments will further 
increase the potential market 
for StatPro Revolution and
• encourage existing clients load 
new portfolios
• extend the number of new clients  
that we can acquire.
Sharing, Sharing, Sharing
StatPro Revolution already offers sharing 
capacity, and we plan to enhance this 
offering in Q2 2013, with a number 
of improvements to the existing 
functionality that will let our users set 
a date delay for the information they 
share with clients and stakeholders. 
At the same time, clients can easily 
configure what their users can and 
can’t see. Based on client feedback, 
we expect that this development will 
trigger an immediate increase in the 
number of invitations to end-users.
Dario Cintioli
Product Director 
14 March 2013
2013 – Roadmap
The launch of a new payable module tackling UCITS IV will trigger the first cross-sale  
opportunities inside StatPro Revolution. Equally important is the planned improvement  
in the sharing capability of the platform, where users can invite their clients into  
StatPro Revolution and increase the viral expansion of the product.
2013 objectives
The development objectives of 2013 
are to:
• introduce the first optional 
and payable modules within 
StatPro Revolution App store
• expand sharing capabilities to trigger 
viral expansion of the platform
• enrich the functionality to 
expand the market segments and 
extend the potential market 28

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2012
The Directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries during the year was the development, marketing and distribution of software 
systems and the provision of cloud-based portfolio analysis and asset pricing services to the global asset management industry. 
Review of business and future developments
The Directors are pleased with the performance of the Group, which has achieved growth in revenue, and an increase in profits  
(before exceptional items) in a year with further investment in the business. A review of the business and likely future developments  
is contained in the Chairman’s Statement on page 8 and Chief Executive’s Review on pages 9 to 11.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group operates in the asset management sector of the financial services industry and, whilst many of our clients are part of  
banking groups, most of our clients are relatively resilient to the challenging economic backdrop. This is because, like StatPro itself,  
they themselves have recurring revenue models and to a large extent, the services and software provided by StatPro are reasonably 
embedded within their core operations. 
The Board closely monitors clients that are potentially at risk as well as the pipeline of new business. We plan for a level of cancellations 
each year but most of our contracts are multi-year agreements which roll into subsequent commitments unless written notice is given  
to terminate the contract. For software service contracts the annual licence fee is payable in advance and for data contracts the fees  
are monthly in advance. For these reasons, we have good visibility on any potential deterioration in our trading outlook and potential 
liquidity risks to the business.
The Group has both cash and undrawn credit facilities available to support its business operations and therefore the Board believes  
that the Group is well-positioned to manage the business risks in the current uncertain environment.
The principal risks and uncertainties that affect the Group are identified on pages 33 to 35.
Financial risk management
The principal financial risks that the Group is exposed to and the approach to risk management are described in the Financial Review  
on pages 18 to 19.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group’s financial statements (see note 1).
Research and development 
The Group continues to invest in developing improved software products and services. Development expenditure incurred during the 
year was £4.18 million (2011: £5.01 million). In accordance with IFRS, development costs are capitalised where recognition criteria are 
met and written off over the useful life, currently estimated by the Directors to be three years. The amount capitalised in the year was 
£3.21 million (2011: £3.45 million) and the total amount of amortisation was £3.06 million (2011: £2.64 million). 
Results, dividends and transfers to reserves
The Group’s profit attributable to equity shareholders for the financial year was £2.68 million (2011: £2.91 million). A final dividend of 
1.9p per Ordinary Share (2011: 1.85p) has been recommended by the Directors taking the total dividend for the year to 2.7p (2011: 2.6p). 
If approved by the passing of a resolution at the 2013 Annual General Meeting, it is intended to pay the final dividend on 22 May 2013 to 
all shareholders on the register at close of business on 26 April 2013 (ex-div date will be 24 April 2013). The profit for the year has been 
transferred to reserves.
Shares issued in year
During 2012 the Company issued 6,149,946 shares (2011: 601,472) as detailed in note 20 to the financial statements. There were 225,000 
shares held in treasury at 31 December 2012 (2011: 225,000). At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the Directors are seeking to 
renew the authority to allow the purchase of own shares up to a limit of 10% of the Company’s share capital.
Donations
The Group made charitable donations for educational purposes of £32,000 (2011: £26,000) during the year, the main component of 
which related to scholarships and sponsorships to students from disadvantaged backgrounds to various educational establishments in 
South Africa and this element increased to ZAR404,000 (2011: ZAR330,000). No political donations (2011: nil) were made during the year. 31
Directors and their interests
The Directors who held office during the year were:
CR Bacon Non-Executive Chairman
JMBT Wheatley Group Chief Executive
AM Fabian Group Finance Director
MC Fairbairn Non-Executive Director Resigned 31 December 2012
MC Adorian Non-Executive Director
SJ Clark Non-Executive Director
JE Tozer Non-Executive Director Appointed 1 October 2012
All Directors are subject to election at the first opportunity after their appointment, and to re-election thereafter at intervals of no  
more than three years in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. The Company’s Articles of Association require that  
one third of the Directors, or the number nearest to one third, are to retire from office by rotation. Accordingly, JE Tozer seeks election 
and  SJ Clark and JMBT Wheatley seek re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. As noted in the 2011 Directors’ Report,  
Gregory Wheatley resigned as Company Secretary on 25 January 2012 and on that date, Andrew Fabian was appointed to the role  
of Company Secretary.
Directors’ interests in the Company’s share capital and share options are detailed on pages 42 to 43.
 
Directors’ interests in significant contracts
Directors’ interests in significant contracts are described in note 21 to the financial statements.
Policy and practice on payment of creditors
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships with its suppliers and sub-contractors and has established the following 
payment policy:
(a) agree payment terms in advance of any commitment being entered into;
(b) ensure suppliers are made aware of these terms by inclusion of the terms of payment on the purchase order or the contract; and
(c) ensure that payments are made in accordance with the terms of the contract or order providing that the presented documentation  
is complete and accurate.
The number of days purchases outstanding at 31 December 2012 for the Group was 26 days (2011: 30) and for the Parent Company was 
23 days (2011: 15).
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected  
to prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’)  
as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and the profit or loss of the Group  
for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ indemnity insurance
The Company carries an appropriate level of professional indemnity insurance cover for the size of the business and also has insurance 
cover for Directors’ and Officers’ liability. 32
Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each Director has confirmed that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware, and
• he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given in accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Substantial shareholdings
The Company has been notified of the following disclosable holdings of voting rights in the Company’s issued share capital as at

In addition to the above holdings, JMBT Wheatley holds 69,000 Ordinary Shares (representing 0.1% of the Ordinary Share capital)  
in a family trust, being a trustee and potential indirect beneficiary of the trust. 
Employment policies
The Group acknowledges the vital role that all employees play in its success through their skills, initiative and commitment. All operations 
are encouraged to provide the proper resources to maximise this potential through efficient systems of recruitment, communication, 
training and development. It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair consideration to the employment and career development of 
disabled persons, commensurate with their aptitudes and abilities. The Group’s policy in respect of staff who become disabled whilst 
employed is to make appropriate adjustments and to assist them wherever possible to continue employment within the Group. The 
Group is also committed to providing equal opportunities regardless of age, gender, religion or ethnic origin.
The Group ensures that all employees are kept fully informed, as far as it is practicable, with regard to the activities of the Group, by 
circulation of news and regular meetings between Directors, managers and other employees. The London office of StatPro, the Group’s 
head office and base of UK operations, retains its Investors in People (‘IIP’) award in recognition of the investment the Company has 
made in its people. The award reflects our commitment to and belief in the value of our staff, their performance and their contribution 
to the success of the business. 
Health and Safety
The Group’s policy is to ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, working environments exist which will minimise risk to the 
health and safety of employees.
Legal form
The Company is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s Registration number  
is 2910629.
Auditors

Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2012 ...continued 33
StatPro has outlined its strategy in this Annual Report. Key to successful outcome is our understanding of StatPro’s market drivers:
Transparency
To ensure that StatPro adds the most value possible to its clients, it must listen and understand their requirements:
• StatPro uses client ‘new feature’ requests and Sales team feedback to prioritise product enhancement.
• StatPro also employs suitable financially qualified staff (e.g. to CFA level, even on the product development team) to ensure that  
it understands its clients’ needs and understand their issues.
Regulation
By understanding the impact of unfolding regulatory changes and updating its products in time, StatPro helps clients meet new 
regulatory requirements.
Competition
StatPro has significant resources to deliver on what is required, yet small enough to react to changing market threats or opportunities. 
Such agility is a key corporate attribute.
Cloud
To allay customer concerns regarding their data being in the ‘cloud’, StatPro has invested in both the ISO 27001 and SSAE 16 
certifications. StatPro has embraced the best cloud product development and management practices for over three years, and has 
partnered with industry-leading IT services suppliers to ensure the best service availability and security.
Outsourcing
StatPro has invested in its own products with best-practice procedures for its own staff to ensure that clients’ requirements are 
routinely met.
Regarding corporate risks and uncertainties more broadly, StatPro considers and manages the following potential risks:
Reputational issues Controls
• Failure to meet client expectations/contractual commitments 
when implementing a new client.
• Failure to service clients adequately, leading to dissatisfaction 
and ultimately lost business.
• Loss of ‘good’ reputation.
• Ensure a good understanding of clients’ needs.
• Allocate an Account Manager to manage the client relationship.
• Escalate any issues to Director level.
• Proactive account management.
• Long-term contracts foster client commitment.
• Development delays, undetected errors in system code and 
poor design compromises system performance.
• Continual investment in Development and Quality Assurance.
• Regular monitoring and reporting of project development and 
quality; user-acceptance testing of enhancements.
Market-related issues Controls
• Market pressure adversely affects StatPro’s market share  
and/or profitability.
• Market take-up of StatPro Revolution may not be as fast  
as anticipated.
• StatPro brand is not sufficiently well-known in the 
marketplace.
• Competitor products are developed that are superior  
to StatPro’s offering. 
• StatPro actively promotes itself within the Asset Management 
industry.
• StatPro uses cost-effective online advertising tools to track 
interest in its products, enabling effective/efficient Marketing 
and Sales efforts.
• The Board has regular meetings with all teams to ensure that 
products and services meet market requirements.
• Continually update market and competitor intelligence.

Principal risks

StatPro’s ability to efficiently and effectively develop new 
products and services, win new business and service  
current clients.
• StatPro’s Investors in People accreditation helps management 
ensure that staff needs and aspirations are met within the 
organisation’s objectives and resources.
• Documenting of key procedures, e.g. for ISO 27001 and SSAE 
16 accreditation, helps ensure that an institutional memory  
is created to capture and exploit key knowledge.
• Excessive staff turnover jeopardises StatPro’s ability to 
operate efficiently and effectively.
• Continual review of HR issues and remuneration levels.
• Legal advice on Employment and Contract Law sought  
where necessary.

ratios closely monitored.

on amortising basis until May 2015.
 – The facility was undrawn on as at 31 December 2012.
 – In addition, £2 million overdraft facility available.
• Currency Risk: 
 – US Dollar
 – Euro
 – Canadian Dollar
 – South African Rand 
 – Australian Dollar
• Client contracts generally denominated in the Sales and 
Support unit operating currency, thereby creating a 
reasonable degree of natural hedging.
• All material currency transaction exposures are hedged 
through use of foreign exchange contracts.
• Use is made of currency swaps to create synthetic hedges 
against movements in the fair value of overseas investments.
• Interest Rate Risk • The net debt has now been eliminated although the debt 
facility is still in place.

no new interest rate hedging is currently proposed.

infringement by StatPro is minimised.
• Litigation relating to contractual client arrangement or 
employee contract. 
• Ensure appropriate legal advice taken when any matter is 
likely to result in legal action. 36
Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
As the Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (‘AIM’), the Company is not required to 
follow the UK Corporate Governance Code, which applies only to fully listed companies. Nevertheless, the Company is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance and the Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate governance. This 
statement describes how the principles of corporate governance are applied to the Company and the Company’s compliance with the 
Code. Except as noted below, the Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
during the year.
The Workings of the Board and its Committees
The Board
The Board currently comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and three other 
Non-Executive Directors and is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. Directors’ biographies appear  
on pages 28 to 29 and demonstrate a range of relevant experience bringing independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources, industry knowledge and standards of conduct, which is vital to the success of the Group. 
Jane Tozer MBE OBE was appointed to the Board on 1 October 2012 and was appointed as Chairman of the Audit Committee with effect 
from 1 January 2013. Charles Fairbairn resigned from the Board with effect from 31 December 2012. Charles joined the Board of StatPro 
in April 2000 and helped prepare the Company for its stock market flotation, which was successfully achieved in May 2000. Charles has 
been an active contributor to the Board’s strategy over the last 12 years. Charles has been Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
from 2000 to 2006 and has been Chairman of the Audit Committee since 2000. 
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is responsible for all Company secretarial matters and compliance with 
relevant statutory obligations. All Directors receive adequate training to enable them to comply with their duties as a Director. 
Gregory Wheatley resigned as Company Secretary on 25 January 2012 and on that date Andrew Fabian was appointed to the role 
of Company Secretary.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information. The Board meets at least 
quarterly and has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control 
over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. At these meetings the Board reviews trading performance, 
ensures adequate financing, sets and monitors strategy, examines investment and acquisition opportunities and discusses reports to 
shareholders. The Directors can also take independent professional advice as appropriate at the Company’s expense. The Chairman 
holds meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present.
The Board has a process for evaluating the performance of each Director. The performance of the Executive Directors is reviewed by 
the Non-Executive Directors. On resignation from the Board a Non-Executive Director would be asked to provide a written statement 
to the Chairman for circulation to the Board, if they were to have any unresolved concerns about the running of the Company. The 
performance of the Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed on an individual basis by the other Directors. 
The overall effectiveness of the Board and its sub-committees is reviewed by the Board as a whole through completion of a  
formal questionnaire. 
The Board believes that the level of sales consulting to promote StatPro Revolution that Mark Adorian has performed on behalf of the 
Company in 2012 means that he may no longer be considered independent under the UK Corporate Governance code although the 
Board believes that Mark Adorian continues to act in the interests of all shareholders.
The senior Independent Director (Charles Fairbairn until his resignation on 31 December 2012) holds meetings with the other Non-
Executive Directors to appraise the Chairman, without the Chairman present. Stuart Clark is the senior Independent Director with effect 
from 1 January 2013 and is available to the shareholders for any concerns which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive or other Executive Directors has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
The following committees have been established to deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is currently chaired by Jane Tozer with effect from 1 January 2013, (previously chaired by Charles Fairbairn who 
resigned on 31 December 2012). The Audit Committee also comprises the Chairman (Carl Bacon), Mark Adorian and Stuart Clark, and 
meets at least three times annually. The Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors. Meetings  
are also attended, by invitation, by the Group Finance Director. 
Corporate Governance 37
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of financial matters, as set out in written terms of reference, including 
the interim results and the annual report and accounts before their submission to the Board and monitoring the controls which are in 
force to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders. The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of 
external auditors and their remuneration both for audit and non-audit work and discusses the nature and scope of the audit. The Audit 
Committee regularly reviews the level of non-audit work being performed by the auditors to ensure that they remain independent and 
the Audit Committee is satisfied that the current level of non-audit work being performed by the auditors is appropriate. The Audit 
Committee reviews the adequacy of the whistleblower process for staff.
The Audit Committee needs to assess annually the qualification, expertise and resources, and independence of the external auditors 
and the effectiveness of the audit process. 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for Executive 
Directors, including performance-related bonus schemes and participation in the Group’s Long Term Incentive Scheme. Mark Adorian  
is the chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the other members are Carl Bacon and Stuart Clark (and Charles Fairbairn until  
his resignation on 31 December 2012). 
The Remuneration Report, which includes details of Directors’ remuneration, pension entitlements and Directors’ interests, together 
with information on service contracts is set out on pages 41 to 43. 
Mark Adorian is the chairman of the Nominations Committee and the other committee members are Carl Bacon, Stuart Clark and 
Jane Tozer (and Charles Fairbairn until his resignation on 31 December 2012). The Nominations Committee undertakes the function  
of nominating appointments to the Board, although all such appointments are reviewed and approved by the full Board. 
There were six full scheduled Board meetings held in 2012. During the year, there were three audit committee meetings, two 
remuneration committee meetings and there was one nominations committee meeting. The number of full scheduled Board meetings 
and main sub-committee meetings attended by each Director during the year were as follows:

Group Executive Board
The Group Executive Board (‘GEB’) is the executive committee, which comprises the Executive Directors together with other senior 
executives of the Group who meet at least 10 times per annum to discuss strategic and operational matters. Regional executive boards 
and product focused committees have been established to deal with executive decisions, within clearly defined terms of reference 
established by the Board. 
With effect from 1 January 2013 a number of changes were made to the members and roles within the Group Executive Board. Andrew 
Peddar was appointed Group Chief Operating Officer and Michel Lempicki was appointed European Sales Director. Marc Zandt was

EMEAA Region (Europe, South Africa and Asia Pacific) and North American Region
Operational decisions on implementing the Group’s strategy, including sales and client services strategy and expenditure and 
recruitment plans, are delegated to senior executives in the Group’s regions, within clearly defined terms of reference and overall 
budgets established by the Board. 
Product strategy
Operational decisions on implementing the Group’s product strategy including development plans together with related expenditure 
and recruitment plans are delegated to the Product Director who works with other senior executives on product-focused committees, 
within clearly defined terms of reference and overall budgets established by the Board. 
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and market  
analysts including presentations after the Company’s preliminary announcement of the annual and interim results and other  
major announcements. 
Internal controls and risk management 
During the year, the Board has formally reviewed the Group’s risk profile and reported on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls and management of Group risk in accordance with the Combined Code. This review is required to address not only 
internal financial controls but other risks and controls of the business. The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the 
Company’s system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate business risks and which provides reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Company has established risk management procedures, which the Directors consider appropriate to a group of StatPro’s size  
and complexity, and during the year, the internal controls and risk management procedures were reviewed by the Directors. This is 
achieved through a series of reports and meetings of specific committees including the Information Security Committee. The Company 
has a Group Risk Manual, which sets out the key risks by region and by function and the controls in place to manage the risks and 
identifies actions to be taken to improve risk management processes. The risk review process focuses on adopting enterprise wide  
risk management techniques on a consistent basis and improving risk reporting and management. Given the size and nature of the 
business the Directors consider that the Group is compliant with the requirements of the Corporate Governance Code.
Each senior executive is responsible for managing risks in his or her region or function and making regular reports on risk issues to both 
the main Board and Group Executive Board. This risk analysis covers all business risks including commercial, financial, operational, legal 
and environmental risks. These reports include the potential impact to the business of each key risk and its likelihood along with details 
of all insurance policies including specific cover for Directors. The Board is thus able to monitor the risk profile for all significant business 
risks. Recommendations on internal controls and risk improvement are reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board. Risk awareness 
is further embedded within the business at a series of review meetings during the year extending to Group Executive Board and other 
Directors and senior managers.
 
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 31 and a statement on going 
concern is below. 
Financial controls
The Group has established written expenditure approval, delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and 
other control procedures together with accounting policies and procedures, which are approved by the Board.
Budgetary process 
Each year the Board approves the annual budget and key risk areas are identified. Performance is monitored and relevant action is taken 
throughout the year through regular reporting to the Board of variances from the budget, updated forecasts for the year together with 
information on the key risk areas.
Investment appraisal 
Major capital and other project expenditure is controlled by a budgetary process and authorisation levels. For capital expenditure above 
specified levels, and for acquisitions and disposals, detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board for approval. 
Corporate Governance ...continued 39
Internal audit 
The Group currently does not have an internal audit function as the Directors consider this to be inappropriate given the current size  
of the Group. However, this situation is reviewed by the Board annually. An element of internal audit assurance is achieved by use of 
internal staff working on specific projects, for example, to review the policies and procedures relating to information security, including 
the effectiveness of related internal controls.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries and for the reasons set out in the Directors’ report, the Directors have a reasonable expectation  
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements (see note 1).

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Mark Adorian is the chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the other members of the Committee are Charles Fairbairn (until 
31 December 2012), Carl Bacon and Stuart Clark. The remuneration of all Executive Directors and other senior executives is recommended 
to the Board by the Committee. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board. During the year the 
Committee has reviewed salary surveys and the policies of other companies of a comparable nature but has taken no external advice. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives by rewarding them with remuneration packages which 
reflect both individual performance and the results of the operations under their control. Packages consist of basic salary, performance-
related bonuses, share options, pensions and other benefits, with a significant proportion of potential remuneration based upon 
achievement of demanding performance targets. Consideration is given to pay and employment policies elsewhere in the Group.  
Details of the remuneration package of each Director are set out on pages 41 to 43.
The Group has implemented a remuneration policy to align the executives’ interests with the objectives of all shareholders. The current 
focus is on the execution of the cloud strategy, the achievement of Group revenue growth and profit targets and bonuses will form a 
greater part of the overall remuneration package.
Basic salary and benefits
Salaries are established by reference to prevailing market rates, adjusted to reflect individual performance, experience, responsibilities 
and skills. There were no changes to basic salaries for Executive Directors for the year commencing 1 January 2012. The Remuneration 
Committee approved an increase in basic salary for Andrew Fabian to £150,000 with effect from 1 January 2013. There were no changes 
to the fee arrangements for Non-Executive Directors.
Share options 
Share options are granted to Directors and eligible employees under established HMRC approved and unapproved employee share 
option schemes as the Company places emphasis on the encouragement and motivation of senior executives. Details of the options 
outstanding under the schemes are provided in note 20 to the financial statements. Options are awarded at the higher of market value 
at the date of grant and a minimum level established by the Remuneration Committee as being acceptable to all shareholders. The 
Remuneration Committee ensures that awards are made within the overall limits authorised by shareholders and at an appropriate level 
for the individual, taking into account their role and contribution to the business, previous option grants and market practice. Share 
options granted to Directors and senior managers include performance criteria as determined by the Remuneration Committee from 
time to time, primarily being that exercise is dependent on achieving a minimum share price and earnings per share growth target. 
Annual performance-related bonus scheme
In addition to basic salary, Executive Directors and other senior executives participate in an annual performance-related bonus scheme. 
Performance targets are designed to both stretch and encourage individuals whilst aligning their interests to that of the Group. 
In 2012, the targets for performance-related bonuses for main Board Executive Directors related to the Group’s revenue growth  
rate, in particular for sales of StatPro Revolution, combined with satisfactory profit and cash generation. The Committee may also  
award individual discretionary bonuses. In 2012 and 2011, there were no discretionary awards. Bonuses do not form part of  
pensionable earnings. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Under the LTIP, each year the Committee considers the grant of options to executive Directors and senior executives with a notional 
value at grant dependent upon the seniority of the participant and related to the participant’s base salary and the performance terms 
for those options. These options generally have a strike price based on a premium to the market price at the time and be exercisable 
after three years. The rules governing these options are identical to existing option schemes, and there are performance criteria  
relating to growth in eps and other measures such as StatPro Revolution sales to ensure incentives are aligned with strategic objectives. 
Providing this is met, and providing that participants have met their individual performance objectives as agreed at the start of  
each year, they will be granted a number of options at an exercise price to be determined by the Committee. 
The LTIP award granted in 2009 failed to vest (and some options granted to Directors in 2006 also lapsed) as the 2011 eps performance 
condition was not met and 1,975,000 options lapsed. Options over 1,045,000 shares previously granted to Justin Wheatley and options 
over 35,000 shares previously granted to Andrew Fabian lapsed.
Following the decision to make a placing and to increase investment in cloud technology in 2012 and in order to align the Directors 
interests with the shareholders, a special award of options was granted to senior Executive Directors on the Group Executive Board. 
Options over 1,000,000 shares were granted to Justin Wheatley and options over 150,000 shares were granted to Andrew Fabian. In 
addition, an award of options over 100,000 shares was granted to Andrew Fabian under the annual LTIP allocation. The strike price for 
these options is 108p and there are other performance conditions attached. There is no plan to award further options under the LTIP  
to Group Executive Board Directors in March 2013.

Shareholders will be invited to approve the introduction of any new scheme. At the AGM in May 2013, shareholders are being asked 
to approve the renewal of the Unapproved Option Scheme which was originally established in 2003 with a 10 year life, which expires  
in July 2013, and a new scheme is being proposed with similar rules to the existing scheme.
Pensions and other benefits
The Company also operates a defined contribution pension scheme for Executive Directors. Other benefits include allowances,  
life assurance and membership of a private healthcare scheme. 
Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors has a rolling contract of service, which is terminable by no more than 12 months’ notice. In the event  
of termination of a service contract, compensation amounting to the notice period would be payable. Details of service agreements  
for each Executive Director are as follows:

same period the FTSE™ AIM total shareholder return was -33%.

StatPro operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary for Company paid pension 
contributions. Where individuals exchange salary this reduces StatPro’s National Insurance contributions. For Executive Directors, 
StatPro credits this saving to the individual’s pension. As part of JMBT Wheatley’s new service agreement, JMBT Wheatley has opted  
to swap pension benefits for other allowances and therefore, he received no pension contribution from the Company in 2012 or 2011.

Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
We have audited the financial statements of StatPro Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the Group  
Income statement, Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, Group Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Group and Company 
Statements’ of Cash Flows, Group Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, Company Statement of Changes in Shareholders’

Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable

assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
and accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;

COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES 
IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
For the year ended 31 December 2012 51
1 Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRIC 
interpretations endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the measurement  
of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. A summary of the significant Group accounting policies is set out 
below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting 
standards in the year.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement or statement  
of comprehensive income. The profit after taxation for the financial year of the Company was £5,209,000 (2011: £3,919,000). 
The Group and Parent financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) 
except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of preparation – going concern
The Group operates in the asset management sector of the financial services industry and whilst many of our clients are part of banking 
groups most of them are relatively resilient to the challenging economic backdrop. This is because, like StatPro itself, they themselves 
have recurring revenue business models and, to a large extent, the services and software provided by StatPro are reasonably embedded 
within their core operations. We have a client base of around 350 client groups (2011: 300) which is diversified geographically and by 
product and with no significant client concentration. Our largest client group, which comprises a number of contracts for a variety of 
products and in a number of territories, represents less than 6% of recurring revenue. We plan for a level of cancellations each year but 
most of our contracts are multi-year agreements which roll into subsequent commitments unless written notice is given to terminate 
the contract. For most software contracts the annual licence fee is payable in advance and for data contracts the fees are monthly  
in advance. For these reasons, we have good visibility on any potential deterioration in our trading outlook and potential risks to  
our business.
Renewals occur throughout the year although there is a slightly greater weighting in the fourth quarter. The Board closely monitors 
clients that are potentially at risk of cancellation as well as the pipeline of new business. 
The Group has both cash and undrawn credit facilities available to support its business operations and therefore the Board believes  
that the Group is well-positioned to manage the business risks. In reaching their conclusion the Board has reviewed cash flow forecasts. 
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Group and Company financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. 
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, therefore not necessarily equate to the actual outcome. Estimates are made by the 
Directors based on experience and estimates believed to be reasonable expectations of future outcomes. Critical accounting estimates 
and judgements are made in the following areas:
• Impairment of goodwill
• Carrying value of development assets
• Deferred tax recognition
The accounting policies in respect of these items are set out below and further details can be found in notes 11 and 17.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is based on a value in use calculation. The 
value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget and projections for the 
next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that 
will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount 
rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation 
purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating units, including a sensitivity 
analysis, are disclosed further in note 11.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 52
Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Carrying value of development assets
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with Group accounting policy. Initial recognition is based on management’s judgement 
that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone 
according to an established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions 
regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of the benefits.
Deferred tax recognition
The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by tax authorities of the 
respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience with previous 
tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Management 
judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the  
level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. 
New and amended accounting standards and interpretations
The following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations were effective as of 1 January 2012:
• IFRS 1 (amendment) First-time adopters – Hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates (not EU endorsed)
• IFRS 7 (amendment) Disclosures about transfers of financial assets
• IAS 12 (amendment) Deferred tax – recovery of underlying asset
We believe that there are no areas within these standards which have a material impact to the Group.
Interpretations and revised standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s future accounting but which 
the Group has not adopted early. Management has not yet fully assessed the impact of these new standards but does not believe they 
will have any material impact on the financial statements.
• IAS 1 (revised) Presentation of Financial Statements – 1 January 2013
• IFRS 7 (amendment) Offsetting financial assets and liabilities – 1 January 2013
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement – 1 January 2015
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements – 1 January 2014
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements – 1 January 2014
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of interest in other entities – 1 January 2014
• IFRS 13 (revised) Fair Value Measurement – 1 January 2013
• IAS 27 (revised) Consolidated and separate financial statements – 1 January 2014
• IAS 28 (revised) Investments in associates and joint ventures – 1 January 2014
• IAS 32 (amendment) Offsetting financial assets and liabilities – 1 January 2014
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings all made up  
to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Revenue 
Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods and services, excluding value added tax, of the following: 
a) Licence revenue and related software support contracts 
 Licence revenue and software support contract income relating to obligations under contracts is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the contract, on a monthly basis, from the start of the month in which the licence commences. Any balance not 
relating to the accounting period is carried forward as deferred income on the balance sheet. 
b) Data fees
 Data fee income is recognised in the income statement over the period of the contract, on a monthly basis, from the start of the 
month in which the contract commences. Any balance not relating to the accounting period is carried forward as deferred income on 
the balance sheet. Data overage revenue on data contracts (data revenue in excess of contracted amount) is recognised in the period 
that the overage was incurred.
c) Professional services revenue 
 Income relating to consultancy projects is recognised in the income statement as a right to consideration is established as a result  
of performance.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 ...continued 53
d) Royalty revenue 
 Income is recognised in the income statement as rights to consideration accrues.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.  
The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as the Group Executive Board.
Research and development 
Expenditure on research and development comprises salaries and related costs of personnel involved in software programming and 
development activities. Development costs are capitalised where the appropriate recognition criteria in accordance with IAS 38 are met 
including the asset and related costs being separately identifiable, the use of the asset being technically feasible and intended and the 
asset being expected to generate future benefits. As a result there is an intangible asset relating to capitalised development costs (both 
internally developed and acquired) recognised on the Group’s balance sheet where the Board expects the benefits to be recovered 
through incremental revenue from future sales. The carrying values, which are analysed by product, are considered carefully by the 
Board and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not  
be recoverable. 
Intangible assets – customer contracts
Customer contracts acquired with acquisitions are valued based on the net contribution expected to be realised over the estimated life 
of the contracts and discounted at an appropriate discount rate, taking into account any tax effects. The carrying values are reviewed  
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Goodwill 
For business combinations before 1 January 2010, goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration 
including all costs relating to the acquisition and the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. 
In accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised), the calculation of goodwill relating to any acquisitions that completed after 1 January 2010 will  
not include any acquisition related costs. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews. Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 has been frozen with effect from 1 January 2004 and is no longer amortised but subject to annual 
impairment reviews. 
Business combinations
The results and net assets of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the 
acquisition method of accounting from the effective date of acquisition, the date control is gained over the subsidiary. The results, and 
net assets of subsidiary undertakings disposed of, are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the acquisition 
method of accounting to the effective date of disposal. Income and expenditure relating to transactions between Group undertakings 
are eliminated on consolidation. 
Amortisation
The cost of other intangibles assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:
Development costs internally generated – 33% per annum
Customer contracts – over the period of the contracts (between 3 and 7 years) 
Other intangibles – software – between 14% and 33% per annum
Other intangibles – website development costs – 33% per annum 
Other intangibles – trademarks – 10% per annum 
Depreciation
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:
Improvements to short leasehold property – over the period of the lease (between 3 and 12 years)
Office equipment – between 10% and 20% per annum 
Fixtures and fittings – between 10% and 20% per annum 
Computer equipment – 33% per annum 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost including estimated contingent consideration less any provisions for impairment. 54
Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Current and deferred taxation 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate 
taxable income. Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements at the balance sheet date and where these transactions or events result in an 
obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. Temporary differences are differences between the Group’s taxable 
profits and its results as stated in the financial statements. Deferred taxation assets are only recognised when their recoverability is 
more probable than not. Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the 
temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Recognised deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Leased assets 
Rentals applicable to operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available 
for sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. The Directors determine the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category  
if acquired principally for the purpose of use in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are presented as current assets.
b) Loans and receivables
 Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are presented in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, 
which are presented as non-current assets. 
c) Available-for-sale financial assets
 The Company does not hold any assets available for sale (other than investments in subsidiaries which are deemed to be assets 
available for sale).
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of prepaid transaction costs) and the redemption value (including interest) is recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current 
liabilities unless the facility is committed such that the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months  
from the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments of less than three months’ maturity (which are considered to have 
insignificant risk to a change in value) to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and are 
presented within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the 
effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability.
Pensions 
The Group provides contributions on behalf of certain Directors and employees to a defined contribution pension scheme. 
Contributions payable in the year are charged to the income statement.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 ...continued 55
Share-based payments 
In common with many high-growth technology enterprises, the Company has issued a number of share options to executives and 
employees. Under IFRS, the equity-settled share-based payment awards are valued at fair value at inception and this cost is recognised 
over the option vesting period (typically three years). As there is no readily available market price for the options the Board has used an 
independent model to estimate the fair value of the options. There are a number of assumptions that affect the value and the Board has 
carefully considered these assumptions in order to derive an appropriate charge for the cost of options (note 20). The financial effect of 
awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its 
individual statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary 
undertakings. 
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividend becomes a liability of the Company. In the case of an interim dividend this is on the payment date; for final dividends 
this arises on the passing of the relevant resolution at the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders.
Exceptional items
Significant items which are separately disclosed on the face of the income statement by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to 
the income statement. The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The profit and loss for the year is translated at the average rate for the year. The exchange differences arising on 
retranslation of opening net assets are taken to other comprehensive income. The difference between the profit and loss at the average 
rate and closing rate are taken to other comprehensive income. All other translation differences are taken to the income statement. 
2 Segmental information 
The Group’s operating segments have been determined based on the information regularly reviewed by the Group Executive Board, 
which has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The Group Executive Board considers the business to be  
split into two primary geographical markets: EMEAA and North America and central costs, which relate to the expenses of the Group’s 
headquarters and costs directly associated with the Parent Company, which are managed by the Group management team. The external 
debt is also held within Central. 
All revenue, profit/(loss) before taxation and total assets are attributable to the principal activity of the Group, being the development, 
marketing and distribution of software systems and the provision of web-based portfolio analysis and asset pricing services to the 
global asset management industry. Segment assets represent those assets arising from the operating activities of those segments. 
Segment results exclude the impact of any intercompany recharges of revenues or costs. Revenue was generated in the UK of 
£5.9 million (2011: £6.3 million) with non-current assets held by UK entities totalling £32.6million (2011: £21.5 million).

8 Non-controlling interests 
Non-controlling interests amounted to nil book value at the year end (2011: nil). The Group exercised its option to acquire a 49% 
non-controlling interest in SiSoft in June 2010 for an estimated contingent consideration of approximately £1.4 million and our estimate 
of the measurement of the liability has not changed (allowing for fluctuations in exchange rates), however, as the vendors are disputing 
certain aspects of the valuation, the process has not been completed as originally expected. In January 2011, a legal process in the 
French Commercial Court was commenced to try to resolve the matter and formally complete the acquisition and this is ongoing. It is 
possible that the matter will not be fully resolved during 2013 and we will provide a further update if the position changes materially  
or on the completion of the acquisition.

The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 1.9p per Ordinary Share for 2012 (2011: 1.85p) resulting in a total dividend for  
the year of 2.7p per Ordinary Share (2011: 2.6p). If the 2012 final dividend is approved at the Annual General Meeting in May 2013 the 
dividend will be paid on 22 May 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 26 April 2013 (ex-div date 24 April 2013). 
In accordance with IFRS, the dividend is not provided for as a liability in the accounts until it becomes a legal liability of the Company 
and will therefore be recorded in the interim and annual accounts for 2013.  60

10 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders by the weighted average number of 
Ordinary Shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted number of Ordinary Shares 
outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares into Ordinary Shares. The Company has two categories of dilutive 
potential Ordinary Shares: shares to be issued and share options. For the share options, a calculation is performed to determine the 
number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s 
shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options. The number of shares 
calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The movement on goodwill relates to exchange differences of £1.17 million (2011: £0.93 million). The total goodwill of £51.52 million 
includes goodwill for the North American region of £34.53 million (2011: £35.32 million) and goodwill for the EMEAA region of 
£16.99 million (2011: £17.37 million).
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 ...continued 61
Goodwill impairment review
The carrying value of goodwill arising on acquisition is reviewed at each balance sheet date to assess whether there has been any 
impairment. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) by considering the Group’s share of the cash 
that is expected to be generated by the business or product that was acquired. The evaluation is based on management forecasts over 
the period five years forward and assuming a terminal value based on 3% growth thereafter. Discount rates are based upon a prudent 
risk-adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
2012 2011
Discount rate for CGUs 
EMEAA 9% 10%
NA 10% 10%
To assess for impairment, the value in use of the CGU is compared to the goodwill. If the resultant net present value of the discounted 
cash flows is less than the carrying value for goodwill the difference is written off through the income statement. Key assumptions in  
the projection of cash flows are: levels of new sales, renewal rates, growth in expenses and the discount rate. Management base these 
projections on the latest budgets and forecasts which take into account market conditions and economic factors. The headroom is 
therefore dependent upon sensitivities to these and other assumptions. The largest element of goodwill is in the North American region 
and if there were no growth in EBITDA in the region then this could result in impairment. However, it is not considered that there would 
be any impairment based on any reasonable set of assumptions. 
2012 2011
Sensitivity for North America
Headroom at 10% discount rate £16 million £4 million
Headroom at 7.5% discount rate £48 million £31 million
Discount rate indicating impairment 13% 11%
The Board believe that the 10% discount rate as being cautious with an acceptable range being 6%–10%. The fair value measure is also 
sensitive to exchange rates, and could have an impact on goodwill impairment assessment. In particular the value of goodwill related  
to the FRI acquisition is linked to the Canadian dollar, whereas the underlying projection of cash flows is linked to exchange rates for 
several currencies. As a result, a strengthening Canadian dollar could have an adverse impact on the measured headroom. The goodwill 
on all acquisitions has been reviewed and, in the opinion of the Directors, there is no impairment to the carrying value at 31 December 
2012 (2011: nil).

Acquired and internally generated development costs
Expenditure on research and development comprises salaries and related costs of personnel involved in software programming and 
development activities. Development costs are capitalised, where recognition criteria are met. As a result, there is an intangible asset 
relating to capitalised development costs (both internally developed and acquired) recognised on the Group’s balance sheet where the 
Board expects the benefits to be recovered through incremental revenue from future sales. Development expenditure is amortised  
over a three year period as, in the opinion of the Directors, this is the period over which the benefits arise. The carrying values, which  
are analysed by product, are considered carefully by the Board and if there has been any impairment in any development costs then  
the carrying value is written down accordingly. There was no impairment in 2012 (2011: nil). 
Customer contracts
Customer contracts acquired were valued on acquisition by estimating the future cash flows to be derived from those contracts over  
a period varying between three and seven years depending on the type of contract and discounting cash flows at a discount rate of  
10% (2011: 10%), adjusting for any tax impact. The resultant fair value for the acquired customer contracts is amortised over a period of 
between three and seven years as, in the opinion of the Directors, this is the period over which the benefits arise. At each balance sheet 
date the current values of the original contracts is reviewed against the carrying values to assess for impairment. The acquired customer 
contracts have been reviewed and, in the opinion of the Directors, there is no impairment to the carrying value at 31 December 2012 
(2011: nil).

total potential deferred tax asset of £1.32 million (2011: £1.19 million), a total of £0.38 million (2011: £0.65 million), which represents 29% 
(2011: 55%) of the total potential asset, was recognised at the end of the year. Deferred tax has been calculated at an estimated average 
rate for the Group of 29% (2011: 27%). A proportion of the deferred tax assets for the Group has been recognised as in the opinion of the 
Directors this is the probable level of the recoverability of such losses.

No deferred tax liability with respect to unremitted earnings has been recognised at the balance sheet date. Undistributed profits 
available to be remitted to the UK should meet the requirements of the UK dividend exemption and should, therefore, be exempt from 
UK Corporation tax. No deferred tax liability has been recognised with respect to the value of the underlying subsidiaries since, in the 
event of a sale, a gain or loss arising on disposal should meet the UK Substantial Shareholders Exemption criteria and, therefore, be 
exempt from UK corporate tax. A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% was effective from 1 April 2012. A further 
reduction from 24% to 23% was substantively enacted in July 2012 and will be effective from 1 April 2013. Accordingly, these rates have 
been applied in the measurement of the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2012.  68
Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
18 Financial instruments and financial risk management
The Company’s and Group’s key financial risks and its approach to managing these risks are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 18 to 19.
a) Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, money market deposits, bank loans, provisions, derivative financial instruments  
and various other accounts receivable and accounts payable, that arise directly from its operations.
Cash and money market deposits, when held, are carried at fair value. All financial assets except derivatives belong to the category 
‘loans and receivables’ in IAS 39. All financial liabilities except derivatives are held at amortised cost. The only derivative financial 
instruments relate to forward currency contracts which are purchased from banks and are considered Level 2 financial instruments  
in accordance with IFRS 7.
Bank loans are recorded at the value of the proceeds received less any direct issue costs which, due to the short term nature of these 
instruments, approximates to fair value. They are subsequently stated at cost plus accrued interest, less any repayments which, due  
to the short term nature of these instruments, approximates to amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Further information on contingent consideration can be found in note 16.
Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to hedge against various financial risks, such as foreign currency and interest 
rate risk. They are initially recognised at fair value and are designated by the entity at fair value through profit or loss. 
As at 31 December 2012, the Group held forward currency hedging contracts to mitigate the effects of currency exposure relating  
to non-sterling financial assets and liabilities, cash flows and investments. The fair value of forward currency contracts relating to 
commercial transactions is recognised through the income statement, the net unrealised gain in respect of these contracts as at 
31 December 2012 was £9,000 (2011: £96,000). The fair value of forward currency contracts relating to hedging of net investments 
designated in hedge accounting relationships is recognised through equity, and the net unrealised loss relating to these contracts 
recognised through equity as at 31 December 2012 was £14,000 (2011: £40,000 gain).
The Company recognises financial instruments in its accounts when it enters into a binding agreement to receive cash or other economic 
benefits and derecognises them once all parties to the agreement have discharged all of their obligations. 
Interest income and expenses are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis. Realised gains and losses upon expiry  
of derivative financial instruments are recognised on settlement of the underlying contract.

Committed facilities
In May 2012 an agreement was signed with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc to extend our existing financing facilities until May 2015,  
with an option to extend for a further two years, subject to customary covenants and terms. At 31 December 2012, the facility was 
£9.5 million (£7.5 million of which is available as a revolving credit facility) reducing by £0.5 million tranches every six months to 
£5.5 million in May 2015. This restructured facility strengthens our financial position and provides financing options at a commercial 
cost and provides more flexibility than the previous arrangement, which was negotiated in early 2009.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 ...continued 69
As a result the current facilities available as at 31 December 2012 comprise:
• Multi-currency fully revolving three-year amortising facility amounting to an initial value of £8 million (£7.5 million at December 2012) 
with six-monthly repayments of £0.5 million.
• Flexibility to repay early with no penalty and to redraw within the amortising limits.
• Option to extend for two more years to May 2017 (subject to The Royal Bank of Scotland plc Credit Committee approval and 
compliance with covenants). 
• Multi-currency revolving working capital loan of £2.0 million (£2.0 million available at December 2012). 
There are covenants associated with the facility primarily relating to the gearing (net debt/EBITDA), interest cover and debt service 
ratios. Repayments of the facilities are on a six-monthly basis and subject to compliance with the covenants, the facility remains 
committed until May 2015. As part of the secured financing arrangement with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc, the bank has security  
over certain Group’s assets, including pledges over shares in certain subsidiaries.

Net investment in foreign operations
As part of our liability management, in order to provide a partial currency hedge against movements in the fair value of investments  
in overseas subsidiaries, we have made use of currency swaps to create synthetic currency hedges denominated in a mixture of 
currencies (USD, CAD, and EUR). At 31 December 2012, the Group had currency swaps in place, with a notional principal amount of  
£5.23 million (2011: £5.41 million) as synthetic loan hedges. The Group recognised a net gain on the hedging instrument of £0.14 million 
(2011: £0.11 million) in equity.

Trade creditors, other creditors and accruals and other taxes of £4.29 million (2011: £4.13 million) have been excluded from the above 
tables and are non-interest bearing. 
Floating rate financial liabilities predominantly relate to bank loans in sterling, Canadian dollars, US dollars and euros. Some debt is 
denominated in currencies in order to provide a currency hedge for profits generated by overseas subsidiaries and the investments  
in those overseas net assets. 
Interest rate risk
As at the 31 December 2012 the Group had no borrowings and therefore it has not assumed any risk sensitivity to reasonably possible 
changes in interest rates (with all other variables held constant) of the Group’s profit before tax through the impact of floating rate 
borrowings. In 2011, the Group assessed the risk of a 100 basis point increase to have a negative impact of the Group’s profit before  
tax of £63,000 and a 100 basis point decrease to have a positive impact of the Group’s profit before tax of £63,000, (any risk has been 
limited because of the interest rate cap purchased as described above.) 72
Business Review / Governance / Financial Statements
Currency risk
The Group’s principal exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises on the translation of overseas net assets and trading results into 
sterling for accounting purposes. The Group has a minimal transaction risk as most of the transactions are invoiced by the entities in 
their local currency. Where there are material exposures, these are covered by taking out currency contracts to eliminate the exposure. 
However, offsetting revenues against costs in the same currency reduces this risk so that only the residual accounting profit translation 
element is at risk. The balance sheet exposures are minimised by reducing the net asset exposure, for example, by arranging borrowings 
in local currency where appropriate. Where the resulting hedge qualifies for hedge accounting under IAS 39 the gains and losses on the 
translation of both the loan and the investment are deferred in equity. As the Group continues to grow and generates greater net profits 
overseas this exchange rate exposure will increase. Following the increase in the percentage of the Group’s operations that are overseas, 
the exposure to US dollars and euros in particular has increased. 
The table below shows the estimated sensitivity of the profit before tax and the net assets to movements in the key exchange rates to 
which the Group is exposed. If the US dollar and the euro strengthen/(weaken) against sterling this is expected to increase/(decrease) 
profits as shown below.

The main balance sheet translation exposure is to the revaluation of goodwill denominated in foreign currency; the largest component 
relates to the goodwill arising on the acquisition of FRI, a Canadian business and is denominated in Canadian dollars. A depreciation of 
10% in sterling against Canadian dollar would result in a £3.6 million increase in net assets and an appreciation of 10% in sterling against 
Canadian dollar would result in a £2.9 million decrease in net assets.
The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is approximately equal to book value. The Group has a forward foreign exchange 
facility which allows the Group to hedge foreign exchange exposures. The Group does not permit anyone in the Group to trade in 
financial instruments.
Counterparty credit risk
This is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Credit risks are associated with deposits with banks 
and receivables from customers. The Group takes into account the credit risk of the counterparty to any major bank deposits but 
currently the level of bank deposits is such that this is not considered a material risk. There is no large concentration of credit risk with 
customers as the largest customer group currently represents less than 6% of projected Group revenues. The maximum exposure to 
credit risk comprises the value of the Group’s cash and debtor balances from time to time.
Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its cash obligations when due. The Group manages this risk by close 
monitoring of projected cash collection from customers and cash obligations to suppliers and salary payments to staff, as well as all 
other cash commitments. At 31 December 2012, the Group also had £9.50 million headroom under its committed revolving credit and 
overdraft facility in addition to cash reserves to reduce the risk that an unforeseen change in the Group’s liquidity position will result  
in a breach of statutory or other payment obligations. 
The table below summarises the maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities as at 31 December 2012 and 2011 based on contractual 
undiscounted payments.

Capital risk
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain further 
development of the business. The Board monitors the composition of investors as well as the return on capital, measured as earnings 
per share (profit attributable to shareholders divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year).  
The capital managed by the Group comprises equity of £49.62 million (2011: £43.83 million) and borrowings of nil (2011: £5.84 million)  
as capital.

The Company has only one class of Ordinary Shares in issue and there are no restrictions regarding voting or other distribution or 
repayment rights. At 31 December 2012 the Company held 225,000 shares in treasury (2011: 225,000), and therefore 67,478,650 
Ordinary Shares is the number of shares that may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by 
which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company 
under the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules, and for earnings per share calculations. The share premium account has increased

Share based payments
Under the approved and unapproved option schemes the Remuneration Committee can grant options to employees of the Group. 
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price which is typically issued at a premium to the market price. The contractual life is 
generally 10 years from date of grant although occasionally a shorter period has been chosen. Options become exercisable after three 
years although exceptionally the period is shorter. Options issued to Directors and senior executives carry performance criteria. There 
are other vesting conditions for options identified in the scheme rules, including performance conditions which are in the option terms 
with typically eps growth above a minimum hurdle, share price growth above a minimum level and a vesting period of three years. 
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair market value after consideration of market based 
performance conditions has been estimated using the following key assumptions:

Fair value of options issued in year 10.98p 11.37p 12.81p 21.95p 9.05p
The risk free rate is based on the yield to maturity of a UK government bond for a term consistent with the assumed life of the options. 
The average share price in the year was 94p. The average market share price for options exercised during the year was 90p. The 
expected volatility level was determined by comparing the historic and current volatility for the Company and comparing with the 
average volatility for companies in the same sector to determine a reasonable estimate for the future volatility. Following lapses in share 
options as a result of failure to meet performance criteria, there was a net credit to the share based payments. The total credit in the 
income statement for the year relating to employee share based payments for the Group was £159,000 (2011: charge of £119,000) and 
for the Company was £197,000 (2011: charge of £11,000).
There were 1,114,367 options exercisable at the balance sheet date (2011: 2,724,700) with a weighted average exercise price of 90p (2011: 
93p). The weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding at the balance sheet date is 6.36 years (2011: 3.85 years).
21 Related party transactions
During the year, the Group paid a fee of £18,695 (2011: £33,486) for training courses and other services supplied by Otos Limited,  
of which CR Bacon is a Director. The year-end creditor balance with Otos Limited was £4,000 (2011: £6,000).
StatPro Group plc made a financial support payment of £25,000 in 2012 (2011: nil) to The Freedom Index Company Ltd, a recently 
established not-for-profit organisation, of which Carl Bacon, Chairman is a Director. The Freedom Index Company Ltd is creating the 
Freedom Index benchmarks, which will be made available free-of-charge to the asset management community. Carl Bacon receives  
no fee for his services as a Director of The Freedom Index Company Ltd.
During the year, the Group paid a fee of £183,600 (2011: £37,005) for consultancy services supplied by Mark Adorian (Non-Executive 
Director) in relation to Revolution sales initiatives including developing the sales function. The year-end creditor balance with Mark 
Adorian was £19,176 (2011: £25,961). It is anticipated that as the StatPro Revolution sales teams develop, Mark Adorian’s consultancy 
time commitment will reduce in 2013.
During the year the Group used the services of Buzzacott, Chartered Accountants of which GFMT Wheatley (Company Secretary until 
25 January 2012) is a partner. The purchases from Buzzacott in 2012 were £1,950 (2011: £18,640).  78

25 Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for Directors and certain employees. The total costs of pensions 
contributions during the year were £478,000 (2011: £532,000). Contributions outstanding at the end of December 2012 were £26,000 
(2011: £37,000). 
26 Contingent liabilities
As is normal for a group of our size and scope of operations, Group companies are involved in a number of potential legal claims and 
disputes from time to time arising from our activities, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial results.
As noted in our Annual Reports for 2010 and 2011, the Group exercised its option to acquire a 49% non-controlling interest in SiSoft in 
June 2010 for an estimated contingent consideration of approximately £1.4 million. The vendors are disputing certain aspects of the 
valuation and the process has not been completed as originally expected. The legal process in the French Commercial Court commenced 
in 2011 by us to try to resolve the matter is still ongoing and it is possible that it will not be fully resolved during 2013. There is therefore 
a risk that the final consideration determined by the Court including related costs will be higher than the amount provided, although the 
Board’s estimate of the measurement of the liability has not changed (allowing for fluctuations in exchange rates – see note 16). We will 
provide a further update if the position changes materially or on the completion of the acquisition.

I	 am	 pleased	 to	 report	 a	 stable	 set	
of	 results	 for	 2009	 despite	 trading	
conditions	 that	 have	 been	 more	 difficult	
than	 any	 that	 we	 have	 encountered	
since	 the	 inception	 of	 the	 Company.
Results
Turnover	 reduced	 by	 8%	 to	 £12.8m	
(2008:	 £13.9m),	 although	 the	 regional	
breakdown	 of	 results	 varied,	 with	 North	
America	 faring	 better	 than	 both	 Europe	
and	 Asia.	 The	 relatively	 small	 fall	 in	
turnover	 considering	 the	 harsh	 market	
background	 is	 evidence	 of	 the	 strength	
of	 Vero	 Software’s	 recurring	 revenues.
EBITDA	 (earnings	 before	 interest,	 tax,	
depreciation	 and	 amortisation)	 increased	
by	 10%	 to	 £2.0m	 (2008:	 £1.8m),	
helped	 by	 cost-saving	 measures	 taken	
during	 the	 year.	 Operating	 profit	 was	
24%	 lower	 at	 £0.83m	 (2008:	 £1.09m)	
and	 profit	 before	 tax	 was	 34%	 lower	
at	 £0.6m	 (2008:	 £0.9m),	 the	 reduction	
due	 mainly	 to	 increased	 amortisation	
and	 exceptional	 depreciation	 on	 the	
write	 down	 of	 a	 property.	 Fully	 diluted	
earnings	 per	 share	 were	 1.94p	 (2008:	
2.27p).
There	 was	 an	 overall	 tax	 credit	 of	
£132,000	 (2008:	 £75,000	 charge),	
largely	 due	 to	 R&D	 tax	 credits	 received	
in	 Italy.
The	 earnings	 and	 profit	 figures	
mentioned	 above	 are	 stated	 after	
exceptional	 costs	 of	 £201,000	 which	
were	 incurred	 during	 the	 year.	 These	
included	 redundancy	 costs	 and	 the	
exceptional	 depreciation	 relating	 to	 the	
property	 write	 down.
The	 Company	 completed	 the	
refinancing	 of	 its	 UK	 loans	 in	 December	
2009,	 raising	 £2.0m.	 This	 was	 used	
to	 repay	 the	 Group’s	 outstanding	
balances	 with	 Fortis	 Bank	 and	 to	
improve	 working	 capital	 levels	 to	
pre-recession	 levels.
Offer
On	 16	 September	 2009,	 the	 Company	
announced	 that	 it	 was	 in	 talks	 which	
may	 or	 may	 not	 lead	 to	 an	 offer	 for	
the	 Company.	 Discussions	 with	 more	
than	 one	 party	 subsequently	 followed	
and,	 at	 the	 time	 of	 going	 to	 press,	 the	
Company	 is	 pleased	 to	 report	 that	
negotiations	 are	 now	 at	 an	 advanced	
stage	 and	 it	 expects	 to	 be	 able	 to	 make	
an	 announcement	 within	 the	 next	 week.	
There	 can	 however	 be	 no	 certainty	 that	
an	 offer	 will	 be	 made	 nor	 as	 to	 the	 terms	
on	 which	 any	 offer	 might	 be	 made.
Outlook
2009	 was	 the	 most	 serious	 market	
downturn	 for	 the	 Company	 since	 its	
formation	 in	 1988.	 It	 has	 weathered	
many	 recessions	 in	 that	 period	
and	 maintained	 a	 growing	 outlook.	
The	 severity	 of	 the	 2009	 downturn	
was	 countered	 by	 strong	 recurring	
revenues,	 the	 use	 of	 technology	 as	 a	
prime	 mover	 in	 reducing	 costs	 and	 the	
growing	 requirement	 on	 customers	
during	 harder	 times	 to	 produce	 new	
models	 of	 their	 products.
Although	 there	 are	 some	 signs	 of	
recovery	 in	 Europe	 and	 China,	 many	
of	 our	 major	 markets	 remain	 cautious,	
with	 2010	 investment	 forecasts	 in	
mould	 and	 stamping	 technologies	
remaining	 at	 similar	 levels	 to	 last	
year.	 Initial	 2010	 trading	 reflects	 this	
continuing	 lack	 of	 market	 confidence.
The	 efforts	 of	 the	 long	 serving	 staff	 of	
Vero	 Software	 remain	 of	 paramount	
importance	 for	 our	 success	 and	 they	
have	 proved	 themselves	 yet	 again	
within	 the	 extreme	 environment	 of	
2009.	 The	 board	 of	 Vero	 (the	 “Board”)	
would	 like	 to	 take	 this	 opportunity	
to	 thank	 them	 all	 for	 their	 focused	
contribution	 during	 the	 year.

Vero helps ‘smart’ tooling 
production 
BK	 Tooling	 is	 a	 thriving	 sub-
contractor	 specialising	 in	 the	 design	
and	 production	 of	 mould	 tools	 and	
prototype/low	 volume	 plastic	 injection	
mouldings.	
BK	 are	 heavy	 users	 of	 CAD/CAM	 and	
have	 been	 continually	 adding	 to	 their	
software	 portfolio	 from	 Vero	 Software	
for	 over	 10	 years.	 It	 is	 the	 most	
recent	 addition	 VISI	 Flow,	 that	 has	
proved	 to	 be	 hugely	 beneficial	 during	
a	 project	 for	 the	 rear	 passenger	 arm	
rest	 for	 a	 prestige	 automotive	 supplier	
renowned	 for	 comfort	 and	 style.	
Before	 starting	 the	 tool	 design,	 a	
plastic	 flow	 analysis	 was	 undertaken	
to	 simulate	 the	 filling	 process.	
Importantly,	 the	 system	 highlighted	
areas	 where	 sink	 marks	 would	 occur	
due	 to	 internal	 voids	 and	 after	 further	
analysis,	 the	 tool	 design	 was	 modified	
to	 core	 out	 the	 problem	 areas.
Basing	 a	 tool	 design	 on	 a	 preventive	
flow	 analysis	 can	 detect	 potential	
manufacturing	 issues	 providing	 the	
maximum	 possible	 time	 frame	 for	
a	 corrective	 solution.	 Typically,	 a	
project	 of	 this	 complexity	 would	 take	
10	 -	 12	 weeks.	 However,	 using	 the	
entire	 suite	 of	 VISI	 software,	 the	 3D	
tool	 was	 designed,	 cut	 and	 built	
within	 5	 weeks.	
Concluding,	 Bob	 Tunks,	 owner	 of	
BK	 Tooling	 explains,	 “We	 often	 deal	
with	 complex	 products	 and	 without	
the	 use	 of	 intelligent	 software,	 we	
could	 never	 guarantee	 project	
completion	 and	 the	 supply	 of	 batch	
mouldings	 within	 such	 short	 time	
scales.	 Vero	 are	 highly	 regarded	 in	
our	 organisation	 and	 have	 become	 an	
integral	 part	 of	 our	 operations.	 Their	
industry	 knowledge	 translates	 into	
an	 excellent	 product	 with	 unrivalled	
customer	 support.”
VISI Flow results accurately match the 
actual moulding conditions.

“The use of PEPS means that a 
program which may have taken 
half a day to complete with our 
old system is now available in half 
an hour” 
Mr Larrandabure Workshop 
Manager 
Time to change  
Based	 in	 Besançon	 (East	 of	 France),	
Fralsen	 is	 a	 company	 who	 specialise	
in	 the	 production	 of	 mechanical	
pieces	 for	 watches.	 Part	 of	 the	 Timex	
group,	 the	 main	 emphasis	 is	 the	
manufacture	 of	 business	 watches,	
but	 the	 Company	 is	 also	 involved	
in	 the	 design	 of	 cutting	 tools	 and	
injection	 moulds.	
Often	 working	 with	 tolerances	 of	 less	
than	 one	 micron	 (0.001mm),	 Fralsen	
recognised	 that	 cutting	 edge	 Wire	
EDM	 technology	 was	 essential	 to	 the	
future	 success	 of	 their	 manufacturing	
business.	 In	 this	 world	 of	 sharpness	
and	 precision,	 wire	 EDM	 technology	
enables	 the	 machine	 to	 cut	 intricate	
contours	 and	 internal	 corners	 with	
very	 small	 corner	 radii	 based	 on	
the	 wire	 diameter	 and	 spark	 gap.	
It	 becomes	 easy	 to	 cut	 square	
apertures	 without	 the	 need	 of	 splitting	
the	 mould	 or	 producing	 accurate	 pin	
holes	 in	 a	 plate	 after	 heat	 treatment.	
Support	 for	 unmanned	 or	 overnight	
machining	 is	 possible	 by	 leaving	 slugs	
attached	 while	 all	 of	 the	 preliminary	
cuts	 are	 taken.	 For	 example,	 taking	
all	 of	 the	 rough	 and	 finish	 cuts	 while	
leaving	 the	 tag	 in	 place	 and	 finally	
removing	 the	 tag	 and	 skimming	 the	
remaining	 area.	
After	 a	 lengthy	 software	 evaluation,	
and	 a	 recommendation	 from	 Makino,	
PEPS	 Wire	 EDM	 was	 selected	 to	
drive	 the	 Agié	 Evolution	 2	 and	 a	
Makino	 PH2	 wire	 EDM	 machines	 on	
the	 shopfloor.	
A choice based on experience 
Fralsen	 have	 over	 20	 years	
experience	 of	 Wire	 EDM	 technology.	
Mr	 Larrandabure,	 workshop	 manager	
explains	 the	 reasons	 for	 upgrading	
their	 technology.	 “Wire	 EDM	 is	
a	 vital	 part	 of	 our	 operation	 and	
we	 were	 looking	 to	 save	 time	 for	
the	 2	 engineers	 in	 charge	 of	 the	
EDM	 machines.	 In	 fact,	 we	 were	
convinced	 that	 using	 the	 latest	
computer	 technology,	 we	 could	 not	
only	 improve	 our	 productivity	 but	
also	 make	 better	 use	 of	 the	 machine	
capabilities”.	
Mr	 Larrandabure	 continues,	
“Customer	 data	 is	 commonly	
supplied	 as	 3D	 data	 so	 the	 software	
must	 be	 able	 to	 manage	 to	 read	
Parasolid	 and	 IGES	 files	 and	 extract	
the	 relevant	 EDM	 features.	 Whatever	
the	 quality	 of	 the	 model	 data,	 the	
software	 must	 know	 how	 to	 quickly	
generate	 the	 programs	 by	 removing	
the	 laborious	 tasks	 and	 helping	 the	
engineer	 with	 intelligent	 decisions.	 We	
want	 the	 engineers	 to	 concentrate	
on	 their	 job	 and	 not	 be	 constrained	
by	 the	 limitations	 imposed	 by	 the	
software.”	
With	 an	 existing	 CADCAM	 system	
already	 in	 place,	 it	 was	 imperative	
that	 the	 new	 solution	 was	 operational	
immediately	 with	 no	 down-turn	 in	
productivity.	 The	 selection	 of	 PEPS	
was	 based	 on	 real	 programming	 of	
live	 jobs	 and	 the	 guarantee	 of	 highly	
tuned	 post	 processors.

Business review
The	 Company	 sells	 software	 in	 a	
market	 niche	 that	 provides	 mould	 and	
die	 makers	 with	 the	 ability	 to	 design,	
simulate,	 plan,	 cost	 and	 machine	
their	 products	 across	 a	 wide	 range	
of	 sectors	 including	 automotive,	
aerospace,	 electronic,	 medical,	 toys	
and	 household	 goods.	 Last	 year,	 all	
of	 these	 sectors	 suffered	 some	 lack	
of	 confidence	 but	 sales	 continued	
to	 those	 looking	 to	 cut	 costs	 and	
improve	 productivity	 through	 software	
that	 reduced	 the	 resources	 required	 to	
produce	 the	 necessary	 moulds	
and	 dies.
The	 downturn	 was	 not	 spread	 evenly	
through	 the	 regions	 and	 while	 sales	
in	 Japan	 and	 Italy	 fell	 with	 respect	 to	
2008,	 those	 in	 North	 America,	 France	
and	 UK	 all	 grew.	 Even	 among	 the	
sectors	 supplied	 the	 effects	 were	
relatively	 unpredictable,	 with	 plastic	
based	 products	 doing	 less	 well	 than	
sheet	 metal,	 whilst	 software	 used	
solely	 by	 the	 automotive	 sector	
surprisingly	 grew	 substantially.
The	 worst	 hit	 sectors	 were	 those	
associated	 with	 machine	 tools,	
where	 worldwide	 investment	 in	 both	
machines	 and	 software	 were	 very	 low	
causing	 some	 of	 the	 major	 machine	
tool	 producing	 countries	 to	 initiate	 new	
incentives.
Software	 maintenance	 and	 service	
revenues	 held	 up	 well	 as	 a	 result	
of	 many	 customers	 relying	 on	 the	
productivity	 improvements	 brought	
in	 through	 new	 releases	 and	 the	
expertise	 of	 the	 product	 support.
Operating expenses
As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 anticipated	 fall	 in	
revenue,	 the	 Company	 took	 swift	
action	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 2009	 to	
reduce	 budgeted	 operating	 costs.	
This	 was	 later	 supplemented	 by	 a	
temporary	 reduction	 in	 personnel	
costs,	 mostly	 through	 short	 time	
working	 during	 the	 summer	 and	
autumn	 periods.	 Tight	 control	 of	
expenditure	 led	 to	 a	 13%	 reduction	 in	
selling	 expenses	 before	 exceptional	
items.	 Administrative	 expenses	 rose	
by	 7%	 but	 this	 was	 largely	 as	 a	 result	
of	 exchange	 rate	 movements,	 with	 the	
underlying	 administrative	 costs	 in	 local	
currency	 lower	 than	 in	 2008.
Product development
Product	 development	 expenditure	
of	 £1,303,000	 has	 been	 capitalised	
(2008:	 £1,008,000)	 in	 accordance	
with	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	
Standards.	 The	 Board	 strongly	
believes	 that	 the	 continued	 investment	
in	 product	 development	 is	 fundamental	
to	 current	 software	 sales,	 future	
growth	 and	 customer	 loyalty.
The	 product	 solutions	 are	 increasingly	
being	 applied	 to	 the	 whole	 process	
relating	 to	 mould	 and	 die	 production	
and	 from	 product	 design	 and	 planning	
to	 mould	 performance	 analysis,	
building	 and	 precision	 machining.
Taxation and earnings per share
Earnings	 before,	 interest,	 tax,	
depreciation	 and	 amortisation	
(EBITDA)	 were	 £2.0m,	 an	 increase	
of	 10%	 compared	 to	 the	 previous	
year	 (2008:	 £1.8m).	 The	 Group	
also	 recorded	 a	 pre-tax	 profit	 after	
exceptionals	 of	 £0.6m	 (2008:	 £.0.9m).	
This	 reduction	 was	 mainly	 a	 result	 of	
increased	 amortisation	 charges	 and	 an

exceptional	 write	 down	 of	 a	 property.	
The	 Group	 received	 a	 net	 tax	 credit	 of	
£0.13m	 (2008:	 £0.07m	 charge).	 The	
tax	 credit	 has	 arisen	 mainly	 because	
of	 research	 and	 development	 tax	
credits	 received	 in	 Italy	 and	 the	 UK.	
Exceptional	 costs	 of	 £201,000	 (2008:	
£445,000)	 were	 incurred	 during	 the	
year.	 These	 included	 redundancy	
costs	 of	 £46,000,	 a	 £26,000	 provision	
for	 an	 onerous	 lease	 and	 £129,000	
exceptional	 depreciation	 relating	 to	
the	 write	 down	 of	 a	 property.	 Post	 tax	
profit	 after	 exceptionals	 was	 £0.74m	
(2008:	 £0.85m)	 and	 basic	 earnings	 per	
share	 were	 2.00p	 (2008:	 2.28p).
Cash flow and net funds
Cash	 flows	 from	 operating	 activities	 in	
2009	 were	 £1.7m	 compared	 to	 £1.9m	
in	 2008.	 The	 cash	 balances	 at	 the	
year	 end	 were	 £2.3m	 (2008:	 £1.6m),	
with	 £1.5m	 of	 short-term	 borrowings	
(2008:	 £1.5m),	 resulting	 in	 net	 funds	
of	 £0.87m	 (2008:	 £0.09m).	 Net	 debt	
reduced	 to	 £2.2m	 from	 £2.9m.	 The	
Company	 completed	 a	 refinancing	 of	
its	 UK	 loans	 in	 December	 2009	 with	 an	
advance	 of	 £2m	 from	 the	 Capital	 for	
Enterprise	 Fund.	 These	 funds	 were
used	 to	 repay	 the	 Group’s	 outstanding	
balances	 with	 Fortis	 Bank	 and	 restore	
working	 capital	 levels	 to	 pre-recession	
levels.
Interest	 payments	 during	 the	 year	 were	
£159,000	 (2008:	 £213,000).
Summary
The	 Company	 proved	 to	 be	 fairly	
resilient	 to	 a	 strong	 global	 recession	
through	 its	 hallmarks	 of	 technological	
innovation,	 customer	 support	 and	
repeat	 transactions.	
2009	 was	 a	 predictably	 difficult	 year	
for	 trading	 but	 the	 Company	 managed	
to	 broadly	 reduce	 its	 costs	 in	 line	 with	
revenues,	 in	 a	 timely	 fashion,	 so	 as	 to	
maintain	 profitability	 and	 cash	 flow.
A	 number	 of	 product	 improvements	
have	 still	 to	 come	 on	 stream	 in	 2010	
and	 these	 should	 provide	 further	
draught-proofing	 against	 the	 cold	 wind	
of	 recessionary	 times.

consideration	 and	 approval	 of	 significant	 expenditure,	 financing	 and	 legal	 matters.	 The	 Group	 is	 currently	 led	 and	 controlled	
by	 a	 Board	 consisting	 of	 four	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 two	 Non-executive	 Directors.	 It	 is	 chaired	 by	 Stephen	 Palframan	
who	 is	 a	 non-executive	 Director.	 The	 Board	 considers	 that	 the	 Non-executive	 Directors	 are	 independent	 and	 that	 each	 has	
specific	 expertise	 and	 experience,	 which	 enhances	 the	 knowledge,	 judgment	 and	 overall	 performance	 of	 the	 Board.

The	 directors	 present	 their	 annual	 report	 and	 audited	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2009	 for	 Vero	
Software	 plc,	 company	 number	 3461213.
Principal activities
The	 principal	 activities	 of	 the	 Group	 during	 the	 year	 were	 the	 development,	 marketing	 and	 distribution	 of	 computer	 aided	
design	 and	 computer	 aided	 manufacturing	 (“CAD/CAM”)	 software.
Business review
In	 accordance	 with	 section	 S417	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006,	 a	 review	 of	 the	 development	 and	 performance	 of	 the	
business	 of	 the	 Group	 including	 the	 financial	 performance	 during	 the	 year	 is	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Chairman’s	 statement	 and	 Chief	
executive’s	 review	 section	 of	 this	 Annual	 Report	 on	 pages	 3	 and	 6	 to	 7	 which	 is	 incorporated	 into	 this	 report	 by	 reference.	
The	 directors	 consider	 that	 the	 following	 measures	 are	 key	 performance	 indicators:
Financial 2009 2008
Revenue	 growth (8)% 10%
Adjusted	 EBITDA	 growth (9)% 45%
Adjusted	 EBITDA	 is	 a	 non	 GAAP	 measure	 which	 excludes	 capitalised	 development	 and	 exceptional	 costs.
Non financial 2009 2008
Number	 of	 licences	 on	 maintenance	 contract 7,689 7,349
The	 number	 of	 licences	 on	 maintenance	 is	 an	 important	 indicator	 of	 customer	 satisfaction	 and	 recurring	 revenues.
 2009 2008
Staff	 turnover 8% 10%
Recruitment	 and	 retention	 of	 staff	 is	 one	 of	 the	 key	 risks	 facing	 the	 business,	 therefore	 staff	 turnover	 ratios	 are	 an	 important	
indicator	 of	 how	 we	 are	 managing	 that	 risk.	 The	 2009	 figure	 includes	 leavers	 arising	 from	 restructuring	 in	 the	 UK,	 North	
America	 and	 China,	 this	 accounted	 for	 4%	 of	 the	 total	 turnover	 (2008:	 5%	 related	 to	 restructuring).
Results and dividends
The	 consolidated	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance	 is	 set	 out	 on	 page	 18.	 The	 directors	 do	 not	 propose	 payment	 of	 a	
dividend.
Research and development
The	 Group	 continues	 an	 active	 programme	 of	 research	 and	 development,	 enhancing	 and	 updating	 current	 products	 	
and	 extending	 the	 product	 range.

Risk Area
International trade risks
The	 Group	 generates	 a	 significant	 portion	 of	 its	 revenue	
outside	 the	 United	 Kingdom	 and	 is	 therefore	 subject	
to	 additional	 risks	 associated	 with	 the	 extent	 of	 its	
international	 operations.
Vero	 receives	 a	 substantial	 proportion	 of	 its	 revenues	 in	
Euros,	 US	 Dollars	 and	 Japanese	 Yen	 therefore	 adverse	
fluctuations	 in	 exchange	 rates	 can	 significantly	 affect	 its	
revenue	 and	 reported	 profits.
Intellectual property
The	 Group’s	 software	 products	 are	 the	 result	 of	 a	
considerable	 investment	 in	 research	 and	 development.	
Inability	 to	 protect	 them	 could	 reduce	 the	 value	 of	 the	
Group’s	 products	 and	 services.
The	 Group	 has	 developed	 and	 utilises	 software	 in	
collaboration	 with	 various	 software	 developers.	 In	 particular	
the	 termination	 of	 the	 Group’s	 licensing	 agreements	 for	
technologies	 from	 third	 parties	 could	 result	 in	 significant	
costs,	 delays	 in	 product	 development	 and	 affect	 the	
Group’s	 profitability.	
Cutomers 
The	 Group	 is	 exposed	 to	 the	 potential	 insolvency	 of	 its	
customers.
Competition 
The	 Group	 faces	 competition	 from	 numerous	 companies	
for	 all	 of	 its	 products.	 Product	 innovations	 or	 technical	
advances	 by	 competitors	 could	 adversely	 affect	 the	 Group.
Recruitment and retention
There	 is	 limited	 availability	 of	 employees	 and	 distributors	
around	 the	 world	 who	 have	 the	 necessary	 technical	 skills	
to	 develop,	 sell	 and	 support	 our	 products.	 The	 ability	 to	
attract,	 retain	 and	 motivate	 people	 with	 the	 appropriate	 skills	
is	 an	 important	 factor	 in	 the	 Group’s	 ability	 to	 expand.
Acquisition integration
The	 Group	 is	 an	 active	 acquirer:	 acquisitions	 may	 involve	 risks	
that	 might	 have	 a	 material	 impact	 on	 the	 Group.	 Any	 failure	
in	 the	 Group’s	 due	 diligence	 of	 the	 operating	 and	 financial	
condition	 of	 these	 acquired	 businesses,	 or	 of	 their	 integration	
into	 the	 Group’s	 operations,	 could	 have	 an	 adverse	 impact	 on	
the	 Group’s	 businesses	 or	 the	 Group	 as	 a	 whole.
Management Action/Mitigation
The	 geographic	 spread	 of	 our	 markets	 helps	 to	 minimise	
risk	 as	 conditions	 in	 one	 market	 are	 not	 always	 reflected	
elsewhere	 in	 the	 world.	
Exchange	 rate,	 credit	 and	 interest	 rate	 risks	 are	 discussed	
in	 note	 29	 to	 the	 accounts.
The	 Group	 protects	 its	 software	 using	 a	 combination	 of	
encrypted	 hardware	 and	 software	 devices.	
The	 Group	 protects	 its	 proprietary	 rights	 to	 its	 software	
with	 license	 agreements	 and	 with	 the	 registration	 of	
trademarks.	 Patent	 applications	 for	 our	 VISI-flow	 product	
have	 been	 filed	 in	 the	 US.	
The	 Group	 has	 entered	 into	 agreements	 that	 provide	 for	
the	 Group’s	 right	 to	 market	 and	 distribute	 the	 products	
containing	 third	 party	 component	 technologies.
The	 exposure	 is	 spread	 over	 a	 large	 number	 of	 customers	
in	 different	 geographic	 locations	 and	 different	 market	
sectors.
Credit	 risks	 of	 new	 customers	 must	 be	 assessed	 locally	
before	 entering	 into	 contracts	 and	 balances	 of	 existing	
customers	 are	 reviewed	 monthly.
Credit	 risks	 are	 further	 discussed	 in	 note	 29	 to	 the	
accounts.
The	 Group	 has	 a	 policy	 of	 continuous	 research	 and	
development	 and	 commits	 a	 significant	 amount	 of	
expenditure	 to	 this.	 The	 products	 of	 competitors	 are	 also	
monitored.
Vero	 aims	 to	 foster	 productive	 and	 mutually	 beneficial	
working	 relationships	 with	 distributors	 and	 provide	 a	
positive	 working	 environment	 and	 competitive	 pay	 levels	 in	
order	 to	 recruit	 and	 retain	 the	 employees	 that	 it	 needs.
These	 risks	 are	 mitigated	 by	 due	 diligence,	 forecasting	 	
and	 planning	 and,	 where	 practicable,	 by	 representations	
and	 warranties	 and	 indemnities	 from	 the	 vendors.

Directors’	 report

Risk factors
Vero’s	 business	 is	 subject	 to	 a	 number	 of	 risks	 and	 uncertainties	 which	 could	 materially	 adversely	 affect	 our	 business,	
financial	 condition,	 results	 of	 our	 operations	 or	 share	 price.	 The	 factors	 discussed	 in	 this	 section	 are	 not	 an	 exhaustive	 list	
but	 are	 considered	 some	 of	 the	 principal	 risks	 and	 uncertainties	 faced	 by	 the	 business.	 Our	 aim	 is	 to	 manage	 and	 control	
identified	 risk	 through	 established	 processes	 but	 it	 cannot	 be	 eliminated	 completely. A n n u a l R e p o r t a n d A c c o u n t s 2 0 0 9

Creditor payment policy and practice
The	 Group’s	 policy	 is	 to	 fix	 payment	 terms	 when	 agreeing	 the	 terms	 of	 each	 transaction.	 It	 is	 the	 Group’s	 general	 policy	 to	
pay	 suppliers	 according	 to	 the	 agreed	 terms	 and	 conditions	 provided	 the	 supplier	 has	 agreed	 with	 those	 terms.	 Trade	 creditor	
days	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 Group	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2009	 were	 94	 days	 and	 46	 days	 respectively.	 This	
represents	 the	 ratio,	 expressed	 in	 days	 between	 the	 amounts	 invoiced	 to	 the	 Company	 and	 Group	 by	 its	 suppliers	 in	 the	 year	
and	 the	 amounts	 due,	 at	 the	 year	 end	 to	 trade	 creditors	 within	 one	 year.
Annual General Meeting
The	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 will	 be	 held	 at	 the	 Company’s	 Head	 Office,	 Hadley	 House,	 Bayshill	 Road,	 Cheltenham,	 	
GL50	 3AW,	 on	 a	 date	 to	 be	 advised.	
Corporate governance
The	 directors	 recognise	 the	 importance	 of	 sound	 corporate	 governance	 and	 intend	 that	 the	 Company	 will	 comply	 with	 the	
main	 provisions	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code	 on	 Corporate	 Governance	 issued	 by	 the	 Financial	 Reporting	 Council	 insofar	 as	 they	
are	 appropriate,	 given	 the	 Company’s	 size	 and	 stage	 of	 development,	 and	 will	 endeavour	 to	 follow	 the	 recommendations	
on	 corporate	 governance	 contained	 in	 the	 Corporate	 Governance	 Guidance	 for	 AIM	 Companies.
The	 Board	 comprises	 4	 executive	 and	 2	 non-executive	 directors,	 who	 meet	 on	 a	 regular	 basis	 throughout	 the	 year.
The	 Board	 maintains	 a	 formal	 schedule	 of	 matters	 reserved	 for	 its	 approval	 and	 is	 responsible	 for	 formulating,	 reviewing	 	
and	 approving	 the	 Group’s	 strategy,	 budgets,	 major	 items	 of	 capital	 expenditure,	 acquisitions	 and	 appointment	 of	 	
senior	 personnel.
Board committees
The	 Board	 has	 delegated	 certain	 responsibilities	 to	 Board	 Committees	 which	 operate	 within	 defined	 terms	 which	 are	 set	
out	 below.	
An	 Audit	 Committee	 has	 been	 established	 which	 comprises	 the	 two	 non-executive	 directors.	 This	 committee	 is	 responsible	
for	 ensuring	 that	 the	 financial	 performance	 of	 the	 Group	 is	 properly	 reported	 on	 and	 monitored,	 and	 for	 meeting	 the	
auditors	 and	 reviewing	 reports	 from	 the	 auditors	 relating	 to	 the	 accounts	 and	 internal	 control	 systems.	 At	 the	 invitation	 of	
the	 Audit	 Committee,	 the	 Finance	 Director	 usually	 attends	 meetings.
A	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 been	 established	 which	 comprises	 the	 two	 non-executive	 directors.	 Its	 main	 function	 is	 to	
review	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 executive	 directors,	 to	 set	 the	 scale	 and	 structure	 of	 their	 remuneration	 and	 the	 basis	 of	 their	
service	 agreements	 with	 due	 regard	 to	 the	 interests	 of	 the	 shareholders.	
The	 Board	 has	 adopted	 the	 Model	 Code	 for	 directors’	 dealings	 in	 shares	 as	 applicable	 to	 AIM	 companies	 and	 will	 take	 all	
reasonable	 steps	 to	 ensure	 compliance	 by	 the	 directors	 and	 by	 relevant	 employees.

Share option schemes
The	 Company	 operates	 share	 option	 schemes	 as	 summarised	 below,	 which	 are	 administered	 by	 the	 Remuneration	
Committee.	 Options	 granted	 under	 all	 of	 the	 available	 option	 schemes	 will	 not,	 in	 aggregate,	 exceed	 10%	 of	 the	 Holding	
Company’s	 issued	 share	 capital.	 The	 directors	 believe	 that	 the	 success	 of	 the	 Company	 depends	 to	 a	 high	 degree	 on	
the	 future	 performance	 of	 the	 management	 team.	 The	 directors	 also	 recognise	 the	 importance	 of	 ensuring	 that	 all	 key	
employees	 are	 incentivised	 and	 identify	 closely	 with	 the	 profitability	 of	 the	 Company.
EMI scheme
Options	 are	 exercisable	 after	 3	 years	 and	 will	 lapse	 if	 not	 exercised	 within	 7	 years.
Approved scheme
Options	 are	 exercisable	 after	 3	 years	 and	 will	 lapse	 if	 not	 exercised	 within	 10	 years.	 Under	 this	 scheme,	 which	 has	 been	
approved	 by	 the	 Inland	 Revenue,	 the	 maximum	 aggregate	 market	 value	 of	 options,	 which	 may	 be	 issued	 to	 a	 participant,	
may	 not	 exceed	 £30,000.
Unapproved scheme
Options	 are	 exercisable	 after	 3	 years	 and	 will	 lapse	 if	 not	 exercised	 within	 7	 years.
Shadow scheme
This	 scheme	 provides	 a	 similar	 incentive	 to	 the	 above	 schemes	 by	 way	 of	 a	 cash	 equivalent.	 The	 main	 purpose	 of	 the	
scheme	 is	 to	 enable	 the	 Company	 to	 provide	 equity	 related	 incentives	 to	 employees	 whose	 participation	 in	 the	 Approved	
Scheme	 or	 Unapproved	 Scheme,	 may,	 at	 the	 relevant	 time,	 not	 be	 practicable.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 preparing	 the	 Directors’	 report	 and	 the	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	
law	 and	 regulations.
Company	 law	 requires	 the	 directors	 to	 prepare	 financial	 statements	 for	 each	 financial	 year.	 Under	 that	 law	 the	 directors	
have	 elected	 to	 prepare	 the	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 European	 Union	 and	
applicable	 law.	 The	 financial	 statements	 must,	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 European	 Union,	 present	 fairly	
the	 financial	 position	 and	 performance	 of	 the	 Company;	 such	 references	 in	 the	 UK	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 to	 such	 financial	
statements	 giving	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 are	 references	 to	 their	 achieving	 a	 fair	 presentation.	 Under	 company	 law	 directors	
must	 not	 approve	 the	 financial	 statements	 unless	 they	 are	 satisfied	 that	 they	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view.	 In	 preparing	 these	
financial	 statements,	 the	 directors	 are	 required	 to:
● l select	 suitable	 accounting	 policies	 and	 then	 apply	 them	 consistently;
● l make	 judgements	 and	 accounting	 estimates	 that	 are	 reasonable	 and	 prudent;
● l state	 whether	 the	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 European	
Union;
● l prepare	 the	 financial	 statements	 on	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 unless	 it	 is	 inappropriate	 to	 presume	 that	 the	 Company	
will	 continue	 in	 business.

The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 keeping	 adequate	 accounting	 records	 that	 are	 sufficient	 to	 show	 and	 explain	 the	
Company’s	 transactions	 and	 disclose	 with	 reasonable	 accuracy	 at	 any	 time	 the	 financial	 position	 of	 the	 Company	 and	
enable	 them	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 financial	 statements	 comply	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 and,	 as	 regards	 the	 Group	
financial	 statements,	 Article	 4	 of	 the	 IAS	 Regulation.	 They	 are	 also	 responsible	 for	 safeguarding	 the	 assets	 of	 the	 Company	
and	 hence	 for	 taking	 reasonable	 steps	 for	 the	 prevention	 and	 detection	 of	 fraud	 and	 other	 irregularities.
The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 the	 maintenance	 and	 integrity	 of	 the	 corporate	 and	 financial	 information	 included	 on	 the	
Company’s	 website.	 Legislation	 in	 the	 United	 Kingdom	 governing	 the	 preparation	 and	 dissemination	 of	 financial	 statements	
may	 differ	 from	 legislation	 in	 other	 jurisdictions.
Disclosure of information to auditors
As	 far	 as	 each	 director,	 who	 is	 in	 office	 at	 the	 time	 when	 the	 directors’	 report	 is	 approved,	 is	 aware,	 there	 is	 no	 relevant	
information	 of	 which	 the	 auditors	 are	 unaware	 and	 each	 such	 director	 has	 taken	 all	 reasonable	 steps	 to	 make	 themselves	
aware	 of	 any	 relevant	 audit	 information,	 including	 making	 appropriate	 enquiries	 of	 fellow	 directors,	 and	 to	 establish	 that	 the	
auditors	 are	 aware	 of	 that	 information.

Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An	 audit	 involves	 obtaining	 evidence	 about	 the	 amounts	 and	 disclosures	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 sufficient	 to	 give	
reasonable	 assurance	 that	 the	 financial	 statements	 are	 free	 from	 material	 misstatement,	 whether	 caused	 by	 fraud	 or	 error.	
This	 includes	 an	 assessment	 of:	 whether	 the	 accounting	 policies	 are	 appropriate	 to	 the	 Group’s	 circumstances	 and	 have	
been	 consistently	 applied	 and	 adequately	 disclosed;	 the	 reasonableness	 of	 significant	 accounting	 estimates	 made	 by	 the	
directors;	 and	 the	 overall	 presentation	 of	 the	 financial	 statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In	 our	 opinion	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements:
● l give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 of	 the	 state	 of	 the	 Group’s	 affairs	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2009	 and	 of	 its	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 then	
ended;
● l have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRSs	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 European	 Union;	 and
● l have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 and	 Article	 4	 of	 the	 IAS	
Regulation.
In	 our	 opinion	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements	 comply	 with	 IFRSs	 as	 issued	 by	 the	 IASB.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In	 our	 opinion	 the	 information	 given	 in	 the	 Directors’	 Report	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 for	 which	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements	
are	 prepared	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We	 have	 nothing	 to	 report	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 following:
Under	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	 to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion:
● l certain	 disclosures	 of	 directors’	 remuneration	 specified	 by	 law	 are	 not	 made;	 or
● l we	 have	 not	 received	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 we	 require	 for	 our	 audit.
Other matter
We	 have	 reported	 separately	 on	 the	 parent	 company	 financial	 statements	 of	 Vero	 Software	 Plc	 for	 the	 year	 ended	
31	 December	 2009.

General information
Vero	 Software	 plc	 is	 a	 company	 incorporated	 and	 domiciled	 in	 the	 United	 Kingdom.	 The	 address	 of	 the	 registered	 office	
is	 given	 on	 page	 10.	 The	 nature	 of	 the	 Group’s	 operations	 and	 its	 principal	 activities	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 business	 review	 on	
pages	 11	 to	 16.
The	 financial	 statements	 are	 presented	 in	 pounds	 sterling,	 rounded	 to	 the	 nearest	 thousand,	 as	 that	 is	 the	 currency	 of	 the	
primary	 economic	 environment	 in	 which	 the	 Group	 operates.
	
The	 Group	 financial	 statements	 consolidate	 those	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 subsidiaries	 (together	 referred	 to	 as	 the	 ‘Group’).	
Foreign	 operations	 are	 included	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 policies	 set	 out	 below.
1.  Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Group	 have	 been	 prepared	 on	 the	 historic	 cost	 basis	 as	 modified	 by	 the	
revaluation	 of	 certain	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities,	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	
(“IFRS”)	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 European	 Union	 and	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 and	 therefore	 comply	 with	 Article	 4	 of	 the	
EU	 IAS	 Regulation.	
The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 on	 the	 going	 concern	 basis.
The	 principal	 accounting	 policies	 of	 the	 Group	 are	 set	 out	 below:
 Changes In accounting policy and disclosures
The	 Group	 has	 adopted	 all	 new	 and	 revised	 Standards	 and	 Interpretations	 issued	 by	 the	 International	 Accounting	
Standards	 Board	 (IASB)	 and	 the	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Interpretations	 Committee	 (IFRIC)	 of	 the	 IASB	 that	
are	 relevant	 to	 the	 Group’s	 operations	 and	 effective	 for	 accounting	 periods	 beginning	 on	 1	 January	 2009.
These	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 revised	 IAS	 1	 Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements	
which	 is	 effective	 for	 accounting	 periods	 beginning	 on	 1	 January	 2009.	 The	 revised	 IAS	 1	 has	 resulted	 in	 a	 change	 to	
disclosures	 in	 the	 financial	 statements,	 as	 well	 as	 changing	 the	 presentation	 of	 performance.	 The	 Group	 has	 chosen	 to	
present	 a	 separate	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance	 and	 comprehensive	 income	 and	 now	 reports	 a	 statement	 of	 financial	
position	 rather	 than	 a	 balance	 sheet.
Revisions	 to	 IAS	 20	 Accounting	 for	 Government	 Grants	 and	 Disclosure	 of	 Government	 Assistance	 require	 the	 benefit	
of	 a	 government	 loan	 at	 a	 below-market	 rate	 of	 interest	 to	 be	 treated	 as	 a	 government	 grant.	 The	 benefit	 of	 the	
below-market	 rate	 of	 interest	 is	 measured	 as	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 loan	 at	 the	 initial	 recognition	
date	 and	 the	 proceeds	 received.	 The	 revisions	 to	 the	 Standard	 apply	 prospectively	 to	 government	 loans	 received	 on	
or	 after	 1	 January	 2009.	 The	 Group	 has	 not	 received	 any	 new	 loans	 since	 this	 date	 at	 below-market	 rates	 of	 interest,	
which	 remain	 outstanding	 at	 the	 year	 end.	 The	 revisions	 to	 the	 Standard	 have	 therefore	 not	 impact	 the	 statements	 for	
the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2009.	 The	 revisions	 to	 the	 Standard	 are	 however	 expected	 to	 impact	 future	 periods.
Revisions	 to	 IFRS	 7	 Financial	 Instrument:	 Disclosures,	 requires	 an	 analysis	 of	 all	 financial	 instruments	 measured	
subsequent	 to	 initial	 recognition	 at	 fair	 value,	 grouped	 into	 a	 hierarchy	 of	 levels	 1	 to	 3,	 based	 on	 the	 degree	 to	 which	
the	 fair	 value	 has	 been	 determined	 using	 observable	 inputs.
IFRS	 8	 Operating	 Segments	 is	 a	 disclosure	 standard	 that	 has	 been	 adopted	 by	 the	 Group	 for	 the	 first	 time	 for	 the	
year	 ended	 31	 December	 2009.	 No	 changes	 were	 required	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2008.
At	 the	 date	 of	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 position	 the	 following	 Standards	 and	 Interpretations,	 which	 are	 applicable	 to	
the	 Group,	 were	 in	 issue	 but	 not	 yet	 effective:
IFRS	 9	 Financial	 Instruments	 deals	 with	 the	 classification	 and	 measurement	 of	 financial	 assets	 when	 determining	
whether	 financial	 assets	 should	 be	 recorded	 at	 amortised	 cost	 or	 at	 fair	 value,	 and	 the	 associated	 accounting	
treatment	 of	 embedded	 derivatives	 within	 financial	 assets.	 The	 standard	 is	 applicable	 for	 accounting	 periods	
beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2013	 but	 early	 adoption	 is	 allowed.	 The	 directors	 do	 not	 anticipate	 that	 the	 adoption	
of	 this	 Standard	 will	 have	 a	 material	 impact	 on	 the	 financial	 statements.

1.  Accounting policies – continued
The	 remaining	 new	 standards,	 interpretations	 and	 amendments,	 in	 issue	 but	 not	 yet	 effective,	 which	 have	 not	 been	 applied	
in	 these	 financial	 statements,	 are	 not	 expected	 to	 have	 a	 material	 effect	 on	 the	 Group’s	 future	 financial	 statements.
 Consolidation
The	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2009	 incorporate	 the	 financial	 information	
of	 the	 Company	 and	 entities	 controlled	 by	 the	 Company	 (its	 subsidiaries	 as	 set	 out	 in	 note	 15).	 Control	 is	 achieved	
where	 the	 Group	 has	 the	 power	 to	 govern	 the	 financial	 and	 operating	 policies	 of	 an	 investee	 entity	 so	 as	 to	 obtain	
benefits	 from	 its	 activities.
Subsidiaries	 are	 consolidated	 from	 the	 date	 of	 their	 acquisition,	 being	 the	 date	 on	 which	 the	 Group	 obtains	 control.
All	 business	 combinations	 are	 accounted	 for	 using	 the	 purchase	 method	 of	 accounting.	 The	 cost	 of	 the	 business	
combination	 is	 measured	 as	 the	 aggregate	 of	 the	 fair	 values	 of	 assets	 given	 less	 liabilities	 incurred	 or	 assumed.	
Consideration	 includes	 any	 deferred	 consideration.
All	 intra-group	 transactions,	 balances,	 income	 and	 expenditure	 are	 eliminated	 on	 consolidation.
 Accounting estimates and judgements
In	 the	 process	 of	 applying	 the	 Group’s	 accounting	 policies,	 management	 has	 made	 judgments,	 estimates	 and	
assumptions	 that	 affect	 the	 reported	 amount	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities,	 income	 and	 expenses.	 These	 judgments	 involve	
assumptions	 or	 estimates	 in	 respect	 of	 future	 events,	 which	 can	 vary	 from	 what	 is	 anticipated	 as	 discussed	 below.
 a)	 Impairment	 of	 non-financial	 assets
The	 Group	 assesses	 whether	 there	 are	 any	 indicators	 of	 impairment	 for	 all	 non-financial	 assets	 at	 each	 reporting	 date.	
Goodwill	 is	 tested	 for	 impairment	 annually	 and	 at	 other	 times	 when	 such	 indicators	 exist.	 Other	 non-financial	 assets	
are	 tested	 for	 impairment	 when	 there	 are	 indicators	 that	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 may	 not	 be	 recoverable.
When	 value	 in	 use	 calculations	 are	 undertaken,	 management	 must	 estimate	 the	 expected	 future	 cash	 flows	 from	 the	
asset	 or	 cash	 generating	 unit	 and	 choose	 a	 suitable	 discount	 rate	 in	 order	 to	 calculate	 the	 present	 value	 of	 those	
cash	 flows.	 Further	 details	 are	 given	 in	 note	 11.
	 b)	 Impairment	 and	 recoverability	 of	 trade	 receivables
	 In	 assessing	 the	 recoverability	 of	 trade	 receivables,	 management	 take	 account	 of	 all	 relevant	 information	 available	 as	
discussed	 in	 note	 17.
 Revenue recognition
Revenue	 represents	 the	 value	 of	 sales	 of	 software	 and	 related	 services	 to	 third	 parties,	 exclusive	 of	 value	 added	
tax	 or	 equivalent.	 Software	 licences	 are	 recognised	 on	 delivery	 of	 the	 software	 licence.	 Maintenance	 renewals	 are	
recognised	 rateably	 over	 the	 period	 of	 the	 maintenance	 contract.	
 Cost of sales
Cost	 of	 sales	 represents	 the	 cost	 of	 licence	 fees	 in	 respect	 of	 third	 party	 software	 licences,	 software	 media	 costs	 and	
related	 hardware.
 Employee benefits
The	 Group	 operates	 a	 defined	 contribution	 pension	 scheme	 for	 employees	 based	 in	 the	 United	 Kingdom.	 The	
scheme	 is	 funded	 by	 the	 payment	 of	 contributions	 to	 an	 independently	 administered	 fund.	 The	 pension	 contributions	
are	 charged	 to	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance	 when	 incurred.
The	 Group’s	 Italian	 and	 Japanese	 subsidiaries	 operate	 a	 staff	 leaving	 indemnity	 fund	 which	 becomes	 payable	 when	
staff	 leave	 the	 Company	 or	 earlier	 upon	 approved	 employee	 application.
Accruals	 are	 made	 for	 holiday	 pay,	 based	 on	 a	 calculation	 of	 the	 number	 of	 days	 holiday	 earned	 during	 the	 year,	 but	
not	 yet	 taken.

17872	 19/05/2010	 Proof	8
1.  Accounting policies – continued
 Share based payments
Charges	 are	 made	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance	 to	 spread	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 share	 options	 issued	 since	
November	 2002	 over	 the	 vesting	 period	 of	 those	 options.
 Government grants
Revenue	 grants	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance	 as	 other	 income	 and	 matched	 against	 the	
project’s	 related	 expenditure,	 provided	 that	 the	 Group	 has	 met	 the	 conditions	 of	 the	 grant	 and	 there	 is	 reasonable	
assurance	 that	 it	 will	 be	 received.
 Intangible fixed assets — research and development
Expenditure	 on	 research	 activities,	 undertaken	 with	 the	 prospect	 of	 gaining	 new	 scientific	 or	 technical	 knowledge	
and	 understanding,	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance	 as	 an	 expense	 as	 incurred.	 Development	
costs	 incurred	 after	 the	 point	 at	 which	 the	 commercial	 and	 technical	 feasibility	 of	 the	 product	 has	 been	 proven,	 and	
the	 decision	 to	 complete	 the	 development	 has	 been	 taken	 and	 the	 resources	 made	 available,	 are	 capitalised.	 The	
expenditure	 capitalised	 includes	 the	 cost	 of	 direct	 labour	 and	 an	 appropriate	 proportion	 of	 overheads.	 Capitalised	
development	 expenditure	 is	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 amortisation	 and	 impairment	 losses.	 Development	
expenditure	 has	 an	 estimated	 useful	 life	 of	 6	 years	 and	 is	 amortised	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis.
 Intangible assets — other
Software	 acquired	 from	 third	 parties,	 licences	 and	 trade	 marks,	 are	 included	 as	 intangible	 fixed	 assets	 at	 cost	 less	
amortisation	 and	 are	 amortised	 over	 3	 to	 10	 years.	
In	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 3	 “Business	 Combinations”	 goodwill	 arising	 on	 the	 acquisition	 of	 subsidiaries	 is	 capitalised	
and	 included	 in	 intangible	 assets.	 IFRS	 3	 also	 requires	 the	 identification	 of	 other	 intangible	 assets	 acquired.	 Although	
the	 techniques	 used	 to	 value	 other	 intangible	 assets	 are	 in	 line	 with	 internationally	 used	 models,	 they	 do	 require	 the	
use	 of	 estimates,	 which	 may	 differ	 from	 actual	 outcomes.
The	 estimated	 useful	 lives	 of	 the	 acquired	 intangible	 assets	 are	 as	 follows:
Intellectual	 property	 	 6	 years
In	 process	 research	 and	 development	 	 6	 years
The	 carrying	 value	 is	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 when	 events	 or	 changes	 in	 circumstances	 indicate	 that	 it	 may	 be	
impaired.	 If	 any	 such	 indication	 exists,	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 the	 asset	 is	 estimated	 in	 order	 to	 determine	 the	
extent	 of	 the	 impairment	 loss.
 Impairment of goodwill
The	 determination	 of	 whether	 or	 not	 goodwill	 has	 been	 impaired	 requires	 an	 estimate	 to	 be	 made	 of	 the	 value	 in	 use	
of	 the	 cash	 generating	 units	 to	 which	 goodwill	 has	 been	 allocated.	 The	 value	 in	 use	 estimation	 includes	 estimates	
about	 the	 future	 financial	 performance	 of	 the	 cash	 generating	 units,	 including	 management’s	 estimates	 of	 long	 term	
operating	 margins	 and	 long-term	 growth	 rates.	 The	 carrying	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 and	 the	 key	 assumptions	 used	 in	 the	
calculation	 of	 value	 in	 use	 of	 the	 cash	 generating	 units	 to	 which	 goodwill	 is	 allocated	 is	 disclosed	 in	 note	 11.
 Property, plant and equipment
Assets	 are	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 depreciation.	 Depreciation	 is	 provided	 to	 write	 off	 the	 cost	 of	 assets	 less	
their	 estimated	 residual	 value	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 their	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 lives	 as	 follows:
	 Buildings	 2%	 to	 3%
	 Motor	 vehicles	 25%
	 Plant	 and	 equipment	 10%	 to	 25%
	 Leasehold	 improvements	 over	 the	 remaining	 life	 of	 the	 lease
 Inventories
Inventories	 of	 CDs,	 manuals	 and	 packaging	 are	 included	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 cost	 and	 net	 realisable	 value,	 after	 making	
due	 allowance	 for	 obsolete	 and	 slow	 moving	 stock.

The	 cost	 of	 inventories	 comprises	 the	 purchase	 price,	 carriage	 and	 other	 costs	 directly	 attributable	 to	 the	 acquisition	 of	
goods,	 less	 any	 trade	 discounts	 deductible.
 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 comprise	 cash	 balances	 and	 short-term	 (with	 an	 original	 maturity	 of	 less	 than	 three	 months)	
deposits.	 Bank	 overdrafts	 that	 are	 repayable	 on	 demand	 form	 part	 of	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 the	
cash	 flow	 statement.
 Trade receivables
 Trade	 receivables	 are	 initially	 recognised	 at	 fair	 value	 and	 subsequently	 at	 amortised	 cost.	 A	 provision	 for	 impairment	 of	
trade	 receivables	 is	 established	 when	 there	 is	 objective	 evidence	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 collect	 all	 amounts	
due	 according	 to	 the	 agreed	 terms.	 The	 creation	 and	 release	 of	 provision	 for	 impaired	 receivables	 has	 been	 included	 in	
‘Selling	 expenses’	 in	 the	 Statement	 of	 financial	 performance.
 Taxation
Income	 tax	 on	 the	 profit	 or	 loss	 for	 the	 periods	 presented	 comprises	 current	 and	 deferred	 tax.	 Income	 tax	 is	
recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance	 except	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 relates	 to	 items	 recognised	 directly	 in	
equity,	 in	 which	 case	 it	 is	 recognised	 in	 other	 comprehensive	 income.
Current	 tax	 is	 the	 expected	 tax	 payable	 on	 the	 taxable	 income	 for	 the	 year,	 using	 tax	 rates	 enacted	 or	 substantively	
enacted	 at	 the	 reporting	 date,	 and	 any	 adjustment	 to	 tax	 payable	 in	 respect	 of	 previous	 periods.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 all	 temporary	 differences	 between	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	
for	 financial	 reporting	 purposes	 and	 the	 amounts	 used	 for	 taxation	 purposes.	 The	 amount	 of	 deferred	 tax	 provided	 is	
based	 on	 the	 expected	 realisation	 or	 settlement	 of	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 assets	 or	 liabilities.	 Deferred	 tax	 is	 measured	
at	 tax	 rates	 that	 are	 expected	 to	 be	 applied	 to	 the	 temporary	 differences	 when	 they	 reverse,	 based	 on	 laws	 that	 have	
been	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	 by	 the	 reporting	 date.
A	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 is	 recognised	 only	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 future	 taxable	 profits	 will	 be	 available	
against	 which	 the	 asset	 can	 be	 utilised.	 Deferred	 tax	 assets	 are	 reduced	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 no	 longer	 probable	 that	
the	 related	 tax	 benefit	 will	 be	 realised.
 Exceptional items
The	 directors	 consider	 the	 costs	 associated	 with	 the	 restructuring	 of	 the	 Group	 to	 be	 exceptional.	 Such	 costs,	 together	
with	 associated	 redundancy	 costs	 and	 provisions	 and	 impairments	 in	 respect	 of	 property	 no	 longer	 required	 by	 the	
Group,	 have	 been	 disclosed	 as	 exceptional	 within	 a	 separate	 column	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance.
 Leasing
Leases	 are	 classified	 as	 finance	 leases	 whenever	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 lease	 transfer	 substantially	 all	 the	 risks	 and	 rewards	
of	 ownership	 to	 the	 Group.	 All	 other	 leases	 are	 classified	 as	 operating	 leases.
Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 held	 under	 finance	 lease	 is	 capitalised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 position	 at	 the	 lower	
of	 cost	 or	 present	 value	 of	 the	 minimum	 lease	 payments	 and	 is	 depreciated	 over	 its	 useful	 life.	 The	 capital	 elements	 of	
future	 obligations	 under	 leases	 are	 included	 as	 liabilities.
Rentals	 payable	 under	 operating	 leases	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	
over	 the	 term	 of	 the	 lease.	 Benefits	 received	 and	 receivable	 as	 an	 incentive	 to	 enter	 into	 an	 operating	 lease	 are	 also	
spread	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 the	 lease	 term.	
 Financial instruments
Treasury	 activities	 are	 managed	 under	 policies	 and	 procedures	 approved	 and	 monitored	 by	 the	 Board.	 These	 are	
designed	 to	 reduce	 the	 financial	 risk	 faced	 by	 the	 Group,	 which	 relate	 primarily	 to	 credit	 risk,	 foreign	 currency	 risk,	
liquidity	 risk	 and	 interest	 rate	 risk.	 The	 Group	 does	 not	 undertake	 any	 trading	 or	 speculative	 activity	 in	 financial	
instruments.

1.  Accounting policies – continued
 Foreign currency
Transactions	 in	 foreign	 currency	 are	 included	 in	 the	 accounts	 of	 individual	 companies	 at	 the	 rate	 of	 exchange	 ruling	
at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 transaction.	 Monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 expressed	 in	 foreign	 currency	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 rates	
ruling	 at	 the	 financial	 year	 end	 date	 and	 any	 differences	 on	 translation	 are	 dealt	 with	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	
performance.
Results	 are	 translated	 into	 sterling	 at	 the	 weighted	 average	 rates	 for	 the	 year,	 which	 is	 effected	 by	 translating	 each	
overseas	 subsidiary’s	 monthly	 result	 at	 exchange	 rates	 applicable	 to	 each	 of	 the	 respective	 months.	 Assets	 and	
liabilities	 denominated	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 at	 the	 reporting	 date	 are	 translated	 into	 sterling	 at	 the	 foreign	 exchange	
rate	 ruling	 at	 that	 date.	 Differences	 on	 exchange	 resulting	 from	 the	 translation	 of	 overseas	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 are	
recognised	 directly	 as	 a	 component	 of	 other	 comprehensive	 income.	 Such	 exchange	 differences	 are	 recognised	 as	
income	 or	 expense	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 the	 operation	 is	 disposed	 of.	 Cumulative	 differences	 were	 set	 to	 zero	 	
at	 the	 date	 of	 transition	 to	 IFRS.

9.  Earnings per share
Basic	 earnings	 per	 share	 is	 calculated	 by	 dividing	 net	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 attributable	 to	 ordinary	 equity	 holders	 of	 the	
parent	 company	 by	 the	 weighted	 average	 number	 of	 shares	 in	 issue	 during	 the	 year.
Diluted	 earnings	 per	 share	 is	 calculated	 by	 dividing	 the	 net	 profit	 attributable	 to	 ordinary	 equity	 holders	 of	 the	 parent	
company	 by	 the	 weighted	 average	 number	 of	 shares	 in	 issue	 during	 the	 year,	 plus	 the	 weighted	 average	 number	 of	
ordinary	 shares	 that	 would	 be	 issued	 on	 the	 conversion	 of	 all	 the	 dilutive	 potential	 ordinary	 shares	 into	 ordinary	 shares.

Goodwill	 acquired	 in	 a	 business	 combination	 is	 allocated	 to	 cash-generating	 units	 (CGU’s)	 which	 represent	 the	
Group’s	 key	 product	 lines.	 The	 Group	 conducts	 annual	 impairment	 tests	 on	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 goodwill	 and	 its	
other	 intangible	 assets	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 36	 “Impairment	 of	 assets”.	 An	 impairment	 test	 is	 a	 comparison	 of	 the	
carrying	 value	 of	 the	 assets	 of	 a	 business	 or	 cash	 generating	 unit	 (CGU)	 to	 their	 recoverable	 amount.	
All	 of	 the	 recoverable	 amounts	 were	 measured	 based	 on	 value	 in	 use.	 As	 a	 result	 of	 a	 decline	 in	 the	 EDI	 sales	 in	
2009,	 the	 goodwill	 on	 this	 product	 line	 has	 been	 impaired	 by	 £20,000	 (2008:	 nil).	 The	 impairment	 charge	 is	 included	
in	 “amortisation”	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 financial	 performance.	 All	 other	 CGUs	 had	 a	 recoverable	 amount	 measured	 in	
excess	 of	 their	 carrying	 value.
Key Assumptions
For	 the	 purposes	 of	 carrying	 out	 the	 impairment	 tests,	 management	 prepares	 cash	 flow	 forecasts	 based	 on	 the	 most	
recent	 approved	 financial	 budgets.	 In	 determining	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 all	 CGUs,	 it	 is	 necessary	 to	 make	 a	
series	 of	 assumptions	 to	 estimate	 future	 cash	 flows.	 These	 assumptions	 have	 been	 made	 by	 management	 reflecting	
past	 experience	 and	 are	 consistent	 with	 relevant	 external	 sources	 of	 information.
Operating cash flows
The	 main	 assumptions	 within	 forecast	 operating	 cash	 flow	 include	 the	 achievement	 of	 future	 sales,	 prices	 and	
volumes,	 the	 cost	 structure	 of	 each	 CGU	 and	 the	 impact	 of	 foreign	 exchange	 rates.

11.  Goodwill –	 continued
Risk adjusted discount rates
Risk	 adjusted	 discount	 rates	 reflect	 the	 current	 market	 assessment	 of	 the	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 CGU’s.	 The	 discount	
rate	 used	 was	 14%.
Growth rate
Future	 cash	 flows	 are	 based	 on	 a	 perpetuity	 growth	 rate	 of	 3%.	 Management	 consider	 that	 it	 is	 appropriate	 to	
consider	 cash	 flows	 for	 a	 term	 longer	 than	 5	 years	 because	 goodwill	 is	 considered	 to	 have	 an	 indefinite	 life.	 This	 rate	
does	 not	 exceed	 the	 average	 long	 term	 growth	 rate	 for	 the	 relevant	 markets.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The	 Group’s	 impairment	 review	 is	 sensitive	 to	 a	 change	 in	 the	 key	 assumptions	 used,	 most	 notably	 the	 discount	
rates,	 the	 perpetuity	 growth	 rates	 and	 expected	 future	 cash	 flows.	 Based	 on	 the	 Group’s	 sensitivity	 analysis,	 a	
reasonably	 possible	 change	 in	 the	 discount	 rate	 or	 perpetuity	 growth	 rate	 could	 cause	 an	 impairment	 in	 either	 the	
SMIRT	 or	 PEPs	 CGUs.
An	 increase	 of	 0.4	 percentage	 points	 in	 the	 discount	 rate	 or	 a	 reduction	 of	 0.4	 percentage	 points	 in	 the	 perpetuity	
growth	 rate	 would	 cause	 the	 value	 in	 use	 for	 SMIRT	 to	 fall	 below	 its	 total	 carrying	 value	 of	 £1.36m	 (including	 both	
goodwill	 and	 other	 intangible	 assets	 attributed	 to	 the	 product	 line).
An	 increase	 of	 1.5	 percentage	 points	 in	 the	 discount	 rate	 or	 a	 reduction	 of	 1.5	 percentage	 points	 in	 the	 perpetuity	
growth	 rate	 would	 cause	 the	 value	 in	 use	 for	 PEPs	 to	 fall	 below	 its	 total	 carrying	 value	 of	 £2.5m	 (including	 both	
goodwill	 and	 other	 intangible	 assets	 attributed	 to	 the	 product	 line).

The	 amounts	 that	 are	 past	 due	 but	 not	 impaired	 relate	 to	 a	 number	 of	 dealers	 and	 independent	 customers.	 All	
balances	 are	 reviewed	 monthly	 and	 previous	 payment	 history	 and	 the	 most	 recent	 understanding	 of	 the	 customer’s	
financial	 position	 are	 assessed	 to	 allow	 management	 to	 judge	 when	 the	 provision	 for	 impairment	 is	 required.	 Balances	
that	 are	 past	 120	 days	 overdue	 represent	 dealers	 with	 whom	 a	 long	 standing	 relationship	 has	 been	 held	 and	 the	 Group	
deems	 it	 necessary	 to	 support	 its	 partners	 during	 the	 current	 economic	 climate.
A	 provision	 for	 impairment	 of	 trade	 receivables	 is	 established	 when	 there	 is	 objective	 evidence	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 not	
be	 able	 to	 collect	 all	 amounts	 due	 according	 to	 the	 agreed	 terms.	 The	 creation	 and	 release	 of	 provision	 for	 impaired

The	 Group	 uses	 the	 Black–Scholes	 model	 to	 value	 its	 share	 options.	 Expected	 volatility	 was	 determined	 by	 calculating	
the	 historical	 volatility	 of	 the	 Group’s	 share	 price	 over	 the	 3	 years	 prior	 to	 the	 granting	 of	 the	 options.	 The	 options	
have	 passed	 the	 vesting	 period,	 therefore	 the	 charge	 for	 the	 year	 is	 nil	 (2008:	 nil).
The	 schemes	 are	 summarised	 on	 page	 15.
Inputs	 into	 the	 Black–Scholes	 model	 are	 as	 follows:

year.	 This	 analysis	 is	 for	 illustrative	 purposes	 only,	 as	 in	 practice	 market	 rates	 rarely	 change	 in	 isolation.	 Actual	 results	 in

Foreign currency risk
Group	 companies	 have	 their	 local	 currency	 as	 their	 functional	 currency.	 The	 Group	 policy	 has	 the	 objective	 of	
reducing	 exposure	 to	 revaluation	 of	 monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities.	 Under	 the	 policy,	 material	 outstanding	 foreign	
currency	 balances	 arising	 from	 transactions	 in	 currencies	 other	 than	 a	 company’s	 functional	 currency,	 are	 hedged	
by	 either	 currency	 deposits,	 borrowings	 in	 currency	 or	 forward	 contracts.	 At	 the	 year	 end	 there	 were	 no	 forward	
contracts	 outstanding	 (2008:	 £1,689,000).

The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 financial	 instruments	 is	 equivalent	 to	 the	 amount	 stated	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.
Liquidity risk
Prudent	 liquidity	 management	 implies	 maintaining	 sufficient	 cash	 locally	 and	 the	 availability	 of	 committed	 credit	
facilities.	 Each	 group	 company	 is	 mainly	 financed	 by	 equity,	 self-generated	 cash	 flows	 and	 inter	 company	 loans.	
Credit risk
The	 Group’s	 credit	 risk	 is	 primarily	 attributable	 to	 its	 trade	 receivables.	 The	 amounts	 presented	 in	 the	 statement	 of	
financial	 performance	 are	 net	 of	 allowances	 for	 doubtful	 receivables,	 estimated	 by	 the	 Group’s	 management	 based	 on	
prior	 experience	 and	 their	 assessment	 of	 the	 current	 economic	 environment.	 Credit	 risks	 of	 new	 customers	 must	 be	
assessed	 locally	 before	 entering	 into	 contracts.	 The	 overall	 Group	 debtor	 exposure	 is	 monitored	 by	 the	 Group	 finance	
department	 and	 local	 entities	 must	 report	 the	 current	 exposure	 on	 a	 monthly	 basis.
The	 risk	 on	 liquid	 funds	 and	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 is	 limited	 because	 the	 counterparties	 are	 banks	 with	 high	
credit-ratings	 assigned	 by	 international	 credit-rating	 agencies.
The	 Group	 has	 no	 significant	 concentration	 of	 credit	 risk,	 other	 than	 that	 disclosed	 in	 note	 17,	 with	 exposure	 spread	
over	 a	 large	 number	 of	 customers	 and	 counterparties.	 V e r o S o f t w a r e P l c

Interest rate risk
The	 Group’s	 exposure	 to	 the	 risk	 of	 changes	 in	 market	 interest	 rates	 relates	 primarily	 to	 the	 Group’s	 long	 term	 debt	
obligations	 carrying	 floating	 interest	 rates.	
The	 following	 table	 demonstrates	 the	 sensitivity	 to	 a	 reasonably	 possible	 change	 in	 interest	 rates,	 with	 all	 other	
variables	 held	 constant,	 of	 the	 Group’s	 profit	 before	 tax	 through	 the	 impact	 on	 cash	 balances	 and	 floating	 rate	
borrowings.	 There	 is	 no	 other	 impact	 on	 the	 Group’s	 equity.

Capital management 
The	 Group’s	 objectives	 when	 managing	 capital	 are	 to	 safeguard	 the	 Group’s	 ability	 to	 continue	 as	 a	 going	 concern	
in	 order	 to	 provide	 returns	 for	 shareholders	 and	 benefits	 for	 other	 stakeholders	 and	 to	 maintain	 an	 optimal	 capital	
structure	 to	 reduce	 the	 cost	 of	 capital.	
No	 changes	 were	 made	 in	 the	 objectives,	 policies	 or	 processes	 during	 the	 years	 ended	 31	 December	 2009	 and	 31	
December	 2008.
The	 capital	 structure	 of	 the	 Group	 at	 31	 December	 2009	 consists	 of	 net	 debt	 (note	 30b)	 and	 total	 equity,	 comprising	
share	 capital,	 share	 premium,	 reserves	 and	 retained	 earnings,	 totalling	 £9,391,000	 at	 31	 December	 2009	 (2008:

We	 have	 audited	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 Vero	 Software	 Plc	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2009	 which	 are	 set	 out	 on	
pages	 50	 to	 54.	 The	 financial	 reporting	 framework	 that	 has	 been	 applied	 in	 their	 preparation	 is	 applicable	 law	 and	 United	
Kingdom	 Accounting	 Standards	 (United	 Kingdom	 Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Practice).
This	 report	 is	 made	 solely	 to	 the	 Company’s	 members,	 as	 a	 body,	 in	 accordance	 with	 Chapter	 3	 of	 Part	 16	 of	 the	
Companies	 Act	 2006.		 Our	 audit	 work	 has	 been	 undertaken	 so	 that	 we	 might	 state	 to	 the	 Company’s	 members	 those	
matters	 we	 are	 required	 to	 state	 to	 them	 in	 an	 auditor’s	 report	 and	 for	 no	 other	 purpose.	 To	 the	 fullest	 extent	 permitted	
by	 law,	 we	 do	 not	 accept	 or	 assume	 responsibility	 to	 anyone	 other	 than	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 Company’s	 members	 as	 a	
body,	 for	 our	 audit	 work,	 for	 this	 report,	 or	 for	 the	 opinions	 we	 have	 formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As	 explained	 more	 fully	 in	 the	 Directors’	 Responsibilities	 Statement	 set	 out	 on	 page	 15,	 the	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	
the	 preparation	 of	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 for	 being	 satisfied	 that	 they	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view.	 Our	 responsibility	 is	 to	
audit	 the	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland).		
Those	 standards	 require	 us	 to	 comply	 with	 the	 Auditing	 Practices	 Boards	 (APB’s)	 Ethical	 Standards	 for	 Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An	 audit	 involves	 obtaining	 evidence	 about	 the	 amounts	 and	 disclosures	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 sufficient	 to	 give	
reasonable	 assurance	 that	 the	 financial	 statements	 are	 free	 from	 material	 misstatement,	 whether	 caused	 by	 fraud	 or	 error.		
This	 includes	 an	 assessment	 of:	 whether	 the	 accounting	 policies	 are	 appropriate	 to	 the	 Company’s	 circumstances	 and	
have	 been	 consistently	 applied	 and	 adequately	 disclosed;	 the	 reasonableness	 of	 significant	 accounting	 estimates	 made	 by	
the	 directors;	 and	 the	 overall	 presentation	 of	 the	 financial	 statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In	 our	 opinion	 the	 financial	 statements:
● l give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 of	 the	 state	 of	 the	 Company’s	 affairs	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2009	 and	 of	 its	 loss	 for	 the	 year	
then	 ended;
● l have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 United	 Kingdom	 Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Practice;	 and
● l have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In	 our	 opinion	 the	 information	 given	 in	 the	 Directors’	 Report	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 for	 which	 the	 financial	 statements	 are	
prepared	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 financial	 statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We	 have	 nothing	 to	 report	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 following	 matters	 where	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 requires	 us	 to	 report	 to	 you	 if,	
in	 our	 opinion:
● l adequate	 accounting	 records	 have	 not	 been	 kept,	 or	 returns	 adequate	 for	 our	 audit	 have	 not	 been	 received	 from	
branches	 not	 visited	 by	 us;	 or
● l the	 financial	 statements	 are	 not	 in	 agreement	 with	 the	 accounting	 records	 and	 returns;	 or
● l certain	 disclosures	 of	 directors’	 remuneration	 specified	 by	 law	 are	 not	 made;	 or
● l we	 have	 not	 received	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 we	 require	 for	 our	 audit.

A.  Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 on	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 and	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	
accounting	 standards	 in	 the	 United	 Kingdom	 (UK	 GAAP).
No	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 is	 presented	 for	 the	 Company	 as	 provided	 by	 s408	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006.
Investments
Investments	 are	 included	 at	 cost	 less	 any	 provision	 for	 permanent	 diminution	 in	 value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred	 tax	 is	 provided	 in	 full	 on	 timing	 differences	 which	 result	 in	 an	 obligation	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 to	 pay	 more	
tax,	 or	 a	 right	 to	 pay	 less	 tax,	 at	 a	 future	 date,	 at	 rates	 expected	 to	 apply	 when	 they	 crystallise	 based	 on	 current	 tax	
rates	 and	 law.	 Timing	 differences	 arise	 from	 the	 inclusion	 of	 items	 of	 income	 and	 expenditure	 in	 taxation	 computations	
in	 periods	 different	 from	 those	 in	 which	 they	 are	 included	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.	 Deferred	 tax	 is	 not	 provided	 on	
unremitted	 earnings	 of	 subsidiaries	 where	 there	 is	 no	 commitment	 to	 remit	 those	 earnings.	 Deferred	 tax	 assets	 are	
recognised	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 regarded	 as	 more	 likely	 than	 not	 that	 they	 will	 be	 recovered.	 Deferred	 tax	 assets	 and	
liabilities	 are	 not	 discounted.	 Deferred	 tax	 is	 not	 recognised	 where	 it	 is	 not	 material.
Share based payments
The	 fair	 value	 of	 employee	 share	 plans	 is	 calculated	 using	 a	 Black–Scholes	 model.	 In	 accordance	 with	 FRS	 20	 “Share	
based	 payment”	 the	 resulting	 cost	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 over	 the	 vesting	 periods	 of	 the	 plan.	 The	
value	 of	 the	 charge	 is	 adjusted	 to	 reflect	 the	 expected	 and	 actual	 levels	 of	 options	 vesting.
Foreign currency
Transactions	 in	 foreign	 currency	 are	 included	 in	 the	 accounts	 at	 the	 rate	 of	 exchange	 ruling	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	
transaction.	 Monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 expressed	 in	 foreign	 currency	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 rates	 ruling	 at	 the	
balance	 sheet	 date	 and	 any	 differences	 on	 translation	 are	 dealt	 with	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account.
Cash flow statement
The	 Company	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 exemption	 in	 FRS	 1	 “Cash	 flow	 statements”,	 which	 provides	 that	 where	 a	
company	 is	 a	 member	 of	 a	 group	 and	 a	 consolidated	 cash	 flow	 statement	 is	 published,	 the	 Company	 does	 not	 have	 to	
prepare	 a	 cash	 flow	 statement.
Related party transactions
The	 Company	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 exemption	 available	 under	 FRS	 8	 “Related	 Party	 Disclosures”	 not	 to	 disclose	
transactions	 between	 Group	 companies.	
B. Profit for the financial year
As	 permitted	 by	 s408	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 the	 Company	 has	 elected	 not	 to	 present	 its	 own	 profit	 and	 loss	
account	 for	 the	 year.	 The	 Company	 reported	 a	 loss	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2009	 of	 £175,000	 	
(2008:	 £25,000	 profit).

Our brands 
  
 
     
      
B&Q is the largest 
home improvement and 
garden centre retailer  
in the UK and Ireland 
offering around  
40,000 products for the 
homemaker, occasional 
to serious DIYers, and 
trade professionals. In 
China, the business is 
adapted to the local 
preference for a  
‘Do-it-for-Me’, model. It 
specialises in the fitting 
out and decoration of 
new apartments. 
 With up to 50,000 
products under one 
roof, Castorama France 
is one of the leading 
home improvement 
retailers in France.  
Like B&Q, Castorama 
targets retail customers 
and DIYers and has an 
emphasis on style  
and inspiration for 
homemakers. In Poland 
and Russia there is a 
bigger emphasis on 
projects, as the home 
improvement market  
is at an earlier stage of 
its development. 
 In both France and 
Spain, Brico Dépôt  
is primarily aimed at 
serious DIYers and 
professional builders. 
It operates a low-price 
format which offers 
customers a choice  
of 10,000 products 
available in larger 
product quantities.  
The same format is  
now being introduced 
into Romania. 
Screwfix is the UK’s 
largest omnichannel 
supplier of trade  
tools, accessories  
and hardware to trade 
professionals and 
serious DIY enthusiasts. 
In addition to its 
catalogue and website, 
Screwfix operates stores 
across the UK.  
 Koçtas ¸, Kingfisher’s 
joint venture in Turkey, 
is now the number one 
home improvement 
retailer in the country. 
Its stores are aimed  
at mainstream 
consumers, 
homemakers  
and occasional  
to serious DIYers. 
Kingfisher Group Executive 
Kingfisher’s Group Executive team meets monthly and is responsible for the overall strategic decision-making of the Group.

It has been another difficult year for 
retailers, due to the challenging economic 
environment which has affected several of 
the markets in which Kingfisher operates. 
In France, our biggest market, high levels 
of unemployment and higher taxes  
have led to consumer uncertainty, with 
customers opting to save more rather than 
spend more. In the UK, we saw a tough 
start to the year but an improvement as 
the year progressed, helped by falling 
unemployment and positive signs in the 
housing market. 
Despite this weak economic backdrop, 
Kingfisher was able to deliver some 
growth, with adjusted pre-tax profits 
increasing by 4.1% on the previous  
year to £744 million. We generated  
£559 million of free cash flow and 
strengthened our balance sheet, finishing 
the year with net cash of £238 million.  
As a result, the Board recommended  
an increase in the full year dividend of  
4.7%, making a total of 9.9p. I am also 
delighted to announce the start of a 
programme to return surplus capital to 
our shareholders, in addition to the annual 
dividend, the first such programme in 
Kingfisher’s 32-year history. 
Highlights of the year included another 
very strong performance from Screwfix  
in the UK, which continued to expand  
fast, opening its 300
th
 outlet during the 
year. B&Q had a more difficult year and 
so the B&Q management team was 
strengthened in order to better position 
the business for the opportunities that any 
improvement in the economy should 
provide. In France, Castorama grew its 
share of a market that was slightly down 
during the year, and we continued to 
expand the Brico Dépôt brand, with new 
stores in France and Spain, as well as  
the acquisition of 15 stores in Romania, 
Kingfisher’s first new market since 2006. 
We continued to make good progress  
with our strategic agenda, Creating the 
Leader, which aims to position Kingfisher 
as a clear leader in home improvement 
retailing. Many of the short-term benefits 
of this programme have been used to 
support our results in a weaker than 
anticipated economic environment, 
including improving prices for customers 
in our major markets of France, the UK 
and Poland.  
Further progress was made on our 
sustainability agenda through Kingfisher’s 
Net Positive plan, with achievements in 
responsibly sourced timber, energy usage 
and community projects. You can read 
more about these initiatives in the Chief 
Executive’s statement on page 5 and 
the Net Positive section on pages  
18 to 19.  
We are committed to diversity among our 
workforce and there is further information 
on our diversity policies and metrics on 
pages 18 to 19, 37 and 69.  
As always, I would like to thank our 
79,000 staff for their hard work during  
the year. In a people business such as 
retailing their contribution is vital, and  
it is through them that we can achieve 
Kingfisher’s purpose of helping our 
customers have better homes and  
better lives.

Although the economic environment was 
difficult, Kingfisher made good progress 
during the year. After an extremely difficult 
first quarter, which was affected by poor 
spring weather, the environment improved 
as the year progressed. The economic 
backdrop was generally soft across 
Europe for much of the year, particularly 
in France, our most significant market. 
However, our self-help programme 
enabled us to grow profits and improve 
our balance sheet strength, whilst also 
investing in lower prices and improved 
convenience for our customers. We 
therefore finished the year in good shape.  
We have continued to make good 
progress with our Creating the Leader 
strategy, which has supported short-term 
trading results whilst also building 
Kingfisher’s longer-term future. As well as 
emphasising our affordability credentials 
through price initiatives, we have 
continued to make home improvement 
easier for customers through an improved 
online offer at B&Q in the UK & Ireland 
and upgraded websites in Turkey, China, 
Brico Dépôt France and Spain.  
Further progress was made in sharing  
our best ranges across more of our 
businesses, with particular progress in 
own brand paint. In October we held our 
inaugural One Team Product Show in Lille 
where 10,000 of our new product ranges 
were unveiled to 6,000 store colleagues 
from around the Group. Expansion 
continued with more than 80 new stores 
opened across Kingfisher, including 60 at 
our Screwfix business. Screwfix had 
another excellent year, growing sales by 
more than 17% (on a 52 week basis) and 
creating nearly 900 jobs, whilst continuing 
to develop its industry-leading online 
operations. Kingfisher continues to work 
more closely as a networked organisation, 
with further investment in our One Team 
Academy, which provides training 
modules for senior management.  
At Kingfisher we are also committed to 
making a positive contribution to society 
and the planet as we grow our business. 
Through our Net Positive programme  
we help our customers to create more 
sustainable homes, while improving 
efficiency and opening up new sources  
of revenue for our companies. We made 
good progress this year towards many  
of our ambitious targets in timber, 
energy use and new community 
engagement projects. See pages  
18 to 19 for more details. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to drive 
our Creating the Leader programme this 
year. Our key priorities will include  
starting the roll-out of our omnichannel 
programmes across the Group (allowing 
customers to shop with us in any way  
they prefer – via shops, the internet or 
catalogues). In addition we will extend  
our sourcing programmes and initiate  
a four-year Group-wide IT change 
programme. This will involve replacing  
our physical infrastructure and software  
to enable a step change in our customers’ 
shopping experience.  
We are also seeking organic growth in  
our selling space of 2% (71 new stores), 
including two new country entries,  
Brico Dépôt into Portugal and Screwfix  
into Germany. 
Importantly, we will focus our portfolio to 
maximise our economic returns, including 
the disposal of our stake in the Hornbach 
business following our decision to expand 
into the Romanian and German markets 
where Hornbach operates. In China, our 
B&Q business is now stable and so we are 
now looking for a strategic partner to  
help grow the business and replicate the 
successful partner approach in Turkey.  
B&Q UK & Ireland has performed resiliently 
during the economic downturn, growing 
profits in a declining market. Looking 
ahead, with its customers and market 
evolving very quickly B&Q has set about 
redoubling its efforts to achieve future 
growth and continued success. Following 
the strengthening of the B&Q management 
team in October 2013 under the direct 
leadership of Kevin O’Byrne, B&Q is 
working towards simplifying its business  
to make it more agile in the marketplace. 
The business aims to grow sales and 
economic profit, for example by delivering 
an improved omnichannel experience for 
customers, an optimised store footprint  
and driving footfall with better targeted 
marketing and more competitive pricing. 
Given the success of the last six years in 
improving our balance sheet and cash 
generation, and having successfully  
resolved an outstanding French tax case, I 
am delighted that we are able to announce 
a multi-year programme of additional  
capital returns. This wi ll be in addition to  
the annual dividend and will start during 
2014/15 with around £200 million. At this 
level Kingfisher would have the flexibility to 
continue reinvesting in the business, pay  
a healthy dividend an d capitalise on value-
enhancing consolidation opportunities. 
As we start the new financial year,  
we are well placed to benefit from a  
pick-up in consumer spending as 
Europe’s economies return to growth.  
Our prospects remain bright, giving us 
confidence to invest in the business and 
actively manage our portfolio, including 
expanding into new markets, whilst also 
commencing a programme to return 
surplus capital to our shareholders.

What we do 
Kingfisher is a retailer of home 
improvement products and services.  
The vast majority of our sales take place 
through our 1,124 stores in nine countries 
across Europe and in China. Increasingly 
we are also selling via the internet. 
How we do it – our Net  
Positive ambitions 
In the broadest sense our business 
creates value for society in a number  
of ways. We help people to have better 
homes for themselves and their families 
and we have a long heritage of helping 
them do this in a more sustainable  
way. We operate in the heart of local 
communities, supporting local projects, 
positively impacting the environment and 
importantly providing local employment. 
Over 79,000 people work in our 
businesses and many more work for  
our suppliers. And we contributed  
£1.71 billion in 2013/14 to the economies 
in which we operate through taxes borne 
and collected. We aim to do more than 
minimise our impact; instead we aspire  
to have a positive impact on the world.  
We call this approach Net Positive  
and we believe this gives us a ‘licence  
to operate’ for the long-term (see pages  
18 to 19 for more information).  
Financial value  
This section concentrates on the financial 
value that we create – that is, the cash  
we generate. Cash is the life-blood of any 
business as it can be reinvested to keep a 
business healthy and growing, and is also 
used to reward the owners who bear all 
the investment risk. For Kingfisher 
maximising our cash generation in a 
responsible way means maximising sales 
and minimising costs whilst observing  
key behaviours – responsibility, honesty, 
passion, openness and adaptability.  
The better we are at this the more cash 
we generate and the more value we  
create for our people, our shareholders 
and society at large. 
Maximising sales 
We believe home improvement is  
an attractive retail sector as spending  
on the home is a key priority  
for householders.  
As a specialist in this area we aim to 
provide a wide product choice and  
expert advice while using our international 
strength and capability to bring new, more 
sustainable and more affordable products 
to market. There are four key areas we 
focus on in order to maximise sales: 
Customers 
We aim to have mass appeal with a 
compelling choice of products and 
services so that we can capture a large 
share of the home improvement market. 
We recognise that ‘one size does not fit all’ 
and so we have adapted our customer 
offer to best suit the different needs of  
the Do-it-Yourself (DIY) customer, the  
Do-it-for-Me (DFM) customer and the 
professional tradesman.  
People 
Retail is a people business and it  
is particularly true in our sector as 
customers often need help and  
advice when shopping for home 
improvement products and services.  
We aim to recruit and retain diverse  
and talented teams to serve our 
customers and we prioritise investment  
in their training and development.  
Products 
We use our scale and international  
reach to find the world’s best products 
and make them available to customers in  
their local market. The rate of innovation 
in home improvement tends to be slower 
than in other retail sectors, such as 
electricals or clothing, and so we are 
increasingly deploying our international 
scale and experience to work with 
suppliers to stimulate innovation and 
create better, more sustainable and 
affordable products. 
Channels  
We want to make home improvement  
as easy as possible for our customers and 
this includes giving them as wide a choice 
as possible of ways to shop with us.  
As well as having local stores with 
extended opening hours we increasingly 
offer home delivery and ‘click & collect’  
via the internet. This type of retailing  
is called omnichannel and our most 
advanced business in this area is  
Screwfix in the UK.  
Minimising costs  
The biggest cost in our business  
is buying the products that we sell  
to our customers.  
Our suppliers benefit from the huge  
scale that we can offer them as one of  
the largest buyers of home improvement 
products in the world. The certainty of 
large scale orders means they can operate 
their businesses more efficiently and 
these benefits are shared between the 
manufacturer and Kingfisher – helping  
to minimise our costs. 
The next major cost is selling and 
distribution, principally the cost of running 
our stores, the cost of getting products  
to our stores and the cost of our people.  
We are constantly working on a rolling 
programme of cost efficiencies and 
productivity initiatives to minimise these 
costs sustainably. 
Cash generated 
The net result of maximising our sales 
whilst minimising our costs is the 
optimisation of the cash we generate 
each year. Over the last six years we 
have generated £5.5 billion of operating 
cash flow from our business model.  
We have strengthened our balance sheet 
by eliminating our financial net debt  
and we have reinvested £1.7 billion in 
modernising and expanding our store 
network and upgrading our IT and  
supply chain infrastructure to underpin 
our future prospects. And we have 
returned £1.0 billion to our shareholders 
as annual dividends. Over the same 
period our market value has grown  
from £3.4 billion to £8.8 billion. 
Our strategy for delivering this, known  
as Creating the Leader, is on pages  
8 to 17, including Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) and progress to date.
Our unique contribution as a business is to harness our home 
improvement experience, our heritage as a leader in sustainability and 
our scale and sourcing capability to bring new, more sustainable and 
more affordable products to market. This means our customers can  
have better homes, the planet’s resources can be protected and we 
generate value for our people, communities and shareholders.  Maximising

Our markets 
We currently operate in nine 
countries, spanning nearly 600 
million households. 
Our research shows that spending on home improvement  
is a key priority for householders, making this an attractive  
sector for retailers. It is also attractive because of the relatively 
small number of well-known manufacturer brands. This means 
a specialist home improvement retailer provides a vital role for 
the consumer by offering a wide product choice and expert 
advice. We can offer a high proportion of own brand product, 
achieve economies of scale and have a more defensible position 
against online or generalist operators when compared with  
other retail segments. Read more about our business model  
on pages 6 to 7. 
Our strategy
Our unique contribution as a 
business to our customers is  
that we can harness our home 
improvement experience, our 
heritage as a leader in sustainability 
and our international scale and 
sourcing capability to bring new, 
more sustainable and more 
affordable products to market.  
This means our customers can have better homes, the  
planet’s resources can be protected and we generate value  
for our people, communities and shareholders. 
By also providing our customers with project advice and new 
shopping channels to complement our stores, we will make  
it easier for them to adapt their homes to their evolving needs.  
Our shorthand for describing this purpose is Better Homes, 
Better Lives.  
The next phase of our developm ent towards this vision –  
Creating the Leader – builds on the success of the previous 
phase known as Delivering Value, which has repositioned 
Kingfisher as a stronger business in the attractive home 
improvement market.

Predicting the potential retail profit benefits from this programme 
today, when we don’t know the economic conditions or 
competitive landscape we will face in the future, is very difficult. 
However, whatever the conditions, we believe our efforts will 
drive higher LFL sales, higher gross margin and more cost  
 
efficiencies than would have been delivered without this
programme. In total we estimate that this would create an 
additional £300 million of annualised retail profit in the fifth  
year (2016/17), net of price reinvestment and based on the  
size of the business and market conditions in 2011/12.

Our Net Positive Approach 
By becoming Net Positive we are making 
it easier for our customers to enjoy homes 
that are better and more sustainable. By 
operating in a Net Positive way we aim to 
become carbon positive, waste nothing, 
be restorative to the environment, and 
have a positive impact on people and 
communities. This will enable us to create 
sustained value for our business and 
stakeholders. It is making our business 
stronger, generating new streams of 
revenue and reducing our costs. For 
example, we have saved at least £30 
million over three years through improved 
recycling and energy efficiency at our 
stores and operations.  
We have 50 ambitious targets. Our  
Group-level priorities – timber, energy, 
innovation and communities – are areas 
where we believe we can have the most 
significant impact. 
Our Net Positive priorities: 
Timber 
Timber is an essential raw material for  
our business. Through responsible 
sourcing, we aim to safeguard future 
supplies at an affordable price while 
protecting and enhancing forests.  
This makes it easier for customers to 
make more sustainable choices.  
In 2013/14, 87% of the timber (by volume) 
used in our products was responsibly 
sourced (89% 2012/13). This decrease 
reflects our work during 2013/14 to 
improve the quality and scope of our  
data, which identified a number of 
products not previously included in the 
data scope. B&Q UK achieved 100% 
responsibly sourced timber in its  
products in 2011.  
During 2013 B&Q developed a responsibly 
sourced sandpaper range, which will bring 
it to 100% responsible sourcing for both 
timber and paper products. Screwfix, Brico 
Dépôt Spain and Brico Dépôt France have 
all achieved over 90% responsible timber 
and paper sourcing. 
We have launched forest projects that are 
enhancing biodiversity and safeguarding 
forests or woodlands by getting local 
communities involved. Brico Dépôt Spain, 
for example, launched two projects during 
2013 that support reforestation and 
enable school children and employees to 
take part in forest conservation. Protecting 
and improving forests helps to ensure a 
resilient and sustainable timber supply 
chain for the future. 
Energy  
Our energy saving products and services 
help customers to reduce their bills and 
create more comfortable homes. Our 
customers are now saving almost 7 TWh 
(terawatt-hours*) every year through the 
energy saving products they’ve purchased 
from us since 2011/12. We estimate  
this could save our customers over  
£450 million every year (based on the 
average UK household energy bill). 
We reduced the energy intensity 
(kWh/m
2
) of our property portfolio by  
8% from our 2010/11 baseline through 
measures such as the introduction of 
energy efficient LED lighting in stores and 
distribution centres. New stores built to 
eco-design principles opened at several 
Operating Companies including Moulins 
(Brico Dépôt France) and Marseille 
(Castorama France). 
We reduced total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
emissions by 5% from our 2010/11 
baseline (see table on page 19).  
Innovation 
Sales of products with eco-credentials 
(those with a lower environmental impact) 
totalled 21% of total sales revenue, 
against our 2020 target of 50%. ‘Best-in-
class’ eco-products (our most innovative 
eco-products) accounted for 5% of sales. 
We have an ambition to develop ‘closed 
loop’ products and supply chains, so that 
the raw materials used in our ranges can 
be continually reused, repurposed and 
recycled. This will enable us to reduce 
costs and waste, and access new, more 
sustainable sources of materials.  
We launched our own closed loop 
calculator in 2013. This practical tool 
enables us to assess and improve the 
closed loop credentials of our products. 
Using the calculator we have identified 
products in our ranges with ‘closed  
loop credentials’. These include the 
‘Infinite’ kitchen worktop developed  
by Castorama France from waste  
wood, which is lighter and more water  
resistant than traditional worktops (see 
www.kingfisher.com/netpositive/infinite).  
Communities 
It is important to us that we invest in 
projects that help people to acquire 
practical home improvement skills and  
that improve the lives of those living in  
the communities near to our stores and 
within our supply chain. 
A number of our community projects 
address this ambition. For example,  
to inspire the next generation of home 
improvers, Castorama Poland runs free 
DIY classes for school children, reaching 
47,000 young people since 2012/13, 
while B&Q UK supported projects to  
help Scouts get their DIY badge. 
 
Becoming Net Positive 
Net Positive is how we make a positive contribution to society  
while creating a more successful business.

We have supported 530 community 
projects since 2012/13. Many Operating 
Companies also have company-wide 
programmes. Screwfix, for example,  
has launched the Screwfix Foundation,  
a new charity that will raise funds to fix, 
repair, maintain and improve properties 
and community facilities for those in need. 
Other issues 
We work on improving our performance  
in three important areas: Employees, 
including creating a diverse workforce and 
improving health and safety performance; 
Suppliers, including the standards we set 
through our Code of Conduct for Factory 
Working Conditions; and the Environment, 
including reducing waste and water use, 
protecting biodiversity and phasing out 
harmful chemicals. Areas of focus during 
2013/14 included: 
Human Rights 
We take steps to protect the human rights 
of people affected by our business, in  
line with the UN Universal Declaration  
of Human Rights and the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human 
Rights. This commitment applies to all  
our interactions with our stakeholders, 
including employees, suppliers and 
communities. During 2013, we 
commissioned a specialist consultancy  
to assess how well our business practices 
align with the Guiding Principles in the 
areas of supply chain, communities, 
human resources and partners. We are 
using the feedback and the results of  
a wider Net Positive policy review to 
further strengthen our policies relating  
to human rights. Our Code of Conduct  
for Factory Working Conditions (see 
www.kingfisher.com/netpositive/code) sets 
out the human rights standards we expect 
supplier factories to meet. We monitor the 
compliance of key suppliers with our Code 
and in 2013/14 we audited over 500 
suppliers and factories.  
Diversity 
By creating an inclusive culture and 
diverse workforce we benefit from  
a wide range of skills, experience and 
perspectives. This improves customer 
insight, widens our talent pool and 
enables better decision-making. We 
encourage diversity in all its forms.  
During 2013/14, women made up  
27% of the Kingfisher Board, 18% of 
senior managers
(1)
 and 39% of our total 
workforce (see the Directors’ Report on 
page 69 for more information).  
How we manage sustainability 
Net Positive is a core part of our Creating 
the Leader corporate strategy, with the 
Group Sustainability Director reporting 
directly to the Group Chief Executive. Our 
Operating Companies are taking the lead 
in implementing Net Positive. Each has a 
three-year plan for how they will 
contribute to our Net Positive goals, with 
targets for their business. By making Net 
Positive part of how our companies work, 
we will ensure that our activities are 
relevant and meaningful in each of our 
markets and that our companies are able 
to maximise the benefits for their 
customers and their businesses. 
We launched our One Academy Net 
Positive executive education module 
during 2013/14, designed to further 
improve understanding of Net Positive 
among our most senior leaders.  
We established the Net Positive Advisory 
Council in 2013, a group of senior 
external experts in different aspects of 
sustainability, who will provide advice, 
insight and challenge to help us progress 
towards Net Positive.

Overview 
Statutory profit after tax increased by 25.9% in the year to  
£710 million. The statutory results for the year have benefited 
significantly from exceptional items which add £17 million to 
profit before tax, £131 million to profit after tax and 5.5p to  
basic earnings per share. For comparative purposes adjusted 
measures are therefore presented. The exceptional items are 
detailed further below.  
The Group’s financial reporting year ends on the nearest 
Saturday to 31 January. The current year is for the 52 weeks 
ended 1 February 2014 with the comparative financial year 
being for the 53 weeks ended 2 February 2013. This only 
impacts the UK & Ireland businesses with all of the other 
businesses reporting on a calendar basis as a result of local 
requirements. The effect of the 53rd week on the prior  
year results of the Group is the inclusion of an additional  
£72 million sales and an immaterial benefit to retail profit. 
Total sales grew by 3.5% on a constant currency 52 week basis 
and increased by 5.2% to £11.1 billion (2012/13: £10.6 billion) 
on a reported rate basis. On a like-for-like basis, Group sales 
were up 0.7%. During the year, a net additional 91 new stores 
were opened, including 60 Screwfix outlets and 15 acquired 
stores in Romania, taking the store network to 1,079 stores 
(excluding 45 Turkey JV stores). 
Retail profit before exceptional items increased by £27 million to 
£805 million (2012/13 restated: £778 million), including a £24 
million favourable foreign exchange movement representing a 
0.7% increase on a constant currency basis.

Kingfisher France 
Kingfisher France sales grew by 0.8% (-1.2% LFL) to £4,423 
million in soft markets impacted by weak consumer confidence. 
Across the two businesses, seven net new stores were opened 
and four were revamped, adding around 4% new space.  
Gross margins were down 30 basis points, with ongoing self-
help initiatives offset by higher price promotional activity across 
both businesses. Continued focus on cost control, including 
lower levels of variable pay, re sulted in retail profit down  
4.7% compared to last year.  
Castorama total sales grew by 2.3% (+0.5% LFL) to £2,469 
million. According to Banque de France data, sales for the home 
improvement market were down 1.4%. Castorama benefited 
from its innovative ‘Do-it-Smart’ approach aimed at making  
home improvement projects easier for customers. LFL sales of  
indoor products were up around 1% with sales of new kitchen, 
bathroom and storage ranges performing particularly well.  
Sales of outdoor seasonal products were down around 1%.  
Brico Dépôt total sales declined by 1.0% (-3.0% LFL) to  
£1,954 million. According to Kingfisher estimates, sales for  
the comparable market, which more specifically targets trade 
professionals and heavy DIYers, were down around 2%. Brico 
Dépôt benefited from self-help initiatives which continued to 
progress well. These included new ranges introduced last  
year (e.g. kitchen, bathroom and power tool ranges) and  
more ‘arrivages’ (rolling one-off special buys), reinforcing  
Brico Dépôt’s value credentials.

Note: 2012/13 retail profit comparatives restated by £3 million to reflect

profit, as per the amended IAS 19. 
Kingfisher UK & Ireland 
Kingfisher UK & Ireland total sales were up 2.7% (+1.1% LFL)  
to £4,363 million supported by a strong performance from 
Screwfix and encouraging early signs in the smaller tradesman 
market, offset by a slower underlying retail market.  
Kingfisher UK & Ireland delivered retail profit growth of 3.4%  
to £238 million. Gross margins were up 10 basis points with the 
benefits from ongoing self-help initiatives offset by investment  
in pricing across both businesses. A strong focus on operating 
cost efficiencies continued.  
B&Q UK & Ireland’s total sales were up 0.4% (+0.1% LFL) to 
£3,698 million. Sales of outdoor products were up around 2%. 
Sales of indoor products were down around 1%. TradePoint 
continues to progress with sales up around 7% compared  
to last year.  
In Ireland, following the conclus ion of the Examinership process  
in May 2013, one store was closed and significant rent reductions 
achieved across the remaining stor es. The business returned to 
break even in the second half of the year. 
The market for the UK’s leading home improvement retailers was 
up 3.8%, including seasonal ranges up 5.0%, following record 
adverse weather last year. On a comparable basis, B&Q UK & 
Ireland sales were up 1.7% and including Screwfix, up 4.1%. 
Strengthened management team  
B&Q is a strong brand with the market leading position in  
the attractive UK home improvement market. Despite a very 
challenging housing and economic backdrop for the last six 
years, during which its market declined around 12% (as per 
Kingfisher estimates – BCG commissioned report), Kingfisher  
UK & Ireland delivered broadly flat sales and achieved profit 
growth of 50% by exploiting the UK trade market opportunity, 
delivering a number of self-help initiatives whilst continuing to 
invest in B&Q’s stores and infrastructure. Looking ahead, its 
customers and market are evolving very quickly and B&Q UK  
& Ireland has set about redoubling its efforts to achieve future 
growth and continued success.  
In October 2013, Kevin O’Byrne, an executive director of 
Kingfisher plc, assumed direct leadership of B&Q UK & Ireland. 
He subsequently further strengthened the B&Q UK & Ireland 
board with the appointment of three executives from the fast 
growing, highly successful Screwfix business (Steve Willett, 
previously Screwfix CEO; David Lowther, Supply Chain; and Guy 
Eccles, HR) and the appointment of two senior executives from 
outside Kingfisher (Chris Moss as Marketing Director, formerly 
Virgin, Orange and 118 118; and more recently Darren Blackhurst 
as Commercial Director, formerly Tesco, ASDA and Matalan).  
This significantly strengthened management team has made  
an encouraging early start, working towards two key aims:  
1. Re-energising the business. Examples of priorities include 
improving store navigation and customer communication,  
and driving footfall with better targeted marketing.  
2. Simplifying the business and growing sales and economic 
profit to make it more agile in the market place and more 
efficient. Examples of priorities include delivering a seamless 
and efficient omnichannel experience for customers, 
optimising the store footprint, reducing complexity in the  
end-to-end supply chain, thereby reducing costs to support 
lower prices, and undertaking a detailed review of all the  
19 categories across our stores, focusing on customer needs 
and business models.    Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14

Other International total sales increased by 10.5% (+3.4% LFL) 
to £2,339 million driven by the acquisition of Romania, LFL 
growth in Poland, Russia and China and new store openings. 
Retail profit increased by 11.4% to £171 million primarily  
driven by Poland.  
During the year 15 net new stores were opened, two in Poland, 
one in Russia, four in Spain and eight in Turkey
(1)
. Including the 
acquisition of 15 additional stores in Romania in Q2, 17% net 
new space was added compared to last year.  
Sales in Poland were up 3.9% (+1.2% LFL) to £1,109 million 
reflecting new store openings. Gross margins were up 60 basis 
points with self-help initiatives more than offsetting investment  
in pricing which annualised during Q2. Productivity initiatives 
largely offset cost inflation resulting in a 10.9% increase in retail 
profit to £123 million. 
In Russia sales grew by 9.2% (+8.0% LFL) to £453 million 
benefiting from new store openings. LFL sales were up 10.5%  
in H1 though slower in H2 (+ 5.8% LFL). Retail profit was  
£15 million (2012/13: £16 million reported retail profit) reflecting 
higher pre-opening and advertising costs compared to last year. 
In Turkey, Kingfisher’s 50% JV, Koçtas ¸, grew sales by 8.0%

loss was £6 million (2012/13: £9 million reported loss) largely 
relating to costs on the new format store trial which opened in 
March 2013.

Profit after tax for the year was £710 million (2012/13: £564 
million). This resulted in the Group recording a basic EPS of 
30.0p in the year (2012/13: 24.1p). 
Taxation  
The effective corporation tax rate, excluding exceptional and prior 
year items is 26% this year co mpared with 27% in 2012/13. The 
overall rate of tax includes the impact of exceptional items and 
prior year adjustments. The impact of such items reduced the 
rate from 26% to 6% (2012/13: 18%) reflecting the positive 
decision in the Kesa demerger French tax case (see exceptional 
items below), the impact on deferred taxes of the further 3% fall 
in the UK rate and the release of prior year provisions either 
reassessed or time expired. 
Kingfisher’s effective tax rate is sensitive to the blend of tax rates 
and profits in the Group’s various jurisdictions. The adjusted 
effective rate of tax, calculated on profit before exceptional items, 
prior year tax adjustments and the impact of rate changes, is 
26% (2012/13: 27%). This is higher than the UK statutory rate 
because of the amount of Group profit that is earned in higher 
tax jurisdictions and because no future benefit is assumed for 
losses incurred in overseas jurisdictions such as China.

The effective rate of tax is lower than in 2012/13 as a result of 
the mix of profits and tax rate changes in some of the countries

2013/14 were the UK statutory tax rate falling from 24% to

Tax contribution  
Kingfisher makes a significant economic contribution to the 
countries in which it operates. In 2013/14 it contributed £1.71 
billion in taxes it both pays an d collects for these governments. 
The Group pays tax on its profits, its properties, in employing 
79,000 people, in environmental levies, in customs duties and 
levies as well as other local taxes. The most significant taxes it 
collects for governments are the sales taxes charged to its 
customers on their purchases (VAT) and employee payroll 
related taxes. Taxes paid and collected together represent 
Kingfisher’s total tax contribution which is shown below:

The 2013 survey ranked Kingfisher 31st for its Total Tax 
Contribution in the UK. In 2013, 101 companies contributed  
to the survey.  
 
Taxation governance and risk management 
The Kingfisher Code of Conduct applies high standards of 
professionalism and integrity which underpin the Group’s 
approach to tax policy, strategy and governance, which is Board 
approved. Our core tax objective is to pay the right amount of tax 
at the right time and to comply with all relevant tax legislation in 
all Group entities. The Kingfisher Group undertakes its activities, 
and pays tax in the countries in which it operates, in compliance 
with the local and worldwide tax rules. In all countries where it 
has activities, it has the staff, premises and other assets required 
to run its business there. The responsibility for tax policy and 
management of tax risks lies with the Group Finance Director 
and the Group Tax Director who engage regularly with the main 
Board and the Audit Committee on all tax matters. 
We manage the tax that we pay and the risks that arise having 
regard to the interests of all stakeholders including our investors, 
our customers, our staff and the governments and communities 
in the countries in which we operate. Tax risks can arise from 
changes in law, differences in interpretation of law and the failure 
to comply with the applicable rules and procedures. We manage 
and control these risks through local management, the tax 
professionals we employ and using advice from reputable 
professional firms. Where disputes arise with the authorities 
these are dealt with promptly in a professional open and 
constructive manner.

Kingfisher paid €138 million tax to the French tax authorities  
in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the 
Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this as an exceptional 
tax charge. Following a successful appeal Kingfisher received  
a refund totalling €169 million from the French tax authorities  
in September 2009. The French tax authorities appealed this 
decision with the final level of court finding in Kingfisher’s favour 
in July 2013. This decision remo ved any uncertainty over the 
position and resulted in an exceptional credit of £145 million 
(€169 million), of which £27 million has been recognised in 
interest and £118 million in taxation. 
In 2013/14 Kingfisher acquired Bricostore in Romania  
and announced its intention to pilot four Screwfix outlets in 
Germany in 2014. At the same time Kingfisher undertook  
a review of its strategic investment in Hornbach, which has 
operations in both of these markets. On 31 January 2014 the 
Group decided to divest its equity stake in Hornbach and also 
waive its right to appoint directors to the Hornbach board.  
This decision has impacted the 2013/14 financial statements  
by changing the basis on which the Group accounts for its 
shareholding, resulting in a net £14 million exceptional loss with 
the investment being impaired to its market value of £198 million 
and reclassified as an asset held for sale. In 2013/14 the Group 
recorded a £14 million pre-exceptional profit in relation to its 
share of Hornbach’s results, comprising £26 million of retail 
profit less £12 million share of interest and tax.  
Following the end of the 2013/14 financial year, on 24 March 
2014 Kingfisher agreed to sell all th e shares it holds in Hornbach 
Holding AG and Hornbach-Baumarkt AG which together  
formed its 21.2% stake in Hornbach, for approximately £195 
million. The stakes in the listed Hornbach Holding preference 
shares and Hornbach Baumarkt have been sold to international 
institutional investors in an ‘accelerated bookbuilding’ by 
Berenberg Bank. The Hornbach family have agreed to buy  
the non-listed ordinary shares in Hornbach Holding AG. 
Acquisition and integration costs of £5 million principally 
comprise costs of acquiring and integrating the Bricostore 
Romania business. 
The current year also includes an exceptional credit of £7 million 
for Ireland restructuring, reflecting the release of provisions 
recorded in January 2013 when B&Q Ireland entered into an 
Examinership process. Following the conclusion of this process 
in May 2013, only one store was closed rather than the potential 
of five, with over 600 jobs saved. 
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) have increased by 24.5%  
to 30.0p (2012/13: 24.1p). On a more comparable basis, 
removing the impact of exceptional items, financing fair value 
remeasurements and the effect of prior year tax adjustments, 
adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 4.9% to  
23.4p (2012/13: 22.3p).

Dividends 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 6.78p which  
results in a full year dividend of 9.9p, an increase of 4.7% 
(2012/13: 9.46p). The final dividend maintains full year dividend 
cover on adjusted earnings at 2.4 times (2012/13: 2.4 times). 
Going forward, the Group continues to aim to move towards a 
medium-term annual dividend cover of around 2.5 times.  
At this level, the Board believes the dividend will continue to  
be prudently covered by earnings and free cash flow and remain 
consistent with the capital needs of the business.  
The final dividend for the year ended 1 February 2014 will be 
paid on 16 June 2014 to shareholde rs on the register at close  
of business on 16 May 2014, subject to approval of shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 12 June 2014.  
A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is available to shareholders 
who would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the 
Company. The shares will go ex-dividend on 14 May 2014. For 
those shareholders electing to receive the DRIP the last date for 
receipt of electing is 23 May 2014. 
Economic returns 
Management are focused on Kingfisher Economic Profit (KEP) 
as a main measure of return on cap ital. It is used in the capital 
investment process, to assess performance and drive returns in 
strategic plans. KEP is derived from the concept of Economic 
Value Added representing earnings after a charge for the annual 
cost of capital employed in the business. Earnings are defined as 
adjusted post-tax profit, excluding interest, property lease costs 
and exceptional items. A charge is then deducted by applying 
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to capital employed. 
For the purposes of consistency both WACC and capital 
employed are lease adjusted. Leases are capitalised based on  
an estimate of their long-term property yields. In order to focus 
on controllable factors both WACC and long-term property yields 
are based on those in place when KEP was introduced.

Net cash at the end of the year was £238 million (2012/13:  
£38 million net cash).  
Free cash flow of £559 million was generated in the year,  
an increase of £229 million year on year primarily due to the 
movement in working capital. This is a combination of LME and 
week 53 impacts in the prior year, the reversal of a higher stock 
position last year ahead of an early Easter and Chinese New 
Year, and a higher level of showroom deposits at the year end, 
following a solid kitchens, bedrooms & bathrooms trading 
strategy for B&Q UK in Q4. 
During the year free cash flow generated was utilised by the 
dividend being increased to £224 million, the acquisition of 
Bricostore Romania and an additional £24 million to acquire  
6 million shares to cover existing share incentive schemes, 
thereby avoiding dilution of current shareholders.  
Capital expenditure 
Gross capital expenditure for the year was £304 million 
(2012/13: £316 million) with a further £63 million invested  
on Bricostore Romania. A total of £12 million of proceeds from 
disposals was received during the year (2012/13: £17 million).  
The Group has a rigorous approach to capital allocation and 
authorisation. The process includes: 
• An annual strategic planning process based on detailed 
medium-term plans for all businesses for the next three  
years. This process drives the key strategic capital allocation 
decisions and the output is reviewed by the Board; 
• A capital approval process through a capital expenditure 
committee, attended by the Group Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, CEO Group Productivity and Development, 
Group Property Director and Group General Counsel.  
The committee is delegated to review all projects above  
£0.75 million and to sign-off the projects between £0.75 
million and £15.0 million (including the capitalised value of 
lease commitments); 
• Projects above £15.0 million are required to be approved  
by the Board. All projects above £0.75 million are notified  
to the Board; 
• Clear investment criteria including KEP and NPV (Net Present 
Value) and challenging hurdle rates for IRR (Internal Rate of 
Return) and DPB (Discounted PayBack); 
• An annual post-investment review process to undertake a  
full assessment of all projects above £0.75 million which  
were completed in the last 2 to 4 years. The findings of this 
exercise are considered by both the capital expenditure 
committee and the Board and used to inform the 
assumptions for similar project proposals going forward; 
• An annual review of KEP by store is performed which  
drives plans to improve the returns of weaker stores, and 
develop lessons from higher returning stores.

Financial risk management 
Kingfisher’s treasury function has primary responsibility  
for managing certain financial risks to which the Group is 
exposed, details of which are provided in note 24 of the  
Group Financial Statements. 
Management of balance sheet and liquidity  
risk and financing 
The Group finished the year with £238 million of net cash  
on the balance sheet. However, the Group’s overall leverage is 
more significant when including capitalised lease debt that in 
accordance with accounting standards does not appear on the 
balance sheet. The ratio of the Group’s lease adjusted net debt 
(capitalising leases at 8 times annual rent) to EBITDAR is 2.3 
times as at the year end. At this level the Group has financial 
flexibility whilst retaining an efficient cost of capital. 
A reconciliation of lease adjusted net debt to EBITDAR is set  
out below:

Lease adjusted net debt to EBITDAR 2.3x 2.4x
(1) Kingfisher believes 8x is a reasonable industry standard for estimating the 
economic value of its leased assets. 
Kingfisher aims to maintain its solid investment grade credit 
rating whilst investing in the business where economic returns 
are attractive and paying a healthy annual dividend to 
shareholders. After satisfying these key aims and taking into 
account the economic and trading outlook, any surplus capital 
would be returned to shareholders. 
Taking all these factors into account, in addition to increasing the 
annual dividend by 5% (to an estimated £234 million) the Board 
has approved a multi-year programme of additional capital 
returns to shareholders, starting with around £200 million during 
the financial year 2014/15. At this le vel we will retain flexibility to 
continue reinvesting in the business, paying a healthy dividend 
and capitalising on value enhancing consolidation opportunities 
(as we did in Romania).  
The timing and mechanism for this capital return will be kept 
under review to ensure we maximise value creation for our 
shareholders. Updates will be given with our interim and full  
year results. 
Kingfisher regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities 
required to fund its activities. This involves preparing a prudent 
cash flow forecast for the next three years, determining the  
level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning  
for repayments of debt at its maturity and identifying an 
appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve  
against unexpected outflows.  
Kingfisher has a £200 million committed bank facility maturing  
in August 2016, which remained undrawn at the year end. 
The terms of the US Private Placement note agreement and  
the committed bank facility require only that the ratio of Group 
operating profit, excluding exceptional items, to net interest 
payable must be no less than 3:1 for the preceding 12 months  
at half year and full year ends. At the year end the Group’s ratio 
was significantly higher than this requirement. 
The maturity profile of Kingfisher’s debt is illustrated at: 
www.kingfisher.com/debtmaturity 
Kingfisher deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with the 
strongest short-term credit ratings and with money market funds 
which have the strongest, AAA, credit rating and offer same day 
liquidity. A credit limit for each bank or fund is agreed by the 
Board covering the full value of deposits and the fair value of 
derivative contracts. The credit risk is reduced further by 
spreading the investments and derivative contracts across 
several counterparties. At the year end, the Group had a total  
of around £500 million of cash deposited with banks and in 
money market funds. The highest cash deposit with a single 
counterparty was £50 million. 
The Group has entered into interest rate derivative contracts  
to convert the fixed rate payable on its bonds and US Private 
Placement notes to a floating rate of interest. The floating interest 
rates paid by the Group under it s financing arrangements are 
based on LIBOR and EURIBOR plus a margin. The margins 
were not changed during the year.

Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are: 
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and retain financial flexibility in order to continue  
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders; and 
• To maintain a solid investment grade credit rating of BBB. 
The Group manages its capital by: 
• Continued focus on free cash flow generation; 
• Setting the level of capital expenditure and dividend in the 
context of current year and forecast free cash flow generation; 
• Rigorous review of capital investments and post investment 
reviews to drive better returns; and  
• Monitoring the level of the Group’s financial and leasehold 
debt in the context of Group performance and its credit rating. 
Kingfisher Insurance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, is 
subject to minimum capital requirements as a consequence of 
its insurance activities. The Group complied with the externally 
imposed capital requirements during the year.  
Acquisitions 
On 31 May 2013, the Group acq uired 100% of Bricostore 
Romania, a home improvement business operating 15 stores 
including eight freeholds. Kingfisher paid £35 million of cash 
consideration and acquired £7 million of cash with Bricostore 
Romania. In addition, debt of £35 million was acquired with the 
business, which was immediately settled, resulting in a total 
amount invested of £63 million. Goodwill of £18 million has  
been recognised on acquisition. 
The year end results include seven months’ trading of Bricostore 
Romania, in which it contributed sales of £72 million and a retail 
profit of £1 million. Since acqui sition, Romania traded under its 
acquired brand Bricostore. In March 2014, two stores were 
converted into the Brico Dépôt format. 
Property  
The Group owns a significant property portfolio, most of which is 
used for trading purposes. A valu ation was performed for internal 
purposes in November 2013 with the portfolio valued by external 
professional valuers. Based on this exercise, on a sale and 
leaseback basis with Kingfisher in occupancy, the value of 
property is £3.5 billion at year end (2012/13: £3.6 billion).  
This is compared to the net book value of £2.8 billion  
(2012/13: £2.9 billion) recorded in the financial statements.  
Pensions 
At the year end, the Group had a net deficit of £100 million 
(2012/13: £nil) in relation to defined benefit pension 
arrangements of which a £29 million deficit (2012/13: £71 
million surplus) is in relation to the UK Scheme. The adverse 
movement is driven by UK scheme actuarial losses following the 
inclusion of updated membership data from the 2013 triennial 
funding valuation, partially offset by employer contributions  
in the year. 
The approach used to prepare the pension valuation is in line with 
current market practice and inte rnational accounting standards, 
and has been applied consistently. This accounting valuation  
is very sensitive to a number of assumptions and market rates 
which are likely to fluctuate in th e future. To aid understanding  
of the impact that changes to th e assumptions could have on the 
reported UK pension position, we have included sensitivity analysis 
as part of the pension disclosure in note 27 of the Group Financial 
Statements. Further details of key assumptions are also contained 
within the note (see page 111). 
The Group has adopted a revised pensions accounting standard 
in the year. This has resulted in a reclassification of £3 million  
of administrative costs of running the UK scheme from interest  
to retail profit in both the current and prior years. 
In the prior year, and following consultation with the active 
members, the UK final salary pension scheme was closed  
to future benefit accrual and replaced by an enhanced  
defined contribution scheme offered to all UK employees.  
Auto-enrolment of eligible employees into this scheme 
commenced in the year, with around two-thirds of all  
UK employees now participating.

Given the scale of our businesses, the Board of directors recognises that the nature, scope and potential impact of our key bus iness 
and strategic risks are subject to constant change. As such, the Board has implemented the necessary framework to ensure that i t  
has sufficient visibility of the Group’s key risks and the opport unity to regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our mitigating 
controls and strategies. 
During the year the Board has also considered the nature and level of risk that we are prepared to accept in order to deliver o ur 
business strategies and has reviewed and approved our internal statement of risk appetite. This describes both the current and 
desired levels of acceptable risk, supported by high level qualita tive risk statements, ensuring that risks are proactively managed  
to the level desired by the Board. 
The Corporate governance report on page 45 describes the systems and processes thro ugh which the directors manage and mitigate 
risks. The Board considers that the principal risks to achieving its strategic aims are set out below.

Our ‘Easier’ initiatives fail to 
deliver demand and value 
due to a lack of rigorous 
change management 
disciplines, capabilities  
and resources. 
Across our markets we are committed to ensuring that our stores and online 
fulfilment channels are aligned with our de sire to optimise our customers’ retail 
experience. To support this we continue to evolve and innovate across our  
product ranges, formats and customer offer.  
However, changes are only implemented once we have completed an appropriate 
level of planning and testing, relative to the risk. In addition, we ensure for any  
such changes that the assumptions and in sight that support the introduction  
of new products or services will deliver the benefits to both our customers and  
our shareholders.  
Giving our 
customers more 
ways to shop 
Our investment in systems 
and supply chain  
platforms fails to deliver  
the anticipated benefits. 
 
We continue to invest in new system s and technologies to support the  
business including: 
• Warehouse management, forecasting and replenishment technologies to  
ensure we maximise operational agility and optimise the flow of product in order 
to meet customer demand; 
• Optimising distribution and logistics platforms to ensure we can deliver products 
via the most efficient routes to market; 
• The delivery of leading edge web architectures and platforms to provide a 
compelling online offer, including the option s to deliver enhanced ‘click, pay and 
collect’ functionality, across smartphone and tablet-based applications; and 
• We are investing in our financial and operational systems to develop a Group-
wide IT solution across our Operating Companies. 
All investments are evaluated and monitored via the project management 
methodologies in place across the Operating Companies. Post investment reviews 
are performed on all investments over £0.75 million after 12 months to assess the 
benefits achieved (see the Financial Review on page 25 for more information). 
As customers change  
the way they shop we fail to 
adapt our business model 
to these changes. 
Across our businesses we recognise both the threats and opportunities presented 
by omnichannel retailing and are taking th e necessary steps to ensure we remain 
competitive in our respective markets. 
We continue to invest in omnichannel technologies and take learnings from our 
businesses which have well developed models e.g. Screwfix. 
Within B&Q we are developing a platform wh ich will be rolled out to the rest of the 
Group to offer alternative channels for customers. 
Our investment in the IT strategy projec t should provide systems and capabilities  
to respond to the changing ways in which customers shop. 
We are developing plans for each Operat ing Company to address how the business 
model needs to be adapted to cope with changes in consumer behaviour in each 
of our markets.

Building 
innovative 
common brands 
We fail to unlock the 
potential to generate 
further shareholder value 
through the optimisation  
of combined purchasing 
and commercial  
synergies, while retaining 
accountability at our 
Operating Companies. 
The development of common brands and sy nergies remains a priority across the 
organisation. We aim to offer customers a product range which is differentiated 
from that of our competitors through innovation and exclusivity. To increase and 
maximise scale efficiencies we: 
• Are carrying out customer insight research to ensure that we understand 
customer buying behaviours, habits and our product insight across all of our 
businesses. In addition, we are ensuring that we are able to identify specific 
opportunities to drive the optimal, and most profitable, outcomes from our 
common buying decisions; 
• Are implementing common range reviews across our larger Operating 
Companies. Performance of the ranges and brands is tracked and strategies 
updated accordingly; 
• Have four sourcing offices focused on selected ranges; and 
• Are working with our vendors to ensure we achieve the best value for  
our customers. 
 We fail to create enough 
innovation opportunities  
to sufficiently differentiate 
our product offer. 
We view innovation as an area of future growth. We have an innovation team 
that is working with our suppliers to ensure that we develop and deliver innovative 
products to our customers. We recognise that this is an area where we need to do 
further work to maximise the opportunities and we are working with our Operating 
Companies to put plans in place. 
 Expand 
Strategic aim Group risks Mitigation 
Growing our 
presence in 
existing markets 
Our investments in new 
store formats, customer 
markets and customer 
proposition strategies fail  
to stimulate increased 
consumer spend and do 
not deliver the desired  
like-for-like sales growth  
in our mature markets. 
Despite the ongoing challenges of global austerity programmes and their impact 
on consumer confidence, we are committed to re-investing in our mature markets 
to maintain market share and to ensure market leadership. 
We continue to invest in our existing stor e portfolio while seeking to minimise its 
cost base and optimise sales densities. Where there are opportunities to expand 
and innovate we will do so using a combination of ex isting and new formats. We  
will pursue low risk market entry and new flexible store format strategies based  
on the utilisation of current Operating Company skills and resources. We take the 
learnings from trials and ensure these are adopted across the Group in future 
projects. We continue to invest in our omnichannel strategy. 
 Uncertainty surrounding 
the resilience of the global 
economy and volatility in 
the eurozone continues  
to impact both consumer 
confidence and the  
long-term sustainability 
and capabilities of our 
supplier base. 
With continuing market volatility and uncertainty across all of the economies in 
which we operate, particularly within the eurozone, we continue to monitor 
potential exposures and risks and provide effective risk management solutions  
to both our businesses and our strategic suppliers. These include: 
• The provision of supply chain finance prog rammes to support strategic suppliers; 
• Support from a strong portfolio of intern ational banking partners that provide 
flexibility, access to funding and reliable local re tail cash and card payment 
processing services; 
• Diversification of cash holdings across a number of financial institutions with the 
strongest short-term credit rating; and 
• An appropriate and prudent mix of hedg ing policies, cash deposits and debt 
financing to minimise the impact of fo reign exchange currency volatility on  
the Group. 
We have also assessed a number of alternative scenarios in relation to the volatility 
and uncertainty within the eurozone.

Expanding in new 
and developing

Our investments in 
overseas expansion fail  
to deliver sufficient sales 
and profits. 
We continually review and assess opportunities for expansion, in terms of both 
online and bricks and mortar retail, across all of the territories and regions in  
which we operate.  
Country and market entry strategies are based on the application of a proven 
operating model and supported by the Operating Company with the most relevant 
experience, capabilities and capacity to successfully lead a market entry strategy. 
We also ensure that any proposed acquisition or market entry strategy is subject to 
an appropriate level of challenge and due diligence from both the Group Executive 
and specialist Group functions which may include the Tax, Treasury, Legal, Group 
Finance and Group Risk and Internal Audi t functions. This due diligence is also 
supported by external and independent advisers when necessary. 
Following an acquisition, integration plans are prepared and monitored at  
divisional and Group levels. Existing management teams are supplemented  
with Group resources to monitor a nd assist with the integration. 
We monitor the political and economic risks of operating in new and  
developing markets.

We do not make the 
necessary investment in 
our people to ensure that 
we have the appropriate 
calibre of staff, skills  
and experience. 
Across our businesses we are developing our talent, building our leadership 
capability and connecting our people through intelligent networks. Specific 
examples of this include: 
• The continued investment in the development of our senior leaders through the 
Kingfisher One Academy, including the 2020 Leadership Programme and the 
development of networks across our businesses; 
• Focused development activities for our store-based colleagues, including the roll 
out of national apprenticeship schemes across our UK and French businesses, 
and an increased focus on how we s upport and recognise the role of our 
customer advisers across the organisation; and 
• Recognition of the importance of ensuring a constant flow of developing talent 
through structured graduate and management trainee programmes, providing 
sustainable career development paths supported by new and innovative reward 
and bonus frameworks (see www.kingfisher.com/people). 
Sustainability:

• Our commitment to sustainability remains one of Kingfisher’s key values and 
across the organisation we continue to ensure that we engage and take advice 
from our expert partners (WWF, BioRegional and Forum for the Future); 
• As part of our business planning process we set and annually review 
sustainability plans for each Operating Company; 
• Monthly Board reports monitor the progress of our largest Operating Companies 
in achieving their sustainability targets; 
• Data is reported annually to the Gro up and signed off by the local Boards; 
• Within each Operating Company responsibility has been assigned to a team or 
individual for the delivery of the sustainability targets. Meetings of the Corporate 
Social Responsibility teams are held twice a year to exchange best practice and 
progress common projects; 
• Our Net Positive Advisory Council provides an external review of our processes

Our markets 
We currently operate in nine 
countries, spanning nearly 600 
million households. 
Our research shows that spending on home improvement  
is a key priority for householders, making this an attractive  
sector for retailers. It is also attractive because of the relatively 
small number of well-known manufacturer brands. This means 
a specialist home improvement retailer provides a vital role for 
the consumer by offering a wide product choice and expert 
advice. We can offer a high proportion of own brand product, 
achieve economies of scale and have a more defensible position 
against online or generalist operators when compared with  
other retail segments. Read more about our business model  
on pages 6 to 7. 
Our strategy
Our unique contribution as a 
business to our customers is  
that we can harness our home 
improvement experience, our 
heritage as a leader in sustainability 
and our international scale and 
sourcing capability to bring new, 
more sustainable and more 
affordable products to market.  
This means our customers can have better homes, the  
planet’s resources can be protected and we generate value  
for our people, communities and shareholders. 
By also providing our customers with project advice and new 
shopping channels to complement our stores, we will make  
it easier for them to adapt their homes to their evolving needs.  
Our shorthand for describing this purpose is Better Homes, 
Better Lives.  
The next phase of our developm ent towards this vision –  
Creating the Leader – builds on the success of the previous 
phase known as Delivering Value, which has repositioned 
Kingfisher as a stronger business in the attractive home 
improvement market.

 Operational Risks 
Strategic aim Risk Mitigation 
Pricing A lack of perceived  
price competitiveness, 
particularly when 
compared to more 
discount based or online 
competitors, would affect 
our ability to maintain  
or grow market share. 
Significant investment in pricing to reinforce and communicate our value 
credentials. This is supported by: 
• The use of improved customer insight and analytical tools to optimise product 
ranging and pricing strategies; 
• Increased margin flexibility through partnerships with strategic vendors and  
the leveraging of Group buying opportunities; and 
• More targeted use of online and mass media tools to communicate and  
reinforce price perception (for example, price comparison websites, such as 
www.kitchen-compare.com and www.bathroomcompare.com in the UK). 
Key supplier 
resilience  
and continuity 
Key product suppliers lack 
the necessary resilience  
or disaster recovery 
capabilities to manage the 
impact of ongoing global 
economic volatility or the 
increasing impacts of 
extreme weather cycles 
and patterns on their 
operations and extended 
supply chains. 
We continue to support our strategic suppliers through a combination of 
relationship management, and ongoing supplier vulnerability assessments, 
supported by supplier financing programmes where appropriate.  
We also seek to ensure continuity of supply through the expansion of our own 
brand programmes and dual sourcing strategies where possible and commercially 
viable. Ongoing investment in our sourcing offices outside of Asia, notably in 
Poland and Turkey, also provides increased flexibility for our sourcing strategies.  
Health & safety We fail to maintain a  
safe environment for  
our customers and store 
colleagues, which results  
in a major incident or 
fatality that is directly 
attributable to a failure  
in our health and safety 
management systems. 
With 79,000 employees and millions of cust omers visiting our stores each week, 
robust health and safety systems are a prio rity. The Board is committed to creating 
and sustaining a safe environment for bo th our staff and customers and regularly 
reviews and challenges health and safety performance, standards and targets 
across our businesses.  
As regulatory requirements vary from country to country, each Operating Company 
is required to designate a director with sp ecific responsibility for health and safety. 
This person is then responsible for ensuring that a written health and safety policy 
is communicated and that appropriate health and safety arrangements are in  
place to protect our employees and customers and that we comply with local 
regulatory requirements. 
The Group Health and Safety Committee sets the policy and standards for the Group. 
Compliance is monitored across our businesses through a programme of self-
certification and health and safety audits, with issues reported through local Audit 
Committees and escalated to the Group Executive, Group Audit Committee or 
Board where necessary (see the Governance report on page 36). 
Environmental or 
ethical failure 
Kingfisher’s reputation  
and brand are affected  
by a major environmental 
or ethical failure, a 
significant corporate  
fraud or material non-
compliance with legislative 
or regulatory requirements 
resulting in punitive or 
custodial procedures. 
 
Both employees and suppliers working for or with Kingfisher must conduct 
themselves according to our minimum standards of ethics and behaviours as 
defined by our Code of Conduct. Responsi bility for compliance with our Code  
of Conduct rests with each Group Op erating Company Chief Executive and 
appropriate resources are available to our businesses to ensure that both staff  
and suppliers are aware of, and comply wi th, the Code and that our businesses 
can manage the legislative or regulatory challenges presented by their  
respective jurisdictions (see www.kingfisher.com/netpositive/code).

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Co mpany’s Corporate Governance 
report for the year ended 1 February 2014.  
Over a number of years, the Boar d of Kingfisher plc has put in 
place a robust, efficient and effective governance framework and 
associated systems by which the whole Group is governed and 
reviewed. This report aims to provide a clear explanation of those 
arrangements which we consider to be essential for the long-
term success of the Company and the continued promotion 
of the highest standards of Corporate Governance across the 
Kingfisher Group. 
It is the role of the Board to support, advise and where necessary 
provide appropriate challenge to the executive team. I believe 
that the Kingfisher Board, with its vast experience and diversity  
of expertise, assists the Company in delivering its strategy and 
maximising shareholders’ long-term interests, whilst conducting 
itself in line with the Group’s Code of Conduct, which mandates 
minimum standards of behaviour for employees and suppliers of 
the Group. Our Code of Conduct can be found within the Net 
Positive section of our website www.kingfisher.com. 
The Company is required to review its operations annually by 
reference to the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). 
Last year I advised that the Company was confident of reporting 
compliance with the revised September 2012 edition of the Code 
and a statement of compliance with the Code is set out on  
page 36. 
During the year, we have enhanced and formalised elements  
of our governance framework to ensure compliance with the  
Code and also the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (amendment) Regulations 2013 
(‘the Regulations’) which requires us to report in a different way to 
previous years. The most significant reporting changes have 
occurred within the Directors’ Rem uneration Report and are fully 
detailed within that report which can be found on pages 47 to 68.  
An additional change to reporting requires a statement from the 
Company’s directors that we consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, when taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. During the year, the Board requested that the 
Audit Committee advise on the statement and conduct such 
activities to support the directors in reaching that conclusion.  
A fuller description of the activities of the Audit Committee in this 
area can be found on pages 42 to 45, along with other additional 
disclosures required in respect of how the Committee addressed 
the key issues it considered during the year. 
The Board constantly reviews its governance framework, adjusting 
where necessary the roles, structure and accountabilities of its 
mechanisms of governance. During the year, the governance 
structure below the Board and primary committee level was again 
reviewed to ensure the correct and accurate flow of information 
and responsibility. The review in cluded a full review of the terms 
of reference of the Group Executive Committee, the Kingfisher 
Capital Expenditure Committee and the Financial Initiatives,  
Tax and Treasury Committee, an d, where necessary, these  
were amended to reflect the oper ations of those committees and 
the authorities delegated to them. As part of the review, in order  
to make the governance structure below primary committee  
level more relevant and agile, the focus on trading and operational 
matters was transferred to the Group Executive Committee and 
the implementation of strategy is now the focus of the One Team 
Board. In addition, a Health and Safety Committee, with the remit 
to review health and safety matt ers across the Group as a whole 
and better enable the sharing of be st practice, was established.  
A Disclosure Committee was also established to formalise the 
review and verification of the Gro up’s full, half-year and quarterly 
announcements of results.  
The revised Group governance structure, together with an overview 
of each of these Committees, is set out on pages 40 to 46.  
Maintaining and promoting the highest standards of corporate 
governance remains central to my role as Chairman and I believe 
the changes implemented during the year have enhanced the 
framework governing the Group’s operations. I am pleased to 
endorse this Report, which I belie ve demonstrates how, through 
its actions, the Board and its Committees fulfil their governance 
responsibilities and how the Board works proactively to embed 
good governance practices across the Group on an ongoing basis.

Compliance with the UK Corporate  
Governance Code 
Kingfisher is subject to, and has reviewed, its operations and 
governance framework to ensure that it reflects the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, published by the 
Financial Reporting Council (the FRC) and available on their 
website, www.frc.org.uk. The edition of the Code, published in 
September 2012, applied throughout the financial year ended 
1 February 2014. In accordance with the Listing Rules of the 
UK Listing Authority, the Board confirms that, throughout the 
year ended 1 February 2014, and as at the date of this report, 
the Company has complied with the provisions set out in 
Section 1 of the Code, save for as set out below.  
Provision D.1.1 provides that grants under long-term incentive 
schemes should normally be phased rather than awarded in 
one large block. 
As reported in our 2011/12 annual report, the Company set 
stretching long-term targets for management as part of the 
Creating the Leader phase of Kingfisher’s strategy. The 
Remuneration Committee approved awards under the 
Performance Share Plan (the ‘Plan’) of up to 500% of  
base salary.  
The award was higher than th e normal award of 200% but  
in making it the Committee took into account the fact that  
no further awards would be made under the Plan until the 
financial year 2014/15, and felt that it created a better focus 
on a single performance period aligned to the next phase of 
the Group’s strategy, rather than the more commonly used 
overlapping performance periods. 
Leadership 
The role of the Board 
The Board’s primary responsibility is to promote the long-term 
success of the Company and deliver sustainable shareholder 
value. The Board has ultimate re sponsibility for the management, 
direction and performance of the Group, and leads and controls 
the Group’s business. The Board is also responsible for ensuring 
appropriate resources are in place to achieve its strategy and 
deliver sustainable performance. Through authorities delegated 
to its Committees, the Board directs and reviews the Group’s 
operations within an agreed framework of controls, allowing risk 
to be assessed and managed within agreed parameters. The 
Board is collectively accountable to the Company’s shareholders 
for the proper conduct and success of the business. 
The Board’s powers are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, which are available to view on its website, and  
may be amended by a special re solution of its members. The 
Board may exercise all powers conferred on it by the Articles,  
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and other 
applicable legislation. 
The Board has established a formal schedule of matters reserved 
for its approval, and has delegated other specific responsibilities 
to its principal committees: the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees. These are clearly defined within  
the written terms of reference of the respective committees. 
Information on the responsibilities and work of each of the 
Board’s committees is set out on pages 42 to 68. 
During the year, as part of it s annual review process, the  
matters reserved for the Board were reviewed, and where 
necessary amended to reflect best practice. The schedule  
of matters reserved for the Board includes the consideration  
and approval of: 
• the Group’s overall strategy, medium-term plans and  
annual budgets; 
• financial statements and Group dividend policy, including 
recommendation of the final dividend; 
• major acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure;  
• major changes to the capital structure including tax and 
treasury management; 
• major changes to accounting policies or practices; 
• the Group’s corporate governance and compliance 
arrangements; 
• the system of internal control and risk management policy; 
• the Group’s risk appetite statements; and 
• review of management development strategy. 
Composition of the Board 
The Board is made up of the non-executive Chairman, four 
executive directors and six non-executive directors. The  
current balance of the Board’s skills, experience and knowledge, 
together with regular briefings by executives below Board level, 
ensures that views, perceptions and discussions are not 
dominated by any one specific view. The structure, size and 
composition of the Board is continually reviewed to ensure it 
remains suitable for the needs of the business. 
There is an established, formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the selection and appointment of new directors  
to the Board, and this is described in the Nomination Committee 
Report on page 46. At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
12 June 2014, shareholders will be asked, in accordance with 
Principle B.7.1 of the Code, to re-appoint all their directors. 
Role of the non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors provide a strong, independent and 
external insight to the Board and its Committees, and have a 
wealth of experience and business knowledge from other sectors 
and industries. The terms and conditions of appointment of each 
of the non-executive directors are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office and will also be available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting. 
At its meeting in January 2014, the Board considered the 
independence of each of the non-executive directors (other than 
the Chairman, who was deemed independent by the Board at 
the date of his appointment) against the criteria specified in the 
Code, and concluded that each remained fully independent of 
management and free from any relationship that could interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement.

Role of the Senior Independent Director 
Since his appointment in January 2012, Mark Seligman has 
acted as Senior Independent Director (SID), supporting the 
Chairman, and is available for approach or representation from 
significant shareholders who feel they are unable to raise issues 
with the Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance 
Director. In accordance with the FRC guidelines, the role of  
the SID is formally set out in writing, and available on the 
Company’s website.  
Roles of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Group  
Chief Executive are separate and clearly defined. As part of  
the annual review process, the written roles of the Chairman  
and Group Chief Executive were reviewed to ensure they  
remained compliant with, and took account of, best practice 
developments, and were in line with FRC guidance. The written 
roles for both are available to view on the Company’s website.  
In accordance with best practice, the Chairman is responsible for 
the overall operation, leadership and governance of the Board, 
setting the tone and style of Boar d discussions, and creating the 
conditions for overall Board and individual director effectiveness. 
He is also responsible for ensuring that all members of the Board 
develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders, 
that there is an open dialogue with shareholders, and that the 
Chairmen of the Board’s principal committees are available to 
answer shareholder questions at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Group Chief Executive is responsible for executive 
management of the Group’s business, consistent with the 
strategy and commercial objectives agreed by the Board.  
He leads the Group Executive team in effecting decisions  
of the Board and its Committees, and is responsible for the 
maintenance and protection of the reputation of the Company 
and its subsidiaries. The Group Chief Executive is also 
responsible for promoting and conducting the affairs of the 
Group with the highest standards of integrity, probity and 
corporate governance. 
Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Board and its 
committees and, with the consent of the Board, may delegate 
responsibility for the management of the committees to other 
suitably qualified staff. The Company Secretary is responsible  
for ensuring that good quality information flows from executive 
management to the Board and its committees and that correct 
Board procedures are followed. She advises the Board on 
corporate governance matters and facilitates the inductions of 
new directors and assists in providing professional development 
as required. All directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary, and her appointment and removal  
is one of the matters reserved to the Board. The Board also  
has access to the Group General Counsel for legal and 
compliance advice. 
Diversity on the Board 
In September 2011, the Board announced its approach to 
diversity. The statement, which is available on the Company’s 
website, confirmed that the Board is committed to ensuring 
directors of the Company possess and demonstrate a broad 
balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and 
diversity, including gender diversity. In order to maintain the 
appropriate balance of skills, experience and knowledge on the 
Board, the Nomination Committee considers each prospective 
candidate on their individual merits, regardless of gender, age, 
race, nationality, religion or disability, in the belief that balanced 
and diverse Boards are effective. The Board is committed to 
maximising the benefits of a diverse workforce to deliver real 
sustainable benefits for the Group and its shareholders. The 
Board remains committed to this statement. 
Charts demonstrating the gender split at Board level, Senior 
Management level, and for the workforce as a whole can be 
found on page 19. 
Effectiveness 
Board meetings 
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings throughout  
the year and unscheduled supplementary meetings as  
and when necessary. These meetings are structured to allow 
open discussion. At each meeting the Board receives certain 
regular reports which include an update from the Group Chief 
Executive, current trading/finance (including liquidity) reports 
from the Group Finance Director, capital expenditure approvals 
and reports from the Company Secretary (including governance, 
legal, insurance and risk updates), people-related updates  
from the Group Human Resources Director and Net Positive 
progress updates and public affairs updates from the Group 
Sustainability Director. 
All directors participate in discussing strategy, trading and 
financial performance, and risk management of the Group. 
Comprehensive briefing papers are circulated to all directors 
approximately one week before each meeting in digital format. 
Should a director be unable to at tend a particular meeting, they 
are provided with all relevant briefing papers and are given the 
opportunity to discuss any issues with the Chairman or the Group 
Chief Executive and, where possible, participate by telephone  
for critical discussions and approvals on specific matters. 
The Board generally meets at the Group’s head office in London 
but holds at least one meeting each year overseas. During the 
year under review, the Board held a meeting in Marseille, France 
where it reviewed the Brico Dépôt and Castorama brands and 
visited a number of stores in the area. It is the Board’s intention 
to hold one off-site meeting within the UK in the coming year,  
to receive presentations from the UK Executive team, and also 
conduct at least one meeting outside the UK in a country in 
which the Group operates. 
The Chairman and the non-executive directors meet regularly 
without executive directors being present.  
The Chairman maintains regular contact with the SID.

Activities during the year 
During the year, in addition to its regular business, the Board: 
• received a progress update on the Group’s Net  
Positive strategy;  
• reviewed and approved the Group’s renewed IT  
programme and processes; 
• reviewed the Group’s risk profile and reviewed the Group  
risk appetite statement; 
• considered the Group’s capital structure and cash position; 
• considered post-investment reviews of capital expenditure 
projects over three years;  
• reviewed and approved the Group’s Health and Safety  
action plan for 2014; 
• reviewed the Group’s anti-bribery and corruption policies  
and procedures to ensure continued compliance with  
the UK Bribery Act; and  
• received regular strategic presentations from management and 
held ‘deep dive’ discussions with management of the Group’s 
Operating Companies, information technology and Group 
sourcing management.  
Board evaluation 
To ensure that they continue to be effective and each director 
remains committed to their role and has sufficient time to 
manage their commitment to their roles, the Board and its 
committees conduct a review of their performance each year.  
In accordance with provision B.6.2. of the Code, the Board 
commissioned an externally facilitated evaluation during the  
year under review. The evaluation was conducted by Geoffrey 
Shepheard of ICSA Board Evaluation (‘ICSA’). Mr Shepheard and 
ICSA are both completely independent and, other than having 
conducted a similar evaluation in 2010, have no connection with 
the Company. 
The evaluation was carried out in November and December 
2013 and Mr Shepheard conducted one-to-one interviews with 
each member of the Board, the Group Executive Committee and 
the Company Secretary. Each interview lasted approximately two 
hours and covered topics agreed in advance of the process with 
the Chairman and Company Secretary. The topics were as 
follows: 
• Board responsibilities;  
• Oversight; 
• Board meetings; 
• Support for the Board; 
• Board composition; 
• Working together; and  
• Outcome and achievements. 
As part of the interview process, interviewees were also 
encouraged to raise any issues which they considered were 
pertinent to the process, and following each meeting, the 
interviewee was provided with a short synopsis of the facilitator’s 
understanding of the interview and an opportunity for further 
comment was provided.  
A report on the findings of the evaluation process was  
prepared by ICSA and presented to the Board at its meeting  
in January 2014. 
The report concluded that the review had been extensive  
and the Board was assessed as being in the upper quartile  
of FTSE companies on governance. The report was positive 
about the overall performance of the Board and recognised 
continued improvement since the last external review  
conducted in 2010. No significant issues were highlighted  
and the evaluation indicated that the Board continued to  
work efficiently and effectively, that the contribution of each  
director and their interaction with each other was good and  
that the non-executive directors offered robust challenge  
where appropriate.  
As a result of the evaluation, a number of actions were agreed 
and will be implemented in the 2014/15 financial year: 
• review of format and timing of strategy days; 
• review of annual standing agenda schedule for meetings of  
the Nomination Committee; and 
• continuing improvement of the quality of information and 
papers submitted to the Board.  
As part of the evaluation process, the Group Chief Executive 
carried out a performance review of the executive directors.  
The non-executive directors, led by the SID, conducted a 
performance review of the Chairman in respect of the  
financial year. 
The Board has confirmed that the contribution of each of  
the directors continues to be effective and that shareholders 
should be supportive of their re-appointment to the Board. 
The Board will continue to review its procedures, effectiveness 
and development in the year ahead, and the Chairman will use 
the output of the ICSA evaluation in his individual meetings with 
directors during the year.

Induction, information and professional development 
All new directors appointed to the Board receive an induction 
pack as part of their comprehensive induction programme 
tailored to their experience, background and particular areas  
of focus. The induction programme is designed to develop 
directors’ knowledge and understanding of the Group’s 
operations and culture.  
The induction programme includes:  
• individual one-to-one meetings with the Chairman, the  
Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and  
other directors; 
• site visits to the Group’s stores and those of its competitors; 
• meetings with management of the Group’s Operating 
Companies and other senior management; and 
• if required, external training courses at the Group’s expense. 
In accordance with best practice, the Chairman considers and 
addresses the development needs of the Board as a whole, if 
any, and ensures that each di rector updates their individual 
skills, knowledge and expertise. 
During the year, the Company Secretary arranged for the Group’s 
corporate lawyers to provide an update session on the duties and 
responsibilities of directors of a UK listed company. Amongst 
other topics, the training covered Listing Rules compliance and 
the control and release of inside information, and provided case 
studies and practical situations for the directors to consider.  
Detailed updates have also been provided on the new reporting 
requirements contained within this year’s Annual Report and 
Accounts, and, in particular, the new remuneration regulations 
and the fair, balanced and understandable statement directors 
have been required to make. 
Subsequent training in specific aspects of the Group’s 
businesses is provided to directors, when requested, or regularly 
as part of site visits. Directors are briefed on issues at Board and 
Committee meetings and have full and timely access to relevant 
information ahead of each meeting. 
The Board also receives regular reports and feedback from 
discussions with the Company’s institutional shareholders and 
are informed of any issues or concerns raised by them. This 
process allows directors to develop necessary understanding of 
the views of these shareholders and also enables the Board to 
judge whether investors have a sufficient understanding of the 
Group’s objectives. In addition to planned development and 
briefings, each director is expected to take responsibility for 
identifying their own individual needs and to take necessary 
steps to ensure that they are adequately informed about the 
Group and their responsibilities as a director. The Board is 
confident that all its members have the requisite knowledge, 
ability and experience to perform the functions required  
of the directors of a listed company. There is also an agreed 
procedure whereby directors may take independent professional 
advice at the Group’s expense in the furtherance of their duties. 
Conflicts of interest 
Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid 
a situation where he or she may have a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts with the interests of the Company. The Company 
has robust procedures in place to identify, authorise and manage 
such conflicts of interest, and these procedures have operated 
effectively during the year.  
A register of directors’ situational and transactional conflicts is 
maintained by the Company Secretary and reviewed by the 
Board on a regular basis and directors have a continuing duty  
to update the Board with any ch anges to their conflicts of 
interest. Following review, the Board confirmed that there  
were no situations of which they were aware which would, or 
potentially could, give rise to conflicts with the interests of the 
Company, other than those that might arise from directors’  
other appointments, which are set out in the directors’ 
biographies on pages 32 to 33.

Relations with shareholders 
The Company is committed to communicating its strategy  
and activities clearly to its shareholders and, to that end, 
maintains an active dialogue with investors through a planned 
programme of investor relations activities. The investor relations 
programme includes: 
• formal presentations of preliminary and interim results; 
• Q1, Q2 pre-close and Q3 trading statements with conference 
calls at Q2 and Q3; 
• regular meetings between institutional investors and senior 
management to ensure that the investor community receives  
a balanced and complete view of the Group’s performance 
and the issues faced by the Group; 
• hosting investors’ and analysts’ sessions at which senior 
managers from relevant Operating Companies deliver 
presentations which provide an overview of their individual 
businesses; 
• responding to enquiries from shareholders through the 
Company’s investor relations team; 
• regular meetings between institutional investors and  
analysts and the Group Chief Executive and Group  
Finance Director to discuss business performance; and 
• a comprehensive investor relations section on the  
Company’s website.  
The Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the 
chairmen of the Board’s committees are available to meet major 
investors on request. The Senior Independent Director has a 
specific responsibility to be available to shareholders who have 
concerns, and for whom contact with the Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive or Group Finance Director has either failed to resolve 
their concerns, or for whom such contact is inappropriate. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee consulted with 
major shareholders on the comprehensive review of the 
Company’s remuneration arrangements and took on board their 
views when proposing the design and policy changes detailed 
within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 68. 
Annual General Meeting 
The principal means of communication with private investors is 
by electronic communications and through the Annual General 
Meeting, which is attended by all the Company’s directors, and 
allows all shareholders present the opportunity to question the 
Chairman and the directors, as well as the chairmen of the 
Board’s Committees. After the Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders have the opportunity to meet informally with 
directors. A summary business presentation is given at the 
Annual General Meeting before the Chairman deals with the 
formal business of the meeting. At the Annual General Meeting 
in June 2014, the Chairman will use his discretion to call for  
a poll on all resolutions. The results of the poll in relation to  
all resolutions will be disclosed to those in attendance at the 
meeting, published on the Company’s website and announced  
to the London Stock Exchange shortly after the conclusion of  
the Annual General Meeting. 
Committees 
The Board has delegated authority to its principal committees to 
carry out certain tasks as defined in each committee’s respective 
terms of reference. The written terms of reference in respect of 
the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are 
available on the Company’s website. The Board is satisfied that 
the terms of reference for each of these committees satisfy the 
requirements of the Code. The terms of reference of the principal 
committees are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
The minutes of committee meetings are made available to all 
directors on a timely basis. In addition, at each Board meeting, 
the chairmen of the principal committees provide the Board with 
a brief synopsis of the work carried out by their committee, if any, 
between Board meetings.  
In addition to the principal committees, the Board is supported 
by the work of the Group Executive Committee and its 
subcommittees. Together these committees form a fundamental 
element of the Company’s corporate governance framework.  
The Group’s governance structure and a brief explanation of the 
work of the Group Executive Committee and the other 
management committees is set out below:

Audit Committee Report 
Andrew Bonfield 
 
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for 
2013/14.  
During the year under review, the Committee was required  
to carry out its duties in line with the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’). The Committee reviewed its 
operations in relation to the Code and where necessary amended 
its actions and terms of reference to reflect any changes.  
Last year, in anticipation of the changes to the Code, this report 
included enhanced disclosure in a number of areas, including 
the assessment of the effectiveness of the external auditors  
and the external audit process. In this report the Committee  
is required to include a description of those significant issues 
considered by it during the year and, as such, further detail is 
provided later in this report.  
The Board has asked the Committee to oversee the process for 
determining whether the Annual Report and Accounts, when 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and 
further description of this process is also contained later in  
the report. 
The Committee is appointed by the Board from amongst its  
non-executive directors, and its principal duties are to provide 
effective oversight and governance of the internal control and  
risk management processes of the Company, to review the 
financial statements and related accounting policies, review the 
effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions and 
provide updates and recommendations to the Board. 
In addition to the activities outlined above, during the year, the 
Committee continued the analysis of the Company’s risks and 
associated mitigating controls and focused on compliance, 
financial governance and internal audit functions. It maintained 
its good working relationship with the Group Audit and Risk 
Management Director, the Group Finance and Planning Director, 
the Company Secretary and the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte 
LLP. The Committee maintained, reviewed and where necessary 
amended its standing agenda, which is linked to the Group’s 
financial calendars. 
In order to improve the understanding of their operations, during 
the year the Committee received in-depth presentations from 
management of the Group’s Operating Companies, including  
the key strategic risks impacting each business. The Committee 
considered and reviewed the Group’s adequate procedures  
in relation to bribery and corruption, the provision of a 
whistleblowing service and approved accounting judgements  
in relation to the Group’s investment in Hornbach. 
A fuller description of the operations of the Committee is set  
out below. I will be available at the Annual General Meeting to 
answer any questions about the work of the Committee. 
For and on behalf of the Committee

Duties  
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Audit Committee  
is required, amongst other things, to: 
• monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group; 
• review, understand and evaluate the Group’s internal financial 
risk, and other internal controls and their associated systems; 
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
audit function on an annual basis;

Governance  
In accordance with the requirements of provision C.3.1 of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, Andrew Bonfield is designated 
as the Committee member with recent and relevant financial 
experience. All other members of the Audit Committee are 
deemed to have the necessary ability and experience  
to understand financial statements. The attendance by  
members at Committee meetings is set out on page 42.  
All members of the Committee receive appropriate induction,  
in addition to the induction which all new directors receive.  
The induction programme includes an overview of the business, 
its financial dynamics and risks. New Committee members  
also obtain access to the Group’s operations and staff, and  
all members of the Committee undertake ongoing training  
as required. 
The Committee is required, under its terms of reference, to  
meet at least three times a year. During the year, the Committee 
met four times. The Committee has a standing agenda linked to 
events in the Group’s financial calendar for consideration at each 
meeting, and within the annual audit cycle, to ensure that its 
work is in line with the requirements of the Code. At the invitation 
of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board and the Group 
Chief Executive attended all meetings, as did the Group Finance 
Director, Group Audit and Risk Management Director, Group 
Finance and Planning Director and the external auditor. Private 
meetings were also held with the external and internal auditors  
at which management were not present. 
The effectiveness of the Audit Committee was considered as  
part of the external Board evaluation detailed on page 38.  
At its meeting in January 2014, the Committee considered the 
contents of the review and concluded that the evaluation had 
found the Committee to operate effectively and provide robust 
challenge to the business. It was agreed that no specific actions 
were required by the Committee as a result of the review.  
Detailed below is the key work undertaken by the Committee 
during the year under review an d up to the date of this  
Annual Report.  
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year 
Internal controls and risk 
The Committee received and considered reports during the  
year from the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP, and the 
Group’s internal audit function on the work they had undertaken 
in reviewing and auditing the Group, in order to assess the 
quality and effectiveness of the internal control system. 
The Committee considered reports on the output from the 
Group-wide process used to identify, evaluate and mitigate  
risks and reviewed the annual report on the Group’s systems of 
internal control and their effectiveness, and reported the results 
of the review to the Board. Further information on the Group’s 
risk management and internal control procedures can be found 
on page 45. 
As part of the Committee’s continuing programme to increase  
its awareness of the Group’s oper ations and to understand the 
implementation of Operating Company control processes,  
the Committee met with, and received presentations from,  
the senior management of Operating Companies in the UK  
(B&Q and Screwfix), China, Russia, Turkey, Poland and 
Romania. The significant matters the Committee considered  
in the year included: 
• Internal audit perform store audits in each of our Operating 
Companies. As part of this work, control issues relating to 
health and safety processes were identified across the Group. 
The issues have been isolated instances of non-compliance 
with our health and safety procedures. Action plans have  
been put in place to address these issues. An initiative has 
also been launched by the Gr oup Chief Executive to raise 
awareness of the importance of health and safety and how 
non-compliance will not be tolerated. This is supported by  
the Group Health and Safety Committee. The Committee  
was satisfied that the necessary steps were being taken to 
improve the standards of health and safety across the Group. 
• several control issues were raised in B&Q China during the 
year in relation to non-compliance with health and safety 
policies, compliance with new social payment regulations and 
store operational controls. The Committee considered papers 
detailing the steps being taken locally and at Group level to 
improve the situation. Project teams have been established  
to address these issues and these are supported by Group 
resources. The Committee concluded that the issues would be 
rectified by rigorous control of process management and the 
monitoring of the projects by fortnightly governance meetings. 
Progress is reported to the Committee regularly. 
In addition, the Committee continued to monitor the progress  
on the standardisation and improvement of the Group’s internal 
control processes, in a number of key areas. 
The Committee reviewed the operation of the Group 
whistleblowing helpline which allows employees within the  
Group and its suppliers to make disclosures about alleged 
financial and operational improprieties. The ‘SpeakUp’  
service was reviewed along with arrangements to acknowledge, 
investigate and close down reports at the Committee’s meeting  
in January 2014 and, having considered the output from the 
service, and the number, location and type of incidents reported, 
the Committee concluded that the Group continued to maintain 
adequate mechanisms for recording disclosures.  
Financial reporting and significant financial issues  
During the year, the Committee formally reviewed the  
Company’s annual and interim financial statements and 
associated announcements. The reviews considered significant 
accounting principles, policies and practices and their 
appropriateness, financial reporting issues and significant 
judgements made. The Committee also considered whether  
the 2013/14 Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced 
and understandable, having received input and guidance from 
the Disclosure Committee.

In conducting these reviews, the Committee considered the  
work and recommendations of the Group finance function  
and received reports from the Group’s external auditor on their 
findings, including any control observations relevant to their  
audit work. The significant reporting matters the Committee 
considered in the year are detailed below: 
• the Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill to 
determine whether any impairment had been suffered. The 
Committee reviewed the significant financial assumptions 
used, including validity of cash flow projections and the 
selection of appropriate discount and long-term growth rates;  
• the Committee considered the treatment of exceptional items, 
which are presented as exceptional to help provide an 
indication of the Group’s underlying business performance; 
• the Committee reviewed significant judgemental provisions 
and accruals held, including those in respect of tax, legal, 
property and inventory risks; and 
• the Committee considered the judgements made by 
management in concluding that the Group ceased to have  
the ability to exercise significant influence over the Hornbach 
businesses. The Committee was satisfied that this conclusion, 
the balance sheet classification and measurement, and the 
resulting net exceptional loss were appropriate. 
Group Internal Audit 
The Committee considered and reviewed updates from the 
internal audit programme at each of its meetings during the  
year. Reports from the internal audit function to the Committee 
included updates on the Group’s risk management systems, 
findings from reviews, and reviews of the remit, organisation, 
annual plan and resources of the internal audit function. During 
the year, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the internal 
audit function. The review was conducted using an internal 
questionnaire with input from the function’s key stakeholders 
within the Group, in addition to the Committee. No significant 
issues were highlighted by the review. 
External Audit 
During the year, the Committee agreed the approach and  
scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the external auditor, 
Deloitte LLP, and undertook an assessment of their qualification, 
expertise and resources, independence and the effectiveness of 
the external audit process. The Committee also reviewed and 
agreed the terms of engagement, the fees, and areas of 
responsibility and the work to be undertaken by the external 
auditor, and agreed the fees payable in respect of the 2013/14 
audit work. Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor 
for their audit services are given in note 7 to the accounts on  
page 92. In addition, the external auditor provided the 
Committee with a schedule of each matter on which there was 
an initial difference between them and management in relation 
to the accounting treatment, and with the final decisions on 
these issues.  
During the year, the Committee considered the effectiveness  
and independence of the external auditor. In consideration  
of its effectiveness, the Committee reviewed the experience  
and expertise of the audit team, the fulfilment of the agreed  
audit plan and any variations to it, feedback from the Group’s 
businesses and the contents of the external audit report. 
In considering the independence of the external auditor, the 
Committee received a statement of independence from the 
auditor, a report describing their arrangements to identify,  
report and manage any conflicts of interest, and reviewed  
the extent of non-audit services provided to the Group. The 
Committee concluded that it is satisfied with the effectiveness 
and independence of the external auditor. 
In addition to their statutory duties, the services of Deloitte LLP 
are also engaged where, as a result of their position as external 
auditor, they either must, or are best placed to, perform the work 
in question. This is primarily work in relation to matters such as 
shareholder circulars, Group borrowings, tax advice, regulatory 
filings and certain business acquisitions and disposals. Other 
work is awarded on the basis of competitive tendering. 
The Committee reviewed and approved the scope of non-audit 
services provided and proposed by the external auditor to ensure 
that there was no impairment of independence and objectivity, 
and subsequently monitored the non-audit work performed to 
ensure it was within policy guidelines.  
The Group has a policy on the use of its external auditor for  
non-audit work and this is regularly reviewed. The external 
auditor is precluded from engaging in non-audit services that 
would compromise their independence or violate any laws or 
regulations affecting their appointment as external auditor.  
The approval of the Chairman of the Committee is required  
prior to awarding contracts for non-audit services to the external 
auditor, where in excess of specified amounts. The Group’s 
policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit work  
can be found on the Group’s website. 
During the year, Deloitte LLP charged the Group £1.8m 
(2012/13: £1.6m) for audit and audit-related services and a 
further £0.4m (2012/13: £0.4m) for non-audit services.  
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the 
Board with regard to the reappointment of the external auditor.  
In doing so, the Committee takes into account auditor 
independence and audit partner rotation. Deloitte LLP were 
appointed as external auditor in 2009/10 following a formal 
tender process. Panos Kakoullis was appointed lead audit 
partner at that time and will step down following the conclusion 
of the 2013/14 audit process, when he will be replaced by 
Richard Muschamp. Richard will serve as lead audit partner  
until the external audit contract is put out to tender, which will  
be in 2019 at the latest. During the year under review, Deloitte 
also replaced the lead audit partner for B&Q UK. The Committee 
noted provision C.3.7 of the Code in relation to audit tendering 
and has taken into account the UK Competition Commission’s 
recent decision to introduce mandatory audit tendering at  
ten-year intervals, in making the decision to tender the external  
audit contract by 2019 at the latest.

The Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte  
LLP be proposed for re-appointment by shareholders as the 
Company’s external auditor at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. As a result of its work during the year, the Committee 
has concluded that it acted in accordance with its terms of 
reference and has ensured the independence and objectivity  
of the external auditor. 
Accountability, Risk Management and Internal Control 
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control, which is designed to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and ensure the reliability of the financial information for 
both internal use and external publication, and to comply with 
the Turnbull guidance and the Code.  
The Board confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of  
the internal control system, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management in accordance with 
the Code, for the period from 2 February 2013 to the date of 
approval of this Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14. 
If significant losses were to be incurred during the year as a 
result of a failure of controls, a detailed report would be provided 
to the Audit Committee and the Board. The Board confirms that 
no significant weaknesses were identified in relation to the review 
carried out during the year and therefore, no remedial action  
was required. 
The Board has approved a set of policies, procedures and 
frameworks for effective internal control. The Group has 
procedures for the delegation of authorities for significant 
matters, to ensure approval is sought at the appropriate level. 
These procedures are subject to regular review and provide an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group. Such a system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring the 
system and the maintenance of effective control is delegated to 
the management of each of the Group’s Operating Companies. 
The Group’s risk management and reporting process helps 
Group management to identify, assess, prioritise and mitigate 
risk. Management at each Operating Company has responsibility 
for the identification and evaluation of the significant risks 
applicable to their business and any mitigating actions to be 
taken. The Group Executive Committee reviews, identifies and 
evaluates the risks that are significant at a Group level, as well  
as the mitigating actions against those risks. These are then 
considered by the Board. The types of risks identified included 
both strategic and material operational risks and are detailed on 
pages 28 to 31 of the report. 
Management is required to apply judgement in evaluating the 
risks facing the Group in achieving its objectives, in determining 
the risks that are considered acceptable to bear, in assessing the 
likelihood of those risks materialising, in identifying the Group’s 
ability to reduce the incidence an d impact on the business of 
risks that do materialise, and in ensuring the costs of operating 
particular controls are proportionate to the benefit provided. 
Monitoring 
There are clear processes for controlling and monitoring the 
system of internal control and reporting any significant control 
failings or weaknesses together with details of corrective action. 
These include: 
• an annual planning process and regular financial reporting, 
comparing results with plan and the previous year on a 
monthly and cumulative basis; 
• written reports from the Group Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director submitted at each Board meeting; 
• Operating Company management report formally to the  
Audit Committee on a regular basis on the control environment 
in their business and actions taken to maintain or improve  
the environment as appropriate; and 
• reports and presentations to the Board on certain areas  
of specialist risk. These include treasury, insurance, tax  
and pensions. 
A formal bi-annual certification is provided by the CEO and 
Finance Director of each Operating Company stating that 
appropriate internal controls were in operation and confirming 
compliance with Group policies and procedures. Any 
weaknesses are highlighted and the results are reviewed by 
Operating Company management, the Group Audit and Risk 
Management Director, the Group Finance and Planning Director, 
the Audit Committee and the Board. The internal audit function 
monitors and selectively checks the results of this exercise, 
ensuring that representations made are consistent with the 
results of its work during the year. 
The internal audit function follows a planned programme of 
reviews that are aligned to the Group’s risks. The function: 
• works with the Operating Companies to develop, improve  
and embed risk management tools and processes into their 
business operations; 
• reports directly to the Audit Committee and has the authority  
to review any relevant part of the Group; 
• oversees the operation of the individual Operating Companies’ 
audit committees; and 
• provides the Audit Committee and the Board with objective 
assurance on the control environment across the Group.  
Risk appetite 
During the year, the Board also considered the nature and level 
of risk that it was prepared to accept in order to deliver business 
strategies, and has reviewed and approved the Group’s internal 
statement of risk appetite. This describes both the current  
and desired levels of acceptable risk, supported by high level

Directors did not attend those parts of the meeting where their own reappointment 
was considered. 
Duties 
The primary objective of the Nomination Committee is to review 
the composition of the Board and plan for its refreshment as 
applicable with regard to composition, balance and structure. 
The Committee is also asked to lead, on behalf of the Board,  
the selection process for new Board appointments and to  
make recommendations in respect of such appointments  
while maintaining an appropriate balance of diversity and  
skills. In accordance with its terms of reference, the Nomination 
Committee is required to: 
• review the structure, size and composition of the Board  
and make recommendations to the Board, as appropriate; 
• identify the balance of skills, knowledge, diversity  
and experience on the Board and nominate candidates  
to fill Board vacancies; 
• review the time commitment required from the  
non-executive directors; 
• consider succession planning, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Group and the  
future skills and expertise needed on the Board; and 
• review the leadership needs of the organisation, both  
executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring the 
continued ability of the organisation to compete effectively  
in the marketplace. 
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed during  
the year and were amended in line with best practice and are 
available on the Company’s website (www.kingfisher.com). 
Activities during the year 
During the year, the Committee considered the reappointment  
of Clare Chapman and Pascal Cagni, following the expiry of  
their initial three-year terms of appointment as directors. The 
Committee concluded that both directors continued to provide 
the necessary balance of skills and experience to the Board, 
including considerable Human Resources and Remuneration 
experience, and in-depth IT and ecommerce knowledge. The 
Committee therefore recommended to the Board that each be 
reappointed as a director of the Company for an additional  
three-year term.  
At its meeting in October 2013, the Committee considered  
a talent and succession review presented by the Group HR 
Director, which outlined succession planning and talent pipeline 
considerations across the entire Kingfisher Group in support  
of the Group’s Creating the Leader strategy. 
Following the reappointment of Ms Chapman and Mr Cagni,  
and a review of the Board and its Committees, the Committee 
firmly believes that the current composition represents a strong, 
well balanced and diverse Board. The Board membership 
is made up of specialists in retail, technology, finance and 
human resources, and possesses considerable knowledge, 
experience and skills to meet the current and future 
requirements of the Group. The Chairman will be available  
at the Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about 
the work of the Committee.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
 www.kingfisher.com

Annual Statement from the Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the 201 3/14 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on behalf of the Board. 
As required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations  
2013, the rest of this remuneration report is split into two sections: 
• The directors’ remuneration policy which sets out the 
Company’s proposed policy on directors’ remuneration for  
the three years from the 2014 Annual General Meeting (the 
‘Remuneration Policy’). The Remuneration Policy will be 
subject to a binding shareholder vote at this year’s AGM  
and thereafter at least every three years. 
• The annual report on remuneration sets out the payments 
made to directors and details the link between Group 
performance and remuneration for the 2013/14 financial  
year (the ‘Annual Remuneration Report’). The Annual 
Remuneration Report together with this letter will be  
subject to an advisory shareholder vote at this year’s AGM. 
Changes to the layout of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
are intended to improve transparency and demonstrate how the 
remuneration arrangements are aligned with the Group’s strategy. 
Outcome 2013/14 
2013/14 proved to be another cha llenging year for retailers but 
although the economic environment was difficult, Kingfisher 
made solid progress, with profit increased and like-for-like sales 
growth delivered. Further information regarding the Group’s 
performance during the year can be found in the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 31. This re sults in bonus payments being 
awarded for performance between threshold and on-target 
levels. As a result, bonuses in respect of performance were 
between 24% and 36% of maximu m which were similar to the 
previous year. 
The 2011 Performance Share Plan vesting percentage is 
determined by the 2013/14 EPS result and the 2011/12 to 
2013/14 cumulative KEP result. EPS was below the required 
threshold but KEP was within the target range, resulting in an 
overall award of 31% of maximum. The awards will vest in  
two equal tranches in June 2014 and June 2015. 
2013/14 Remuneration Review 
During the year, the Committee conducted a thorough and 
comprehensive review of the Group’s executive remuneration 
arrangements. The focus of this review was to ensure that the 
overall executive remuneration structure supports the Creating 
the Leader strategy and is aligned to long-term shareholder  
value creation. The review also considered the structure of a  
new long-term incentive plan to replace the Kingfisher Incentive 
Share Scheme and the Performance Share Plan. The rules of 
the new plan will be submitted to shareholders for approval at 
the AGM in 2014.  
Our major shareholders were consulted as part of this review  
to ensure that we took on board their views on the proposed 
changes to our remuneration structure. 
Following this thorough review, the Committee is satisfied  
that the Group’s executive remuneration arrangements create  
a strong link between competitive pay and performance. The 
Committee agreed to propose a number of changes to the 
Group’s executive remuneration policy to strengthen alignment 
with long-term sustainable performance by increasing deferral, 
extending malus provisions and raising shareholding 
requirements. The specific changes are:  
• Annual bonus deferral for executive directors to be increased 
to 50% (from 33%); 
• Reverting to annual grants under the proposed new  
long-term incentive plan, at the level of 200% of salary, with 
the flexibility in future to award up to 250% for the Group 
Chief Executive, subject to stretching performance targets; 
• Increased shareholding requirements – to 300% of salary  
for the Group Chief Executive and 200% of salary for other 
executive directors; and 
• Extension of malus provisions to include instances of 
reputational damage linked to executive actions. 
The full proposed Remuneration Polic y is set out on pages 49 to 58. 
At our 2013 AGM, 98% of sharehol ders voted in favour of our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. I very much hope you will 
support the Remuneration Policy and 2013/14 Annual 
Remuneration Report at our forthcoming meeting. I will be 
available at the AGM in June to answer any questions about  
the work of the Committee.

conducted a comprehensive review of 
executive remuneration arrangements 
to ensure they are aligned to long-term 
shareholder value creation.”

The key principles of our  
Remuneration Policy are to: 
• provide executive directors with a 
remuneration package that recognises 
the experience of the individual 
concerned and the value created; 
• ensure performance-related 
remuneration constitutes a  
substantial proportion of the 
remuneration package; 
• ensure executive directors’ interests  
are aligned with shareholders’ by 
delivering rewards in shares, and 
requiring a significant personal holding 
in Kingfisher shares in accordance  
with the Group’s ownership policy; 
• be competitive in the talent markets  
in which the Group operates; 
• be fair, transparent and straightforward 
to understand; and 
• ensure remuneration principles apply 
consistently throughout the Group,  
and where practical are translated  
into local practice at the appropriate 
organisational level.

Remuneration Policy 
The Remuneration Policy set out in this section is intended to 
apply for three years from the da te of the 2014 AGM, subject to 
shareholder approval. Where the forward-looking policy differs 
from the policy that was in operation in 2013/14, we have 
provided explanations of these differences. The Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) will review the Remuneration Policy 
on an annual basis to ensure th at it remains aligned to the 
Creating the Leader strategy and is appropriately positioned 
relative to the market. There is no current intention to revise the 
policy more frequently than every three years. Where a material 
change to policy is considered, the Group will consult with its 
major shareholders prior to submitting the revised policy to all 
shareholders for approval. 
The Remuneration Policy will be displayed on the Group’s  
website www.kingfisher.com immediately after the 2014 AGM. 
The Remuneration Policy is designed to attract, retain and 
motivate executives of the highest quality, incentivising them  
to deliver exceptional business performance aligned with the 
interests of shareholders, and to deliver the Group’s Creating the 
Leader strategy. The Remuneration Policy continues to ensure 
that a significant element of executive directors’ remuneration 
remains ‘at risk’.  
The key principles of the Remuneration Policy are to: 
• provide executive directors with a remuneration package  
that recognises the experience of the individual concerned 
and the value created; 
• ensure that performance-related remuneration constitutes  
a substantial proportion of the remuneration package; 
• ensure that executive directors’ interests are aligned with 
shareholders by delivering rewards in shares and requiring  
a significant personal holding in Kingfisher shares in 
accordance with the Group’s share ownership policy;  
• be competitive in the talent markets in which the  
Group operates; 
• be fair, transparent and straightforward to understand; and  
• ensure remuneration principles apply consistently throughout 
the Group, and where practical are translated into local 
practice at the appropriate organisational level.  
The Committee is satisfied that this Remuneration Policy strikes 
an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable elements 
of remuneration, and between promoting short and long-term 
business objectives. 
 
 
Future Remuneration Policy  
Element and purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Assessment of performance 
Base salary    
Base salary reflects the 
individual’s role, experience 
and contribution to the  
Group and is set at levels  
that support the recruitment 
and retention of executive 
directors of the calibre 
required by the Group. 
Base salaries are set with reference to two primary 
comparator groups; i) FTSE 25-75 excluding 
financial services organisations, and ii) FTSE100 
retailers and privately held retailers which are 
considered to be of a similar size and market 
capitalisation to the Group. The Committee also 
takes account of pay levels in other large European 
retailers. Alternative peer groups may need to be 
referenced depending on the domicile of 
individual executive directors outside the UK.  
The Committee does not apply a strict 
mathematical approach to the market data,  
which it considers to be only one relevant input. 
Instead, the Committee has regard to its overall 
assessment of appropriate levels of salary, within 
the benchmark range taking into account the 
market, economic conditions, affordability, the 
level of increases awarded to employees generally 
and the individual’s performance, contribution  
and experience. 
Salaries are reviewed, but not necessarily 
adjusted, annually. Out of cycle reviews may  
be conducted in exceptional circumstances if 
determined appropriate by the Committee.  
Base salaries are paid monthly in cash. 
Whilst there is no prescribed or 
formulaic maximum, the annual 
increase will normally not exceed 
the level awarded to the general 
workforce. Higher increases may 
be made where there have  
been significant changes in the 
responsibility and accountability  
in a role, or where there are large 
variances to the market, for 
example in the case of a recently 
appointed executive director 
appointed on a salary below the 
market median. Any significant 
increases will be fully explained. 
 
Individual performance is an 
important factor considered by the 
Committee when reviewing base 
salary each year.

Benefits    
Benefits are provided to 
assist executive directors  
in the performance of their 
roles and are designed  
to be competitive and  
cost effective. 
 
The Group may provide pension contributions  
(set out below), a company car or cash alternative, 
allowance for financial planning, medical 
insurance, and life assurance cover. Other benefits 
may be provided from time to time if considered 
reasonable and appropriate by the Committee,  
to include items such as relocation allowances, 
and will be explained in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report. 
The Group pays the cost of providing benefits on  
a monthly basis or as requ ired for one-off events 
such as financial planning advice. 
Store discount may be offered to all directors  
on the same basis as offered to other  
Group employees. 
Maximum levels of benefit  
provision are: 
• Car allowance £25,000 per annum 
• Private medical insurance  
on a family basis 
• Life assurance cover of 4x  
base salary 
• Financial planning at  
£2,500 per annum 
There are a number of variables  
and unknowns impacting the 
maximum payable in the event of 
relocation; however, the Committee 
would pay no more than is necessary 
in such situations. 
Store discount of up to 20%  
is offered. 
By exception, death in service cover 
for Kevin O’Byrne is provided at 7x 
base salary. The additional 3x cover is 
funded by him through an equivalent 
0.25% reduction in his pension  
cash allowance. 
None 
 
All-employee share plans    
To enable investment in 
shares in Kingfisher on the 
same terms as other UK-
based employees. 
UK-based executive directors may participate in  
a tax approved all-employee scheme (Sharesave) 
under which they make monthly savings over a 
period of three or five years, that may be used to 
buy Kingfisher shares at a discounted price when 
the scheme matures. They may also choose to 
withdraw their savings at the end of the savings 
period or at any time during the savings contract. 
UK-based executive directors may also participate 
in the Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Designed to 
promote employee share ownership, the SIP 
enables participants to make monthly investments 
in Kingfisher shares. 
The maximum monthly limit for  
the Sharesave plan is currently  
£250 per month. 
The maximum monthly amount an 
individual may invest in partnership 
shares is currently £125 per month. 
The SIP also allows the award of free 
and matching shares up to the limits 
set by the Government.  
The Group may increase the amounts 
that can be saved or invested under 
the Sharesave and SIP plans in line 
with any increases authorised by the 
UK Government for approved plans. 
None 
Pension    
To provide retirement 
benefits and support 
retirement planning in a  
tax efficient way through  
a competitive scheme. 
Pension provision for executive directors (with  
the exception of Philippe Tible) is by way of 
contributions to a defined contribution scheme.  
A cash allowance is available to those who choose 
not to participate in the defined contribution 
scheme as a result of having applied for protection 
upon exceeding or getting close to Lifetime 
Allowance limits. For executive directors who 
choose to remain in the scheme, to avoid total 
member and employer contributions exceeding 
the Annual Allowance (£40,000 for the tax year 
2014/15), employer contributions can be paid as a 
taxable cash allowance on a cost neutral basis to 
the Company.  
A French non-contributory defined benefit 
arrangement is in operation for Philippe Tible  
as divisional CEO of Castorama and Brico Dépôt. 
For the defined contribution scheme 
or cash allowance, the maximum 
annual pension contribution is 30% 
of base salary for the Group Chief 
Executive and 20% of base salary for 
other UK-based executive directors. 
For the defined benefit arrangement 
in which the divisional CEO of 
Castorama and Brico Dépôt, Philippe 
Tible participates, the pension 
notionally accrues at a value of 1.5% 
of final pensionable pay for each year 
of service, with crystallisation of the 
pension being conditional upon him 
retiring from the Company.

Annual bonus    
To incentivise executive 
directors to achieve or 
exceed annual financial, 
strategic and personal 
objectives set by the 
Committee at the start of 
each financial year. The 
deferred element of the 
annual bonus is intended 
to support longer-term 
shareholder alignment  
and retention. 
  
Annual bonuses are paid after the end of the 
financial year to which they relate. 
50% of the annual bonus is paid in cash shortly 
after the financial year end. The remaining 50%  
of the annual bonus is deferred for three years in 
Kingfisher shares. Vesting of these shares is not 
subject to performance conditions and no match 
is applied. Shares delivered on the exercise of an 
award attract additional dividend shares calculated 
on the basis of the re-inv estment back into shares 
of the dividend that wo uld have been received  
had the shares been beneficially held. 
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the 
bonus outcome if the pure application of a formula 
is not felt to produce an appropriate result in light 
of overall underlying performance. In particular the 
Committee has the discretion to adjust payments 
downwards if profits have fallen. Any adjustment 
made using this discretion will be explained. 
Malus may be applied whereby part or all of an 
unvested deferred bonus award may be reduced 
(including, if appropriate, reduction to zero) in the 
event of financial misstatement, serious 
reputational damage, or material misconduct in 
individual cases. 
Deferred bonus awards will ve st in full in the event 
of a change of control of the Company. 
The on-target and maximum 
annual bonus payable are  
100% and 200% of base  
salary respectively. 
The level of payment at threshold 
is set on an annual basis but will 
not exceed 25%.  
The specific measures, targets and 
weighting may vary from year to year in 
order to align with the Group’s strategy, 
but always with a substantial proportion 
based on key financial metrics. For the 
2014/15 financial year, 60% of the 
annual bonus is linked to key financial 
metrics, 20% is related to KPIs for which 
there is a particular focus during the year 
in question; examples would include 
Group sourcing and productivity. 20%  
is for personal performance based on 
achievement of personal objectives and 
contribution to the One Team strategy, 
including behaviours. 
Where executive directors have specific 
management accountability for the 
results of one or more Operating 
Companies they may, in addition to, or 
as a substitute for Group targets, also 
have targets related to the performance 
of those businesses. 
The actual performance targets set are 
not disclosed at the start of the financial 
year, as they are considered to be 
commercially sensitive.  
Long-term incentive plan    
To incentivise executive 
directors to achieve 
superior returns for 
shareholders and drive 
shareholder alignment and 
retention of executives over 
the performance period  
of the awards. 
Performance conditions 
are aligned with 
shareholder interests  
and the Group’s  
strategic objectives. 
 
Awards will be granted annually under the 
Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan, subject to  
a three-year vesting period and stretching 
performance conditions. 
Shares delivered on the exercise of an award 
attract additional dividend shares calculated on 
the basis of the re-investment back into shares of 
the dividend that would have been received had 
the shares been beneficially held. 
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the 
LTIP outcome if the pure application of a formula 
is not felt to produce an appropriate result in  
light of overall underlying performance. 
Malus may be applied whereby part or all of an 
unvested long-term incentive award may be 
reduced (including, if appropriate, reduction  
to zero) in the event of financial misstatement, 
serious reputational damage, or material 
misconduct in individual cases.  
In the event of a change of control of the 
Company, awards will vest subject to assessment 
of performance up to the date of change of control 
and will be reduced on a time pro-rated basis 
unless the Committee considers that such a 
reduction is inappropriate. 
The maximum annual award is 
200% for executive directors, with 
the flexibility to award up to 250% 
for the Group Chief Executive. The 
Group Chief Executive’s award in 
2014/5 will be 200%. 
25% of the award vests for 
threshold performance. 
Awards vest based on performance  
over three years against performance 
measures chosen by the Committee  
to align with business and strategic 
priorities. For the 2014/5 financial year 
the measures for executive directors are:  
50% EPS 
50% Kingfisher Economic Profit (KEP) 
The Committee may adjust the 
performance measures attaching to 
awards and the weighting of these 
measures if it feels this will create  
greater alignment with business and 
strategic priorities. 
A significant change to the measures 
used would only be adopted following 
consultation with major shareholders.

Profit sharing arrangements   
Participation Scheme 
To enable French  
employees to share in the 
financial success of the 
French businesses 
Philippe Tible participates in this scheme as an 
employee of a French company on the same 
terms as all French employees. 
The Participation scheme is a mandatory scheme 
based on a legal requirement for a proportion of 
the Castorama and Brico Dépôt France profits  
to be distributed to employees. It is paid in cash 
shortly after the financial year end, although the 
scheme provides the option to defer the payment 
for a period of five years to receive certain  
taxation exemptions. 
Under the Participation Scheme 
the maximum opportunity is set by 
the French government. There are 
two limits set which are based on a 
multiple of the Annual Social 
Security ceiling (PASS). This is 
updated each year but for 2014 
stands at €37,548. 
These limits are: 
The maximum salary that the 
award level as a % of salary is 
applied to is 4x PASS (€150,192) 
The maximum possible payment is 
0.75x PASS (€28,161) 
The award level is determined  
as a proportion of profits as set with 
reference to the minimum required 
by the French government and a 
more favourable formula that  
has been agreed with the French 
Works Council. 
Over the last five years the award  
level as a % of salary (up to the salary 
cap) has remained within the 5% – 
7% range. On Philippe Tible’s actual 
salary the award levels have been less 
than 2% of salary. 
Interessement Scheme 
To enable French employees 
to share in the financial 
success of growth in the 
French businesses 
Philippe Tible participates in this scheme as an 
employee of a French company on the same 
terms as all French employees. 
This scheme creates a profit pool which is divided 
by the cost of wages and salaries to determine  
an award level as a % of salary. 
Payments are made in cas h on a quarterly basis 
although the scheme provides the option to defer 
the payment for a period of five years to receive 
certain taxation exceptions. 
Since the design is in the form of  
a profit pool, there is no set cap as 
such. However, the award level for 
Philippe Tible has not exceeded 
20% of salary historically. 
The profit pool is based on a formula 
which is linked to a proportion of  
the sales and profit growth. 
 
Shareholding requirements    
To ensure alignment of 
interests of executive 
directors and shareholders 
over the long-term. 
Executive directors are required to build a 
significant shareholding in the Company before 
the fifth anniversary of the date of their first award 
under a qualifying share plan. Consideration will 
be given to extending the five-year time frame in 
the event that share awards vesting from deferred 
bonus shares or the LTIP alone do not provide 
enough shares to meet the shareholding 
requirement. Unvested deferred bonus awards are 
not included in the assessment of the holding 
requirement until the transfer of beneficial 
ownership to the executive director at the end of 
the three-year deferral period. Nil-cost options 
which have vested but the executive has yet  
to exercise are considered to count towards  
the shareholding. 
Group Chief Executive: 
shareholding of 300% of  
base salary. 
Other executive directors: 
shareholding of 200% of  
base salary.

Legacy Awards    
Performance Share  
Plan (‘PSP’) 
A one-off exceptional award of 500% of base 
salary was granted under the PSP in 2011.  
This award was granted to create focus on a 
single three-year period of the Creating the  
Leader strategy. The awards vest in two equal 
tranches in June 2014 and June 2015. 
On exercise, additional dividend shares are  
added to the award, with a value equivalent to  
the value of dividends reinvested into shares from 
the date of grant to the date of transfer. 
Malus may be applied to unvested awards, if the 
Committee determines that the grant of awards 
was not justified.  
Certain awards granted prior to 2011 have vested 
but have not been exercised and therefore  
remain outstanding. 
500% of base salary for all 
executive directors.  
Awards are subject to stretching 
performance targets, 50% based  
on EPS and 50% on KEP. 
Following completion of the financial 
year, the vesting percentage has 
been determined by the Committee 
at 31% of the maximum award level, 
subject to continued employment.

Kingfisher Incentive  
Share Scheme (‘KISS’) 
Under the KISS, executive directors defer 33% of their 
Annual Bonus into Kingfisher shares. Awards are deferred 
for three years and are subject to forfeiture should the 
executive leave the Group before the vesting date. Malus 
may be applied to unvested awards, if the Committee

Company Share Option  
Plan (‘CSOP’) 
An HMRC approved share opti on plan was used to grant 
awards with a value up to a limit of £30,000. The option 
price was determined at the time of grant by reference to 
the market price immediately before the date of grant. 
The options are linked to an underpinning KISS Award

To attract and retain a 
Chairman and non-executive 
directors of the calibre 
required by the Group. 
The fees paid to the Chai rman are determined by  
the Committee, while the fees of the non-executive 
directors are determined by the Board with affected 
persons absenting themselves from the discussions  
as appropriate. 
The Committee reviews the Chairman’s fees annually.  
The Chairman’s fees are determined with reference to 
time commitment and relevant benchmark market data. 
Contributions may be made towards the cost of running 
the Chairman’s office. 
The Board determines non-executive directors’ fees under 
a policy which seeks to recognise the time commitment, 
responsibility and technical skills required to make a 
valuable contribution to an effective Board. 
A base fee is paid to all non-executive directors  
and additional fees are al so paid to the Senior 
Independent Director and the Chairmen of the Audit  
and Remuneration Committees.  
The Board annually reviews f ees paid to non-executive 
directors against those in similar companies and taking 
into account the time commitment expected of them. 
Fees are paid monthly. 
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not 
participate in any of the Company’s performance-related

discount of up to 20%. 
Aggregate annual fees paid to  
the Chairman and non-executive 
directors are limited by the 
Company’s Articles of Association, 
which may be varied by special 
resolution of the shareholders. The 
current limit contained within the 
Articles of Association is £1 million

Element and purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Assessment of performance 
Approach to recruitment 
remuneration  
When hiring a new executive di rector, or making internal 
promotions to the Board, the Committee will in principle 
apply the same policy as for ex isting executive directors, 
as detailed in the Remuneration Policy. The rationale for 
the package offered will be explained in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report.  
Base salary would be set at an appropriate level to recruit 
the best candidate based on their skills, experience and 
current remuneration. 
Benefits would be in line with normal policy and may 
include, where appropriate, relocation benefits or other 
benefits reflective of normal market practice in the  
territory in which the executive director is employed. 
Normal incentive awards would be made under the 
annual bonus plan and long-term incentive plan in  
line with the Remuneration Policy. 
For internal promotions any commitments made prior  
to appointment may continue to be honoured as the 
executive is transitioned to the new remuneration 
arrangements.  
The Committee would be mindful of best practice 
guidelines in considering whether any enhanced LTIP or 
other award was necessary on recruitment in order to 
secure the preferred candidate (e.g. to buy out awards 
forgone from the incoming execu tive’s previous employer). 
The Committee’s policy is to seek to avoid buying out 
awards forgone. Normally the Committee would seek only 
to make performance-related awards under the long-term 
incentive plan, for example by pro-rating them into 
recently awarded plan cycles to ensure alignment with 
existing executive directors. However, each case will  
need to be considered on it s own facts at the particular 
time such awards are made. If a buy-out award would  
be required, the Committee would aim to reflect the 
nature, timing and value of an award forgone in any  
replacement award which may be in the form of a 
restricted stock or performance-related award as 
appropriate. The Committee would aim to minimise  
the cost to the Company. 
Normal Awards 
The normal maximum incentive 
opportunity on recruitment will be 
in line with the Remuneration 
Policy for executive directors. 
Additional LTIP Award 
Under the plan rules, the 
Committee may, on the 
recruitment of an executive 
director, make an additional one-
off performance linked award 
under the long-term incentive plan 
of up to an equal face value to the 
normal policy award (i.e. up to 
250% of base salary for the Group 
Chief Executive and 200% of base 
salary for the other executive 
directors). This provision is 
normally used to pro-rate incoming 
executives into recently awarded 
long-term incentive plan cycles. 
Buy-out Award 
The Committee normally seeks to 
avoid explicitly buying out awards 
forgone at a previous employer, 
preferring instead to make long-
term incentive plan awards as set 
out above. 
Where, in exceptional 
circumstances, buy-out awards are 
made, they are not subject to a 
formal maximum, although would 
be designed to reflect only  
the value forgone or less. In 
establishing the appropriate value 
of any buy-out the Committee 
would also take into account the 
value of any additional long-term 
incentive plan award made  
on joining.  
None 
The Committee will operate the Kingfisher In centive Share Plan (which will be subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in  
June 2014) and the Group’s legacy plans (t he Performance Share Plan, Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme and Company Share 
Option Plan) (together the ‘Plans’) in accordance with the rules of those Plans and where relevant with the UKLA Listing Rules. 
In addition to the discretions set out as part of this Remunera tion Policy, the rules provide the Committee with discretion in certain 
matters regarding the administration and operation of these Plans, including, but not limited to the following: 
• the impact of a change of control or restructuring; 
• any adjustments to performance conditions or awards required as a result of a corporate event (such as a transaction, corporate 
restructuring event, special dividend or rights issue); 
• the operation of malus provisions; and 
• minor administrative matters to improve the efficiency of operatio n of the plans or to comply with local tax law or regulation. 
The Committee retains certain discretions in relation to th e Annual Bonus Plan, which include but are not limited to: 
• the determination of and timing of any bonus payment; 
• the impact of a change of control or restructuring; 
• any adjustments required as a result of a corporate event (such as a transaction, corporate restructuring event, special divide nd 
or rights issue) 
In relation to the Plans and the Annual Bonus Plan, the Committe e retains the ability to amend the performance conditions and/or 
measures in respect of any award or payment if one or more even t(s) have occurred which would lead the Committee to consider  
that it would be appropriate to do so, provided that such an amendment would not be materi ally less difficult to meet.

If the Committee used any of the discre tions set out above these would, where re levant, be disclosed in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report and the views of major shareholders may also be sought. 
Discretion in relation to the Group’s All-Employee Share Plans (Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan) would be exercised within  
the parameters of the HMRC and the UKLA Listing Rules. 
Notes to the future remuneration policy table 
Annual bonus 
The performance conditions are set annually based on the metrics the Committee feels are most appropriate for the business.  
Like-for-like sales is a key metric in the Creating the Leader st rategy, and Profit Before Tax ensures that this sales growth i s delivered 
in a way that creates value for shareholders. Other strategic KPIs are chosen to support particular objectives for the year, an d the 
individual component enables outstanding contributions to be incentivised and rewarded. 
Annual bonus targets are set with reference to internal budgets and analyst consensus fo recasts, with maximum pay-out requiring 
performance well ahead of budget. 
Long-term incentive plan 
The Committee believes that long-term incentive plan measures should be aligned to shareholder value while providing line of si ght  
to management, so that they are meaningful and incentivising. EP S growth is a key measure of our success in growing value for 
shareholders over time, while KEP balances profit growth with efficient use of our balance sheet. 
The setting of LTIP targets takes into account analyst consensus forecasts, internal projections, and the levels of performance 
required over the long-term to deliver absolute value appreciation for shareholders. 
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees 
All employees are entitled to base salary and benefits and may also receive bonus, pension, profit share and share awards which  
vary according to local jurisdiction and market practice. The maximum provision and incentive opportunity available are determi ned  
by the seniority and responsibility of the role.

As described in this report. 
Cash benefits 
Car allowance (as an alternative to a company car) and pension benefit. 
Non-cash benefits 
The Company provides a range of additional benefits, including private medical insurance on a family basis, death in service 
cover equal to four times base salary, a subsidised staff canteen, a staff discount card, allowance for financial planning and  
30 working days’ holiday per year. 
Expenses 
Reimbursement of reasonably incurred costs in acco rdance with their duties. 
Non-compete 
During employment and for 12 months after leaving. In respect of Philippe Tible, an amount equal to 50% of annual salary  
and car benefit must be paid to him on a monthly basis if his employment is terminated by the Company. This amount is 
standard under French law in order to ensure that the non-compete provision is enforceable. 
Contractual  
termination payment 
Executive directors 
 
In the case of resignation, no payments on departure will be made on termination, even if by mutual agreement the notice  
period is cut short. If notice is served by the Company in full, no other payments should be due on departure. For any period 
of notice period not served, the payment takes the form of liquidated damages, which pays the departing executive 8.3% of  
salary per month for the remainder of their notice period. The se monthly payments are subjec t to mitigation. The maximum 
payment post departure would be one times base salary. 
If notice is served by either party, the ex ecutive director may continue to receive ba se salary, benefits and pension for the  
duration of their notice period, during which time the executive director may continue their duties or be assigned a period of 
garden leave. The Group’s policy is that payments for termination will not exceed 12 months’ base salary.  
The terms of the phased payment clauses in the service contracts of Sir Ian Cheshire and Kevin O’Byrne were consistent with  
the governance guidelines at the time the contracts were put in place. In circumstances wher e the Company terminates their 
agreements, they will receive phased payments of 15% and 12% of base sala ry respectively for a maximum of 12 months  
from the date of termination subject to mitigation. 
The termination clause in Philippe Tible’s contract is determ ined by the collective convention which applies to all French 
employees. A termination payment would be made up of two parts (i) the dismissal indemnity which is 3% of annual 
remuneration per year of service and (ii) a payment for any unpaid notice which would be a maximum of three months’ 
remuneration. The current combination cost based on years of service to date is approximately one times base salary. 
Remuneration for this purpose consists of ba se salary, car benefit and cash bonus award. 
In the event of a settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal  
claims. This may include an en titlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment protection 
legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions. The Committee may also include in such paymen ts reasonable reimbursement  
of professional fees in connection with such agreements.

Chairman and  
non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors are appointed under letters of engagement. Appointments have historically been for an initial period of 
three years and invitations to act for subseq uent three-year terms are subject to a re view of performance, and taking into account 
the need to progressively refresh the Board. 
The appointment may be terminated by either party giving the ot her not less than three months’ prior written notice, unless 
terminated earlier in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, and the Company has no obligation to pay 
compensation when their appointment terminates. 
Leaver provisions for  
annual bonus 
If notice is served by either party, the ex ecutive director may receive bonus payments in cash on a pro-rated basis from the st art of 
the financial year up to the date of termination of employment, based on the determination of the results at the year-end again st 
targets set. 
In the event that an executive director ceases to be employed during or shortly after the financial year and before the date of the 
annual bonus award, the Committee has the discretion to make a bonus payment and determine the basis upon which it is made 
and its value taking into account the individual circumstances of the departure. If the ex ecutive ceases employment as a result  
of a reason defined as a good leaver (which includes ill-heath or retirement), then th e normal approach would be to award a tim e 
pro-rated bonus in cash based on the actual results against the performance measures set once they have been determined 
following the end of the financial year. In the case of resignation, no bonus award will be made. 
Leaver provisions for  
share incentives 
The rules of the Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan (which will be subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in June 2014) and  
the Group’s legacy plans (the Performance Share Plan, Kingfish er Incentive Share Scheme an d Company Share Option Plan) 
(together the ‘Plans’) set out the treatment that will be applied to aw ards and options if a partic ipant leaves the Group befor e the 
end of the vesting period. A summary of the treatment is set out below: 
Long-Term Incentive Awards (granted under t he Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan (‘KISP’) from 2014 onwards and the Performance 
Share Plan (‘PSP’)) 
Awards will normally lapse upon cessation of employment (with th e exception of unvested awards granted under the KISP, which 
lapse on the date of notice of termination of employment), except in certain circumstances as described below. In determining t he 
extent to which awards should vest when an executive depart s, the Committee will consider a ll the facts of the executives 
departure, including their performance and the extent to which the departure is at the instigation of the Company. 
If an executive director ceases to be employed as a result of a reason defined as a good leaver within the rules of the KISP or the 
PSP, which includes ill-health, retirement or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee, then the awards will vest on the 
normal vesting date, but will be adjusted on a time pro-rated basis (unless the Committee decides, acting fairly and reasonably , 
that such an adjustment would be inappropriate). The Committee retains the discretion to reduce further awards granted under 
the KISP to reflect any personal performance issues. If the award is structured as a nil-cost option, it will normally be exercisable 
for a period of six months from the normal vesting date (unless the Committee determines that it may vest on the date of 
cessation). In circumstances where the participant ceases to be employed as a result of death, then the award will vest on the 
date the Company is notified and, if the award is structured as a nil-cost option, then it will be exercisable for a period of twelve 
months from the date of notification. The Committee will determine the vesting of the award based upon the performance 
conditions attached to the awards and a reduction in the numbe r of shares on a time pro-ra ted basis (unless the Committee 
decides, acting fairly and reasonably, that such an adjustment would be inappropriate). 
In the event of a takeover or other corporat e event (such as the winding-up of the Company), awards wi ll vest on the date of 
notification, but will be adjusted on a time pro-rated basis (unless the Committee decides, in its absolute discretion, that su ch an 
adjustment would be inappropriate) and in the case of an award structured as a nil- cost option, will be ex ercisable for a perio d of 
one month from the date of notification. 
Deferred Bonus Awards (granted under the KISP fr om 2015 onwards and the KISS up to 2014) 
Awards granted under the KISS lapse if the executive director re signs or is dismissed for cause. In all other circumstances, th e 
award will vest in full on the date of cessation of employment and will remain exercisable for a period of six months (12 month s in 
the case of death). 
Deferred Bonus Awards which will be granted under the KISP from 2015 onwards will lapse if the executive director resigns or is 
dismissed for cause. If an executive director ceases to be employed as a re sult of a reason define d as a good leaver which 
includes ill-health, disability or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee, then the awards will vest on the normal vesting 
date. If the award is structured as a nil-cost option, it will be exercisable for a period of six months from the normal vestin g date. In 
circumstances where the participant ceases to be employed as a result of death, th en the award will vest in full on the date th e 
Company is notified and, if the award is st ructured as a nil-cost option , then it will be exercisabl e for a period of twelve mo nths 
from the date of notification. 
In the event of a takeover or other corporat e event (such as the winding-up of the Company), awards wi ll vest on the date of 
notification and in the case of an award st ructured as a nil-cost option , will be exercisable for a period of one month from th e date 
of notification. 
Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’) 
The CSOP is an HMRC approved share option plan. Options granted under the CSOP are linked to an underpinning deferred 
bonus award granted under the KISS and the two must be exercised simultaneously. Options granted under the CSOP will 
normally lapse upon cessation of employmen t. If an executive director ceases to be empl oyed as a result of a reason defined as  
a good leaver within the rules of the CSOP, which include injury, disability or the sale or transfer of the business or company  
that employs them the option will vest on the cessation of employment and will be exercisable for a period of six months. If th e 
executive director leaves due to retirement, the award will vest on the normal vesting date or if the cessation of employment is 
within six months of the normal vesting date it will vest on the date of cessation.

Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group 
The Committee invites the Group HR Director to present at its meeting the proposals for salary increases for the employee popul ation 
generally and on any other changes to remune ration policy within the Group. The Group HR Director consults with the Committee o n 
the KPIs for the executive directors’ bonuses and the extent to which these should be cascaded to other employees. The Committe e 
has oversight of all LTIP awards across the Group. 
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structur e for all One Team Board members, approves the policy on share 
award levels for all employees and uses this information to ensure that there is consistency of approach throughout the Group.

Base salary as at 1 February 2014. 
Benefits: Estimate based upon benefits received during 2013/14 and recorded in the single figure table of remuneration. 
Pension: based upon pension of 30% of base salary for Sir Ian Cheshire and of 20% of base salary for Kevin O’Byrne and Karen Witts. Philippe Tible’s pension is based 
on that for 2013/14. 
Below threshold performance would result in the payment of the fixed elements of pay only. 
On-target performance is the level of performance required to deliver 50% of the maximum annual bonus and 50% of the full LTIP award. 
On-target for the Participation Scheme £8,500, maximum £23,900. 
On-target for the Interessement Scheme 10% of salary, maximum 20% of salary. 
Maximum performance would result in the maximum bonus payment and 100% vesting of the LTIP award.

Taxable benefits 
The benefits provided to executive directors for both 2013/14 and 2012/13 included car benefit (or cash allowance), private medical 
insurance, death in service cover and financial advice. 
Annual bonus 
The executive directors’ targets for the 2013/14 bonus were based on both financ ial targets and individual objectives as set ou t in  
the tables below, with annual bonus payments determined by refere nce to performance over the financial year ending 1 February 
2014. For the financial targets achievement is calculated on a straight-line basis be tween start to earn and target and between target 
and maximum. 
Group profit before tax at constant exchange rates grew modestly year-on-year, but was behind the Threshold level of performanc e 
and so no bonus was paid on this element. Re tail operating profit performance for B&Q and Koçtas ¸ brands was just above Threshold 
and so warranted a small bonus payment on this element for Kevin O’Byrne. 
Like-for-like sales growth was below target as we faced significan t sector-wide declines in a number of our markets. However, i n a 
number of our markets we grew market share even if absolute le vels of like-for-like sales growth were below target. Overall thi s 
performance resulted in a level of payment modestly above Threshold. 
In the face of challenging trading conditions the Group made good productivity improvements at the level of store productivity but also 
in identifying and delivering cost savings across the Group. As a result our producti vity targets were slightly exceeded, leading to a 
payment between Target and Maximum. 
Similarly good progress was achieved on our sourcing strategy wher e synergies and improvements in direct sourcing and own brand 
sourcing resulted in the Group as a whole being just above the target level of payment on this measure. 
Personal components of bonus reflected generally strong performance against personal objectives and contribution to the One  
Team behaviours.

These measures are considered commercially co nfidential and are therefore not disclosed. 
Long-term incentive plan 
The LTIP amount included in the 2013/14 single figure table is the PSP award granted in 2011. Vesting is dependent upon 
performance over the three financial years ending 1 February 2014 and continued employment up to the vesting date in June 2014.

Directors’ pension plan benefits 
The Company operates a defined contribution pension plan for executive directors based in the United Kingdom. 
Sir Ian Cheshire’s defined contribution pension arrangement provid es a Company contribution of 30% of his base salary, and Kevi n 
O’Byrne’s and Karen Witts’ arrangements provide a Company contrib ution of 20% of base salary. The Company operates a policy  
to limit pension contributions during the tax year up to the Annu al Allowance, with the excess being directed into a taxable mo nthly  
cash payment. Following pension and tax legisl ation changes which took effect in 2012 and which reduced the lifetime allowance 
from £1.8 million to £1.5 million, the Company has offered a fully taxable cash alternative, at no additional cost to the Company, to 
executive directors wishing to exit the defined contribution scheme completely. 
Kevin O’Byrne has chosen to receive his Company pension contributions as a taxable monthly cash supplement in full. 
Philippe Tible is a member of a separate Group defined benefit pension scheme, for wh ich eligibility requires him to retire wit h the 
Kingfisher Group. He has now met the age criteria of 62 in this scheme to retire and for the pension to crystallise. Based upon 11 
years’ service, the pension accrued is valued at £3.3m. The incr ease in the value of his pension over the course of the financi al year 
is £320,000 as shown in the single figure table. These figures are based on a crystallised pension and have not been discounted in 
any way for the risk of forfeiture. 
The following table shows details required under the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 as they apply to Kingfisher fo r the year ended 1 February 2014.  
The value of the increase in pension savings over the year is split between: 
• Defined benefit arrangements – the additional value achieved in the year based on the ‘HMRC methodology’ 
• Defined contribution arrangements – the cash value of any employer contributions over the year.

Payment in lieu of retirement benefits n/a 258.4
Sir Ian Cheshire ceased to accrue future bene fits in the Final Sala ry section on 30 June 2012. Un der that scheme, Sir Ian’s nor mal retirement age is 65 and his accrued 
pension figure at 1 February 2014 was £34,077. 
The increase in Sir Ian Cheshire ’s defined benefit arrangement is because the ‘H MRC methodology’ increases the opening pension (2 February 2013) with the change  
in the CPI index whereas the closing pension (1 February 2014) in cludes an increase at 1 April 2013 based on the change in the RPI index. Note that there have been  
no member contributions payable in respect of the Final Salary section since 30 June 2012. 
The defined contribution figure above represents employer contributions to the Money Purchase Plan over the year in question. M ember contributions of £52,000 were  
paid on behalf of Sir Ian Cheshire through salary sacrifice.

at no additional cost to the Company. 
(2) The payments to Sir Ian Cheshire in 2013/14 and 2012/13 include a goodwill payment received following the closure of the Ki ngfisher defined benefit scheme and  
his transfer to the Kingfisher defined contribution scheme. These payments were offered to all members of the scheme on the sam e terms.

(1) The option was granted at an option pr ice of 290.87p calculated by reference to the average closing price of Kingfisher plc shares for the three d ealing days immediately 
before the date of grant. 
(2) The market price of shares was determined by reference to the closing price of Kingfisher plc shares on the date of grant ( 11 April 2013). 
Included as an element of the KISS award, Karen Witts was granted options under the CSOP, a HMRC approved plan. The CSOP is und erpinned in part by a matching fixed 
value element of the KISS share awards granted on the same day. On exercise, the proceeds of part of the KIS share award are us ed to fund the exercise price of the CSOP 
award. The total value of the KISS share award is unchanged.  
Dilution limits 
Kingfisher’s share plans contain limits that set out the quantum of newly issued shares that may be used to satisfy awards gran ted 
under those plans. These limits are in line with the current Associ ation of British Insurers (ABI) guidance on headroom limits which 
provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in re lation to the Company’s issued share 
capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period on executive plans. The Company has always operated within thes e 
limits. The Committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers the effect of potential ve sting  
of options or share awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits. Any awards which are required to be satisfie d  
by market purchased shares are excluded from such calculations. No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended  
1 February 2014.  
Payments to past directors and payments for loss of office 
No payments were made to past directors or for loss of office during the year.

Performance graph and table 
The graph below shows Kingfisher’s total sh areholder return (‘TSR’) for the five year s to 1 February 2014 which assumes that £1 00 
was invested in Kingfisher on 1 February 2009. The Company ch ose the FTSE100 Index as an appropri ate comparator for this graph 
as Kingfisher has been a constituent of that index throughout the period.

2013/14 compared with the average percentage change in the avera ge of each of those components for all full-time equivalent emp loyees 
based in the UK. The UK employee workforce was chosen as a suitab le comparator group as Sir Ian Cheshire is based in the UK (al beit 
with a global role and responsibilities) and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.

The significant annual bonus % increase for a ll UK employees is driv en off a relatively low base for 2012/13, hence this does n ot impact the overall in crease significantly.

Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in the following financial year 
The Remuneration Policy will be implemented with effect from the AGM in 2014 in line with policy as follows: 
Base salary and fees  
Base salary and fees £’000 
% increase As at 1 Feb 2014 As at 1 Feb 2013 
Sir Ian Cheshire 849.0  832.3  2%

Senior Independent director 17.4 17.4 0%
Chairman of Audit Committee 20.0 20.0 0%
Chairman of Remuneration Committee 15.0 15.0 0%
Philippe Tible’s remuneration and the fees paid to Provestis in respect of the provision of Dani el Bernard as Chairman, are pai d in euros and are converted to sterling for  
the purpose of the table at the average exchange rate over the course of the relevant year. 
The increase awarded to Karen Witts was based on the intention to bring her up to the market median position as she develops in to her role, and gains more experience  
as a Group Financial Director.  
Benefits 
Implemented in line with policy. 
All employee share plans 
Implemented in line with policy. 
Pension 
Implemented in line with policy. 
Annual bonus 
Implemented in line with policy. 
Weighting of annual bonus for 2014/15 
• Profit before tax – 30% 
• Like-for-like sales – 30% 
• Cashflow – 20% 
• Personal objectives – 20%  
At the threshold level of performance, the award will be 10% of maximum. 
Profit before tax is calculated on the ba sis of budgeted exchange rates and excludes exceptional items according to the judgeme nt  
of the Committee. 
Like-for-like sales is set as an absolute target, but the Committee applies judgement in measuring the outcome against target,  
taking into account sales growth against the local market out-tu rn and any consequent increase or decrease in market share. 
Cashflow excludes capital expenditure, but the Committee may appl y judgement to ensure that the measure has not been met at  
the expense of investment. 
Any exchange rate upsides/downsides will be removed from the results when dete rmining award levels, since they are deemed to be 
outside the executive directors’ control. 
Long-term incentive plan 
Implemented in line with policy.

Performance measures for long-term incentives to be awarded in 2014/15 
Performance measure 
Threshold –  
25% vesting 
Maximum – 
100% vesting
Earnings per share – compound annual growth up to 2016/17 4% 11.5%
The EPS growth targets have been set to be consistent with ma rket practice in the FTSE100 and in particular the retail sector.  
The intention is to operate this range consistently over the poli cy period. The Threshold level of performance provides for real  
growth, which is considered suitably challenging in what remains an uncertain economic environment, but sets an achievable level  
of performance to ensure participants place value on the plan and are motivated by it. The Maximum performance level ensures th at 
full vesting is only achieved for outstanding double-digit perfor mance over the three-year period, well in excess of typical in dustry 
growth rates. 
Performance targets also include a KEP measure. KEP targets are calibrated to be consistent with the EPS growth targets, recogn ising 
that in weaker performance scenarios offsetting capital efficienci es should be identified, whereas stronger performance scenari os  
may allow increased capital investment. KEP is defined in the same way as set out in the Financial Review. 
Consideration by the directors of matters relating to directors’ remuneration 
The Committee has delegated responsibility from the Board for reviewing and approving the remuneration of the executive directors 
and the members of the Group Executive and for setting the re muneration package for the Chairman. The Committee also has 
oversight of the remuneration policy and p ackages for other senior members of staff. 
Members of the Committee 
The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors during the financial year to 1 February 2014.

The Committee has authority to obtain the advice of external in dependent remuneration consultants and is solely responsible  
for their appointment, retention and termination. In February 2013, following a robust tender process, the Committee appointed 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its principal adviser. During the financial year to 1 February 2014, th e following external advisers

PwC provided the Committee with executive remuneration advice, including the operation of employee and executive share plans. 
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group (the professional body for executive remuneration consultants) and

which £91,000 related to the comprehensive review of executive remuneration conducted during the year. 
Allen & Overy LLP (A&O) 
A&O provided legal advice to the Committee on service and em ployment contracts, and for other employment and remuneration 
issues. A&O also provides advice to the Group on other legal matters.

Directors’ report 
 Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14 
69 
The Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to present 
a Directors’ Report for the financial year ended 1 February  
2014. It is also required to repo rt on its compliance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) for the year and 
provide certain disclosures in respect of the United Kingdom 
Listing Authority’s (the UKLA) Disclosure and Transparency  
and Listing Rules. The report, together with the Corporate 
Governance report on pages 35 to 41 the Audit Committee report 
on pages 42 to 45, and the Dire ctors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 47 to 68 are incorporated into this Directors’ Report by 
reference, and when taken together with cross references to 
disclosures elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts, fulfil 
the Company’s disclosure requirements. 
Strategic Report 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to present  
a fair review of the operations of the business during the year  
to 1 February 2014 and the position of the Company at year  
end along with the principal risks and uncertainties faced. The 
Strategic Report of the Company, which includes the Group’s 
Key Performance Indicators, a statement on Corporate 
Responsibility, a Financial Review including financial and  
capital risk, is detailed on pages 1 to 31 and is incorporated  
by reference and deemed to form part of this report. 
Dividends 
The directors recommend a final dividend of 6.78p (2012/13: 
6.37p) per ordinary share amounting to £160m (2012/13: 
£150m) to be paid on 16 June 2014 to members appearing on 
the Register at the close of business on 16 May 2014. Together 
with the interim dividend of 3.12p (2012/13: 3.09p) per ordinary 
share, amounting to £74m (2012/13: £73m), paid on 15 
November 2013, the total dividend for the financial year ended  
1 February 2014 will be 9.90p (2012/13: 9.46p) per ordinary 
share, amounting to £234m (2012/13: £224m). 
The Kingfisher Employee Benefit Trust has waived all dividends 
payable by the Company in respect of the ordinary shares held 
by it. The total dividends waived in the year to 1 February 2014 
were in aggregate £1.1m. 
Directors 
Full biographical details of the current directors are set out on 
pages 32 and 33. In accordance with the principles of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors will retire and be 
submitted for re-appointment at the AGM in 2014. 
Directors’ indemnity arrangements 
The Company has provided qualifying third-party deeds of 
indemnity for the benefit of each director and former director 
who held office during the 2013/ 14 financial year. The Company 
has also purchased and maintained Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance throughout 2013/14. Neither the indemnities 
nor the insurance provides cover in the event that the director 
concerned is proved to have acted fraudulently. 
Directors’ interests 
Details of directors’ remuneration , service contracts and interests  
in the Company’s shares and sh are options are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 68. No director  
had a material interest at any time during the year in any derivative 
or financial instrument relati ng to the Company’s shares. 
Principal risk identification and management 
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group have been 
reviewed by the Board and are shown in the Risks section on 
pages 28 to 31. The Risks sectio n also provides information on 
the performance of the Board in actively managing those risks, to 
allow assessment of how the di rectors have performed their 
statutory duty to promote the success of the Company. 
Employees 
The commitment of the Group’s employees is vital to ensure that 
high standards of customer care and service are maintained 
throughout the business. The Group is fully committed to treating 
its employees and customers with dignity and respect, and to 
valuing diversity. It is Group policy to: 
• ensure there is no discrimination in employment on the 
grounds of race, gender, age, disability, marital status,  
sexual orientation or religious belief; 
• implement measures in stores to ensure a level of customer 
service for disabled people equivalent to that offered to  
non-disabled people; and 
• maintain a mechanism which customers and employees can 
use to give feedback on the Group’s performance and ensure 
that all customer comments are analysed, responded to and 
acted upon. 
A breakdown of employee gender diversity, as required by the 
Companies Act 2006, can be found on page 19  the Net 
Positive section of the Strategic Report and forms part of the 
Directors’ Report disclosures. During the year B&Q UK 
continued its long-established policy of promoting age diversity, 
with around a quarter of its employees aged over 50. 
The Group’s statement on employee development is set  
out in the People section of the Company’s website 
(www.kingfisher.com).  
There are a number of communication channels in place to  
help employees to develop their knowledge of, and enhance  
their involvement with, the Group. These channels include 
engagement surveys, briefing groups, internal magazines and 
newsletters that report on business performance and objectives, 
community involvement and other applicable issues. Directors 
and senior management regularly visit stores and discuss 
matters of current interest and concern with employees. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
The Group is required to state the annual quantity of emissions 
in tonnes of CO 2 equivalent from activities for which the Group  
is responsible. Details of our emissions for the year ended 1 
February 2014 and the actions the Group is taking to reduce 
their impact are set out within th e Sustainability section of the 
Strategic Report on pages 18 and 19 and form part of this 
Directors’ Report. 
Political donations 
The Board annually seeks and obtains shareholders’ approval  
to enable the Group to make donations or incur expenditure  
in relation to EU political parties, other political organisations  
or independent election candidates under section 366 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

The Group made no political donations during the year 
(2012/13: £nil). As with previous annual approvals, the Group 
has no intention of changing its current policy and practice of not 
making political donations. The Board seeks the approval on a 
precautionary basis to avoid any unintentional breach of the 
relevant provisions. Shareholder approval will be sought at this 
year’s AGM to renew this authority; further details are provided  
in the Notice of AGM. 
Significant agreements – change of control 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company following  
a takeover bid, such as bank loan agreements, Medium Term 
Note (‘MTN’) documentation, private placement debt and 
employee share plans. None of these are deemed to be 
significant in terms of their potential impact on the business  
of the Group as a whole except for:  
• the £200 million credit facility dated 8 July 2011 between  
the Company, HSBC Bank plc (as the facility agent) and the 
banks named therein as lenders, which contains a provision 
such that in the event of a change of control any lender may, 
if they so require, notify the agent that they wish to cancel 
their commitment whereupon the commitment of that lender 
will be cancelled and all their outstanding loans, together  
with accrued interest, will become immediately due and 
payable; and 
• the US$297 million US Private Placement notes, issued 
pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated 24 May 2006 
by the Company to various institutions, which contains a 
provision such that in the event of a change of control, the 
Company is required to make an offer to the holders of the 
US Private Placement notes to prepay the principal amount  
of the notes together with interest accrued. 
The Company does not have agreements with any director or 
officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of 
the Company’s share incentive schemes may cause options and 
awards granted under such schemes to vest on a takeover. 
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are set out in  
note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. All of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up and rank 
equally in all respects. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are 
set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which 
can be obtained from the Company’s website. The holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s Annual 
Report and Accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings  
of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or on 
the exercise of voting rights attached to them, except (i) where 
the Company has exercised its right to suspend their voting rights 
or to prohibit their transfer following the omission of their holder 
or any person interested in them to provide the Company with 
information requested by it in accordance with Part 22 of the 
Companies Act 2006 or (ii) where their holder is precluded from 
exercising voting rights by the Financial Services Authority Listing 
Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 
The Company has a Sponsored Level 1 American Depositary 
Receipt (‘ADR’) programme in the United States. 
Authority to allot shares 
At the AGM in 2013, shareholders approved a resolution to give 
the directors authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £124,279,699. In addition, shareholders approved a 
resolution to give the directors authority to allot up to a nominal 
amount of £248,559,398 in connection with an offer by way  
of a rights issue in accordance with ABI guidance. If this 
additional allotment authority were used, the ABI guidance  
would be followed. The directors have no present intention to 
issue ordinary shares, other than pursuant to employee share 
incentive schemes. These resolutions remain valid until the 
conclusion of this year’s AGM when resolutions will be proposed 
to renew these authorities. 
Authority to purchase own shares 
At the AGM in 2013, shareholders approved a resolution  
for the Company to make purchases of its own shares to a 
maximum number of 237,261,243 ordinary shares, being 
approximately 10% of the issued share capital. This resolution 
remains valid until the conclusion of this year’s AGM. As at 24 
March 2014, the directors have not used this authority. In order 
to retain maximum flexibility, a re solution will be proposed at  
this year’s AGM to renew this authority. It is the Company’s  
current intention that shares acquired under this authority  
will be cancelled. 
Financial instruments 
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies 
are set out in note 24 to the financial statements on pages  
107 to 109. Note 24 also details th e Group’s exposure to foreign 
exchange, interest, credit and liquidity risks. These notes are 
included by reference and form part of this report.

Going concern 
The directors confirm that, after reviewing expenditure 
commitments, expected cash flows and borrowing facilities,  
they have a reasonable expectation that Kingfisher plc (the 
‘Company’) and the Kingfisher group of companies (the ‘Group’) 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the next financial year and the foreseeable future. For this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these financial statements. Further details of the Group’s liquidity 
are provided in the financial review on page 20. 
Disclosure of information to auditors 
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that: so far as he or she is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as defined by section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and each director has taken all the steps that he or  
she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself  
or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
Responsibility for preparing financial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
• UK company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected  
to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.  
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the 
directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• follow applicable UK Accounting Standards (except where 
any departures from this requirement are explained in the 
notes to the parent Company financial statements); and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements in accordance  
with IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, the directors 
are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
• present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and 
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible fo r safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenanc e and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement 
The directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;  
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and 
• The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide  
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
1 February 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the 52 weeks 
then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity,  
the consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets, the 
consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to  
38 for the Group and 1 to 15 for the Parent Company financial 
statements. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is 
applicable law and IFRSs as adop ted by the European Union.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in  
the preparation of the Parent Co mpany financial statements is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Going concern 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ 
statement on page 71 that the Group is a going concern.  
We confirm that: 
• we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going  
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate. 
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may  
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below  
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of  
the engagement team: 
 
 
Subject Nature of risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Inventories Assessing net realisable value is an area 
of significant judgement, in particular with 
regards to the estimation of provisions for  
slow-moving and obsolete inventory. 
We focused on the valuation of year end 
inventory levels, including challenging 
judgements taken regarding obsolescence. 
Inventory provisioning has been assessed 
using historic stock performance and 
compared to the Group provision recognised. 
Our procedures included assessing the 
adequacy of, and movements in, inventory 
provisions held by recalculating a sample of 
items included within the provision to ensure 
appropriate basis of valuation. 
Supplier rebates Assessing the timing of recognition of rebate 
income earned from suppliers, including 
adherence to contractual terms, is an area  
of complexity. The subsequent recoverability 
of amounts due from suppliers is also an  
area of management judgement. 
We reviewed agreements with suppliers 
and adherence to terms to assess whether 
sufficient evidence to support the recognition 
of rebate income exists. We circularised a 
sample of suppliers where the outstanding 
balances were significant at the year end in 
order to assess recoverability.    www.kingfisher.com

Subject Nature of risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Property 
As a result of the diverse property 
portfolio across the Group, there are several 
technically complex or judgemental aspects  
of property accounting and accounting for 
leases across the Group, including: 
• The assessment of carrying values of 
freehold stores; 
• accounting for store closure costs; and  
• other property related provisions,  
including onerous leases. 
For leasehold property, we focused our work 
on the identification of complex or unusual 
lease contracts to assess whether they were 
appropriately accounted for under IAS 17: 
‘Leases’. We also performed procedures to 
identify leases which could be considered 
onerous – for example, we reviewed the 
properties currently under lease, and identified 
those which may be vacant or underutilised, 
or where properties are sublet whether the 
estimated rental income leads to an  
onerous contract. 
For freehold properties, we reviewed 
management’s assessment of carrying  
values, challenged key assumptions used  
in, and performed sensitivity analysis on,  
the impairment models where indicators of 
impairment were identified. 
We considered the assumptions used by 
management in estimating store closure costs 
and challenged the timing of recognition of 
associated provisions. 
Goodwill and intangible assets Determining the appropriate carrying 
value of goodwill and intangible assets  
requires management to make significant 
estimates. Cash generating units are  
reviewed for impairment using a value in  
use model, as described in note 12 to the 
financial statements. 
We reviewed the assumptions used in the 
impairment model for goodwill and intangible 
assets, including comparison of the input 
assumptions to externally and internally 
derived data, as well as forming our own 
assessments, and challenged the key inputs 
used, including specifically the operating cash 
flow projections, discount rates, and long-term 
growth rates. We considered the sensitivity of 
the model to changes in key assumptions.  
We also considered the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in respect of impairment 
testing and whether disclosures about the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions 
properly reflected the risks inherent in  
the assumptions. 
Taxation Due to the estimation uncertainty as referred 
to in the Critical Accounting Estimates and 
Judgements in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements at page 88 in respect of 
settlements with tax authorities around the 
world, assessing the Group’s exposure to 
significant tax risks and the level of provisions 
recognised is a judgemental area.  
We considered all significant taxation 
exposures across the Group, including 
challenging the estimates and judgements 
made by management when calculating the 
income tax payable in each territory and the 
associated provisions held. 
We reviewed correspondence with taxation 
authorities in significant locations, as well as 
reviewing the support or opinions received 
from external counsel and other advisers 
where management has relied on such 
opinions to make assumptions on the level  
of taxation payable. 
The Audit Committee’s consideration of risks is set out on page 43. 
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole , and 
not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with r espect 
to any of the risks described above, and we do no t express an opinion on these individual matters.   Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14

Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.  
We determined materiality for the Group to be £35 million,  
which is below 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit, and below 1% of 
equity. We use adjusted pre-tax profit to exclude the effect of 
volatility due to exceptional items from our determination.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them all audit differences in excess of £700,000, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit scope focused primarily on all significant  
trading entities and the Group head office, and included B&Q 
UK, Castorama France, Brico Dépôt France, Castorama Poland, 
Castorama Russia, B&Q China, Screwfix, Brico Dépôt Spain, 
Bricostore Romania and the Koçtas ¸ joint venture. These locations 
represent the principal business units and account for 99% of 
the Group’s revenue, 98% of the Gr oup’s profit before tax after 
taking into account the allocation of central sourcing costs, and 
97% of the Group’s net assets. The locations in scope were 
selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified 
above. Our audit work at these locations was executed at levels 
of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were 
lower than Group materiality. The entities which are out of our 
scope are primarily individually insignificant cost entities, the 
Hornbach investment and other smaller operations. 
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of 
planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor visits locations considered the most significant 
each year. For the remaining locations where Group audit work is 
performed but no visit is carried out, the Senior Statutory Auditor 
has discussed and challenged the key areas of judgement with 
the lead audit partner of the relevant component in the current 
year, and a senior member of the Group engagement team has 
visited the location. We also held regional planning briefings, 
attended by the component auditors from each of the eleven 
locations discussed above, at which we discussed developments 
in the Group relevant to our audit, including risk assessment and 
audit procedures to respond to the risks identified. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006  
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting 
records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to  
you if, in our opinion: 
• we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in  
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report 
if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review. 
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in  
the course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading.    www.kingfisher.com
 75
Strategic Report Governance Accounts
 
 
 www.kingfisher.com 
75 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those  
matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have 
not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with  
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We 
also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK 
and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that 
our quality control procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team, strategically focused  
second partner reviews and independent partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’ s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company  
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work,  
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting  
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with,  
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing  
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 www.kingfisher.com

1 General information 
Kingfisher plc (‘the Company’), its subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates (together ‘the Group’) supply home improvement 
products and services through a network of retail stores and 
other channels, located mainly in the United Kingdom, 
continental Europe and China.  
The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom. The nature 
of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in 
the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 31. 
The address of its registered office is 3 Sheldon Square, 
Paddington, London W2 6PX. 
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
These consolidated financial statements have been approved  
for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 March 2014. 
2 Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated. A prior year restatement as a result of 
the amendments to IAS 19 (revised), ‘Employee benefits’, is 
described in section a of this note. 
a. Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company, its 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are made up to the 
nearest Saturday to 31 January each year, except as disclosed  
in note 17 and in note 4 of the Company’s separate financial 
statements. The current financial year is the 52 weeks ended  
1 February 2014 (‘the year’ or ‘2013/14’). The comparative 
financial year is the 53 weeks ended 2 February 2013 (‘the prior 
year’ or ‘2012/13’). The 53 weeks in the prior year only impacted 
the UK and Ireland businesses with all of the other businesses 
reporting on a calendar basis as a result of local requirements.  
The directors of Kingfisher plc, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the Group 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future 
and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended 1 February 2014. Refer to the Directors’ statement  
of responsibility on page 71. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS legislation. 
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations, 
which are mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
ended 1 February 2014, are relevant and material for  
the Group: 
• IAS 1 (amended), ‘Presentation of items of other 
comprehensive income’ (effective from 1 July 2012); 
• IAS 19 (revised), ‘Employee benefits’ (effective from  
1 January 2013); 
• IFRS 7 (amended), ‘Disclosures – Offsetting financial assets 
and financial liabilities’ (effective from 1 January 2013); 
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ (effective from  
1 January 2013). 
The impact on the Group of the application of the above 
standards is as follows: 
• The amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of items of other 
comprehensive income’, require items presented in ‘other 
comprehensive income’ to be grouped by those items that 
may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and  
those that will never be reclassified, together with their 
associated income tax. The amendments have been  
applied retrospectively and the presentation of items of  
comprehensive income has been adjusted accordingly. 
• IAS 19 (revised), ‘Employee benefits’, amends the accounting 
for employment benefits and the Group has applied it 
retrospectively in accordance with the transition provisions of 
the standard. The impact on the Group has been in the 
following areas: 
– The standard replaces the interest cost on the defined 
benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets 
with a single net interest expense or income based on the 
net defined benefit asset or liability and the discount rate, 
measured at the beginning of the year. There is no change 
to determining the discount rate; this continues to reflect 
the yield on high-quality corporate bonds. For the current 
and comparative year, the Group’s reported profit before 
taxation was not impacted as the expected rate of return  
on assets at the start of the current and prior year was the 
same as the discount rate for the UK scheme, the Group’s 
principal defined benefit pension plan. 
– The revised standard also requires administrative costs of 
running the UK scheme to be reclassified from net finance 
costs to operating costs. For the current year the Group’s 
reported operating profit is £3m lower and net finance 
income £3m higher than they would have been prior to the 
adoption of IAS 19 (revised). For the year ended 2 February 
2013 the Group’s reported operating profit is £3m lower 
and net finance costs £3m lower than previously reported. 
• IFRS 7 (amended), ‘Disclosures – Offsetting financial assets 
and financial liabilities’, amended the required disclosures 
surrounding the effect or potential effect of netting 
arrangements, including rights of set-off associated with 
recognised financial assets and liabilities, on the Group’s 
financial position. 
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, has impacted the 
measurement of fair value for certain financial assets and 
liabilities as well as introducing new disclosures.   Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14

The following amendments and interpretations, which are 
mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended  
1 February 2014, are either not currently relevant or not  
material for the Group: 
• IFRS 1 (amended), ‘First time adoption’ on government  
loans (effective from 1 January 2013); 
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 –  
Investment entities; 
• Annual improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011 (effective from  
1 January 2013); 
• IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase  
of a Surface Mine’; 
• Amendments to IFRS 1 Government Loans. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements,  
the following new standards, amendments and interpretations, 
which have not been applied in these financial statements,  
were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had  
not yet been adopted by the EU): 
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ (effective from  
1 January 2018); 
• IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ (effective  
from 1 January 2014); 
• IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ (effective from  
1 January 2014); 
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ (effective 
from 1 January 2014); 
• IAS 27 (revised), ‘Separate financial statements’ (effective  
from 1 January 2014); 
• IAS 28 (revised), ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ 
(effective from 1 January 2014); 
• IAS 32 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’  
on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities  
(effective from 1 January 2014).  
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards 
listed above will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS  
9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of  
financial instruments. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide  
a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a 
detailed review has been completed.  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the use  
of valuations for certain financial instruments, share-based 
payments and post-employment benefits. A summary of the 
Group’s principal accounting policies is set out below.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  
IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates and 
assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its 
judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving critical accounting estimates and 
judgements, which are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements, are disclosed in note 3. 
Use of non-GAAP measures 
In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain 
measures that are not required under IFRS, the Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (‘GAAP’) under which the Group 
reports. Kingfisher believes that retail profit, adjusted  
pre-tax profit, effective tax rate, adjusted post-tax profit and 
adjusted earnings per share provide additional useful information 
on underlying trends to shareholders. These and other non-
GAAP measures such as net debt/cash are used by Kingfisher 
for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation 
arrangements for employees. The terms ‘retail profit’, ‘exceptional 
items’, ‘adjusted’, ‘effective tax rate’ and ‘net debt/cash’ are not 
defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable 
with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to,  
GAAP measures. 
Like-for-like (‘LFL’) sales growth is defined as the constant 
currency, year-on-year sales growth for stores that have been 
open for more than a year. 
Retail profit is defined as conti nuing operating profit before 
central costs (principally the costs of the Group’s head office), 
exceptional items, amortisation of acquisition intangibles  
and the Group’s share of interest and tax of joint ventures  
and associates. 
The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items,  
which are presented as exceptional within their relevant income 
statement category, helps provide an indication of the Group’s 
underlying business performance. The principal items which  
are included as exceptional items are: 
• non-trading items included in operating profit such as  
profits and losses on the disposal, closure or impairment  
of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and investments 
which do not form part of th e Group’s trading activities; 
• profits and losses on the disposal of properties; and 
• the costs of significant restructuring and incremental 
acquisition integration costs. 
The term ‘adjusted’ refers to the relevant measure being  
reported for continuing operations excluding exceptional items, 
financing fair value remeasurements, amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles, related tax items and prior year tax items (including 
the impact of changes in tax rates on deferred tax). Financing  
fair value remeasurements represent changes in the fair value  
of financing derivatives, excluding interest accruals, offset by  
fair value adjustments to the carrying amount of borrowings  
and other hedged items under fair value hedge relationships. 
Financing derivatives are those that relate to underlying items  
of a financing nature.    www.kingfisher.com

2 Principal accounting policies continued 
The effective tax rate represents the effective income tax  
expense as a percentage of continuing profit before taxation 
excluding exceptional items. Effective income tax expense is  
the continuing income tax expense excluding tax on exceptional 
items and tax adjustments in respect of prior years and the 
impact of changes in tax rates on deferred tax. 
Net debt/cash comprises borrowings and financing derivatives 
(excluding accrued interest), less cash and cash equivalents 
and current other investments. 
b. Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures  
and associates. 
(i) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group  
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half  
of the voting rights. Subsidiary undertakings acquired are 
recorded under the acquisition method of accounting and their 
results included from the date of acquisition. The results of 
subsidiaries which have been disposed are included up to the 
effective date of disposal. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary  
is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred 
and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting 
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired  
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis,  
the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the  
acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is 
the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-
controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling 
interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having 
a deficit balance. Prior to 31 January 2010, losses exceeding  
the non-controlling interest in the equity of a subsidiary were 
required to be attributed to the parent; the resulting deficit 
balances were not restated following amendment to IAS 27, 
‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’. 
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of  
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition-
date fair value of any previous equity interests in the acquiree 
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of  
the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of  
a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly  
in the income statement. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains  
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries have been  
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the  
policies adopted by the Group. 
(ii) Joint ventures and associates 
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint  
control, with a third party, to govern the financial and operating 
activities of that entity. The equity method is used to account  
for the Group’s investments in joint ventures. 
Associates are entities over which the Group has the ability  
to exercise significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanied by a shareholding of between 20% and 50%  
of the voting rights. The equity method is used to account  
for the Group’s investments in associates. 
Under the equity method investments are initially recognised at 
cost. The Group’s investments in joint ventures and associates 
include goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment losses) 
identified on acquisition. 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses is 
recognised in the income statement within operating profit,  
and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is 
recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition 
movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of  
the investment. When the Group’s share of losses equals or  
exceeds its interest, including any other long-term receivables, 
the Group does not recognise any further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint 
venture or associate. 
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its  
joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless  
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Accounting policies of joint ventures and associates 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group. 
The equity method of accounting is discontinued from the date 
an investment ceases to be a joint venture or associate, that is 
the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control or 
significant influence over the investee or on the date it is 
classified as held for sale. 
c. Foreign currencies 
(i) Presentation and functional currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in  
Sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. Items 
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates  
(i.e. its functional currency). 
(ii) Transactions and balances 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are  
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the date of the transaction or, for practical  
reasons, at average monthly rates where exchange rates  
do not fluctuate significantly.    Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14

 Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14

2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  
currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange  
at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary 
items are taken to the income statement. Exceptions to this are 
where the monetary items form part of the net investment in a 
foreign operation or are designated and effective net investment 
or cash flow hedges. Such exchange differences are initially 
deferred in equity. 
(iii) Group companies 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings  
are expressed in Sterling at th e rates of exchange at the  
balance sheet date. Profits and losses of overseas subsidiary 
undertakings are expressed in Sterling at average exchange  
rates for the period. Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of foreign operations, including joint ventures and 
associates, are recognised in a separate component of equity. 
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of 
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. When a foreign 
operation is sold, such exchange differences recorded since  
1 February 2004 are recognised in the income statement as  
part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition  
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the rates of exchange at the 
balance sheet date. Goodwill arising prior to 1 February 2004 
is denominated in Sterling.

d. Revenue recognition 
Sales represent the supply of home improvement products and 
services. Sales exclude transactions made between companies 
within the Group, Value Added Tax, other sales-related taxes  
and are net of returns, trade and staff discounts. 
Sales of in-store products are generally recognised at the point  
of cash receipt. Where award credits such as vouchers or loyalty 
points are provided as part of the sales transaction, the amount 
allocated to the credits is deferred and recognised when the 
credits are redeemed and the Group fulfils its obligations to 
supply the awards. 
For delivered products and services, sales are recognised either 
when the product has been delivered or, for installation income, 
when the service has been performed. Sales from delivered 
products and services represent only a small component of  
the Group’s sales as the majority relates to in-store purchases  
of products. 
Other income is generally composed primarily of external  
rental income and profits and losses on disposal of assets.  
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight 
line basis over the term of the rele vant lease. Initial direct costs 
incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and  
recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
e. Rebates 
Rebates received from suppliers mainly comprise volume  
related rebates on the purchase of inventories.  
Volume related rebates are recognised based on actual 
purchases in the period as a proportion of total purchases 
forecast over the rebate period where it is probable the rebates 
will be received and the amounts can be estimated reliably.  
Rebates relating to inventories purchased but still held at the 
balance sheet date are deducted from the carrying value so  
that the cost of inventories is recorded net of applicable rebates. 
Such rebates are credited to the income statement when the 
goods are sold.  
f. Dividends 
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the 
Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised  
when they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
g. Intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising  
from assets acquired in a business combination that are  
not individually identified and separately recognised.  
Such benefits include future synergies expected from the  
combination and intangible assets not meeting the criteria  
for separate recognition. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is not amortised and is tested annually for impairment 
by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash generating 
unit or groups of cash generating units to which the goodwill 
relates. The recoverable amount is assessed by reference  
to the net present value of expected future pre-tax cash flows 
(‘value-in-use’) or fair value less costs to sell if higher. The 
discount rate applied is based upon the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks 
associated with the relevant cash generating unit or groups of 
cash generating units. When the recoverable amount of the  
goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement which cannot 
subsequently be reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an 
entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold. 
(ii) Computer software 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the  
basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
specific software. These costs are amortised over their  
estimated useful lives of two to ten years.    www.kingfisher.com

Strategic Report Governance Accounts
 
 
 
 www.kingfisher.com 
85 
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of 
identifiable and unique software products controlled by the 
Group, which are expected to generate economic benefits 
exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible 
assets. Direct costs include software development, employee  
and consultancy costs and an ap propriate portion of relevant 
overheads. These costs are amortised over their estimated  
useful lives of two to ten years. Costs associated with identifying, 
sourcing, evaluating or maintaining computer software are 
recognised as an expense as incurred. 
h. Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Cost  
Property, plant and equipment held for use in the business  
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provisions for impairment.  
Properties that were held at 1 February 2004 are carried at 
deemed cost, being the fair value of land and buildings as  
at the transition date to IFRS. All property acquired after  
1 February 2004 is carried at cost. 
(ii) Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided to reflect a straight line reduction  
from cost to estimated residual value over the estimated useful 
life of the asset as follows: 
Freehold land – not depreciated 
Freehold and long leasehold buildings – over remaining useful life  
Short leasehold land and buildings – over remaining period  
of the lease 
Fixtures and fittings – between 4 and 20 years 
Computers and electronic equipment – between 3 and 5 years 
Motor cars – 4 years 
Commercial vehicles – between 3 and 10 years 
Long leaseholds are defined as those having remaining lease 
terms of more than 50 years. Asset lives and residual values  
are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
(iii) Impairment 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment 
is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference 
to the net present value of expected future pre-tax cash flows 
(‘value-in-use’) of the relevant cash generating unit or fair  
value less costs to sell if higher. The discount rate applied is 
based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital with 
appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the relevant 
cash generating unit. Any impairment in value is charged to the 
income statement in the period in which it occurs.  
(iv) Disposal 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset 
is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds  
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
income statement. Sales of land and buildings are accounted for 
when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts.  
(v) Subsequent costs 
Subsequent costs are included in the related asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,  
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item  
can be measured reliably.  
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
i. Leased assets 
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements which give 
rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if 
they had been purchased outright. The amount capitalised is the 
lower of the fair value or the present value of the minimum lease 
payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease.  
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or 
their useful life. Obligations relating to finance leases, net of 
finance charges in respect of future periods, are included, as 
appropriate, under borrowings due within or after one year.  
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to finance  
costs in the income statement over the lease term.  
All other leases are operating leases and the rental payments  
are generally charged to the income statement in the period  
to which the payments relate, except for those leases which 
incorporate fixed minimum rental uplift clauses. Leases which 
contain fixed minimum rental uplifts are charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Where a lease is taken out for land and buildings combined,  
the buildings element of the lease may be capitalised as a 
finance lease if it meets the criteria for a finance lease, but the 
land element will in most cases be classified as an operating 
lease. If the contracted lease payments are not split between 
land and buildings in the lease co ntract, the split is made based 
on the market values of the land and buildings at the inception  
of the lease.  
Incentives received or paid to enter into lease agreements are 
released to the income statement on a straight line basis over  
the lease term. 
j. Investment property 
Investment property is property held by the Group to earn rental 
income or for capital appreciation. The Group’s investment 
properties are carried at cost less depreciation and provision for 
impairment. Depreciation is provided on a consistent basis with 
that applied to property, plant and equipment. 
k. Capitalisation of borrowing costs 
Interest on borrowings to finance the construction of properties 
held as non-current assets is capitalised from the date work 
starts on the property to the date when substantially all the 
activities which are necessary to get the property ready for  
use are complete. Where construction is completed in parts,  
each part is considered separately when capitalising interest.  
Interest is capitalised before any allowance for tax relief. 
l. Inventories 
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value, on a weighted average cost basis. 
Trade discounts and rebates received are deducted in 
determining the cost of purchase of inventories. Cost includes 
appropriate attributable overheads and direct expenditure 
incurred in the normal course of business in bringing goods  
to their present location and condition. Costs of inventories 
include the transfer from equity of any gains or losses on 
qualifying cash flow hedges relating to purchases.    Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
86
Accounts 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14 
86 
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale. Write downs to net realisable value are made for 
slow moving, damaged or obsolete items and other events  
or conditions resulting in expected selling prices being lower  
than cost. The carrying value of inventories reflects known and 
expected losses of product in the ordinary course of business.  
m. Employee benefits 
(i) Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates various defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension schemes for its employees, some of which 
are required by local legislation. A defined benefit scheme is a 
pension scheme which defines an amount of pension benefit 
which an employee will receive on retirement. A defined 
contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the 
Group usually pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.  
In all cases other than some of the legally required schemes,  
a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing 
liabilities. The assets of each of these funds are either held  
under trusts or managed by insurance companies and are 
entirely separate from the Group’s assets. 
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect  
of defined benefit pension schemes is the fair value of scheme 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation  
at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged to 
the statement of comprehensive income as they arise. 
For defined contribution schemes, the Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.  
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit 
expense when they are due. 
(ii) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates several equity-settled, share-based 
compensation schemes. The fair value of the employee  
services received in exchange for the grant of options or  
deferred shares is recognised as an expense and is calculated 
using Black-Scholes and stochastic models. The total amount  
to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the options or deferred shares 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect 
expected and actual levels of options vesting due to  
non-market vesting conditions.  
n. Taxation 
The income tax expense represents the sum of the tax  
currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable  
is based on taxable profit for the year.  
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported  
in the income statement because it excludes items of income  
or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years or 
which are never taxable or deductible. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable  
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to  
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences or unused tax 
losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised  
if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition  
of goodwill in a business combination. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising 
on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at  
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it  
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates which 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Current and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income 
statement, except when they relate to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is  
also recognised directly in equity. 
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against 
each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
o. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal  
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more 
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.  
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate which reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific  
to the liability. 
p. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows  
from the financial asset expire or the Group has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial 
liabilities (or a part of a financ ial liability) are derecognised  
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged  
or cancelled or expires.    www.kingfisher.com

Financial assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group  
has a currently enforceable legal right to set-off the respective 
recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, 
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
(i) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits  
held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
(ii) Borrowings 
Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured  
at amortised cost. Where borrowings are in designated and 
effective fair value hedge relationships, adjustments are made  
to their carrying amounts to reflect the hedged risks. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the  
income statement using the effective interest method. 
(iii) Other investments 
Other investments include bank deposits, government bonds 
and other short-term investments with original maturities of  
more than three months. Investments classified as ‘available- 
for-sale’ under IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition  
and measurement’, are initially measured at fair value, with 
subsequent changes in fair value recorded directly in equity.  
Any dividends received are recognised in the income statement. 
On disposal, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised 
in equity are transferred to the income statement. 
(iv) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision  
for bad and doubtful debts.  
(v) Trade payables 
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
(vi) Derivatives and hedge accounting 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to  
which it is not effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives 
are recognised in the income statement as they arise. Changes  
in the fair value of derivatives transacted as hedges of operating 
items and financing items are recognised in operating profit  
and net finance costs respectively.  
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently carried 
at fair value. The accounting treatment of derivatives and other 
financial instruments classified as hedges depends on their 
designation, which occurs at the start of the hedge relationship. 
The Group designates certain financial instruments as: 
• a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability or unrecognised 
firm commitment (‘fair value hedge’); 
• a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or firm 
commitment (‘cash flow hedge’); or 
• a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (‘net 
investment hedge’). 
Fair value hedges  
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair  
value, the hedged item is adju sted for changes in fair value 
attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding 
entry being recorded in the income statement. Gains or losses 
from remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument  
are recognised in the same line of the income statement. 
Cash flow hedges  
Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of  
derivatives that are designated as hedges of future cash flows  
are recognised directly in equity, with any ineffective portion  
being recognised immediately in the income statement  
where relevant. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or 
forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial 
asset or liability, then, at the time it is recognised, the associated 
gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been 
recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of 
the non-financial asset or liability. For hedges that result in the 
recognition of a financial asset or liability, amounts deferred in 
equity are recognised in the income statement in the same 
period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.  
Net investment hedges 
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations 
through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the 
retranslation of the borrowings are recognised directly in equity.  
If the Group uses derivatives as the hedging instrument, the 
effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, with any 
ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are  
recycled through the income statement on disposal of the  
foreign operation.  
In order to qualify for hedge a ccounting, the Group documents  
in advance the relationship between the item being hedged  
and the hedging instrument. The Group also documents and 
demonstrates an assessment of the relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging in strument, which shows that the 
hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. 
The effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to 
ensure that the hedge remains highly effective. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs.  
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the  
net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred  
to the income statement. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their  
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host 
contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value  
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.  
q. Assets held for sale 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held  
for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition  
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and  
the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in  
its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and 
customary for sales of such assets.

2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Management must be committed to the sale, which should  
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of classification as held for sale. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for 
sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell. This excludes financial assets, deferred tax 
assets and assets arising from employee benefits, which are 
measured according to the relevant accounting policy. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not 
depreciated once classified as held for sale. The group ceases to 
use the equity method of accounting from the date on which an 
interest in a jointly controlled entity or an interest in an associate 
becomes held for sale. 
3 Critical accounting estimates  
and judgements 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under  
IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year  
are discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill and other assets 
As required, the Group applies procedures to ensure that its 
assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amount.  
The procedures, by their nature, require estimates and 
assumptions to be made. The most significant are set out below. 
The Group is required, on at le ast an annual basis, to test 
whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. As part of this 
testing the recoverable amounts of cash generating units have 
been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The  
use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash 
generating unit and the choice of suitable discount and long- 
term growth rates in order to calculate the present value of the 
forecast cash flows. Actual outcomes could vary significantly 
from these estimates. Further information on the impairment 
tests undertaken, including the key assumptions, is given  
in note 12. 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment 
is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash 
generating unit is determined as the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated on the basis of 
management’s assumptions and estimates. 
At each reporting date the Group is required to assess whether 
there is objective evidence that its investments in associates  
and joint ventures may be impaired. This requires estimates  
of the investments’ recoverable amounts, including present 
values of the Group’s share of future cash flows. 
Inventories 
As inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value this requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of 
goods to customers in the future. A high degree of judgement  
is applied when estimating the impact on the carrying value of 
inventories of factors such as slow moving items, shrinkage, 
damage and obsolescence. The quantity, age and condition of 
inventories are regularly measured and assessed as part of range 
reviews and inventory counts undertaken throughout the year 
and across the Group. Refer to note 18 for further information. 
Income taxes 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
and there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of 
business. Significant judgement may therefore be required in 
determining the provision for income taxes in each territory. The 
Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the 
final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 
which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which 
such determination is made. These adjustments in respect of 
prior years are recorded in the income statement or directly  
in equity as appropriate. Refer to notes 9 and 25 for further 
information. 
Restructuring provisions 
The Group carries a number of provisions in relation to  
historical and ongoing restructuring programmes. The most 
significant part of the provisions is the cost to exit stores and 
property contracts. The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows 
are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the 
closed stores and subletting surplus space. Refer to note  
26 for further information. 
Post-employment benefits 
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised on 
the balance sheet is dependent on a number of assumptions 
including interest rates of high quality corporate bonds, inflation 
and mortality rates. The net interest expense or income is 
dependent on the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds. 
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and 
changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements 
in the estimated obligations. To help the reader understand the 
impact of changes in the key assumptions, a sensitivity analysis 
is provided in note 27. 
Investment in Hornbach 
During the year a number of developments have occurred  
in respect of our strategic investment in Hornbach. This  
has required judgement to be exercised surrounding the  
ability of the Group to exercise significant influence over 
Hornbach based on accounting definitions, and therefore the 
appropriateness of continuing to account for the investment as 
an associate. Following the decision to waive the right to appoint 
directors to the board, the Directors have judged that the Group 
ceased to have the ability to exercise significant influence from 
31 January 2014. Further judgements have been required in 
assessing the classification of the investment as an asset held for 
sale, the valuation as at 1 Febr uary 2014 and whether it should 
be classified as a discontinued operation, the latter not being 
judged appropriate given its size relative to the Group as a  
whole. Refer to notes 17 and 34 for further information.

Income tax expense 49 127
The effective rate of tax on profit before exceptional items and excluding prior year tax adjustments and the impact of changes  
in tax rates on deferred tax is 26% (2012/13: 27%). Tax on exceptional items for the year is a credit of £114m, £118m of which 
relates to prior year items. In 2012/13 tax on exceptional items was a credit of £1m , with no amount relating to prior year ite ms.  
The effective tax rate calculation is set out in the Financial Review on page 23. 
The overall tax rate for the year is 6% (2012/13: 18%) reflecting the release of a £118m exceptional tax provision following the 
successful resolution of the Kesa demerger French tax case.  
Kingfisher paid €138m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals 
demerger and recorded this as an exceptional tax charge. Kingfisher appealed successfully against this tax liability and as a result 
received €169m from the French tax authorities in September 2009, representing a refund of the €138m and €31m of repayment 
supplement. The French tax authorities appealed this decision and the hearing took place in May 2011 with the Court of Appeal 
finding in Kingfisher’s favour. In July 2013 the Conseil d’Etat, France’s ultimate court, found in favour of Kingfisher regarding the  
Kesa demerger tax case, which concluded the matter. Whilst a refund was received from the French tax authorities following the  
first positive decision in 2009, the Group continued to provide against the risk while litigation was ongoing. A £27m repayment 
supplement provision and £118m taxation provision related to the case have subsequently been released and treated as exceptional. 
In addition to the amounts charged to th e income statement, tax of £67m has been credited directly to equity (2012/13: £14m 
charge), of which a £19m credit (2012/13: £6m credit) is included in current tax a nd a £48m credit (2012/13: £20m charge) is 
included in deferred tax. 
Impact of changes in tax rates 
The UK corporation tax rate fell from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 and will fa ll to 21% from 1 April 2014 and then to 20% from  
1 April 2015. As all these rates have been en acted by the balance sheet date, their impa ct has been fully reflected in this Ann ual

Adjusted diluted earnings per share 552 2,382 23.2 522 2,373 22.0
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company b y the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
(‘ESOP’) which for the purpose of this calculation are treated as cancelled. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of sh ares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potentia l 
ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employ ees where both the exercise price is less than the average mark et 
price of the Company’s shares during the year and any related performance conditions have been met.

The Board has reviewed a sensitivity analysis, including the use of prior year discount and growth rates, and does not consider  
that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations would cause the carrying amounts  
of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts. The key assu mptions used for value-in-use calculations are set out below. 
Assumptions 
• The cash flow projections are based on approved financial budgets and strategic plans covering a three year period. These are 
based on both past performance and expe ctations for future market development. 
• Key drivers in the plans are like-for-like (‘LFL’) sales, margin and operating profit percentage. LFL sales projections take in to 
consideration both external factors such as market expe ctations, and internal factors such as trading plans. 
• Cash flows beyond this three year period are calculated using a gr owth rate which does not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for retail businesses operating in the same countries as the CGUs. 
• The weighted average cost of capital, used to discount future cash flows, is calcu lated using a combination of the cost of debt , 
leases and equity, weighted according to an estimate of the CG U’s capital gearing. A risk adjustment is also made for the count ry  
in which the CGU operates. 
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates and long-term growth rates used are as follows:

In 2013/14 Kingfisher acquired Bricostore in Romania and announced its intention to pilot four Scre wfix outlets in Germany in  
2014. At the same time Kingfisher undertook a review of its strategic investment in Ho rnbach, which has operations in both of these 
markets. On 31 January 2014 the Group decided to divest its equity stake in Hornbach and also waive its right to appoint direct ors 
to the Hornbach board.  
Following this decision, the Group concluded it had lost the ability to exercise significant influence over the Hornbach busine sses, 
despite maintaining a 21% equity interest at the balance sheet date. This conclusion was reached based on the Group ceasing to 
participate in the significant financial and operating policy decisions made by Ho rnbach. On 31 January 2014 the Group’s investment 
was written down to its fair value of £198m, resulting in an excep tional impairment loss of £45m being recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. The impairment loss is included within the Gr oup’s share of post-tax results, however this excludes an except ional 
transfer from reserves of cumulative foreign ex change gains since transition to IFRS of £31m.  
The Hornbach investment and retail profit contribution is incl uded in the Other International reporting segment. In 2013/14 the Group 
recorded a £14m pre-exceptional profit in re lation to its share of Hornbach’s post-tax results, comprising £26m of retail profi t less 
£12m share of interest and tax. 
Due to active marketing of the shares at the balance sheet date, the investment was reclassified as an asset held for sale – re fer  
to note 34. Following the end of the 2013/14 financial year, on 24 March 2014 Kingfisher agreed to sell all the shares it holds in 
Hornbach Holding AG and Hornbach-Baumarkt AG which together formed its 21.2% stak e in Hornbach for approximately £195m. 
No goodwill is included in the carrying amount of invest ments in joint ventures and associates (2012/13: £nil).

Bank overdrafts and loans 
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. Current bank loans mature within the next 12 months. Both are arranged at floating rat es 
of interest. 
Non-current bank loans have an average maturity of three years (2012/13: three years) and are arranged at fixed rates of interest  
with an effective interest rate of 2.8% (2012/13: 3.8%). 
At the year end, there were no drawn amounts under Chinese Renm inbi committed facilities and therefore a nil effective borrowin g 
rate (2012/13: 6.2%). These facilities are unsecured (2012/13: assets worth RMB 1.6 billion (£163m) secured a bank facility in 
China, which matured in 2013). 
Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt 
Medium Term Notes (‘MTNs’) were issued in prior years under the Group’s €2,500m MTN programme and further notes issued as a

(2) Swapped to floating rate Euro based on 3 month EURIBO R plus a margin using a cross-currency interest rate swap. 
The Group values its MTNs and USPP on an amortised cost basis, adjusted for fair value gains and losses (based on observable 
market inputs) attributable to the risk being hedged in designated and effective fair value hedge relationships.  
The carrying amounts of the MTNs and USPP have been impacted both by exch ange rate movements and fair value adjustments  
for interest rate risk. At 1 February 2014, the cumulative effect of interest rate fa ir value adjustments is to increase the Group’s MTNs 
and USPP carrying amounts by £ 25m (2012/13: £38m increase).  
The USPP contains a covenant requiring th at, as at the end of each semi-annual and annual financial reporting period, the ratio of 
operating profit to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 mont h period. 
The Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 1 February 2014.  
Finance leases 
The Group leases certain of its buildings and fixtures and equi pment under finance leases. The average lease term maturity for 
buildings is seven years (2012/13: seven ye ars) and for fixtures and equipment is two years (2012/13: two years). Certain build ing 
leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.

Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair values of borrowings. Where market values are not available  
or are not reliable, fair values have been calculated by discou nting cash flows at prevailing interest and foreign exchange rat es.  
This has resulted in a mix of Level 1 and Level 2 inputs as defi ned by IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurements’ being used to value th e 
borrowings of the Group.

The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows arising from the instruments and adjusted for credit risk. Thes e fair 
value measurements are all made using observable market rates of interest, foreign exchange and credit risk.  
All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considere d to have fair values determined by level 2 inputs as defined by the fair 
value hierarchy of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements nor have there been an y 
transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.

Fair value hedges comprise interest rate sw ap contracts that convert fixed rate debt issued under the Group’s Medium Term Note 
programme and the US Private Placement to floating rate liabilitie s, along with certain cross-currency swaps. At 1 February 2014 the 
Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £307m (2012/13: £261m). During the y ear, cross-currency interest rate swaps have 
expired to coincide with repayments of unde rlying debt. The Sterling equivalent amount of those expired swaps (at year end exch ange 
rates) was £31m. 
Cash flow hedges 
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases. At 1 February 2014 the Sterling 
equivalent amount of such contracts is £419m (2012/13: £441m). The associated fair valu e gains and losses will be transferred t o 
inventories when the purchases occur during the next 12 months . Losses of £9m (2012/13: £8m gain s) have been transferred to 
inventories for contracts which matured during the year. 
Net investment hedges 
Cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge currency exposures of overseas investments. At 1 February 2014 the Sterling equivalent 
amount of such contracts is £nil (2012/13: £90m).  
Non-designated hedges 
The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge against fluctuations in the income statement arising from bal ance 
sheet positions. At 1 February 2014 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £813m (2012/13: £1,062m). These have no t 
been accounted for as hedges, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslatio n of 
the balance sheet positions. These include short-term foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for embedded de rivatives and none of these contracts has any embedded derivati ves 
which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore the Group is not required to account for these separately. 
Kingfisher enters into netting agreements with counterparties to manage the credit and settlement risks associated with over-th e-
counter derivatives. These netting agreements and similar arrang ements generally enable the Group and its counterparties to  
settle cashflows on a net basis and set-off liabilities against av ailable assets in the event that either party is unable to fu lfill its 
contractual obligations.

24 Financial risk management 
Kingfisher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for managing cert ain financial risks to which the Group is exposed.  
The Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments req uired  
to manage these risks. Kingfisher’s treasury function is not run as a profit centre and does not enter into any transactions fo r 
speculative purposes. 
In the normal course of business the Group uses financial instruments including derivatives. The main types of financial instru ments 
used are Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt, bank loans and deposits, money market funds, interest rate swaps, 
commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts. 
Interest rate risk 
Borrowings arranged at floating rates of interest expose the Grou p to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at f ixed  
rates of interest expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain 
interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Group’s underlyi ng debt instruments, principally the 
Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt. 
Currency risk 
The Group’s principal currency exposures are to the Euro, US Dollar and Polish Zlot y. The Euro and Polish Zloty exposures are 
operational and arise through the ownership of retail businesses in France, Spain, Ireland and Poland. In particular, the Group 
generates a substantial part of its profit from the Eurozone, and as such is exposed to the economic uncertainty of its member  
states. The Group continues to monitor potential exposures an d risks, and consider effective risk management solutions. 
Balance sheet Euro translation exposure is currently hedged by ma intaining a proportion of the Group’s debt in Euro. It is the Group’s 
policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings into Sterling. In addition, the Group has significant transactional ex posure 
arising on the purchase of inventories deno minated in US Dollars, which it hedges usin g forward foreign exchange contracts. Under 
Group policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed inventory purchases and a proportion of forecast inventory 
purchases arising in the next 12 months, a nd this is monitored on an ongoing basis. 
Kingfisher’s policy is to manage the interest rate and currency profile of its issued debt using derivative contracts. The effe ct of these 
contracts on the Group’s net debt/cash is as follows:

Financial instruments principally affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the significant market risks impacting Kingfisher, 
are borrowings, deposits and derivatives. The following analysis illust rates the sensitivity of net finance costs (reflecting the impact on 
profit) and derivative cash flow hedges (reflecting the impact on other comprehensive income) to changes in interest rates and foreign

The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash flow he dges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dolla rs 
used to hedge forecast US Dollar purchases of inventories. The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity un til  
the purchases occur. See note 23 for further details. The retranslation of foreign currency borrowings and derivatives designat ed as 
hedges of net investments in foreign operations is reported in equity and offset by the retranslation of the hedged net investments. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payable s 
and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are befo re the effect of tax. It has been prepared on the basis that the 
Group’s debt, hedging activities, hedge accounting designations, and foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contrac ts 
remain constant, reflecting the positions at 1 February 2014 and 2 February 2013 respectively. As a consequence, the analysis 
relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended. In preparing the sensitiv ity  
analysis it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective. 
The effects shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in interest rates and foreign  
exchange rates.    www.kingfisher.com

24 Financial risk management continued 
Liquidity risk 
The Group regularly reviews the level of ca sh and debt facilities required to fund its activities. This involves preparing a pr udent cash 
flow forecast for the next three years, determining the level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning for repayments  
of debt at its maturity and identifying an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected outflows.  
The following table analyses the Group’s non-derivative financ ial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant maturity 
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. It excludes trade and other 
payables due to the low associated liquidity risk. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flo ws 
(including interest) and as such may differ from the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

At 1 February 2014 the Group has an undr awn revolving committed facility of £200m which matures in August 2016. The  
£200m facility contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each annual and semi-annual financial reporting period, the  
ratio of operating profit to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the precedin g  
12 month period. The Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 1 February 2014. 
Credit risk 
The Group deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with the st rongest short-term credit ratings and with money market funds 
which have AAA credit ratings and offer same day liquidity. A credit limit for each co unterparty is agreed by the Board coverin g the 
full value of deposits and the fair value of derivative contracts . The credit risk is reduced further by spreading the investments and 
derivative contracts across several counterparties. At 1 February 2014, the highest to tal cash investment with a single counter party 
was £50m (2012/13: £39m). 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash at bank and short-term deposits and the fair 
value of derivative assets. 
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts as the Group has a lo w 
concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables. Co ncentration of risk is limited as a result of low individual ba lances with 
short maturity spread across a large number of unrelated customers. 
At 1 February 2014, trade and other rece ivables that are past due but not provid ed against amount to £50m (2012/13: £41m), 
of which £4m (2012/13: £3m) ar e over 120 days past due.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £221m (2012/13: £243m) available for offset against future profit s.  
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £22m (2012 /13: £24m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of the remaining £199m (2012/13: £219m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. Included in 
unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China of £181m (2012/13: £187m) which can be carried forward only in the next 
one to five years.  
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary diff erences of £3,331m (2012/13: £2,980m) relating to the unremitted earnings 
of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. This is because the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group and therefore no tax 
is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

Within the onerous property contracts provisions, Kingfisher has provided against future liabilities for properties sublet at a shortfall 
and long-term idle properties, along with properties acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries at above-market rents. Such provisions 
exclude those related to restructuring programmes which are included in the restructuring provisions. The provisions are based on 
the present value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges. 
Restructuring provisions include the estimated costs of the UK, Ireland and China restructuring programmes. The provisions have 
been discounted to reflect the time value of money and the risks associated with the specific liabilities. 
The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows related to the above provisions are largely dependent on exiting the property lease 
contracts and subletting surplus space.    www.kingfisher.com

27 Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates a variety of post-e mployment benefit arrangements covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit 
schemes and defined contribution schemes. The most significant defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are in the  
UK. The principal overseas defined benefit schemes are in France, where they are mainly retirement indemnity in nature, and  
the principal overseas defined contribution scheme is in China. The overseas schemes are not material in relation to the Group 
as a whole. 
Defined contribution schemes 
Costs for the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes, at ra tes specified in the individual schemes’ rules, are as follows : 
£ millions  2013/14 2012/13
Charge to operating profit 27 17
From July 2012 an enhanced defined contribution pension scheme was offered to all UK employees. Eligible UK employees have 
been automatically enrolled into the scheme from 31 March 2013. 
Defined benefit schemes 
The Group’s principal defined benefit arrang ement is its funded, final salary pension scheme in the UK. This scheme was closed  
to new entrants from April 2004 and was closed to future benefit accrual from July 2012. 
The scheme operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustee on behalf of members in accordance with  
the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The Trustee Board consists of te n Trustee directors, made up of  
five employer appointed directors, one independent director and four member nominated director s. The Trustee Board delegates 
day-to-day administration of the scheme to the Group Pensions Department of Kingfisher plc.  
The main risk to the Group is that additi onal contributions are required if investment returns and demographic experience is wo rse 
than expected. The scheme therefore exposes the Group to actuar ial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk ,  
interest rate risk and market (investment) risk. The Trustee Board regularly reviews such risks and mitigating controls, with a risk 
register being formally approved on an annual basis. The assets of the scheme are held separate ly from the Group and the Truste e’s 
investment strategy includes a planned medium-term de-risking of assets, switching from return -seeking to liability-matching assets. 
Other de-risking activities have included the scheme acquiring an interest in a property partnership, as set out further below. 
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every th ree years by an independent actuary for the Trustee and the las t full 
valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2013. 
Following this valuation and in accordance with the scheme’s Statement of Funding Prin ciples, the Trustee and Kingfisher have 
agreed annual employer contributions of £36m from April 2014. The contribution schedule has been derived with reference to a 
funding objective that targets a longer-term, low risk funding position in excess of the minimu m statutory funding requirements. This 
longer-term objective is based on the principle of the scheme re aching a point where it can provide benefits to members with a high 
level of security, thereby limiting its reliance on the employer for future support. The Company monitors the scheme funding level on 
a regular basis and will review with the sc heme Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule 
currently in place. 
The Trust Deed provides Kingfisher with an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets assuming the full settlement of pl an 
liabilities in the event of a plan wind-up. 
UK scheme interest in property partnership 
In 2010/11, the Group established a partnership, Kingfisher Scotti sh Limited Partnership (‘Kingfisher SLP’), as part of an arra ngement 
with the UK scheme Trustee to address an element of the scheme deficit and provide greater security to the Trustee. The partner ship 
interests are held by the Group and by the scheme, the latter resulting from investments of £78m and £106m made by the Trustee  
in January and June 2011 respectively. These investments followed Group contributions of the same amounts into the scheme.  
In accordance with IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’, the investments he ld by the scheme in Kingfisher SLP do not represent plan  
assets for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly the reported pension position does not  
reflect these investments.  
UK property assets with market values of £83m and £119m were transferred, in Ja nuary 2011 and June 2011 respectively, into  
the partnership and leased back to B&Q plc. The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to subst itute 
alternative properties. The Trustee has a fi rst charge over the properties in the even t that Kingfisher plc becomes insolvent. The 
scheme’s partnership interest entitles it to the majority of the income of the partnership over the 20 year period of the arran gement. 
The payments to the scheme by Kingfisher SLP over this term are reflected as Group pension contributions on a cash basis. At th e 
end of this term, Kingfisher plc has the option to acquire the Trustee’s partnership interest in Kingfisher SLP. 
The Group has control over the partnership and therefore it is consolidated in these Group financial statements. Accordingly, 
advantage has been taken of the exemptions provided by Regulation 7 of the Partne rships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 from the 
requirements for preparation, delivery and publication of the partnership’s accounts.   Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14

The estimated amount of total contributions to be paid to the UK and overseas pension schemes by the Group during the next 
financial year is £36m. 
Principal actuarial valuation assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are set by the 
Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions a t  
the time and changes in these as sumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated obligations, as illustrated in the 
sensitivity analysis. 
The UK scheme discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for  
the difference in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities.

For the UK scheme, the mortality assumptions used in the actuaria l valuations have been selected with regard to the characteris tics 
and experience of the membership of the scheme from 2010 to 2013. The base mortality assumptions have been derived by 
adjusting standard mortality tables (SAPS tables) projected forward to 2013 using the ‘CMI 2013’ core projection improvement 
factors, as published by the UK actuarial profession. In addition , allowance has been made for fu ture increases in life expectancy. 
The allowance is in line with CMI 2013 improvements subject to a long-term rate of 1.25% pa for males and 1.0% pa for females. 
These improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends.   Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14

Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now)   
– Male 86.7 86.7 86.4

Age to which future pensioners are expected to live (60 in 15 years’ time)   
– Male 87.4 87.4 87.1
– Female 88.6 89.0 88.7
The following sensitivity analysis for the UK scheme shows the es timated impact on the obligation resulting from changes to key 
actuarial assumptions, whilst holding all other assumptions constant. 
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by £43m
Price inflation Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £38m
Rate of pension increases Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £38m
Mortality Increase in life expectancy by one year Increase by £68m
Due to the asset-liability matching investment strategy, the abov e impacts on the obligations of changes in discount rate and p rice 
inflation would be significantly offset by movements in the fair value of the scheme assets.

Information on the share schemes is given in note 14 of the Company’s separate financial statements. 
Options have been exercised on a regular basis throughout the ye ar. On that basis, the weighted average share price during the year, 
rather than at the date of exercise, is £3.53 (2012/13: £2.81). The options outstanding at the end of the year have exercise pr ices 
ranging from £nil to £3.15 and a weig hted average remaining contractual life of 2.9 years (2012/13: 3.1 years). 
The Group recognised a total expense of £7m in the year ended 1 February 2014 (2012/13: £9m) relating to equity-settled share-

(1) The Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme includes the Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’) element of the KISS awards. Details o f the CSOP element of the award are set 
out in the Director’s Remuneration Report. 
(2) Expected life is disclosed based on the UK schemes. For the KISS and PSP schemes in the UK, the expiry date is 7 years from the date of grant. Expiry of overseas KISS 
schemes and CSOP is 6 months from the date of vesting. Expiry of overseas PSP schemes is 1 year from the date of vesting. 
(3) Expected volatility was determined for each individual award, by calculating the historical vo latility of the Group’s share price (plus reinvested dividends) immediately prior 
to the grant of the award, over the same period as the vesting pe riod of each award, adjusted by expectations of future volatil ity.  
(4) The fair values of UK and International Sharesave awards granted on or before 1 January 2009 have been restated to reflect the 17 January 2008 amendment to IFRS 2 
on vesting conditions and cancellations.

On 31 May 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the Bricostore Romania companies from Group Bresson, a 
French retail company. Consideration of £51m comprised £35m cash and a further £16m non-cash element, representing the 
obligation to assume a liability of the vendor. 
Goodwill of £18m has been recogn ised on provisional net assets of £33m, repres enting a strategic premium to strengthen the 
Group’s position in Eastern Europe and anticipated synergies that will arise from the acquisition.

Owing to local conditions, Bricostore Romania prepares its financial statements to 31 December. In the period from 31 May 2013 to 
31 December 2013, it contributed sales of £72m and a retail profit of £1m. If the acqui sition had occurred at the start of the financial 
year, the Group’s sales would have been £11,163m and Group operat ing profit, after exceptional items, would have been £734m for 
the year ended 1 February 2014.

Assets held for sale include the Group’s investment in Hornbach of £198m, which wa s subsequently agreed to be sold on  
24 March 2014 for approximately £195m (see note 17). It also includes a UK freeho ld property asset of £10m, which was 
subsequently sold on 4 February 2014 for £32m. 
The investment in Hornbach is measured based on the 31 Janua ry 2014 market price of the shares of Hornbach Holding AG and 
Hornbach-Baumarkt AG which are listed on the German Stock Exchange, along with the sale price agreed after the balance sheet 
date for the unlisted shares in Hornbach Holding AG.

Notes to the Company financial statements  
 www.kingfisher.com 
121 
1 Principal accounting policies 
The financial statements of Kingfisher plc (‘the Company’)  
are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January each year. 
The directors of Kingfisher plc, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the 
Company to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year 
ended 1 February 2014. Refer to the Directors’ statement of 
responsibility on page 71. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the use of valuations for certain 
financial instruments, share-based payments and pensions,  
and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company’s financial statements are included in the 
consolidated financial statements of Kingfisher plc. As permitted 
by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss 
account and statement of total recognised gains and losses are 
not presented. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms 
of FRS 1, ‘Cash flow statements’. The Company is exempt under 
the terms of FRS 8, ‘Related party disclosures’, from disclosing 
related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries of 
Kingfisher plc. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption to provide financial instrument disclosures under  
the terms of FRS 29, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation  
of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated. 
a. Foreign currencies 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary items  
are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Principal rate of exchange against Sterling: 
Euro  2013/14 2012/13
Year end rate 1.22 1.15
b. Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are carried in the balance sheet at  
cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for 
impairment. Depreciation is provided to reflect a straight line 
reduction from cost to estimated residual value over the 
estimated useful life of the asset as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings – between 4 and 20 years
Computers and electronic equipment – between 3 and 5 years 
Motor cars – 4 years 
Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is 
conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference  
to the higher of value-in-use and net realisable value. Any 
impairment in value is charged to the profit and loss account  
in the period in which it occurs. 
c. Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are included in the 
balance sheet at cost, less any provisions for impairment. 
d. Operating leases 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit  
and loss account in the period to which the payments relate. 
Incentives received or paid to enter into lease agreements are 
released to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis 
over the lease term or, if shorter, the period to the date on  
which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing 
market rate. 
e. Employee benefits 
(i) Pensions 
The Company operates defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension schemes for its employees. A defined benefit scheme  
is a pension scheme that defi nes an amount of pension  
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. A defined 
contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the 
Company usually pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
In all cases a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the 
accruing liabilities. The assets of each of these funds are either 
held under trusts or managed by insurance companies and  
are entirely separate from the Company’s assets. 
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect  
of defined benefit pension schemes is the fair value of scheme 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at 
the balance sheet date, together with an adjustment for any past 
service costs not yet recognised. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
A net pension asset is only recognised to the extent that it is 
recoverable either through reduced future contributions or 
through agreed refunds from the scheme. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged 
directly to the profit and loss reserve as they arise. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit  
and loss account, unless the changes to the pension scheme  
are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a 
specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the  
past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period. 
For defined contribution schemes, the Company has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.  
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit 
expense when they are due.  
(ii) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates several equity-settled, share-based 
compensation schemes for the employees of the Company  
and its subsidiaries using the Company’s equity instruments.

The fair value of the Company’s employees’ services received  
in exchange for the grant of options or deferred shares is 
recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes 
and stochastic models. The total amount to be expensed over 
the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of 
the options or deferred shares granted, excluding the impact of 
any non-market vesting conditions. The value of the charge is 
adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting 
due to non-market vesting conditions. 
The fair value of the compensation given to subsidiaries in 
respect of share-based compensation schemes is recognised  
as a capital contribution over the vesting period. The capital 
contribution is reduced by any payments received from 
subsidiaries in respect of these schemes. 
(iii) Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) 
The ESOP is a separately administered discretionary trust. 
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaran teed by the Company and the 
assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.  
Own shares held by the ESOP are deducted from equity 
shareholders’ funds and the shares are held at historical cost 
until they are sold. The assets, liabilities, income and costs  
of the ESOP are included in both the Company’s and the 
consolidated financial statements. 
f. Deferred tax 
Provision is made for deferred tax using the incremental 
provision approach and is measured on an undiscounted  
basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods  
in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and  
laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences  
that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet  
date subject to the following: 
• deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-
monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale 
agreement exists at the balance sheet date. Where rollover 
relief is available on an asset, deferred tax is not recognised;  
• deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries and associates only where dividends are accrued 
as receivable or there is an intention to remit these in the 
foreseeable future; 
• deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are 
regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable 
when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted; and 
• deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences. 
g. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present  
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it  
is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount can be  
reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses.  
h. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the financial asset expire or the Company has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial 
liabilities (or a part of a financ ial liability) are derecognised  
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged  
or cancelled or expires. 
(i) Borrowings 
Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. Where borrowings are in designated and effective 
fair value hedge relationships, adjustments are made to their 
carrying amounts to reflect the hedged risks. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are amortised to the profit and loss account 
using the effective interest method. 
(ii) Trade creditors 
Trade creditors are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
(iii) Derivatives and hedge accounting 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to which 
it is not effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives are 
recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise. 
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and subsequently carried at 
fair value. The accounting treatment of derivatives classified as 
hedges depends on their designation, which occurs at the start 
of the hedge relationship. The Company designates certain 
derivatives as a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability  
(‘fair value hedge’). 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, 
the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable 
to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry being 
recorded in the profit and loss account. Gains or losses from 
remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument are also 
recognised in the profit and loss account. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company 
documents in advance the relationship between the item  
being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Company  
also documents and demonstrates an assessment of the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument, which shows that the hedge has been and will be 
highly effective on an ongoing basis. The effectiveness testing  
is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge 
remains highly effective. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their  
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of  
host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair  
value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the profit  
and loss account.

9 Net pension asset 
The Company participates in both a funded defined be nefit scheme and a funded defined contribution scheme. 
Defined contribution scheme 
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme, at rates specified in the scheme’s rules, are as follows: 
£ millions  2013/14 2012/13
Charge to operating profit 2 2
From July 2012 an enhanced defined contribution scheme ha s been offered to all Company employees. Eligible Company 
employees have been automatically enrolled into the defined contribution scheme from 31 March 2013. 
Defined benefit scheme 
Kingfisher plc is one of a number of Group companies that part icipate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, and therefore the  
Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities. The valuation of the scheme has been based on the  
most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2013 and has been updated to 1 February 2014. 
In the prior year the UK final salary pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual with effect from July 2012. The closu re to 
future accrual resulted in an exceptional non-cash curtailment gain of £1m, representing the one-off reduction in accounting li abilities 
as benefits are no longer linked to future salary increases other than in line with inflation. Furthermore, it resulted in a fu ll provision 
against the net surplus being recognised at the curtailment date . This exceptional non-cash asset restriction loss of £6m refle cted the 
requirements under UK accounting standards, which restrict the am ount of surplus that can be recognised following the closure t o 
future accrual of benefits. 
In 2010/11 and 2011/12 the Company entered into two phases of a property partnership arrangement with the scheme Trustee  
to address an element of the scheme deficit. Further details on this arrangement are given in note 27 of the consolidated finan cial 
statements. The reported pension position, before provision for asset restriction, reflects the Company’s share of the resultin g  
scheme asset.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligation of the defined benefit pension scheme are set by the Directors aft er 
consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and 
changes in these assumptions can lead to sign ificant movements in the estimated obligation. 
The discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the diffe rence  
in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities. The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets reflects market expectations at  
the valuation date of long-term asset returns and the mix of assets in the scheme.

Overall expected rate of return 4.7 4.7
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics and experience  
of the membership of the scheme from 2010 to 2013. The base mortality assumpti ons have been derived by adjusting standard 
mortality tables (SAPS tables) projected forward to 2013 using the ‘CMI 2013’ core pr ojection improvement factors, as published  
by the UK actuarial profession. In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy. The allowance is in 
line with CMI 2013 improvements subject to a long-term rate of 1.25% pa for males and 1.0% pa for females. These improvements 
take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends. 
The assumptions for life expectancy of the scheme members are as follows:

The Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme (‘KISS’) and Performance Share Plan are described as part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 47 to 68.  
Restricted Awards are granted as one-off compensatory awards granted under the rule s of the KISS. They are granted as nil  
cost options, as with the KISS, but do not accrue dividends until after they are exercised. Vesting dates may vary according to 
individual grants. 
Certain employees, excluding directors, have been granted contingent share awards unde r the Kingfisher Retention Share Scheme. 
The last awards granted under this scheme vested in 2012. These awards do not accrue dividends during the vesting period.  
The Store Management Incentive Share Scheme provided awards to store managers in 2009 with vesting dates of April 2011 and 
April 2012. There were performance conditions based on store standards and awards lapsed if not maintained throughout the 
performance period. These awards do not ac crue dividends during the vesting period. 
Under the UK Sharesave scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into HMRC approved savings contracts for a 
period of three or five years, whereby sh ares may be acquired with savings under the contract. The option price is the average market 
price over three days shortly before the invitation to subscrib e, discounted by 20%. Options are exercisable within a six month period 
from the conclusion of a three or five year period. The Irish and International Sharesave plans, which operate along similar li nes to the 
UK Sharesave scheme, include eligible employees in Ireland and certain overseas locations. 
The last grant of options under the Executive , International Executive and Phantom Share Option Scheme were in April 2003. Under 
these schemes, participants received a bi -annual grant of options based on their posi tion in the Group. These options are norma lly 
exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the gran t (up to the tenth anniversary), except where the performance conditions 
have not been met. The performance conditions for all options ha ve now been met. On the exercise of Phantom Share Options, 
participants receive in cash the increase in value of the all ocated number of shares in the Company. All options granted under these 
schemes have either now been exercised or have lapsed.  
The rules of all schemes include provision for the ear ly exercise of options in certain circumstances.    www.kingfisher.com

is calculated by comparing 52 w eeks against the equivalent 52 weeks of the prior year. This only impacts the UK & Ireland busin esses with all of the other businesses 
reporting on a calendar basis. The effect of the 53rd week on the results of the Group in 2012/13 was the inclusion of an addit ional £72m sales and an immaterial  
benefit to retail profit.

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams)  
Kingfisher plc is legally obliged to make its share register 
available to the general public. Consequently some shareholders 
may receive unsolicited mail, including correspondence from 
unauthorised investment companies. We are aware that  
some shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are 
typically from overseas based brokers who target UK 
shareholders offering to sell what often turn out to be worthless  
or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are advised  
to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at 
a discount or offers of free company reports. Details of any share 
dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in 
Company mailings.

Forward-looking statements  
Certain statements included in this Annual Report and Accounts 
are forward-looking and should be considered, amongst other 
statutory provisions, in light of the safe harbour provisions of the 
United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  
All statements other than historical facts may be forward-looking 
statements. Such statements are therefore subject to risks, 
assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results  
to differ materially from those expressed or implied because  
they relate to future events. These forward-looking statements 
include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the 
Company’s expectations around the Company’s programme 
known as Creating the Leader and its associated eight steps.  
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of 
relevant terminology including the words: ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, 
‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘goal’, ‘target’, ‘aim’, 
‘may’, ‘will’, ‘would’, ‘could’ or ‘should’ or, in each case, their 
negative or other variations or comparable terminology and 
include all matters that are not hist orical facts. They appear in a 
number of places throughout this Annual Report and Accounts 
and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or 
current expectations and those of our officers, directors and 
employees concerning, amongst other things, our results of 
operations, financial condition, changes in tax rates, liquidity, 
prospects, growth, strategies and the businesses we operate.  
Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
from those estimated by the forward-looking statements include, 
but are not limited to, global economic business conditions, 
monetary and interest rate policies, foreign currency exchange 
rates, equity and property prices, the impact of competition, 
inflation and deflation, changes to regulations, taxes and 
legislation, changes to consumer saving and spending habits; 
and our success in managing these factors.  
Consequently, our actual future financial condition, performance 
and results could differ materially from the plans, goals and 
expectations set out in our forward-looking statements. Reliance 
should not be placed on any forward-looking statement.  
The forward-looking statements contained herein speak  
only as of the date of this Annual Report and the Company 
undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking 
statement, whether as a result of new information, future events 
or otherwise.   Kingfisher is included in two socially responsible indices, the 
FTSE4Good and Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. We also 
achieved Business in the Community’s Corporate Responsibility 
Index Platinum Big Tick in the 2013 survey.

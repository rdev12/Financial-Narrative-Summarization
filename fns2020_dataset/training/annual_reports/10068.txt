The Melrose strategy
The Melrose strategy is to acquire good manufacturing businesses underperforming their 
potential, improve them by a mixture of investment, operational improvements and changed 
management focus, then commercially choose the right time to sell, often within a 3 to 5 
year time frame but this is flexible. The value from significant disposals is then returned to 
shareholders.
Whilst we are ready for the next acquisition, we will be patient to ensure it is the right one.

Strategy in action 
ACqUISITION OF FKI
Substantial potential being realised
On 1 July 2008 Melrose completed the acquisition of FKI plc for a 
total consideration, including debt, of just under £1 billion. FKI was a 
major international diversified engineering group with four divisions, 
including some businesses with very good market positions. 
However, FKI had a weak Balance Sheet and borrowings due to 
be refinanced in the near term. The financing terms of Melrose’s 
acquisition enabled the Balance Sheet issues to be resolved and a 
more appropriate Group borrowing structure with lower overall debt 
leverage and a maturity date of 2013. 
In addition to addressing the pressing financial constraints facing 
FKI, Melrose identified a number of opportunities to improve the 
performance of FKI’ s businesses, principally through an increased 
focus on cash generation and profitability. Melrose will continue to 
seek to invest in existing facilities and new capacity, as well as consider 
acquisitions and organic growth into new markets, where appropriate.
DYNACAST
Buy, Improve, Sell
Dynacast was acquired in May 2005 alongside McKechnie. During 
the six years of ownership, as a result of the improvement in its 
performance Melrose quadrupled the shareholders’ investment 
in Dynacast, selling the business for an enterprise value of £377 
million in July 2011. Consistent with Melrose’s strategy, following the 
disposal approximately £373 million was returned to shareholders.
The sale of Dynacast means that nearly £1 billion in cash was 
generated from the original £429 million McKechnie and Dynacast 
acquisition. Melrose successfully steered Dynacast through the 
global slowdown, and cost savings made during the downturn 
were retained as sales recovered. Melrose invested fully in Dynacast 
to expand capacity, particulary in the Far East, and to improve 
efficiency.
Dynacast also succesfully completed some bolt on acquisitions.
Under Melrose ownership, sales in all three of Dynacast’s main 
geographic regions grew.
MCKECHNIE AEROSPACE
Creating significant value
Melrose acquired McKechnie, along with the Dynacast businesses, 
in May 2005. At acquisition it could see the benefit of the strong 
upturn in the aerospace cycle. Moreover, Melrose saw significant 
scope to improve the operational and financial performance of the 
business and subsequently:
•	 invested in the business to improve its performance and 
manufacturing efficiency; and
•	 supported the business to improve the depth and quality of 
management.
In our two years of ownership revenues grew by 35%, EBITDA 
grew by approximately 75% with margins increasing by 6 
percentage points. On 14 May 2007 McKechnie’s aerospace 
and aftermarket businesses were sold for £428 million in cash, 
generating an IRR of 65% and a profit (including cash generation 
during ownership) of approximately £250 million. In total it is 
estimated that the disposal crystallised an equity value of nearly 2.5 
times.

Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report Melrose’s ninth set of annual results 
since flotation in 2003. In this time Melrose has raised £785 
million in capital for acquisitions and has returned £771 million in 
capital returns and dividends giving a current net investment by 
shareholders of £14 million. After payment of the final dividend 
proposed below, Melrose will have repaid all equity raised. 
At the current share price our market capitalisation means 
that approximately £1.5 billion of value has been created for 
shareholders since 2003. 
RESULTS FOR THE GROUP
These accounts report the results for the Group for the year to  
31 December 2011 and comparatives for the previous year.
Revenue from continuing businesses for the year was £1,153.9 
million (2010: £1,035.4 million) and headline profit before tax 
(before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset 
amortisation) was £161.2 million (2010: £121.7 million). Headline 
diluted earnings per share (‘EPS’) on continuing and discontinued 
businesses were 28.8p (2010: 24.1p). Diluted EPS on continuing 
and discontinued businesses were 59.0p (2010: 27.0p). 
Further details of these results are contained in the Finance 
Director’s review.
DIVIDENDS
The Board intends to pay a final dividend of 8.4p per share (2010: 
7.0p) on 14 May 2012 to those shareholders on the register at  
13 April 2012, subject to approval at the AGM on 9 May 2012. This 
gives a total for the year of 13.0p per share (2010: 11.0p), which 
represents an 18% increase.
We continue to pursue a progressive policy even in years such as 
this where a capital return has been made.
“At the current share price our market 
capitalisation means that approximately 
£1.5 billion of value has been created for 
shareholders since 2003.”

TRADING
2011 saw an excellent performance from our businesses. Headline 
operating profit was up 23% on sales up 11% reflecting another 
year of increased headline operating margins, which are now at 
15.7%. We believe there is more to come from these businesses 
both in profits and margins and, in this context, the most 
encouraging sign was the increase in order intake throughout the 
year, with the fourth quarter being the strongest.
We have now fully entered the investment phase with increased 
capital expenditure across all of our businesses. Nevertheless 
net debt has remained at £290 million, which means that this 
investment has been funded out of operational cash generation. 
We continued to maintain strict controls on working capital and we 
expect this excellent cash generation to continue.
Further details on trading are included in the Chief Executive’s 
review.
BOARD CHANGES
We have announced today a forthcoming change of roles within 
the Melrose Board. Simon Peckham, currently our Chief Operating 
Officer, will take over as Chief Executive from the next Annual 
General Meeting. David Roper, whom he succeeds, will become 
Executive Vice-Chairman. As a founder Director, David has been a 
highly important and fundamental part of Melrose and its success 
since inception in 2003. Equally Simon, also a founder Director, 
has made a huge contribution to our progress and has fully earned 
this appointment. On behalf of shareholders I would like to thank 
them both for their efforts past and future. This is part of a planned 
management succession programme, and all your executive 
Directors remain fully committed and are looking forward to 
continuing Melrose’s development and success. 
We were delighted to welcome Justin Dowley to our Board as a non-
executive Director last September. He has had a distinguished career 
in the City and we look forward to his contribution to Melrose.
STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
The sale of Dynacast in July 2011 for an enterprise value of 
£377 million and the subsequent return of these proceeds to 
shareholders was a further demonstration of our strategy. The first 
and most important part of our strategy of ‘buy, improve, sell’ is, of 
course, making good acquisitions. We continue to look for suitable 
opportunities but, it should go without saying, we will be extremely 
careful in the application of our criteria, which include price. We are 
optimistic that we will identify something which will add further to 
the excellent growth of the Group.
At the interim stage we highlighted the strong end markets which 
most of our businesses serve and the expected return, in due 
course, on our increased investment programmes. Since then 
order books have continued to improve and we feel we are seeing 
early signs of recovery in the USA. Our businesses in the Rest of 
the World continue to perform well. While we are naturally cautious 
about economies in continental Europe, we are encouraged by 
current trading and the outlook for 2012.

“2011 saw an excellent performance from our businesses. Headline 
operating profit was up 23% on sales up 11% reflecting another year of 
increased headline operating margins, which are now at 15.7%. We believe 
there is more to come from these businesses both in profits and margins.”

Chief Executive’s review
I am very pleased with the trading results of the Group in 2011. On 
all measures of performance, whether it be sales and operating 
profit growth, profit margins, cash generation or order intake, the 
result has been very good.
It is gratifying to see the sales growth momentum in the business 
increasing in the second half of the year, reflecting continuing 
market improvements and the benefits of the active programme of 
capital investment, supported by a healthy pipeline of new product 
introductions. 
The Energy division had another excellent year in 2011. Order 
intake in the year was very good and continued to build through the 
period as the benefits of the competitiveness and energy efficiency 
of Brush Turbogenerators’ main product, the gas turbogenerator, 
produced good gains in market share. Significant capital investment 
continues to be made in both Brush’s new build and aftermarket 
facilities in order to increase capacity to meet projected demand 
and to achieve productivity gains. The absorption of Hawker 
Siddeley Switchgear into Brush will produce significant operational 
savings and in addition will result in a more targeted and focused 
sales function, given the customer overlap between Hawker 
Siddeley Switchgear and Brush Transformers. Marelli reported 
healthy increases in sales, orders and operating profit in the year, 
with a greater proportion of higher margin, more specialist business 
feeding through in the second half. The new plant in Malaysia is 
now operational and is an important step in reconfiguring Marelli’s 
manufacturing footprint.
In the Lifting division, Bridon performed creditably in 2011, 
underpinned by good demand in its onshore oil & gas and mining 
markets. In view of the favourable prospects in most of its markets, 
Bridon invested heavily in 2011, with capital expenditure of 
“On all measures of performance, 
whether it be sales and operating 
profit growth, profit margins, cash 
generation or order intake, the result 
has been very good.”

approximately £13 million (2.8 times depreciation). This, together 
with a strong commitment to new product development, is a key 
part of Bridon’s strategy to be the leading global solutions provider 
for high specification rope applications.
Crosby reported very strong results in 2011, nearly matching its 
record year in 2008, with good demand in its core oil & gas and 
mining markets, supported by its excellent relationships with its 
distributor base. In addition to its investment programme in the 
US to increase capacity and efficiency, Crosby continues to invest 
actively in its European and Chinese operations to enable it to take 
advantage of its market-leading brand name and the promising 
opportunities that have been identified in these markets.
In the Other Industrial division, the trading performance overall was 
satisfactory, reporting increased revenue and operating profit in the 
year. While Truth struggled in the face of challenging conditions in 
its markets, Harris performed well as demand for scrap recycling 
machines recovered in the year. MPC reported a strong trading 
performance as the results of its investment in the highly successful 
Range Rover Evoque programme started to come through.
OUTLOOK
Although conditions in the world economy remain uncertain, albeit 
with some signs of improvement, a large proportion of Melrose 
Group companies’ sales derive from good market positions in the 
global power generation, oil & gas and mining sectors which are 
forecast to remain strong.
The visibility and positive momentum of our order books, supported 
by an aggressive capital investment programme, together with a 
strong pipeline of new products, give us confidence for another 
good year in 2012.

Brush’ s aftermarket business saw sales increase marginally in 2011 
compared to 2010, as end-users sought to conserve cash by 
deferring maintenance expenditure. With aftermarket sales at 29 per 
cent of Brush’ s total revenue in 2011, a major effort is continuing to 
be directed at this business to deliver growth and margin progression, 
and to benefit from the very promising market opportunities that exist 
as a result of the large installed base of turbogenerators.
Transformers saw revenue beginning to recover in the second 
half of 2011 as UK demand for transformers increased, as we 
enter year two of the current five-year OFGEM cycle. There was a 
substantial improvement in order input in 2011, with orders more 
than double that of the previous year.
On the back of the successful integration of Transformers into 
Brush in 2010, HSS was also absorbed into Brush in late 2011. 
The customer overlap and efficiency gains should benefit the 
enlarged Group going forward.
HSS revenue increased by 16 per cent in 2011 compared to 2010. The 
‘Eclipse’ AC switchgear indoor product was the stand-out performer 
in the year, recording a 34 per cent increase, and this product now 
accounts for approximately 50 per cent of HSS’ s sales. Strong growth 
was also experienced in the company’ s Australian operation.
Order intake at HSS increased by 8 per cent over 2010 with almost 
all product lines being ahead of internal forecasts. The exception 
was the High Speed DC ‘Lightning’ product, which is primarily 
used for major projects within the rail industry, which suffered from 
delays in a number of major rail infrastructure projects.
As part of Brush, HSS will not only benefit from sales and 
marketing synergies, but also from the implementation of the Brush 
manufacturing strategy. We expect the latter to positively impact on 
the operating margin in 2012.
Harrington, the specialist small generator manufacturer based in the UK, 
recorded a 30 per cent increase in revenue in 2011 and a 23 per cent 
increase in orders as a result of winning a number of large contracts.
Outlook
Record order intake in 2011 has left Brush in an excellent position 
for 2012.
Turbogenerators and Transformers entered 2012 with 
approximately 70 per cent of their budgeted 2012 new build sales 
covered by orders, whilst HSS has about half.
This positive order momentum, coupled with further operational 
improvements and the continued drive to increase the contribution 
from higher margin aftermarket business, gives us confidence that 
Brush will have another good year in 2012.
BRUSH
Brush Turbogenerators (‘Turbogenerators’) is the world’s largest 
independent manufacturer of electricity generating equipment for the 
power generation, industrial, oil & gas and offshore sectors. From 
its four plants in the UK, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and 
the USA, it designs, manufactures and services turbogenerators, 
principally in the 10 MW to 250 MW range, for both gas and steam 
turbine applications and supplies a globally diverse customer 
base. In addition, Brush designs and manufactures systems and 
power transformers under the brand name Brush Transformers 
(“Transformers”) and also produces a wide range of indoor and 
outdoor medium voltage AC/DC switchgear under the Hawker 
Siddeley Switchgear (‘HSS’) brand name.
Brush performed strongly in 2011, building on the significant progress 
made since acquisition in 2008. Operating profit for the year was 25 
per cent higher than in 2010 on the back of sales which were up by 4 
per cent over the same period. Turbogenerator order intake in 2011 
was substantially higher than in 2010, including the first orders for 
the new large air-cooled product, and the trading performance was 
supported by excellent cash generation during the year.
Turbogenerators’ new build revenue increased marginally in 2011 
over 2010, as the global power generation market continued its 
slow recovery. During the year, Turbogenerators increased its share 
of the market it operates in, particularly in the more efficient and 
environmentally acceptable gas turbine sector, which continues to 
grow at the expense of the coal and nuclear sectors, with the latter 
suffering as a result of the Fukushima incident in Japan.
Turbogenerators’ operating profit in 2011 benefited from the contract 
to supply four 250 MW combined-cooled generators to the nuclear 
power plant at Mochovce in the Slovak Republic. 2011 was the last 
full year of this highly successful multi-year €46 million contract.
The productivity benefits of the substantial capital investment 
programme, which started in the first half of the year, have 
been most encouraging. During the year £15 million of capital 
expenditure was approved. The majority of this relates to capacity 
increases and productivity improvements of the 2-pole generator 
production facilities in Brush in the UK and Czech Republic, the 
benefits of which will continue to flow through 2012 and into 2013.
In order to further the productivity gains in Turbogenerators, a 
restructuring of the manufacturing facility in the Netherlands has 
been announced. The objective is to streamline the operation in 
order to focus exclusively on the manufacture of 4-pole generators. 
This should be completed by mid-2012 and will generate significant 
savings. Melrose PLC

MARELLI MOTORI (‘MARELLI’)
Marelli, based in Italy, is one of the world’ s leading manufacturers of 
industrial generators and electric motors with a product portfolio ranging 
from 0.12 KW to 7.2 MW. With five overseas offices in Germany, UK, 
Malaysia, USA and South Africa, it serves worldwide markets for power 
generation, marine, oil & gas and industrial manufacturing.
Marelli reported healthy increases in revenue, order intake, and 
operating profit in 2011 of 22 per cent, 19 per cent and 15 per cent 
respectively. As reported in the Interim Statement, trading in the 
first half of the year was affected by an adverse sales mix, which, 
as expected, was reversed in the second half as sales of higher 
margin, larger specialist machines recovered. Cash generation and 
control of working capital continued to be well managed.
2011 was a productive year for Marelli in terms of new product 
introductions. A number of new products were successfully 
launched, including a synchronous 400 Hz generator for use in the 
aviation industry, a special generator for use with tidal power and 
new motors to meet European efficiency regulations.
Over £1 million has been invested in the last two years in Marelli’s 
new Malaysian factory to manufacture the smaller, more standard 
generators. This site has been operational since the last quarter 
of 2011 and currently employs around 100 people. Although, 
unsurprisingly, there still remain a few teething issues, relating to 
the finessing of the supply chain and the completion of the training 
programme, it is nevertheless an important step in the rebalancing 
of Marelli’s manufacturing capacity.
Other than the investment in the Malaysian facility, additional capital 
expenditure was made in the year to further improve existing 
manufacturing and testing procedures — these include a new 
notching press for generators, development of CAD systems and 
a large machinery test room. Further capital investment has been 
earmarked for 2012.
Outlook
The trend reported in the Interim Statement of a recovery in Marelli’s 
higher margin marine, oil & gas and hydroelectric business looks 
set to continue. The positive momentum in the order intake gives 
us confidence that 2012 will be another year of progress for Marelli.
Marelli supplied and installed two MJT 630 Series Hydro 
Generators to the City of Agordo, Northern Italy, for use within 
a hydroelectric power plant, located near the River Liera. The 
equipment provides a maximum power of 550 kW and a rated 
speed of 500 rpm. The generators weigh 7.6 tonnes each and 
are able to satisfy the electric power requirements of over 370 
households.

Divisional review
Lifting review continued
The mining market has continued to see solid activity levels with the 
demand for commodities largely unaffected so far by the global financial 
downturn. Orders have improved in most markets for both deep shaft 
and surface mining on the back of stronger demand in Russia, China 
and South Africa, where Bridon is expanding its presence.
The commercial construction markets in Europe and the Middle 
East remained subdued through 2011, although there were some 
tentative signs of improvement in North America. Many industrial 
crane companies remain very cautious and are reluctant to commit 
to orders. Demand for crane ropes has continued to be solid in 
China, but the volatile industrial production levels in Asia have led to 
variable demand for industrial ropes.
Bridon’s strategy is to be the global technology leader for 
demanding rope applications and the leading solutions provider. 
In order to support this strategy, Bridon is investing £20 million in 
building a new factory on Neptune Quay in Newcastle upon Tyne 
to produce the largest ropes in the world. This new factory, which 
will initially employ around 40 people, should be operational by 
December 2012.
In addition, a new technology centre is being built in Doncaster, 
which will provide state of the art laboratory and testing facilities.
Bridon continues to invest in the upgrading of its manufacturing 
facilities. The programme to improve the wire mill in Doncaster 
was substantially completed in the year, which will increase 
manufacturing efficiencies and reduce carbon emissions and 
other environmental waste. The major investment in new capacity 
in the German factory is also complete, significantly improving 
manufacturing capability for complex multi-strand ropes.
As part of its ongoing commitment to innovation, Bridon launched 
eight new products in 2011 and developed some promising 
enhancements to existing products. For the mining market, new 
products include extended and sheathed round balance ropes 
with increased corrosion resistance and flexibility. New products 
for the oil & gas sector include a new ‘Bristar’ rope, which 
provides industry-leading technology for enhanced rope fatigue 
performance, and the ‘Bristar with hyrtel’ system, with greater 
temperature resistance when compared to conventional polymer 
rope structures.
Outlook
The financial issues in the Eurozone have created uncertainty in 
markets, and as a result a number of companies are cautious in 
terms of making financial commitments. In spite of this, Bridon 
expects demand for oil & gas and commodities to remain solid 
in 2012. The high oil price and the continuing requirement for 
commodities to support economic development, particularly in the 
emerging markets, should support activity levels in these sectors.
BRIDON
Bridon designs and manufactures a comprehensive range of lifting 
and stabilising solutions for applications in wire rope, fibre rope, 
steel wire and strand. The company services global customers in 
the oil & gas, mining, industrial, marine and infrastructure sectors.
Bridon’s trading results improved in 2011 compared to 2010, with 
sales and operating profit ahead of the previous year and operating 
margins increased over the second half of 2010. This reflected 
an overall recovery in Bridon’s markets, the exiting of the lower 
margin structures business and operational improvements. Orders 
received in 2011 were approximately 20 per cent higher than in 
2010. Working capital control remained strong with greater than 
100 per cent profit conversion to cash before capital expenditure. 
Although steel prices rose by some 20 per cent in the year, Bridon 
was largely able to pass this on, reflecting the underlying strength 
of the business.
Demand for onshore oil & gas remained solid through the year. In the 
offshore sector, there was some recovery compared to 2010 and this 
continues to build going into 2012. Demand improved in the North 
Sea, Brazil and parts of Asia and Africa, whilst exploration and drilling 
activities in the Gulf of Mexico have continued to be impacted by the 
aftermath of the Horizon oil spill, reflected in the time taken to obtain 
or renew licences and permits. Bridon has established a trading 
company in Brazil to service this important market.
Cross section through Bridon’s new ‘Tiger 24LS Dyform 
Hoist Rope’, a new product that was launched in early 2012 
and will typically be used by deep shaft mining customers 
for hoisting applications. This product offers both heavy duty 
performance and a high level of safety due to the fact that its 
design ensures wires are not allowed to cross inside the rope, 
thus reducing the amount of internal nicking.

Although the outlook for construction and manufacturing in general 
remains uncertain, continued growth in the emerging markets 
should underpin these sectors.
Substantial capital is being invested in Bridon to enable it to 
compete at the highest level in markets with favourable longer 
term growth prospects. With an order book at the start of this year 
approximately 20 per cent higher than a year previously, we are 
confident of a good outcome in the year ahead.
CROSBY
Crosby is a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing 
of lifting fittings, blocks and sheaves to the oil & gas, construction 
and mining industries, serviced primarily through a global network 
of value-added specialty distributors.
Crosby has had an excellent year, continuing its strong recovery 
from the difficult year in 2009. With revenues and operating 
profit up by over 20 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, its 
performance in 2011 was close to its record year in 2008. Whilst 
construction markets in North America and Europe remained slow 
in 2011, oil & gas and mining remained strong worldwide.
During 2011, Crosby continued its focus on supporting and 
working closely with its traditional worldwide distributor base, 
with less dependence on OEMs. Through additional training 
programmes and close support, relationships have broadened and 
deepened and are resulting in Crosby growing its market share with 
these distributors.
2011 saw the completion of several large capital investment 
programmes in Crosby’s main US manufacturing plants, designed 
to both increase production capacity and efficiency. This has 
been linked to an investment programme in Europe to rationalise 
Crosby’s manufacturing base to make it more efficient and at the 
same time to make it less dependent on Crosby US. This will have 
the additional benefit of further freeing up production capacity in 
the US to enable it to meet the increasing demand from emerging 
markets such as China, Brazil and India.
It is expected that the demand for offshore oil & gas will continue 
to grow worldwide for the foreseeable future. In response to this, 
Crosby will continue to invest in large forging hammers and larger 
machining equipment.
The expansion of Crosby’s presence in emerging markets remains 
a high priority. During 2011, considerable investments were made 
in recruiting additional sales and engineering personnel and this 
will remain an area of focus for 2012. Progress was made in 2011 
at Crosby’s crane block and sheave centre in Hangzhou, China, 
to produce sheaves and blocks for the Chinese market and to sell 
additional standard product lines into the Chinese marketplace.
During 2011, one of the key new product introductions developed 
by Crosby was a new tubing clamp, called the ‘McKissick Tubing 
Grab’, which provides a quick, easy and efficient attachment for 
the lifting of tubing to and from the rig floor within ‘well servicing’ 
applications. Although early days, this application has been well 
received in the market place.
Crosby continues to be at the forefront of the development 
of e-application systems to provide customers with real-time 
information relating to the installation and use of Crosby products in 
the field. Building on the increased usage by customers of access 
through the Apple iPad in 2011, Crosby is working on a suite of 
iPad-based and Android-based applications to extend the range 
of services that can be utilised by customers. It is hoped that this 
will be rolled out on a worldwide basis to include internet-based 
certifications through CertPro and Verification Pro systems.
Outlook
Crosby has experienced a very sharp turnaround in its trading 
performance since the low point in 2009, not least because of the 
decisive actions taken by management. Although we do not expect 
the same rate of growth to continue in 2012, the strength of the 
opening order book gives us confidence of further improvement 
this year.
Crosby’s ‘Wide Body’ shackles were used to lift a 1,250 
metric tonne tower into place as part of the eastern span 
replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the 
US, which is scheduled to open in 2013.

Harris performed well in 2011 as demand for scrap recycling 
machines continued to recover from 2010. On the back of the 
healthy increase in orders in 2011 over the previous year, revenue 
increased by 15 per cent, including an encouraging contribution from 
aftermarket sales. Operating profit was 25 per cent higher, assisted 
by continued efforts to improve productivity and contain costs. 
Harris continued to invest in the design and engineering of new 
products. Three new baler and shear products were introduced to 
the market in 2011 that provide variable frequency drive technology 
for ferrous and non-ferrous materials. These new machines boast 
higher throughput than the machines they are replacing, but with 
approximately half the energy consumption, and present a strong 
value proposition.
TRUTH
Truth designs and manufactures a broad product portfolio of operating 
hardware for windows, patio doors and skylights. Truth products 
are sold primarily to OEM facilities throughout North America that 
serve new residential housing, commercial buildings and remodelling 
and replacement segments of the construction market. Primary 
manufacturing facilities are located in Minnesota, USA, and Ontario, 
Canada, with some outsourcing to lower cost countries.
After a strong recovery in 2010, both Truth and its customer 
base expected the momentum to continue into 2011. However, 
unusually harsh winter and spring weather in almost all regions of 
the US and Canada contributed to a slow start in 2011. Optimism 
for a better second half receded as it became evident that the US 
Government tax incentives introduced in 2010 had the effect of 
bringing forward demand into 2010 at the expense of 2011. On top 
of this, consumer confidence remained weak throughout the year.
The overall demand in the markets in which Truth operates 
declined in 2011 over the previous year. However, as a result of a 
concerted focus on new product design and development, Truth 
outperformed, achieving some notable market share gains.
A highlight in 2011 was the success of the award-winning ‘Sentry 
Multi-Point Hinged Patio Door Hardware System’. This product was 
launched in mid-2011 and has been well received in the market. 
It is selling well and is already established as a core product within 
the Truth range.
Control of overheads was an area of major focus during 2011. Not 
only was this necessary to mitigate the impact on profit of the fall in 
sales, but also to help offset some of the effect of not being able to 
fully recover raw material price increases in the year.
Outlook
Truth remains positive about the prospects for 2012. Without the 
distorting effect of the US Government tax incentives in 2010 
and 2011, it is expected that Truth will see a more normalised 
pattern of demand than has been seen in the previous two years. 
Although the general economy in North America is seeing signs of 
recovery, conditions in housing and construction are lagging behind. 
Nevertheless, Truth is confident of continuing to gain market share on 
the back of a healthy pipeline of new product introductions. Truth is an 
inherently high quality, high margin business with a very strong position 
in its market. When the housing and construction markets in North 
America recover, Truth’ s trading performance will bounce back sharply.
HARRIS
Harris is a market leader in the scrap and waste recycling 
industries, operating from two plants in Georgia, USA. The 
Company designs, manufactures and services a full range of 
size reduction equipment solutions for the scrap metal and fibre 
recycling industries.
Truth’s new ‘Sentry Multi-Point Hinged Patio Door Hardware 
System’ combines flexibility with optimal security. The product 
has a 90-degree thumbturn located above the handle, high 
performance adjustable hinges and multiple handle designs.

MCKECHNIE PLASTIC COMPONENTS (‘MPC’)
MPC designs and manufactures engineered plastic injection 
moulded and extruded components and metal pressings for 
sectors including food and beverage packaging, automotive, 
construction and industrial.
MPC has reported strong trading results in 2011, with sales and 
profit up by in excess of 45 per cent and 70 per cent respectively. 
This is largely due to a healthy recovery in the automotive sector, 
where MPC is a supplier on a number of key programmes, such as 
the highly successful Range Rover Evoque.
During the year, MPC continued to focus on investing in its core 
engineering skills aimed at product and tool design, development 
and testing. As a result, it has been able to satisfy customer 
requirements for the supply of technically complex products, such 
as twin shot claddings, wheel arch liners and automated 
multi-assemblies.
Technical differentiation remains at the core of MPC’s value 
proposition, as it seeks to work closely with partner-customers 
such as Jaguar Land Rover, Ford, Marks & Spencer, Makita, 
Diageo and Heineken. MPC was delighted to be given the 
Jaguar Land Rover award for both quality and systems at its two 
manufacturing locations in Yorkshire, UK.
Outlook
MPC is well placed to continue to profit from the demand from 
automotive OEMs to provide cars to key export markets such 
as China, Russia and North America. With a number of exciting 
projects in the pipeline, we are confident of another year of 
progress for MPC.
Harris expanded its presence in Latin America during 2011 to take 
advantage of the rapidly growing recycling industries in that region.
Outlook
Harris expects demand in the recycling industry to remain stable in 
2012, with sales weighted more to the second half of the year, as in 
2011. After a year of significantly higher revenue and profit in 2011, 
we expect a more steady trading result in 2012.

Finance Director’s review
The year to 31 December 2011 included the disposal of the 
Dynacast division along with four smaller businesses previously 
shown in the Other Industrial division; Brush Traction, Logistex UK, 
Madico and Weber Knapp. Taken together, these five businesses 
constituted 25% of both Group revenue and Group headline 
operating profit in 2010. In accordance with IFRS 5 the trading 
results of these businesses have been shown as discontinued in 
both years in these financial statements.
GROUP TRADING RESULTS — CONTINUING OPERATIONS
The continuing operations now include the three remaining trading 
divisions, namely Energy, Lifting and Other Industrial.
To help understand the results of these operations the term 
‘headline’ has been used. This refers to results calculated before 
exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset 
amortisation as this is considered by the Melrose PLC Board to be 
the best measure of performance.
For the year ended 31 December 2011 the Group achieved revenue 
from continuing operations of £1,153.9 million (2010: £1,035.4 
million) representing an 11% increase over 2010. During the second 
six months of 2011 this pace of year on year growth increased to 
14% compared with 9% in the first six months of 2011.
 
Headline operating profit in the year ended 31 December 2011 
was £180.8 million (2010: £147.0 million) which was up by 23% 
on the previous year, a very similar year on year growth rate to that 
achieved in the first six months of 2011. The headline operating 
profit margin (defined as the percentage of headline operating 
profit to revenue) increased from 14.2% in 2010 to 15.7% in 2011. 
Indeed, in the second half of 2011 the headline operating profit 
margin increased to 15.9%. 
After exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset 
amortisation Group operating profit was £117.0 million (2010: £134.0 
million) and Group operating margin was 10.1% (2010: 12.9%).
“Improving businesses by investing

The performance of each of the trading divisions is discussed in 
detail in the Chief Executive’s review.
Central costs comprise £9.2 million (2010: £8.6 million) of Melrose 
PLC corporate costs and an LTIP charge of £6.8 million (2010: 
£6.6 million). The LTIP charge consists of an annual accrual for the 
Melrose 2009 Incentive Scheme of £1.8 million (2010: £1.8 million) 
and an accrual for the divisional management LTIPs of £5.0 million 
(2010: £4.8 million). The divisional management LTIPs are cash 
based incentive schemes for operational management to reward 
improvements in business performance mainly over the period to 
31 December 2014.
FINANCE COSTS AND INCOME
The net finance cost in 2011 was £19.6 million (2010: £25.3 
million).
Net interest on external bank loans, overdrafts and cash balances 
was £15.7 million (2010: £17.9 million), which, for the year ended 
31 December 2011, was largely protected from interest rate 
changes by a number of interest rate swaps which fix the interest 
rate on £380.1 million (comprising US $546.0 million and €33.3 
million), which is 78% of total Group interest-bearing borrowings. 
More detail on these swaps (and the new swap arrangements 
entered into in February 2012, relating to the new banking facility 
drawn down on 31 January 2012) is given in the finance cost risk 
management section of this review. The net interest expense on 
external loans reduced during the year because of lower leverage 
ratios. In 2011 the Group had a blended interest rate of 3.1% 
(2010: 3.4%).
Also included in the net finance cost is a £2.5 million (2010: £2.3 
million) amortisation charge relating to the initial costs of raising the 
£750 million bank facility, a net interest cost on pension liabilities in 
excess of the expected return on their assets of £0.3 million (2010: 
£3.3 million) and a charge for the unwinding of discounts on long 
term provisions of £1.1 million (2010: £1.7 million).
EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
In accordance with IAS 33, two sets of basic and diluted EPS 
numbers are disclosed on the face of the Income Statement, one 
for continuing operations and one that also includes discontinued 
operations. In the year ended 31 December 2011 the diluted EPS 
for continuing operations was 23.7p (2010: 19.8p) and for both 
continuing and discontinued operations was 59.0p (2010: 27.0p).
The Melrose Board believe that headline EPS gives the best 
reflection of performance in the year as it strips out the impact 
of exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset 
amortisation. With the Melrose 2009 Incentive Scheme scheduled 
to crystallise in 2012, it is also considered more appropriate to 
focus on the diluted EPS calculation which recognises the impact 
of the shares that are expected to be issued under the Melrose 
2009 Incentive Scheme. The estimate of the value of this scheme 
as at 31 December 2011, using a Black–Scholes pricing model 
compliant with IFRS 2, was £99.4 million (2010: £70.7 million). 
Using the average share price for the 40 business days up to  
31 December 2011, if paid out in shares, this would result in the 
issue of 30.1 million Ordinary Shares.
Following the disposal of Dynacast and the share consolidation in 
the year, the Directors consider that the best measure of year on 
year growth in headline diluted EPS is shown by comparing the 
diluted EPS calculated using the headline results of continuing 
and discontinued businesses, before the profit on disposal of 
businesses, and the weighted average number of shares for the 
year, being 28.8p, with the headline diluted EPS of the full Group 
for 2010 of 24.1p. This shows a 20% increase. 
ExCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
In the year ended 31 December 2011 the Group incurred 
exceptional costs of £40.1 million (2010: £10.3 million) and did not 
receive any exceptional income (2010: £21.4 million). In addition 
intangible asset amortisation of £23.7 million (2010: £24.1 million) 
was charged. A tax credit on these exceptional costs and intangible 
asset amortisation, of £20.7 million (2010: £6.0 million), and an 
exceptional tax credit of £38.1 million (2010: £23.5 million) has 
been taken in the year. www.melroseplc.net

As disclosed in the 2010 Annual Report and the 2011 Interim 
Statements and now updated in the exceptional costs note 
to these financial statements (note 6) two Bridon companies 
that Melrose acquired as part of the acquisition of FKI plc are 
defendants in respect of product liability litigation. In light of the 
current available information the provision relating to this has been 
increased by £21.0 million to £25.8 million (US $40 million) at 
31 December 2011. This increase in the year has been charged to 
exceptional costs due to its size and nature.
During the second half of 2011 three restructuring programmes 
have been approved which are intended to enhance the operational 
and financial performance of the Group. These restructuring 
programmes include the reorganisation of the Brush facility in the 
Netherlands and the integration of Hawker Siddeley Switchgear into 
Brush Turbogenerators at a total cost of £12.0 million. In addition, 
as part of the large scale investment within the Bridon business, a 
provision for restructuring costs of £3.9 million has been recognised 
in order to relocate certain activities from Doncaster to the new 
Neptune Energy Park facility in Newcastle upon Tyne. 
The Group considered the potential acquisition of Charter 
International plc but, following the emergence of a competitive 
bidder, your Board remained price disciplined and ended the 
process early enough to limit costs incurred to £2.4 million. The 
other acquisition and disposal costs of £0.8 million were primarily 
in respect of the return of capital following the disposal of Dynacast.
In recognition of the exceptional restructuring costs and increase in the 
legal provision booked in the year, a tax credit of £7.6 million has been 
taken and a tax credit of £13.1 million has also been recognised in 
respect of intangible asset amortisation. In addition, during the year, an 
exceptional tax credit of £38.1 million was taken of which £28.6 million 
related to the reduction of tax liabilities in respect of overseas tax audits 
inherited on the acquisition of FKI, reflecting the Company’ s view of the 
most likely outcome of these audits. A further £9.5 million exceptional 
deferred tax credit relates to previously unrecognised tax losses that 
are now considered recoverable.
Overall the net exceptional items and intangible asset amortisation, 
after tax, shows a net expense of £5.0 million.
DISPOSAL OF BUSINESSES 
On 19 July 2011 Melrose completed the disposal of Dynacast to 
KDI Holdings Inc, managed by Kenner & Company, Inc. for an 
enterprise value of £377 million (US $607 million). This comprised 
£366.5 million (US $590 million) in cash received on completion, 
together with Dynacast taking with it £10.5 million (US $17 million) 
of net pension liabilities. The profit on disposal of this business 
in the year was £150.5 million after costs of £12.8 million and 
Dynacast contributed £164.0 million to revenue and £26.4 million to 
headline operating profit in 2011.
Dynacast was an extremely successful investment for Melrose. 
During its six years of ownership the enterprise value of Dynacast 
increased from £197 million to £377 million, and the equity value 
increased by four times. As a result of this and Melrose’s other 
actions nearly £1 billion in cash has been generated from the £429 
million McKechnie and Dynacast acquisition in May 2005.
Four smaller businesses were sold in the year, namely, Brush 
Traction, Logistex UK, Madico and Weber Knapp all of which were 
previously shown within the Other Industrial division. Along with the 
disposal of the businesses, £22 million of gross pension liabilities 
went with the Logistex UK business, and over £100 million of 
parent Company guarantees and bonds were transferred to the 
buyer on the Brush Traction disposal.
The gross proceeds received on the disposal of these businesses 
amounted to £24.0 million, with related costs of £1.8 million, 
realising a profit on disposal of £1.9 million. The businesses 
contributed £13.8 million to revenue and £1.0 million to headline 
operating profit in 2011.
RETURN OF CAPITAL AND NUMBER OF SHARES IN ISSUE
Consistent with the Melrose strategy of returning proceeds to 
shareholders following significant disposals, Melrose announced 
the return of £373.2 million to shareholders on 8 August 2011 
following the sale of Dynacast.
The return was made via a redeemable share scheme which gave 
shareholders the option of receiving a payment either in August 
2011 or April 2012, or a combination of both. A £1.1 million liability 
is included in the 31 December 2011 Balance Sheet to represent 
the outstanding balance on the £373.2 million capital repayment for 
those shareholders who elected to receive payment in April 2012. 
Alongside the capital return, a share consolidation took place which 
reduced the number of Ordinary Shares in issue by a factor of 11 
for 14, or by 21%, from 497.6 million to 391.0 million. 
CASH GENERATION AND MANAGEMENT
Melrose has started a significant period of investment in its key 
businesses with a resulting capital expenditure to depreciation ratio 
of 1.7× for the year. This means that it is appropriate to look at the 
operating cash generated post working capital movement, but pre 
capital expenditure, as a percentage of headline EBITDA (defined as 
headline operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) to  Melrose PLC

Finance Director’s review continued
gauge cash performance in the year. The percentage in 2011 for the 
continuing Group was 89% which was ahead of internal expectations. 
It is also pleasing to note that the pace of profit conversion to cash 
improved in the second half to 102% (first half: 74%).
At 31 December 2011 the percentage of net working capital to 
sales for the Melrose Group was 12.5% compared to 15.4% on 
acquisition of FKI.
The cash generation performance in 2011 is summarised as 
follows:

Foreign exchange and other non-cash
 movements (5.7)
Closing net debt (289.6)
The Balance Sheet leverage (calculated as net debt divided by 
headline operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) was 
1.4x at 31 December 2011 (31 December 2010: 1.3x). The fact that 
this increase in leverage was so small was a result of the strong cash 
management and improved profitability of the continuing Group as 
ordinarily the disposal of Dynacast and other businesses (together 
contributing 25% of Group headline operating profit in 2010) and 
returning all the proceeds to shareholders would have increased 
leverage further.
CAPITAL ExPENDITURE
Improving businesses by investing in capital projects with 
acceptable paybacks is a key part of the Melrose strategy. By 
division, the capital expenditure in the year was as per the table at 
the bottom of this page.
The capital spend to depreciation ratio was 1.7× in 2011, 
compared with 1.0× in 2010. Indeed, in the second half of 2011 it 
increased to 1.9×. This illustrates that the Group has returned to its 
investment phase by spending money on capital and restructuring 
projects which will improve the value of the businesses. The 
seven year Melrose average annual capital spend is in excess of 
depreciation at 1.3×.
The largest investment was made in the Bridon business (within the 
Lifting division) to improve the technical capabilities and capacity of 
the business. More detail on this investment and others is included 
in the Chief Executive’s review.
REFINANCING
In December 2011 a new five-year committed £600 million multi-
currency revolving credit facility was agreed with a syndicate of 10 
banks, strengthening the Group’s banking syndicate compared to 
that in place previously. This was drawn down on 31 January 2012, 
replacing the committed £750 million syndicated term loan and 
revolving credit facility which was fully repaid. The new facility has 
no mandatory repayments in its term and allows borrowings to be 
repaid as cash is generated. 
The facility has been drawn in the Group’s core currencies namely 
US Dollars, Euros and Sterling in the most suitable proportion to 
protect, as effectively as possible, against the currency risk within 
the Group.
TAx
As expected, the headline Income Statement tax rate in 2011 
was 26% (2010 restated: 28%). The overall effect on the Group of 
higher tax rates in North America and certain European countries is 
offset by the benefit that continues to arise from lower tax rates 
in the Far East and other European countries, as well as the 
settlement of prior year tax audits.
 
The tax rate after exceptional items and intangible asset 
amortisation is a credit of 18% (2010: charge of 5%). The reasons 
for the tax credit in the year include the reduction by £28.6 million 
of tax liabilities in respect of overseas tax audits inherited on the 
acquisition of FKI. The reduction reflects the Company’s view of the 
most likely outcome of those audits, which are now approaching 
conclusion. A further exceptional deferred tax credit of £9.5 million

has been recognised because some of the Group’s previously 
unrecognised tax losses are now considered recoverable. In 
addition, a £7.6 million tax credit has been taken in the year 
in respect of tax relief on exceptional costs and a tax credit of 
£13.1 million taken in respect of current period intangible asset 
amortisation and the impact upon future amortisation of the 
change during the year of UK tax rates.
The cash tax rate on headline continuing and discontinued 
operations of 14% (2010: 16%) is again low due to the benefit 
arising from the utilisation of tax losses and other deferred tax 
assets. In the medium term, the headline cash tax rate is expected 
to trend toward the headline Income Statement rate.
The overall net tax liability (deferred and current) has decreased by 
£59.5 million in the year. The reduction in the current tax creditor, 
by £35.5 million, is mostly due to the exceptional credit taken in 
respect of overseas audits. The reduction in the net deferred tax 
creditor, by £24.0 million is largely represented by the recognition 
of a deferred tax asset on certain tax losses, and the reduction 
of the deferred tax liability on intangible assets, both of which are 
discussed above.
The Group’s net deferred tax liability is £57.9 million (31 December 
2010: £81.9 million). The largest item included within this balance 
is an £83.6 million (31 December 2010: £102.8 million) deferred 
tax liability provided in respect of brand names and customer 
relationships acquired. This liability does not represent a future cash 
tax payment and will unwind as the brand names and customer 
relationships are amortised.
The total amount of tax losses in the Group has decreased in 
the year for three reasons; the disposal of businesses containing 
losses, the utilisation of losses (and other assets) against taxable 
profits and the recalculation of available losses following tax audits.

PENSIONS
The Group has a number of defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension plans.
The most significant pension plan in the Group is the FKI UK 
Pension Plan. The net accounting deficit on this plan was £79.4 
million at 31 December 2011 (31 December 2010: £78.6 million). 
This plan had assets at 31 December 2011 of £600.3 million 
(31 December 2010: £549.2 million) and liabilities of £679.7 million 
(31 December 2010: £627.8 million).  
The assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 deficit of the pension 
plans within the Melrose Group are considered carefully by the 
Board of Directors. For the FKI UK Pension Plan a male aged 65 in 
2011 is expected to live for a further 20.3 years. This is assumed 
to increase by 2.5 years (12%) for a male aged 65 in 2036. A 
summary of the key assumptions of the UK plans are shown below:
2011 
Assumptions
%
2010
Assumptions
%
Discount rate 4.90 5.55
Inflation 3.10 3.45
It is noted that a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the discount rate 
would increase the pension liabilities on the main FKI UK Pension 
Plan by £10.5 million, or 2%, and a 0.1 percentage point increase 
to inflation would increase the liabilities on this plan by £7.0 million, 
or 1%. Furthermore, an increase by one year in the expected life of 
a 65 year old male member would increase the pension liabilities on 
this plan by £19.8 million, or 3%.
The FKI UK Pension Plan is closed to new members and on  
28 February 2011 it was closed to current members’ future service. 
The other UK defined benefit pension plan of significant size in the 
Group, namely the McKechnie UK Pension Plan, was in surplus of 
£3.0 million at 31 December 2011 (31 December 2010: surplus of 
£1.9 million). This plan had assets at 31 December 2011 of £157.5 
million (31 December 2010: £143.8 million) and liabilities of £154.5 
million (31 December 2010: £141.9 million).
The McKechnie UK Pension Plan is closed both to new members 
and current members’ future service. 
The long term strategy for the UK plans is to concentrate on the 
cash flows required to fund the liabilities as they fall due whether 
that is within the timescales of Melrose ownership or not. The 
Melrose PLC Board recognise that as businesses are bought and 
sold eventually pension scheme liabilities need to exit the Group. 
However this can be done at a time which is commercially sensible.
The pension plan cash flows extend many years into the future and 
the ultimate objective is that the total pool of assets derived from 
future company contributions and the investment strategy allows 
each cash payment to members to be made when due. The Melrose 
Group contributes £18.5 million to the FKI UK Pension Plan and £4.6 
million to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan per annum.
In addition, a US defined benefit plan for FKI exists. At 31 December 
2011, this had assets of £195.2 million (31 December 2010: £193.3 
million), liabilities of £228.7 million (31 December 2010: £213.1 million) 
and consequently a deficit of £33.5 million (31 December 2010: £19.8 
million). This plan is closed to new members and to current members’ 
future accrual.
During the year the pension plans relating to Dynacast and Logistex 
UK were disposed which reduced the Group plan assets by £30.5 
million and the Group plan liabilities by £41.1 million and hence the 
Group accounting deficit by £10.6 million.
PROVISIONS
Total provisions at 31 December 2011 were £120.6 million  
(31 December 2010: £118.7 million), a slight increase from 
the previous year. The following table shows the movement 
in provisions in the year. Within this there were some major 
movements:
Total

Net charge to exceptional costs 35.1
Disposal of businesses (3.6)
Other (including foreign exchange) 1.1
At 31 December 2011 120.6
Included within cash spend on provisions in 2011 are two exceptional 
cash costs which the Group incurred, both of which were fully 
anticipated and provided. They represented payments in respect of 
two liabilities that were acquired with FKI plc. The first related to the 
transfer of £10.4 million of captive insurance liabilities to an external 
party, Safety National Inc., so that the Group has no further exposure 
to these risks. These were transferred at a cash cost of £9.0 million 
resulting in a profit in the year of £1.4 million. The second related to a 
legal settlement in respect of a historical FKI owned company, 
DeWind GmbH, disposed of prior to the Group’ s acquisition of FKI. 
This historical liability was paid in two tranches totalling £10.4 million. In 
addition £3.0 million of ongoing maintenance costs in respect of  
DeWind, originally provided, were paid in cash.
The net charge to headline operating profit in 2011 in respect of 
provisions was £6.9 million, mostly relating to the charge of £5.0 
million in respect of the divisional LTIP schemes. 
As described in the exceptional costs section of this review, a 
£21.0 million increase to a legal provision in respect of two Bridon 
businesses acquired as part of the acquisition of FKI plc has been 
charged in the year. In addition, of the £15.9 million exceptional 
cost relating to restructuring programmes agreed in the year, £14.1 
million was booked to provisions with the remaining £1.8 million 
shown as an impairment of fixed assets.  www.melroseplc.net

The other movements on provisions in the year include £3.6 million 
of provisions that were sold along with the five disposed businesses 
and a movement of £1.1 million, being the net effect of the unwind 
on long term provisions and foreign exchange.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The financial risks the Group faces have been considered and 
policies have been implemented to best deal with each risk. The 
four most significant financial risks are considered to be liquidity 
risk, finance cost risk, exchange rate risk and commodity cost risk. 
These are discussed in turn.
Liquidity risk management
The Group’s net debt position at 31 December 2011 was £289.6 
million compared with £287.4 million a year earlier. 
At 31 December 2011 the Group had a committed £750 million 
syndicated term loan and revolving credit facility which was due to 
mature in April 2013. In order to minimise future refinancing risk the 
Board decided prudently to refinance this facility early. As a result 
of the strong cash generation in Melrose since the FKI acquisition, 
which has allowed Group net debt to reduce by £280 million, 
61% at constant currencies, the new facility could be reduced. 
Consequently in December 2011, a new five-year committed 
£600 million multi-currency revolving credit facility was agreed and 
subsequently drawn down on 31 January 2012, at which date the 
original facility was repaid in full and cancelled. 
The new facility is committed until December 2016 and is not subject 
to any mandatory repayments over its term but allows extra flexibility 
for the Group to reduce its borrowings as cash is generated. 
The new facility has two financial covenants, a net debt to 
headline EBITDA (headline operating profit before depreciation and 
amortisation) covenant and an interest cover covenant. 
The first covenant, which calculates net debt at average exchange 
rates during the period, is set at 3.0x throughout the life of the facility. 
For the year ended 31 December 2011 it was 1.4x (31 December 
2010: 1.3x) showing significant headroom compared to the covenant 
test. The interest cover covenant remains at 4.0x throughout the 
life of the facility. At 31 December 2011 it was 11.7x (31 December 
2010: 9.7x) which also affords comfortable headroom compared 
to the covenant test. Covenant tests are performed each June and 
December on the new facility.
The initial drawdown of the new facility has been made in the core 
currencies of the Group, being US Dollars, Euro and Sterling and 
in a proportion to protect the Group as efficiently as possible from 
currency fluctuations on net assets and profit.
 
In addition, there are a number of small uncommitted overdraft 
and borrowing facilities made available to the Group. These 
uncommitted facilities are lightly used.
Cash, deposits and marketable securities amounted to £195.6 
million at 31 December 2011 (31 December 2010: £195.7 million) 
and are offset against gross debt of £485.2 million (31 December 
2010: £483.1 million) to arrive at the net debt position of £289.6 
million (31 December 2010: £287.4 million). The combination of this 
cash and the size of the new revolving facility allows the Directors 
to consider that the Group has sufficient access to liquidity for its 
current needs.
In accordance with the reporting requirements on going concern 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council the Directors acknowledge 
that by its very nature the economic environment causes uncertainty 
as to the trading outcome for 2012 and beyond. The Group has 
committed borrowing facilities until December 2016. In addition, 
the breadth of the end markets that the Melrose Group companies 
trade in, both by sector and geographically, gives some balance to 
various market and economic cycle risks. Furthermore, the Group 
has a consistent cash generation record, which has allowed net debt 
at constant exchange rates to reduce by 61% since July 2008. As 
a consequence the Directors believe that the Group can manage 
its business risks successfully and accordingly the Group financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Finance cost risk management
The Group remained in a net debt position at 31 December 2011. In 
2011 the Group protected 78% of its gross debt from exposure to 
changes in interest rates by holding a number of interest rate swaps 
to fix £380.1 million (US $546.0 million and €33.3 million) of term 
debt. Under the terms of these swaps, the Group fixed the underlying 
interest rate at 2.1% for US Dollars and 2.6% for the Euro through to 
early 2013. At 31 December 2011 this produced a blended interest 
rate of 3.1% (2010: 3.4%) on the £750 million facility, calculated after 
inclusion of the current bank margin of 1.35% (2010: 1.5%) but before 
amortisation of arrangement fees and non-utilisation fees.
In February 2012 the Group closed out this swap arrangement 
and replaced it with a new arrangement to fix the interest rate on 
a proportion of the new facility drawn down on 31 January 2012. 
The new five-year swap arrangements fix the finance cost on US 
$231 million, £105 million and €42 million of debt. Under the terms 
of these new swap arrangements, the Group will pay, annually in 
arrears, 1.0% for US Dollar swaps, 1.1% for Euro swaps and 1.1% 
for Sterling swaps, plus the bank margin which is currently 1.5%. 
This arrangement protects approximately 70% of the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations for the term of the new facility.
Exchange rate risk management
The Group trades in various countries around the world and is exposed 
to many different foreign currencies. The Group therefore carries an 
exchange rate risk that can be categorised into three types as described 
overleaf. The Board policy is designed to protect against the majority 
of the cash risks but not the non-cash risks. The most common cash 
risk is the transaction risk the Group takes when it invoices a sale in a 
different currency to the one in which its cost of sale is incurred. This is 
addressed by taking out forward cover against approximately 60% to 
80% of the anticipated cash flows over the following twelve months, 
placed on a rolling quarterly basis or for 100% of each material contract. 
This does not eliminate the cash risk but does bring some certainty to it. Melrose PLC

The effect on the key headline numbers in 2011 for the continuing 
Group due to the translation movement of exchange rates from 
2010 to 2011 is shown below. The table illustrates the translation 
movement in revenue and headline operating profit if the 2010 
average exchange rates had been used to calculate the 2011 
results rather than the 2011 average exchange rate.
The translation difference in 2011 £m
Revenue increase 5.6
Headline operating profit increase minimal
For reference, an indication of the short term exchange rate 
risk, which shows both translation exchange risk and unhedged 
transaction exchange rate risk, is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation and 
unhedged transaction exchange risk
Increase 
in headline 
operating 
profit
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar
 against Sterling 4.7
For every 10 cent strengthening of the Euro
 against Sterling 2.8
The long term exchange rate risk, which ignores any hedging 
instruments, is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation and full 
transaction exchange rate risk
Increase 
in headline 
operating 
profit
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar
 against Sterling 6.6
For every 10 cent strengthening of the Euro
 against Sterling 2.6
No specific exchange instruments are used to protect against this 
translation risk because it is a non-cash risk to the Group. However, 
when the Group has net debt, the hedge of having a multi-
currency debt facility funding these foreign currency trading units 
protects against some of the Balance Sheet and banking covenant 
translation risk.
Lastly and potentially the most significant exchange risk that the 
Group has arises when a business that is predominantly based in a 
foreign currency is sold. The proceeds for those businesses may be 
received in a foreign currency and therefore an exchange risk might 
arise if foreign currency proceeds are converted back to Sterling, 
for instance to pay a dividend to shareholders. Protection against 
this risk is considered on a case-by-case basis. 
Commodity cost risk management
As Melrose owns engineering businesses across various sectors 
the cumulative expenditure on commodities is important. The 
Group addresses the risk of base commodity costs increasing by, 
wherever possible, passing on the cost increases to customers 
or by having suitable purchase agreements with its suppliers 
which sometimes fix the price over some months into the future. 
On occasions, Melrose does enter into financial instruments on 
commodities when this is considered to be the most efficient way 
of protecting against movements.

Melrose operates in a wide variety of sectors and countries and is exposed to a range of risks and uncertainties from a strategic, operational, 
compliance, ethical and financial perspective. Detailed below are risks and uncertainties that could impact on the Company’s performance. 
A risk management and internal controls framework is in place within the Group to ensure that such risks and uncertainties can be identified 
and where possible managed suitably.
Risks and uncertainties
Strategic Risk Nature of Risk Mitigating Factors
Acquisition of new 
businesses and 
improvement strategies
•	 Discovery of unforeseen liabilities 
following acquisition.
•	 Value generation post acquisition does 
not meet expectations.
•	 Need for a greater amount of capital 
expenditure and working capital to 
grow the acquired business than 
originally forecast.
•	 Structured and focused due diligence undertaken.
•	 Focus on acquisition targets that have strong 
headline fundamentals – high quality products, 
leading market share, but are underperforming their 
potential and ability to generate sustainable cash 
flows and profit growth.
•	 Hands-on role taken by Directors and other senior 
employees of the Group. Development of strategic 
plans, restructuring opportunities, capital expenditure 
and working capital management.
Disposals
•	 Timing of disposal of companies.
•	 Long term liabilities retained by the 
Group post disposal.
•	 Directors are experienced in judging and regularly 
reviewing the appropriate time in a business cycle for 
disposal to realise maximum value for shareholders.
•	 Each disposal is assessed on its merits, along with 
the extent to which indemnities, warranties and 
guarantees are provided.
Operational Risk Nature of Risk Mitigating Factors
Economic and political risk
•	 Difficult macro-economic conditions, 
changing pattern of global demand  
and political uncertainty.
•	 Diverse range of companies operating within the 
Group, within a variety of different industries and 
countries, which reduces macro-economic and 
political risks.
•	 Regular monitoring of order books and other leading 
indicators, to ensure the Group and each of its 
businesses can respond quickly to any adverse 
trading conditions. This includes the identification of 
cost reduction and efficiency measures.
Customers
•	 Concentration of customers in certain 
markets and/or countries around the 
world.
•	 Financial viability of key customers.
•	 Diverse portfolio of businesses serving different 
customers and markets. No reliance on any one 
customer, or group of customers. At a business unit 
level performance could be materially affected by 
the loss of a key customer and regular monitoring is 
undertaken to reduce such risks.
•	 Active credit management and development of 
customer relations at a business level.
•	 Monitoring of key markets for early warning of 
negative commercial trends.
Suppliers
•	 Over reliance on a small number 
of suppliers, leading to a lack of 
availability.
•	 Production volatility and supply chain 
disruption.
•	 Fluctuations in cost of raw materials.
•	 Diverse portfolio of suppliers. The Company is not 
reliant on any one supplier, or group of suppliers.
•	 Ongoing assessment of suppliers, including the 
monitoring of their financial viability.
•	 If commercially suitable, contract prices are 
agreed with raw material suppliers to reduce the 
effect of short term price fluctuations. Risks are 
further reduced by the use of escalation clauses, 
surcharges and price increases when negotiating 
contracts, together with the use of matching hedging 
arrangements. Melrose PLC

A variety of different health and safety KPIs are used by each of 
the businesses within the Group, which are specific to the exact 
nature of the business and its associated risks. Three overall 
Group KPIs are also used by the Board, which are Major Accident 
Frequency Rate (accidents that result in an employee having more 
than three days off work due to a work related injury, per 200,000 
working hours), Accident Frequency Rate (accidents that result in 
an employee having less than three days off work due to a work 
related injury, per 200,000 working hours) and Accident Severity 
Rate (average number of lost days per work related accident).
Strategic objective
The Company has an objective to stop all preventable accidents.
Performance
The Company introduced the three Group KPIs during 2011 and 
as part of this process statistics were also calculated historically 
back to 2009. These KPIs improved during the period from 2009 
to 2011. Further information in relation to the various health and 
safety initiatives undertaken by the Group’s businesses during 
2011 and planned for 2012 can be found within the Directors’ 
report on pages 45 and 46.
Health and safety
Method of calculation
Environmental KPIs used within the Group and their method of 
calculation vary by business unit, which depends on the specific 
nature of the operation. A range of environmental measures 
are used, including energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, water 
consumption, water contamination and waste disposal.
Due to the diverse nature of the Group each business uses a 
range of its own specific non-financial KPIs, which are used to 
drive business performance and assist in managing risk. This helps 
to ensure that the KPIs used are relevant to each business and 
take into account specific operational and reporting requirements. 
Such KPIs cover operational, quality, commercial and human 
resource measures. Further information regarding some of the 
Group’s recent initiatives can be found within the Directors’ report 
on pages 43 and 44.

Strategic objective
Each of the Group’s businesses are committed to ensuring 
that their operations have a minimum adverse effect on the 
environment and that ongoing reductions are achieved, where 
practicable. Particular relevance has been placed on the reduction 
of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.
Performance
Investment was provided by the Group for several environmental 
improvement initiatives during 2011. Details of these, together with 
some of the environmental initiatives for 2012 can be seen in the 
Directors’ report on pages 46 and 47.

Directors’ report
The Directors of Melrose PLC present their annual report and 
audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended  
31 December 2011.
STRATEGY
Melrose PLC has a buy, improve, sell strategy to acquire 
manufacturing businesses, improve performance and realise 
their value in the medium term. Further details of each part of the 
strategy are shown below. Additional information is also shown on 
pages 6 and 7.
Melrose aims to acquire good manufacturing businesses that, in 
the opinion of the Directors, are currently underperforming their 
potential. Businesses are targeted that have strong headline 
fundamentals, such as high quality products, or a leading market 
share, to generate sustainable cash flows, achieve profit growth 
and create value for shareholders.
The executive Directors have extensive experience of identifying 
and evaluating such acquisition opportunities, in both quoted and 
unquoted companies, within the UK and overseas.
To date, the largest acquisition by the Company has been that of 
FKI plc, in July 2008, for a total consideration of £970.4 million, 
which at the time increased the size of the Melrose Group by 
approximately six times. 
The Directors of the Company are currently in the process of 
looking for the next acquisition opportunity. Indeed, during 2011 
a proposal was made to the Board of Charter International plc 
(‘Charter’) regarding a possible offer by the Company for Charter, 
for approximately £1.4 billion; the Directors remained price 
disciplined and ultimately decided not to pursue this opportunity 
but remain confident that other suitable targets exist.
The Company is not a passive investor in the businesses that 
it acquires. The Directors and senior management team have a 
hands-on relationship with each acquired company, by working 
closely with their divisional senior management teams in developing 
the long term strategic plans of the business, as well as having 
regular input on re-structuring decisions, capital expenditure and 
working capital management. The Company is fully committed to 
investing within the businesses it acquires in order to fully exploit 
their operational and strategic strengths. A natural part of this 
process involves the disposal of non-core businesses. 
The Company has a proven track record in being able to make 
substantial improvements within the businesses it purchases. Two 
examples of this are as follows:
•	 Dynacast 
Melrose acquired Dynacast in May 2005 and sold this business 
in July 2011. During the six years of ownership, and as a result 
of a variety of improvement initiatives and investments made by 
Melrose, the equity value increased fourfold. Melrose successfully 
steered Dynacast through the global slowdown and cost savings 
made during the downturn were retained as sales recovered.
•	 McKechnie Aerospace 
Melrose acquired the McKechnie group in 2005. Part of this 
purchase included the McKechnie Aerospace and aftermarkets 
business, which was ultimately sold in May 2007 for £428 
million. During the two year period of ownership within the Group 
revenues grew by 35 per cent, EBITDA grew by approximately 75 
per cent, with margins increasing by 6 percentage points. The sale 
generated a profit (including cash generation during ownership) 
of approximately £250 million and in total it is estimated that the 
disposal crystallised a value increase of nearly 2.5 times.
At the appropriate time, each business will be disposed of, in order 
to return value that has been created to shareholders.
The Directors are experienced in being able to recognise the 
appropriate time in the business cycle for disposal, in order to 
provide funding for future acquisitions and return funds to investors.
During the year, the Company’s strategy of returning value to 
shareholders was successfully demonstrated again following the sale 
of the Dynacast division on 19 July 2011, for a cash consideration 
of £366.5 million. This was followed by a return of capital of £373.2 
million in cash to shareholders, of which £1.1 million has been 
deferred until April 2012. In 2011, non-core businesses of Brush 
Traction, Logistex UK, Madico and Weber Knapp were also sold for 
gross proceeds of £24.0 million, in aggregate.
Prior to these disposals the Company had already delivered 
significant value to shareholders via the acquisition and subsequent 
re-structuring of the McKechnie Group as mentioned above. The 
sale of Dynacast in 2011 means that nearly £1 billion in cash has 
been generated from the original purchase of the McKechnie and 
Dynacast businesses for £429 million in 2005.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The Company operates via three distinct trading divisions, being 
Energy, Lifting and Other Industrial, with over half of the Group’s 
end market revenues coming from the energy, oil & gas and mining 
sectors. A summary of the key strengths, products and major 
customers of each Group business is shown within the ‘Group at a 
glance’ section of this report on pages 8 and 9.
The Company’s businesses operate on a global scale, having 
manufacturing locations throughout the world, as shown on the map 
on pages 4 and 5. Further details regarding the principal activities of 
the Company can be found within the Chief Executive’s review on 
pages 12 and 13 and Divisional reviews on pages 14 to 22. www.melroseplc.net

DIVISIONAL REVIEwS
The Company remains committed to investing within its various 
businesses and this can be seen through the development of new 
or upgraded facilities at various Group locations around the world. 
Bridon’s new £20 million state of the art manufacturing facility at 
Neptune Energy Park, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, is on track to 
be operational by the end of 2012, whilst Marelli’s new factory in 
Malaysia became fully operational towards the end of 2011. Other 
recent investments in site infrastructure include the development of 
an industry-leading patenting and galvanizing process at Bridon’s 
Doncaster factory in the UK and improvements that will allow for 
capacity increases within each of Crosby’s key US manufacturing 
locations. A further £15 million has been approved to increase 
capacity and productivity at the Brush facilities in the UK and Czech 
Republic, in relation to the manufacture of 2-pole generators. 
These investments will assist in developing growth opportunities 
within new markets, especially China, other parts of Asia and South 
America.
Investment continued in the development of new and innovative 
product lines during 2011, with further product launches planned 
for 2012. This strategy helps to ensure that each business can 
remain at the forefront of technological advances within defined 
market sectors and are also able to meet specific customer 
demands.
In accordance with the Group’s strategy of improving commercial 
performance within its businesses, a variety of structural changes 
were implemented during 2011. A good example of this can be 
seen through the absorption of the Hawker Siddeley Switchgear 
(“HSS”) business into Turbogenerators during 2011, thus allowing 
them to benefit from similar sales and end market opportunities. 
HSS will also be able to benefit from the Turbogenerator 
manufacturing strategy as a result of this re-organisation, which has 
been developed over a period of time to create industry-leading 
and efficient production methods. The cost base of all businesses 
was also kept under constant review, as each business continued 
to build on the various cost reduction initiatives that have been 
introduced in recent years, and to ensure they are able to react to 
changing markets and demand.
The Group also continues to regularly review its pension benefit 
and legacy liabilities and reduce volatility where possible. A number 
of actions were taken during the year, as detailed on page 28. In 
addition, the Group sold legacy FKI insurance obligations to a third 
party insurer to remove financial uncertainty in future years.
The results of the Group are set out in detail in the financial 
statements on pages 63 to 67 and in the accompanying notes.
The Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to set out 
in this report a fair review of the development and performance of 
the Group during the year, the position of the Group at the end of 
the year and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group. The information that fulfils these requirements 
can be found within the Chief Executive’s review, Divisional reviews, 
Finance Director’s review and in this Directors’ report. Details of the 
main key performance and risk indicators used by the Group can 
be seen on pages 31 to 35.
The subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the profits or net 
assets of the Group in the year are listed in note 3 to the Melrose 
PLC UK Company accounts, on page 113.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
The Group’s profit for the financial year attributable to Ordinary 
shareholders was £286.4 million (2010: £141.1 million). In addition, 
there were gains attributable to non-controlling interests of £0.1 
million (2010: £0.2 million).
SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND
The Directors are pleased to recommend the payment of a 
final dividend of 8.4p (2010: 7.0p) on 14 May 2012 to Ordinary 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 13 April 
2012. This dividend recommendation will be put to shareholders at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) of the Company, 
to be held on 9 May 2012.
It is the intention of the Board to maintain a progressive dividend 
policy, where appropriate. The Company offers a Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan which gives shareholders the opportunity to use 
their dividend payments to purchase further Melrose PLC shares. 
Further details about the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and its terms 
and conditions can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.melroseplc.net.
In August 2011, following the sale of the Dynacast business and as 
part of the return of capital to shareholders, a special dividend of 
75 pence per Ordinary Share was approved. Following the return of 
capital, a consolidation and sub-division of the Company’s ordinary 
share capital was undertaken. Further details can be found about 
this and the special dividend on pages 40 and 41.
DIRECTORS’ APPOINTMENT AND POwERS
The Directors of the Company as at the date of this report, together 
with their biographical details, are given on pages 36 and 37. On 
1 September 2011, Justin Dowley joined the Company as an 
independent non-executive Director in order to provide further 
experience and complement the existing skill set of the Board. 
Justin Dowley is also a member of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees of the Board.
The Company’s Articles of Association (‘Articles’) give the Directors 
power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the terms of 
reference of the Nomination Committee, any appointment must be 
recommended by the Nomination Committee for approval by the 
Board. The Articles also require Directors to retire and resubmit 
themselves for election at the first AGM following their appointment. 
In previous years, one third of the Company’s Directors have 
been subject to retirement by rotation with a requirement then 
to offer themselves for re-election. However, going forward and 
notwithstanding the Articles, the Board has determined that  Melrose PLC
Annual Report 2011 40
21012-04   26/03/2012   Proof 6
Directors’ report continued
all Directors of the Company will stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM and annually thereafter, in compliance with the 
new provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Directors are responsible for managing the business of the 
Company and exercise their powers in accordance with the 
Articles, directions given by special resolution and any relevant 
statutes. Specific powers relating to the issuing of shares and the 
ability of the Company to purchase its own shares are also included 
within the Articles and such authorities are submitted for approval 
by the shareholders at the AGM each year.
Pursuant to sections 693 and 701 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
a special resolution passed at the AGM in 2011, the Company was 
authorised to purchase its own shares, limited to an aggregate 
maximum number equal to 10 per cent of the issued share capital 
of the Company. Following the Share Capital Consolidation (defined 
below), this authority ceased to be valid. The Company did not 
purchase any Ordinary Shares pursuant to this authority. The 
resolutions being proposed at this year’s AGM include a resolution 
to renew this authority.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS AND REMUNERATION
Information on Directors’ beneficial interests, including those of 
connected persons (within the meaning of section 252 of the 
Companies Act 2006), in the shares of the Company is shown in 
the Remuneration report on pages 56 to 59.
No Director had a material interest at any time during the year 
in any contract with the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings, other than a service contract.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
The Directors have the benefit of an indemnity from the Company in 
respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office. This indemnity 
is provided under the Articles and satisfies the indemnity provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken out an insurance policy in respect of those 
liabilities for which the Directors may not be indemnified. Neither 
the indemnity nor the insurance provides cover in the event that a 
Director is proved to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
consolidated financial statements is set out on page 60.
SHARE CAPITAL
Following the sale of the Group’s Dynacast business on 19 July 
2011 for a cash consideration of £366.5 million, a return of 
capital was made to shareholders in August 2011. An amount of 
£373.2 million was agreed to be returned, representing 75 pence 
per existing Ordinary Share. A share capital consolidation and 
sub-division was authorised by the Directors and subsequently 
approved by the shareholders to help ensure that a constant 
share price be maintained both before and after the return of 
capital (subject to normal market movements). This resulted in a 
consolidation and sub-division of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital; for every 14 Ordinary Shares of 0.2 pence nominal 
value in the capital of the Company (‘Old Ordinary Shares’) held 
shareholders received 11 new Ordinary Shares of 14/55 pence 
nominal value in the capital of the Company (‘New Ordinary 
Shares’) (the ‘Share Capital Consolidation’).
In order to facilitate the return of capital, shareholders were given 
one new C non-cumulative redeemable preference share of 75 
pence each in the capital of the Company (‘C Share’) for every one 
Old Ordinary Share held. Three alternatives, with a mix and match 
facility, were offered to the holders of C Shares, allowing them to 
decide how and when to receive their return of capital, as detailed 
below:

75 pence in the capital of the Company (“C 
Deferred Shares”) to be redeemed by the 
Company on 30 April 2012.

and after the Share Capital Consolidation, together with the rights

The holders of the remaining C Shares and C Deferred Shares shall 
not be entitled to:
•	 any further right of participating in the profits of the Company; or
•	 the right to vote at general meetings of the Company, except 
holders of C Shares can vote on the winding up of the Company.
On a winding up, the holders of the C Shares shall be entitled in 
priority to all other classes of shares up to 75 pence per C Share. 
The holders of the C Deferred Shares shall not be entitled to any 
right or participation in the assets of the Company on a winding up.
The C Deferred Shares and C Shares will be redeemed by the 
Company on 30 April 2012. 
Only the New Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock 
Exchange, having been admitted to the Official List as maintained 
by the UK Listing Authority, on 9 August 2011.
2009 INCENTIVE SHARES
The 2009 Incentive Shares of £1.00 each have been awarded 
to Directors and senior managers within the Company, together 
with Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited (as Trustee of the 
Melrose PLC Employee Benefit Trust) and replaced the incentive 
share scheme introduced in 2007. The rights attaching to the 2009 
Incentive Shares are identical to those originally attached to the 
2007 Incentive Scheme, with the exception that the Company may 
pay a dividend on the 2009 Incentive Shares as an alternative to 
converting them into Ordinary Shares and the award holders were 
not able to request early conversion in 2010 and/or 2011. The 
rights attaching to the 2009 Incentive Shares remained the same 
both before and after the Share Capital Consolidation.
Holders of the 2009 Incentive Shares will be entitled to either a cash 
dividend, or a number of Ordinary Shares in the Company aligned to 
the increase in shareholder value between July 2007 and May 2012.
The 2009 Incentive Shares do not confer a right to be paid an 
interim or final dividend or to vote at a general meeting. On winding 
up, the holders are entitled to participate in the Company’s assets 
equal to an amount to which they would have been entitled if their 
2009 Incentive Shares had crystallised as at the date of winding 
up. Further details of the 2009 Incentive Shares can be found in the 
Remuneration report on pages 56 to 59.
FURTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ATTACHING  
TO SHARES
The following summary is based on the Company’s Articles, as 
adopted at a general meeting of the Company on 8 August 2011.
VOTING
Only New Ordinary Shares have voting rights attached. In a 
general meeting of the Company, subject to the provisions of the 
current Articles and to any special rights or restrictions as to voting 
attached to any other class of shares in the Company (of which 
there are currently none):
•	 on a show of hands, every member present shall have one vote; 
and
•	 on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy 
shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
The Company’ s Articles were amended pursuant to a special 
resolution approved at a general meeting of the Company held on 
8 August 2011, to reflect the rights and restrictions attaching to the 
C Shares and the C Deferred Shares and certain other changes 
required in connection with the Share Capital Consolidation. The rights 
attaching to the New Ordinary Shares following the Share Capital 
Consolidation remained exactly the same as those attaching to the Old 
Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Share Capital Consolidation.
If any call or other sum payable by a holder of New Ordinary Shares 
remains unpaid, they shall not be entitled to vote at any general 
meeting or class meeting in respect of any shares held by him. 
Currently, all issued New Ordinary Shares are fully paid.
As at 7 March 2012, the Melrose PLC Employee Benefit Trust held 
19,862 New Ordinary Shares (2010: 25,279 Old Ordinary Shares) 
at a nominal value of 14/55 pence per share (2010: 0.2 pence per 
share), resulting from the crystallisation of the original incentive 
scheme in August 2007. The FKI Employee Benefit Trust held a 
further 124,232 New Ordinary Shares (2010: 158,114 Old Ordinary 
Shares) at a nominal value of 14/55 pence per share (2010: 0.2 
pence per share), arising from the Melrose acquisition of FKI plc. 
The Remuneration Committee may direct how the voting rights of 
those shares are exercised.
DEADLINES FOR VOTING RIGHTS
Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect of 
the resolutions to be considered at the AGM to be held on 9 May 
2012 are set out in the Notice of AGM, on pages 118 to 120.
DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company may, by ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be 
paid to the Ordinary shareholders, but no dividend shall exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim 
dividends and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its 
payment. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro-rata 
according to the amounts paid up on the shares.
The Board may deduct from a dividend, or other amounts payable 
to a person in respect of their shares, amounts due from him to the 
Company on account of a call or otherwise in relation to such shares. Melrose PLC

shareholders as the liquidator shall determine.
TRANSFER OF SHARES
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of 
his shares in any form which the Board may approve, and the 
transfer shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor. Subject 
to the Articles and the requirements of any relevant investment 
exchange, the Board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to 
register a transfer of a share which is not a fully paid share or on

register a transfer unless the transfer is: (i) in respect of only one 
class of shares; (ii) in favour of not more than four joint transferees 
or renouncees; (iii) duly stamped (if required); and (iv) delivered 
for registration to the registered office, or such other place as the 
Board may decide, accompanied by the certificate for the shares 
to which it relates and such other evidence as the Board may 
reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor.

pages 50 to 55. Additionally, key commercial and economic risks 
are covered in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 12 to 22.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS AND CHANGE OF CONTROL
With the exception of the Group’s banking facilities, the Melrose 
2009 Incentive Share Scheme and the divisional management long 
term incentive schemes, there are no other agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid, that are considered to be significant in 
terms of their potential impact on the business of the Group as a 
whole on 7 March 2012.
On 22 December 2011, the Group agreed a new syndicated 
£600 million five-year multi-currency, committed, revolving credit 
facility, which has the same change of control provisions as the 
previous £750 million facility. In the event of a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid, the Company and lenders 
under this facility are obliged to enter into negotiations to determine 
whether and, if so, how to continue with the facility. There is no 
obligation for the lenders to continue to make the facility available 
for more than 30 days beyond any change of control. Failure to 
reach agreement with parties on revised terms could require an 
acquirer to put in place replacement facilities.
In the event of a takeover of the Company, the 2009 Incentive 
Shares convert into New Ordinary Shares or an entitlement to a 
dividend paid in cash, the conversion being based upon the offer 
price of the Company’s New Ordinary Shares as calculated on 
the date of the change of control of the Company. If part or the 
entire offer price is not in cash, the Remuneration Committee will 
determine the value of the non-cash element, having been advised 
by an investment bank of repute that such valuation is fair and 
reasonable. www.melroseplc.net

PRODUCT AND EMPLOYER’S LIABILITY CLAIMS
The Group seeks to assess its ongoing risks in relation to potential 
future liabilities arising from insurance claims via the use of external 
actuarial projections to measure material exposures. Historic claims 
experience data is used to analyse risks in relation to less significant 
exposures. Actuarial projections and claims history experience are 
regularly analysed by management and key issues, trends and 
statistics are also discussed at Board level.
Risks within the Group relate to potential future liabilities arising 
from product, industrial disease (including asbestos), employer’s 
liability and workers’ compensation claims. Provisions in relation 
to such risks are recognised in the Group’s Balance Sheet, where 
appropriate. Note 30 to the consolidated financial statements 
provides further information with regard to contingent product 
liabilities.
A number of businesses have ISO 9001 and ISO 16949 
certifications for their quality management systems, which also help 
to ensure their products and processes are of a recognised quality, 
reducing the risk of product claims. Some businesses within the 
Group are also certified to international health and safety standards 
via ISO 18001, which helps to further ensure that risks in relation to 
employer’s liability claims are kept to a minimum.
PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS
The Company has decided not to utilise standard protocols in 
respect of payments to suppliers, given the international nature 
of the Group’s operations. It is the responsibility of each business 
to agree the exact terms and conditions of transactions with their 
suppliers and these arrangements are adhered to, provided that 
suppliers meet their contractual commitments. The Company, as 
a holding company, did not have any material amounts owing to 
trade creditors at 31 December 2011.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Company and each of its businesses recognise the value and 
importance of its intellectual property (‘IP’) and, where appropriate, 
will seek to protect and enforce its rights over IP . Due to the varying 
types of IP rights held or licensed within the Group, each business 
is responsible for the management and enforcement of these on a 
de-centralised basis through the use of external advisers and the 
support of the Company. As part of this process and to try and 
reduce risks in this area, internal IP audits are conducted by all 
businesses within the Group.
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
The Group recognises its responsibilities for the fair treatment of 
all its employees in accordance with legislation applicable to the 
territories within which it operates. Due to the diverse nature of 
the Group, businesses are required to manage their employment 
matters on a de-centralised basis and, therefore, responsibility 
for the adoption of employment policies and practices sits at a 
local business unit level. This position ensures that policies and 
procedures meet both site and local regulatory requirements, taking 
into account the size and nature of the businesses.
As part of this de-centralised approach, each business is responsible 
for setting and measuring its own KPIs and, as such, these vary 
throughout the Group. However, such measurements will generally 
include absenteeism, punctuality, headcount and employee relations 
issues. Any concerns or adverse trends are responded to in a timely 
manner. Further, as a Group-wide policy and so far as particular 
disabilities permit, the Company and each of its businesses will give 
employees disabled during their period of employment continued 
employment in the same job or, if this is not practicable, a suitable 
alternative job. Equal opportunities for appropriate training, career 
development and promotion are also available to all employees within 
the Group regardless of any physical disability, gender, religion, race, 
nationality, sexual orientation or age.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always 
fully considered by the Group, taking into account job-specific 
requirements and applicant aptitude. It is the policy of the Group 
that in recruitment, training, career development and promotion, 
the treatment of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be 
identical to that of other employees.
The Group regards employee training and advancement as an 
essential element of industrial relations. Disputes and days lost 
through strike action are negligible.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT, CONSULTATION AND 
DEVELOPMENT
The Group attaches great importance to good labour relations, 
employee involvement and employee development. The nature of the 
Group’s activities places the responsibility for employment practices 
with local management, in a manner appropriate to each business.
A culture of clear communication and employee consultation is 
inherent in the Group’s businesses. Employee briefing sessions 
are held on a regular basis to communicate strategy, key changes, 
financial results, achievements and other important issues. Regular 
appraisals, employee surveys, noticeboards, intranet sites, team 
meetings, suggestion boxes and newsletters are also used to 
communicate with employees.
Extensive training is available to all staff and is actively encouraged 
to ensure a high standard of skill is maintained across the Group. 
Cross-training programmes are also in place at a number of the 
Group’s businesses. The importance of training extends beyond 
on-the-job training and also focuses on enhancing personal 
development. Apprenticeship programmes are in place at the 
majority of sites, which help to assist with succession planning 
in locations where there is an ageing workforce. Employees are 
encouraged to think in an innovative manner across the Group. Melrose PLC

HUMAN RESOURCE INITIATIVES
During 2011, many of the Group’s businesses implemented a range 
of employee-related initiatives, which include the following:
•	 Within the Turbogenerators business at Loughborough, a 
substantial investment has been made in a new Learning 
Academy, which was officially opened in July 2011. Classroom 
style facilities have been provided to enhance the skills of 
existing employees and to ensure that future apprentices can 
benefit from a structured learning environment. These new 
training facilities are also being used to carry out customer 
training courses in relation to the growing Aftermarket business. 
During 2011, Brush invested in a series of ‘next generation’ 
management development programmes, aimed at managers 
who have responsibility for apprentices. The programme is being 
developed further during 2012. Turbogenerators were awarded a 
‘Gold Standard’ from the National Apprenticeship Service during 
2011, in relation to their highly regarded apprenticeship scheme. 
•	 At Bridon’s Doncaster UK facility, efforts have been made to 
encourage employee engagement in health and safety matters, 
in order to improve further the safety record of the site. This 
resulted in the business being awarded a steel industry ‘Live 
Wire’ award in 2011 for its efforts in involving employees in a 
variety of health and safety initiatives.
•	 Within each of the US-based businesses, a focus has been 
placed on various employee health and wellness initiatives. 
These include the introduction of tobacco-free sites, provision 
of flu jabs, weight loss initiatives, wellness fairs and free medical 
testing services. These initiatives are ongoing.
A significant number of employees are members of unions and 
some businesses operate works councils, both of which are used 
for consultation and dissemination of information, as appropriate.
The Directors have monthly meetings with divisional senior 
management and visit the sites on an ad hoc basis to communicate 
with the wider Group. Financial results of the Company for the 
half year and full year are discussed with the Group’s senior 
management team; Group developments are communicated 
to the businesses as appropriate. Employee involvement in and 
commitment to the Group’s profitability is encouraged through 
appropriate bonus schemes.
PENSIONS
Companies within the Group operate various pension schemes 
around the world. The table at the bottom of this page shows 
defined benefit schemes that are material to the Group.
The FKI UK Pension Plan (‘FKI UK Plan’) is a UK defined benefit 
pension plan with FKI Limited as its principal employer. The primary 
liability for funding rests with the participating employers, which 
currently pay £18.5 million annually into the FKI UK Plan. This is 
expected to remove the funding deficit by 31 December 2022, 
when the contribution levels were last formally assessed as at  
31 December 2008. A formal actuarial valuation of the FKI UK Plan 
is currently being carried out, which will record the funding position 
as at 31 December 2011; the Company and the trustees of the 
plan will be discussing valuation results and funding requirements 
during the course of 2012. The FKI UK Plan closed to the accrual 
of future benefits for existing members on 28 February 2011 and 
this is expected to lead to the funding deficit being removed earlier 
than would otherwise have been the case.
The McKechnie UK Pension Plan (‘McKechnie UK Plan’) is a UK 
defined benefit pension plan with McKechnie Limited as its principal 
employer. The primary liability for funding rests with the participating 
employers. The Company and Trustees reviewed the funding of the 
McKechnie UK Plan as part of the actuarial valuation as at  
31 December 2008 and it was agreed that the participating 
employers would contribute £4.6 million annually into the 
McKechnie UK Plan. The Company has guaranteed the funding 
of the McKechnie UK Plan on an ongoing basis. A formal actuarial 
valuation of the McKechnie UK Plan is currently being carried out, 
which will record the funding position as at 31 December 2011; 
the Company and Trustees of the plan will be discussing valuation 
results and funding requirements during the course of 2012.
The FKI US Pension Plan is a defined benefit pension plan covering 
several of FKI’s US businesses. The primary liability for funding 
the FKI US Pension Plan rests with the participating employers. 
The Company and Trustees of the plan reviewed the funding 
requirements of the FKI US Pension Plan, based on its 1 January 
2011 actuarial valuation and no contributions will need to be made 
during 2012. Unlike the UK pension plans, deferred member 
liabilities do not increase by inflation each year.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Directors of the Company are committed to minimising the 
health and safety risks that each of the Group’s employees are 
exposed to by promoting the effective use and management of 
business specific policies and procedures. 
The Group has a policy to ensure that the Directors are made aware 
of any serious health and safety incidents, wherever they occur in 
the world, without delay to ensure that suitable investigations and 
corrective action can be organised. Health and safety is also covered 
at every quarterly Board meeting of the Company.
Each of the Group’s businesses has specific health and safety KPIs 
in use, which are specific to the exact nature of their business and 
allow for focus, analysis and improvement at local business levels, 
often on a location by location basis.
To supplement the business specific KPIs, Group-wide health 
and safety KPIs were developed during 2011. Going forward, this 
will allow the Directors to review Group statistics on a regular and 
consistent basis; it will also ensure they have a greater visibility of 
the key Group health and safety trends in order to help them to 
make decisions on where future focus should be placed.
The Group health and safety KPIs that are actively being used 
are: Major Accident Frequency Rate (defined as an accident 
that resulted in an employee having more than three days off 
work due to a work-related injury, per 200,000 working hours), 
Accident Frequency Rate (defined as an accident that resulted in 
an employee having between one and three days off work due to 
a work-related injury, per 200,000 working hours) and Accident 
Severity Rate (which calculates the average number of lost working 
days per accident). Such statistics are collected quarterly on a site-
by-site basis. From an overall Group perspective, each of the three 
KPI statistics had improved in the period from 2009 to 2011.
Each business is responsible for setting its own detailed 
arrangements concerning health and safety policies and 
procedures, in accordance with local health and safety legislation. 
As a general rule, businesses strive to achieve best practice, in 
terms of what is suitable and practical for the size and nature 
of their operations. Several of the Group’s businesses already 
hold ISO 18001 certification, the internationally recognised 
assessment standard for occupational health and safety 
management systems. This certification includes some of the 
major manufacturing locations within the Group, such as the 
Brush sites at Loughborough, UK and in the Czech Republic. The 
certification process is also currently underway at the two MPC 
sites in Yorkshire. The Bridon business has a medium term strategy 
to achieve ISO 18001 international health and safety standards for 
all of its sites.
Divisional managers within each business unit have responsibilities 
to ensure that health and safety remains a key focus and to ensure 
that active procedures and monitoring systems are in place to 
provide substance to written policies. Detailed health and safety 
plans are set by businesses each year to determine annual targets 
and improvement initiatives.
All businesses have an established Health and Safety Committee 
(‘H&S Committee’) structure in place; such committees meet on 
a regular basis and are made up of representatives from both 
management and shop floor level personnel. Each of the H&S 
Committees has wide-ranging responsibilities which vary from 
business to business and include the review of reported incidents 
and the monitoring of incident trends. These H&S Committees 
are also responsible for ensuring that corrective measures are 
implemented when accidents occur and that all incidents, whether 
or not they are deemed reportable under local legislation, are given 
due attention.
One of the key responsibilities for these H&S Committees is to 
carry out regular tours of the premises in which they work, in order 
to ensure compliance with local policies and procedures. These 
tours also identify potential hazards, for which counter measures 
can be identified to prevent accidents from happening. Each H&S 
Committee recommendation is followed up at the next committee 
meeting to ensure that issues are resolved. Additionally, operations 
are audited by the H&S Committees at least annually and reports of 
performance and recommended improvements are prepared and 
circulated to the divisional senior management teams. Divisional 
managers are provided with detailed health and safety reports on a 
frequent basis to ensure that such matters are given high visibility 
and that improvements are authorised and implemented quickly.
HEALTH AND SAFETY INITIATIVES
During 2011, many of the Group’s businesses implemented a range 
of initiatives aimed at improving health and safety performance, as 
part of the Group’s goal of achieving zero preventable accidents 
and these include: 
•	 Ongoing development within Bridon of a new team meeting 
structure throughout its worldwide locations; at such meetings, 
Bridon’s policy dictates that health and safety should be top of 
the agenda, thus providing suitable forums to discuss relevant 
issues and escalate these to management quickly. As part of 
this approach, a variety of different meetings take place on a 
daily, weekly and monthly basis to discuss a whole range of 
business issues, with the aim of improving visibility, ownership 
and leadership on a site-by-site basis. This structure is already 
in place within Bridon’s European sites and is now being rolled 
out to its sites in the US, Asia and New Zealand. Bridon is also in 
the process of further developing their existing health and safety 
auditing systems.
•	 During 2011, investment of approximately £0.5 million was 
provided to various Bridon facilities to further improve barriers 
designed to segregate walkways from forklift truck usage and to 
improve machine guarding. Melrose PLC

Directors’ report continued
The photograph above shows a ‘level one’ shop floor meeting 
taking place at Bridon’s factory in Willington Quay, near 
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. With heavy industrial processes 
taking place in Bridon’s worldwide locations health and safety 
takes a top priority at daily meetings such as this.
More information about Bridon is available online at 
www.bridon.com
•	 At Turbogenerators, focus continues to be placed on 
driving down the number of accidents within each of its key 
manufacturing locations through the process of cultural change. 
Improved safety committee structures and site safety tours are 
all helping the business to reduce its accident rate. During 2011, 
a full equipment audit took place within Turbogenerators to 
develop a register of machinery that has the potential to cause 
hand arm vibration or noise induced injuries, which will allow 
usage levels to be monitored going forward. Equipment has also 
been identified that either needs to be repaired, recalibrated or 
replaced.
•	 HSS implemented production line process changes during 2011 
in order to reduce the number of manual handling injuries and 
this will continue to be monitored throughout the course of 2012. 
The use of safety eye wear has also been made compulsory 
in certain parts of the Blackwood site in South Wales, together 
with a communication programme to ensure all employees are 
aware of the policy. They have also just implemented an initiative 
in conjunction with some of their sheet metal suppliers to ensure 
that materials arrive in a ‘de-burred’ state, which ensures all 
sharp edges are removed to further reduce the number of cut-
related injuries.
•	 Marelli are currently rolling out an in-house risk perception 
training course for four hundred of its employees at their main 
manufacturing location in Arzignano, Italy. This is designed to 
communicate further the importance of risk reduction and the health 
and safety policies that need to be adhered to whilst on site.
•	 Within several of the US businesses, efforts are being made 
to reduce specific accident causes, such as slips, falls and 
repetitive strain type injuries. Investments include the use of 
non-slip coatings on factory floors and the installation of cranes 
to allow for the safer loading and unloading of heavy materials. 
Additional safety training and awareness programmes have also 
been introduced to assist further in working towards the goal of 
achieving a zero-tolerance approach to preventable accidents.
THE ENVIRONMENT
The Company’s main impact on the environment is through its 
energy use and associated carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions and 
waste. The Directors fully understand the importance of the Group’s 
environmental responsibilities. Each of the Company’s businesses 
are committed to ensuring that their operations have a minimum 
adverse effect on the environment and that ongoing reductions 
in both energy usage and CO 2 emissions are achieved, wherever 
practicable.
Many of the Group’s businesses are developing environmental 
policies and procedures in line with best practice guidelines, via 
ongoing improvements to local processes to reduce the impact of 
their activities. A number of the businesses have achieved, or are 
currently in the process of achieving, the high standards required to 
obtain ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems certification. 
In addition, UK subsidiaries comply with the UK Packaging Waste 
Regulations and REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and 
Restriction of Chemicals), as appropriate.
Although there are no standardised environmental KPIs currently 
used within the Group, each business fully understands the 
importance of monitoring the impact of its operations on the 
environment. A range of KPIs are used as environmental measures, 
including energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, water consumption, 
water contamination, waste disposal, solid and liquid waste 
generation, recycling and volatile organic compound emissions. 
Environmental performance is measured via the use of KPIs in order 
that each of the businesses can plan for ongoing reductions.
ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES
In terms of environmental initiatives that have either been 
completed in 2011, or are ongoing for 2012, there are a variety of 
examples from the Group’s businesses and these include:
•	 Continuing development of a new ‘triple rinse system’ at Bridon’s 
Doncaster, UK site, which is designed to conserve water used 
to rinse products and recover acid. This project was ongoing 
through 2011 and it is hoped the system will be fully operational 
from mid-2012. www.melroseplc.net
Stock code: MRO 47
Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
21012-04   26/03/2012   Proof 6
•	 Planned reduction in the use of hydrochloric acid as a pickling 
agent at Bridon’s Doncaster site. This will be achieved by the 
greater use of mechanical de-scaling and ultra-sonic technology 
using phosphoric acid as the cleaning agent. Phosphoric acid is 
preferred to hydrochloric acid as it does not spontaneously fume 
and therefore no emissions are released into the atmosphere. It is 
anticipated that this project will be completed by the end of 2012.
•	 The installation of variable speed drives on pumps within 
bore hole abstraction wells and the effluent plant at Bridon’s 
Doncaster site was completed during the year. Prior to this, 
such processes had operated on a constant full power setting. 
The benefits of this investment include the reduction of energy 
consumption of up to 65 per cent on the specific processes to 
which the variable speed drives were applied, together with a 30 
per cent reduction in the use of bore hole water, thus conserving 
local water supplies. 
•	 A reduction in waste product is planned at Turbogenerators 
Loughborough, UK site during 2012 by a further commitment to 
recycle not only general waste but also shop floor waste such 
as copper, other metals and plastic. Further workforce training 
will help to ensure recycling figures increase and waste product 
declines going forward. Various other initiatives are also currently 
taking place within Brush to reduce energy consumption, such 
as investment in automatic roller shutter doors to aid heat 
retention, trials of LED energy efficient lighting and an increase in 
the number of lights around the site that are on timers.
•	 Truth have recently made a considerable investment in a new air 
compressor system at their Owatonna, Minnesota, US facility, 
designed to substantially reduce energy consumption; a similar 
investment will be made in Truth’s Canadian facility at Brampton, 
Ontario, during 2012.
•	 At Crosby’s Tulsa, Oklahoma, site in the US, during December 
2011, a sulphuric acid recovery system was installed within the 
galvanizing department. This allows for the acid to be recovered 
and recycled as part of the cleaning process on the galvanizing 
line, thus reducing the amount of hazardous waste generated 
from this operation, as well as providing a significant return on 
the investment. 
•	 A programme to reduce the amount of energy used for lighting 
within Crosby’s site in Tulsa has been very successful, resulting 
in a 50 per cent reduction in energy consumed by such usage. 
Further energy efficient improvements were made, including 
insulation of exterior walls and new energy efficient windows. 
The replacement of old and inefficient pre-heating stations used 
for welding operations was also carried out during the year, with 
the new equipment being 50 per cent more efficient due to the 
reduction in pre-heating times.
•	 Emergency spill kits have been introduced to Crosby’s 
Jacksonville, US site during the year, which will substantially 
improve the containment response time in the event of a large 
spill of hazardous material from the drums used to hold such 
liquids. Training courses were also provided for employees 
working in these areas in relation to the new equipment.
During the year, the Company filed its first Annual Report to the 
Environment Agency to ensure compliance with the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (‘CRC’). This is 
a mandatory climate change and energy saving scheme introduced 
in the UK during April 2010, designed to record the Group’s CO 2 
usage within the UK. The Company will ensure that it continues to 
comply with the ongoing annual reporting requirements of the CRC 
and to further reduce energy consumption wherever possible.
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES
The Directors seek to ensure that all environmental risks are closely 
managed by external environmental specialists in conjunction 
with internal management. The environmental laws of certain 
jurisdictions impose obligations to remediate contaminated sites in 
relation to sites both currently and previously owned by the Group.
The Company Secretary is made aware of all major environmental 
liabilities that may occur within any of the Group’s businesses; 
the Board are also regularly updated on such matters. All costs 
incurred by the Group with regard to environmental liabilities are 
monitored, with provisions being made as appropriate.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company actively encourages ongoing research and 
development within each of its businesses. Investment funds are 
made available for this purpose to ensure that new designs can be 
introduced to market and that existing processes can be further 
enhanced. This helps to ensure that each business unit remains 
at the forefront of technological advances and is able to meet the 
ever-changing demands of its customers. Details of some of the 
new products currently being introduced to the market are included 
within the Chief Executive’s review on pages 12 to 22. Due to the 
nature of the research and development that occurred in 2011, the 
associated costs were expensed during the year rather than being 
capitalised, in line with the Group’s accounting policy on page 71.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Due to the heavy industrial nature of some of the Group activities, 
the Directors recognise that its operations will potentially impact 
on a wide variety of stakeholders in terms of social, environmental 
and ethical matters, including employees, customers, suppliers and 
local communities.
Many of the Group’s businesses have social and ethical policies, 
with responsibility for communication and implementation resting 
with relevant senior divisional managers. Such policies apply and 
extend to local law and standards and as a minimum include equal 
opportunities and anti-discrimination policies.
The majority of the businesses provided community support during 
the year with efforts ranging from charitable donations to voluntary 
assistance and fund raising. 
The Company is committed to continuing to invest in its businesses 
during its ownership, thus enhancing their reputation within the 
markets and communities in which they operate. Melrose PLC

Directors’ report continued
CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL DONATIONS
The Group paid £50,000 (2010: £21,550) to charities during  
the year. There were no political donations made during the year 
(2010: nil).
AUDITOR
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditor is unaware and the Directors have 
taken all the steps which they ought to have taken as Directors to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office 
as auditor. Accordingly, a resolution will be proposed at the AGM of 
the Company to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditor of the Company 
and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Divisional reviews on pages 14 to 22. The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Finance Director’s review on pages 23 to 30. In 
addition, notes 19 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements 
include the Group’s policies and processes for managing its capital, 
exposures to liquidity risk and financial risk management objectives, 
as well as details of its financial instruments and hedging strategies. 
Credit risk exposure is discussed in notes 16 and 24 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Group prepares regular business forecasts and monitors 
projected facility headroom and compliance with its banking 
covenants, which are reviewed by the Board. Forecasts are 
then adjusted for sensitivities which address the principal 
risks to which the Group is exposed, such as fluctuations in 
exchange rates and best estimates of the possible impact of the 
macroeconomic environment on the Group’s underlying trading 
results. Consideration is then given to the potential actions available 
to management to mitigate the impact of one or more of the 
sensitivities.
Taking all this into consideration, the Group should be able to 
operate within the level of its current banking facilities and remain 
covenant compliant for the foreseeable future, being a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial 
statements.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and financial statements.
AGM
The AGM of the Company will be held at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, 
Monkwell Square, Wood Street, London, EC2Y 5BL at 11.00 am 
on 9 May 2012.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code published 
in June 2010, which applies to all accounting periods beginning 
on or after 29 June 2010, all Directors will offer themselves for 
election or re-election at this year’s AGM, as per resolutions 4 
to 10 of the Notice of Meeting shown on pages 118 to 120. 
Following his appointment to the Board on 1 September 2011 and 
in accordance with the Company’s articles of association, Justin 
Dowley will retire and offer himself for election at the AGM as per 
resolution 11 of the Notice of Meeting.
Resolutions dealing with the following special business will be 
proposed at the AGM:
Resolution 13 will seek shareholder approval to renew the 
Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe 
for or convert any securities into shares pursuant to section 551 
of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Section 551 authority’). The 
authority contained in paragraph (A) of the resolution will be limited 
to an aggregate nominal value representing £331,724, being 
approximately one third of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share 
capital, as at 7 March 2012.
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, 
paragraph (B) of this resolution would give the Directors authority to 
allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any securities 
into shares in connection with a rights issue up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £663,448, representing approximately two-thirds 
of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital as at 7 March 
2012, as reduced by the nominal amount of any shares issued 
under paragraph (A) of this resolution.
The Company does not hold any treasury shares.
Resolution 14 will seek to renew the authority conferred on the 
Board to allot equity securities of the Company (or sell any shares 
which the Company may elect to hold in treasury) for cash pursuant 
to section 570 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Section 570 
authority’) without first offering them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their existing shareholdings.
The authority is limited to allotments or sales in connection 
with pre-emptive offers, subject to any arrangements that the 
Directors consider appropriate to deal with fractions and overseas 
requirements, and otherwise up to a maximum nominal value of 
£49,758, representing approximately 5 per cent of the Company’s 
issued Ordinary Share capital as at 7 March 2012, which is in 
accordance with the relevant guidelines for the Company. www.melroseplc.net

21012-04   26/03/2012   Proof 6
If approved, the Section 551 authority and the Section 570 
authority will expire at the conclusion of next year’s AGM or, if 
earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2013. The Directors 
have no present intention of exercising the Section 551 authority or 
the Section 570 authority.
Resolution 15 will seek to renew the authority conferred on the 
Company to purchase its own shares pursuant to sections 693 
and 701 of the Companies Act 2006. This authority is limited to 
an aggregate maximum number of 39,096,104 Ordinary Shares, 
representing 10 per cent of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share 
capital as at 7 March 2012. This power will expire at the conclusion 
of next year’s AGM or, if earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 
2013. The maximum price which may be paid for an Ordinary Share 
will be an amount which is not more than 5 per cent above the 
average of the middle market quotation for an Ordinary Share as 
derived from the London Stock Exchange plc’s Daily Official List for 
the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the 
Ordinary Share is purchased. The Directors have no present intention 
of exercising all or any of the powers conferred by this resolution and 
will only exercise their authority if it is in the interests of shareholders 
generally.
Resolution 16 will seek shareholder approval to allow the Company 
to continue to call general meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 clear 
days’ notice. In accordance with the Companies (Shareholders’ 
Rights) Regulations 2009 the notice period required for general 
meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a 
shorter notice period (subject to a minimum period of 14 clear days). 
AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, 
when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. In 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company must 
make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for 
that meeting in order to be able to call a general meeting on less 
than 21 clear days’ notice. 
RECOMMENDATIONS
The Board believes that each of the resolutions to be proposed 
at the AGM is in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously 
recommend that ordinary shareholders vote in favour of all of the 
resolutions proposed, as they intend to do in respect of their own 
beneficial holdings.

Corporate Governance report
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Board of Directors remains committed to maintaining the 
high standards of corporate governance required to ensure the 
Company can continue to deliver its long term strategic goals 
for shareholders. As part of this approach, the Board supports 
the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “UK 
Code”), which replaced the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance with effect from financial years beginning on or after  
29 June 2010.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good 
governance. Throughout the year ended 31 December 2011, the 
Company complied with the provisions of the UK Code and with 
the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (‘DTR’) 
on audit committees and corporate governance statements. The 
statements below describe how the Company has applied the 
principles identified in the UK Code and DTR directives.
THE BOARD
Members:   Christopher Miller, Executive Chairman
 David Roper, Chief Executive
 Simon Peckham, Chief Operating Officer
 Geoffrey Martin, Group Finance Director
 Perry Crosthwaite, Non-executive Director
 Justin Dowley, Non-executive Director
 John Grant, Non-executive Director
 Miles Templeman, Senior non-executive Director
All of the above Directors served throughout the year, with the 
exception of Justin Dowley who was appointed as a non-executive 
Director on 1 September 2011.
THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES:
•	 effectively manage and control the Company via a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision;
•	 determine and review Company strategy and policy;
•	 consider acquisitions, disposals and asset requests for major 
capital expenditure;
•	 review trading performance;
•	 ensure that adequate funding and personnel are in place;
•	 maintain sound internal control systems; and
•	 report to shareholders and give consideration to all other 
significant financial matters.
Board responsibilities are undertaken in conjunction with senior 
management, who in turn are responsible for the day-to-day 
conduct of the Group’s operations and for reporting to the Board 
on items of significance and progress against objectives. The Board 
meets regularly during the year as well as on an ad hoc basis as 
required by time critical business needs. There were four scheduled 
Board meetings held during the year and the attendance of each of 
the Directors is shown on page 54.
BOARD BALANCE, INDEPENDENCE AND PERFORMANCE
The Board believes that the Directors possess diverse business 
experience in areas complementary to the activities of the 
Company; this position has been enhanced further by the 
appointment of Justin Dowley during the year. Biographies of 
the Directors are shown on pages 36 and 37. These biographies 
identify any other appointments held by the Directors. The only 
executive Director to hold non-executive Director appointments 
elsewhere is Christopher Miller, who is a non-executive Director of 
TMO Renewables Limited and is allowed to retain the remuneration 
he receives from that appointment.
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Code, consideration 
has been given to the independence of all the non-executive 
Directors; the Board considers all the non-executive Directors to 
be independent. The non-executive Directors are not entitled to 
any bonus or shares under the 2009 Incentive Share Scheme. 
Performance of the Board and each Committee is evaluated 
annually. 
As part of the performance appraisal process both the executive 
and non-executive Directors are required to complete performance 
questionnaires on an annual basis in relation to the Board, its three 
committees of audit, remuneration and nomination and their fellow 
Directors. All responses are reviewed and collated by the Company 
Secretary before further action is taken, as necessary. This process 
also helps to determine if any of the Directors have any specific 
training requirements.
The Chairman has held meetings with the Directors, including the 
senior independent non-executive Director, Miles Templeman, to 
discuss the performance of individual executive Directors and the 
Board as a whole. It was considered that the individual Directors 
and the Board as a whole were operating effectively. The non-
executive Directors, led by Miles Templeman, the senior non-
executive Director, are responsible for the performance evaluation 
of the Chairman and as part of this process also took account of 
the views of the executive Directors.
The Board are currently considering the impact on the performance 
evaluation process with respect to the new requirement under the 
UK Code to carry out externally facilitated performance evaluations 
at least every three years. The Company has therefore not yet 
carried out an external evaluation of its Directors’ performance. 
The Nomination Committee currently takes into account a variety 
of factors before recommending any new appointments to the 
Board, including relevant skills to perform in the role, experience, 
knowledge, ethnicity and gender. The most important priority of the 
Nomination Committee has been, and will continue to be, ensuring 
that the best candidate is selected to join the Board and this 
approach will remain in place going forward. 51

Shareholder information Financials Business performance Governance
New Directors joining the Board receive a formal and tailored 
induction shortly after their appointment. Directors are advised 
that they have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied 
with. The Board may seek independent legal and financial advice in 
the furtherance of its duties, at the Company’s expense.
A pack of briefing papers and an agenda are provided to each 
Director in advance of each scheduled Board or standing 
Committee meeting. The Directors are able to seek further 
clarification and information on any matter from any other Director 
or employee of the Group whenever necessary. Decisions are 
taken by the Board in conjunction with the recommendations of its 
Committees and advice from external consultants, advisers and 
senior management.
DIRECTOR TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The terms and conditions of the executive Directors’ service 
contracts and the non-executive Directors’ appointments are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. The 
non-executive Directors’ appointment letters are also available on 
the Company’s website: www.melroseplc.net.
ANNUAL RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
In previous years, one third of the Company’s Directors have 
been subject to retirement by rotation with a requirement then 
to offer themselves for re-election. However, going forward and 
notwithstanding the Company’s Articles, the Board has determined 
that all Directors of the Company will stand for election or re-
election at the forthcoming AGM and annually thereafter, in 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Code.
The Board and Nomination Committee have carefully considered 
the time commitments required and the contribution made by 
each Director. Both the Nomination Committee and the Board are 
of the belief that the performance of each executive and non-
executive Director continues to be effective and that each Director 
demonstrates commitment to his role.
CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF ExECUTIVE
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive of the Company 
are, and will remain, separate and distinct from one another in 
accordance with best practice and Board policy.
The Chairman alone is responsible for leadership of the Board. 
Responsibility for ensuring effective communications with 
shareholders rests with the Chairman and other executive Directors. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for strategic direction and 
decisions involving the day-to-day management of the Company. 
These respective responsibilities are set out in writing and have 
been approved by the Board, which considers that the respective 
roles and responsibilities are clearly understood by both individuals 
and by the Board as a whole.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Code, the Board 
has three standing Committees: the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees. Each of these includes the four 
independent non-executive Directors. The duties of the Committees 
are set out in formal terms of reference. These are available from

AUDIT COMMITTEE
Members:      John Grant, Chairman (from 6 March 2012)
       Perry Crosthwaite
                     Justin Dowley
                     Miles Templeman (Chairman to 6 March 2012)
MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES:
•	 review and monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the 
Group, including its interim accounts, the annual report, interim 
management and preliminary statements and any other formal 
announcements relating to the financial performance of the 
Group;
•	 keep under review the effectiveness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, internal controls, risk management systems and 
compliance controls;
•	 focus and challenge the consistency of accounting policies, 
methods used to account for significant or unusual transactions 
and compliance with accounting standards;
•	 review the Group’s arrangements for its employees to raise 
concerns in confidence about possible wrongdoing in financial 
reporting, in accordance with the Company’s whistleblowing 
policy; and
•	 develop, implement and monitor the Group’s policy on external 
audit and for overseeing the objectivity and effectiveness of the 
auditor.
Each member of the Audit Committee brings relevant financial 
experience from senior executive and non-executive positions as 
described in their biographies on pages 36 and 37.
The Audit Committee invites the Group Finance Director, the Head 
of Financial Reporting and senior representatives of the external 
and internal auditors to attend meetings as appropriate to the 
business being considered. The Audit Committee has the right 
to invite any other employees to attend meetings where this is 
considered appropriate. In addition, the Audit Committee meets 
at least once per year with both the external and internal auditors, 
without management present.
The Audit Committee is expected to meet not less than three times 
a year and the Audit Committee met three times during 2011. The 
attendance of its members, along with the Group Finance Director, 
is shown in the table on page 54.
GROUP AUDITOR
The Group’s external auditor is recommended for reappointment by 
the Audit Committee, which also assesses the appropriateness of 
the scope of audit work performed and provides recommendations 
in respect of their remuneration and terms of engagement. The 
Audit Committee receives regular reports from the Group’s external 
auditor.
The Audit Committee has a policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor for the supply of non-audit services. In accordance 
with best practice FRC guidelines, which apply from 30 April 2011 
onwards, the Company policy in relation to non-audit services 
is kept under regular review; the policy outlines which non-audit 
services are pre-approved, which services require the prior approval 
of the Audit Committee and which services the auditor is excluded 
from providing.
During 2011, the main non-audit services provided by Deloitte LLP 
were in relation to taxation compliance, tax planning, corporate 
finance (which includes work carried out around the sale of 
Dynacast and aborted purchase of Charter International plc) and 
UK pensions.
The Audit Committee carries out regular reviews to ensure that 
auditor objectivity and independence is maintained at all times. 
A different senior partner carries out the taxation audit of the 
Company compared to those working on the non-audit taxation 
services. With regard to corporate finance services a separate 
team, which was independent from the audit team was used within 
Deloitte LLP to carry out this work. The non-audit work provided 
on pensions was performed either by a different senior partner 
to those involved in audit work, or by independent actuaries who 
have no links with Deloitte LLP . Based on these strict procedures 
the Audit Committee remains confident that auditor objectivity and 
independence has been maintained but accepts that non-audit 
work should be controlled to ensure that it does not compromise 
the auditor’s position.
Deloitte LLP was appointed in 2003. At each year end, Deloitte 
LLP submits a letter setting out how it believes its independence 
and objectivity have been maintained. They are also required to 
rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group and subsidiary 
audits every five years. The Group’s audit signing partner changed 
as part of that rotation process in 2010. There are no contractual 
obligations that restrict the Group’s capacity to recommend a 
particular firm for appointment as auditor.
INTERNAL AUDIT PROGRAMME
Due to the size and complexity of the Group, it is appropriate for an 
internal audit programme to be used within the business. BM Howarth, 
an external firm, provides internal audit services to the Group. A 
rotation programme is in place, such that every business unit will have 
an internal audit at least once every three years, with the largest sites 
being reviewed at least once every two years. The rotation programme 
allows divisional management’ s actions and responses to be followed 
up on a timely basis. During the year, BM Howarth also carried out an 
audit of the Group’ s central head office functions. 
The internal auditor’s remit includes assessment of the effectiveness 
of internal control systems, compliance with the Group’s 
Policies and Procedures Manual and a review of the businesses’ 
Balance Sheets. A report of key findings and recommendations 
is presented to the Group Finance Director, Head of Financial 
Reporting and Group Operations Controller, followed by a meeting  53
21012-04   26/03/2012   Proof 6
www.melroseplc.net
Stock code: MRO
Shareholder information Financials Business performance Governance
to discuss key findings and resulting action points. BM Howarth 
also presented their key findings to the Audit Committee twice 
during the year. Review of the internal audit process and scope 
of work covered by the internal auditor is the responsibility of the 
Audit Committee, to ensure their objectives, level of authority and 
resources are appropriate for the nature of the businesses under 
review. A report of significant findings is presented by the internal 
auditor to the Committee at each meeting and implementation of 
recommendations by the Board are followed up at the subsequent 
Committee meeting.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Members:     Perry Crosthwaite, Chairman
                     Justin Dowley
                     John Grant
                     Miles Templeman
MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES:
•	 annually review remuneration trends across the Group and obtain 
reliable and up-to-date information about the remuneration of 
Directors and senior employees in other companies;
•	 consider and make recommendations to the Board on the 
framework for the remuneration of the Company’s executive 
Directors, the Company Secretary and other senior employees;
•	 ensure the executive Directors and senior employees are 
provided with appropriate annual incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and that they are rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success of the Company; and
•	 approve the structure of, and determine targets for, any long 
term incentive plans operated by the Company.
In developing its recommendations, the Committee has given due 
consideration to Schedule 8 of Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Remuneration Committee is expected to meet not less than 
twice a year and during 2011 the Remuneration Committee met 
twice. The attendance of its members is shown in the table on page 
54. The report to shareholders on how Directors are remunerated, 
together with details of individual Directors’ remuneration is shown 
in the Remuneration report on pages 56 to 59.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Members:     Miles Templeman, Chairman
                     Perry Crosthwaite
                     Justin Dowley
                     John Grant
                     Christopher Miller
MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES:
•	 keep the size, structure and composition of the Board under 
regular review and recommend to the Board any adjustments as 
may be necessary from time to time;
•	 give full consideration to succession planning to ensure an 
optimum balance of executive and non-executive Directors in 
terms of skills, experience and diversity;
•	 keep under review the leadership needs of the business; and
•	 keep up to date and fully informed about strategic issues and 
commercial changes affecting the Company and the markets in 
which it operates.
As one of the main responsibilities of the Nomination Committee 
is to recommend any adjustments to the size or structure of the 
Board, it was involved in the recruitment of Justin Dowley, who 
was appointed as a non-executive Director on 1 September 2011. 
Prior to Justin’s appointment the Committee agreed upon a specific 
recruitment process. This included the development of a candidate 
specification which set out the required skills, qualifications and 
experience followed by a thorough interview process.
The Nomination Committee is expected to meet not less than twice 
a year and during 2011 the Nomination Committee met three times. 
The attendance of its members is shown in the table overleaf.
The Nomination Committee uses external search consultants as 
appropriate.
ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS
The table over the page shows the attendance of each of the 
Directors at the scheduled and significant meetings of the Board 
and its standing Committees held during the year. The quorum 
necessary for the transaction of business by the Board and 
each of its standing Committees is two. Briefing papers and 
meeting agendas are provided to each Director in advance of 
each meeting. Decisions are taken by the Board in conjunction 
with the recommendations of its Committees and advice from 
external advisers and senior management as appropriate. The 
representations of any Director who is unable to attend a meeting 
of the Board or a standing Committee are duly considered by those 
Directors in attendance. 54

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Objectives and policy
The objectives of the Directors and senior management are to 
safeguard and increase the value of the business and assets of the 
Group. Achievement of their objectives requires the development 
of policies and appropriate internal control frameworks to ensure 
the Group’s resources are managed properly and any key risks are 
identified and mitigated where possible.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s overall system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, while the 
role of management is to implement the policies set by the 
Board in respect of risk management and controls. The Directors 
recognise that the systems and processes established by the 
Board are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and cannot provide absolute 
assurance against material financial misstatement or loss.
The Board is committed to satisfying the internal control guidance 
for Directors set out in the revised version of the Turnbull Guidance 
on Internal Control. In accordance with this guidance, there is an 
ongoing process, regularly reviewed by the Directors, for identifying, 
evaluating, managing and mitigating (where possible) the significant 
risks faced by the Group. This process for reviewing the Group’s 
internal controls is consistent with prior years and has been in place 
throughout the 2011 financial year and up to the date of approval of 
this Annual Report.
Managing and controlling risk
The Group has policies which address a number of key business 
risks, including strategic, operational, compliance, ethical and 
financial risks. A summary of some of the strategic and operational 
risks and uncertainties that could impact on the Company’s 
performance is set out on pages 31 to 33. The Group’s financial 
risk management objectives and policies are also described in the 
Finance Director’s review on pages 23 to 30. Further information 
can also be found in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 12 to 
22, and the Directors’ report on pages 38 to 49.
The Group operates on a de-centralised basis and the Board 
has established an organisational structure with clear reporting 
procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority. Divisional 
senior management, plant managers and financial controllers have 
been delegated responsibility by the Board for the establishment 
and implementation of detailed control systems as appropriate for 
their business.
An established programme of regular review is in place at the 
businesses and a culture of continuous improvement is encouraged 
by the Board through regular meetings with senior management, 
review of operating performance and progress against business 
plans. The ongoing process of review provides assurance that the 
control environment is operating as intended.
The Audit Committee also monitors the effectiveness of the 
internal control processes implemented across the Group 
through review of the key findings presented by the external and 
internal auditors and discussions with senior management on 
an ad-hoc basis. The Board is responsible for considering Audit 
Committee recommendations in respect of internal controls and 
risk management and ensuring implementation by management of 
those recommendations it deems appropriate for the business.
Internal financial controls
The Group has a comprehensive system for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal financial controls, 
including strategic business planning and regular monitoring and 
reporting of financial performance. A detailed annual budget is 
prepared by senior management and thereafter is reviewed and 
formally adopted by the Board. The budget and other targets are 
regularly updated via a rolling forecast process and regular business 
review meetings are held involving senior management to assess 
performance. The results of these reviews are in turn reported to 
and discussed by the Board at each meeting. 55

Shareholder information Financials Business performance Governance
As discussed in the Audit Committee section on pages 52 and 
53 of this report, BM Howarth is the Group’s internal auditor. A 
total of 21 businesses have been visited during the year, including 
the Group’s central head office functions, and the Directors are 
pleased to report that there were no material deficiencies and 
that the majority of recommendations presented in the internal 
auditor reports have now been, or are in the process of being 
implemented. A further 23 businesses are planned for review during 
2012.
The Board confirms that, from the review of internal controls, it  
has not determined any significant failings or weaknesses that  
it considers require remedial action. The Board also confirms that 
it has not been advised of any material weaknesses in the internal 
control systems that relate to financial reporting.
wHISTLEBLOwING, ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION 
POLICIES
During the year, the Company updated its anti-bribery and 
corruption policy in accordance with the Bribery Act 2010 (the 
‘2010 Act’), which came into force on 1 July 2011. As part of 
this process, a full audit of each Group business was carried out 
in which key risks were identified and mitigating actions agreed. 
The results of the audit confirmed that additional procedures were 
required within some of the Group businesses in relation to the 
use of sales agents who operate in high risk areas of the world, 
together with the general development of stricter policies and 
procedures when trading in certain territories for the first time. 
Additional procedures have also been developed with regard to gift, 
hospitality and charitable donation registers. 
In order to ensure compliance with the 2010 Act, the Company 
developed a specific training and communication process to ensure 
all relevant senior employees were aware of the Group’s policy and 
their individual obligations in helping to ensure adherence. This 
process involved the development of a specific internally designed 
training portal for use by relevant employees within the Group. 
An internal review process has also been incorporated into the 
annual audit programme carried out by BM Howarth, to ensure 
ongoing compliance to the Group policy. As an addition to this, 
each business is required to provide an annual confirmation to the 
Company that it has fully complied with the Group’s anti-bribery 
and corruption policy.
The Group’s anti-bribery and corruption policy applies to all 
Directors, employees (whether permanent, fixed-term, or 
temporary), pension trustees, consultants and other business 
advisers, contractors, trainees, volunteers, business agents, 
distributors, joint venture partners, or any other person working for 
or performing a service on behalf of the Company, its subsidiaries 
and associated companies in which it has a majority interest.
Responsibility for anti-corruption policies and procedures rests with 
the Board of Directors. It is tasked with ensuring that adequate 
internal financial controls and record keeping is in place within the 
Group in order to minimise the risk of bribery and corruption.
The Company also updated its whistleblowing policy during the 
year, as part of the anti-bribery and corruption communication 
process within the Group. This enables individuals to make 
protected disclosures to their divisional human resources manager, 
Group Company Secretary or the senior non-executive Director 
if they have concerns about possible improprieties in financial 
reporting or other malpractices within their business.
COMMUNICATIONS wITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company seeks to build on a mutual understanding of 
objectives with its institutional shareholders, via the executive 
Directors, through regular meetings and presentations following 
announcements of its annual and interim results. The non-executive 
Directors are available to meet institutional shareholders should 
there be unresolved matters they wish to bring to their attention. 
The views of key analysts and major shareholders are fed back 
to the Board directly by individual Directors, or via the Company’s 
brokers. This helps to ensure that all members of the Board 
develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders. 
Corporate information is available on the Company’s website, 
www.melroseplc.net.
The Board welcomes the attendance of shareholders at the 
AGM. The number of proxy votes cast for and against each of the 
resolutions proposed is announced at the AGM and a summary will 
be provided shortly after the AGM, on the Company’s website.

Annual Report 2011
Remuneration report
INTRODUCTION AND COMPLIANCE
The Directors’ Remuneration report has been prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board. The report 
has been drawn up in accordance with relevant sections of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, 
the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
A resolution inviting shareholders to approve the report will be put 
to the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2012.
The Remuneration report is divided into two parts. The first part 
contains commentary on remuneration policy, which is not required 
to be audited. The second part contains details of the Directors’ 
remuneration, which has been audited in accordance with the 
relevant statutory requirements.
Biographies of the Directors are shown on pages 36 and 37. These 
biographies identify any other significant appointments held by the 
Directors.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION:
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Perry Crosthwaite, 
an independent non-executive Director. Miles Templeman, John 
Grant and Justin Dowley (appointed on 1 September 2011), the 
other three independent non-executive Directors, complete the 
Committee.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are 
posted on the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s 
website (www.melroseplc.net) and are also available from the 
Company Secretary at the registered office address. Page 53 of 
the Corporate Governance report sets out the functions of the 
Remuneration Committee.
REMUNERATION POLICY
Remuneration packages are reviewed regularly and changes are 
effective from 1 January each year. The Remuneration Committee 
and its advisers use a number of third party remuneration surveys 
from which to obtain remuneration data in order to carry out 
benchmarking exercises.
The remuneration package for all executive Directors comprises 
base salary and benefits, annual bonus, long term incentive 
arrangements and pension contributions as described within this 
report. Some senior employees of the Group are also entitled to 
bonuses and long term incentive arrangements as noted below.
ExECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND OTHER SENIOR EMPLOYEES
The Board establishes the remuneration policy based on 
the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee. The 
remuneration policy adopted by the Company requires the package 
offered to any executive Director or senior employee to be sufficient 
to attract, retain and motivate management of a suitable quality, but 
not to be more than is necessary for this purpose. It is intended that 
performance related pay should comprise a significant proportion of 
the total remuneration package.
NON-ExECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The executive Directors are responsible for proposing the non-
executive Directors’ fees. In proposing such fees they take account 
of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar sized listed 
companies within the Company’s listing sector, as well as the time 
commitment and responsibility of the role. Any decisions regarding 
fee changes are taken by the executive Directors as a whole and 
non-executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their 
own remuneration. Non-executive Directors do not receive other 
taxable benefits or pension contributions from the Group.
BASE SALARY AND BENEFITS
The Remuneration Committee gives consideration to both the 
performance of the individual during the period of review and of 
current market salaries for equivalent roles based on independently 
sourced market information.
The salaries of all executive Directors and the senior management 
team are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee prior to the 
beginning of each year. Base salaries for 2011 were reviewed 
in December 2010. In January 2011, each of the executive and 
non-executive Directors received an inflationary increase of three 
per cent. In addition, a further inflationary increase of three per cent 
was awarded in December 2011, effective from January 2012.
The executive Directors also receive a company car allowance, fuel 
allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and permanent 
health insurance cover. Mr Martin also receives paid train travel to 
and from London and accommodation for working in London.
ANNUAL BONUSES
Bonus scheme arrangements are in place for executive Directors 
and senior management. The maximum bonus payable is 100 
per cent of base salary. The annual bonus scheme has two 
components, up to 80 per cent of base salary is payable based 
on diluted earnings per share growth and the remaining 20 per 
cent is discretionary. The discretionary element is payable based 
on the Remuneration Committee considering a range of financial 
and non-financial factors including working capital management 
and cash generation, overhead cost control, liability management, 
health and safety improvements and any other factors which the 
Remuneration Committee considers to be relevant. The Chairman 
does not participate in the annual bonus scheme and the same 
will also apply to the Executive Vice-Chairman with effect from the 
Company’s AGM on 9 May 2012.
LONG TERM INCENTIVES
Long term incentives are granted to Directors and other senior 
employees in order to promote the success of the Company. The 
long term incentive arrangements currently in place are structured 
to ensure that participants are only rewarded for growth in the 
underlying value of the business in order to align the interests of the 
Directors with those of the Company’s shareholders. 57

Stock code: MRO
Shareholder information Financials Business performance Governance
During 2011 the Group operated the following long term incentive 
schemes:
•	 2009 Incentive Share Scheme
•	 Divisional long term incentive plans
•	 FKI cash long term incentive plan
2009 INCENTIVE SHARE SCHEME
The 2009 Incentive Share Scheme (the ‘2009 Scheme’) was 
approved by shareholders at a General Meeting held in May 2009; 
it replaced the 2007 Incentive Share Scheme and as at 7 March 
2012 continues to ensure the interests of the executive Directors 
and senior employees are aligned with those of shareholders by 
only rewarding participants if shareholder value is created. The 
executive Directors and five other senior employees are the only 
participants in the 2009 Scheme, as at 7 March 2012.
Participants of the 2009 Scheme are entitled to either a cash 
dividend or a number of Ordinary Shares, equal in value to 10 
per cent of the increase in shareholder value from 18 July 2007 
to 31 May 2012, or earlier upon a takeover of the Company (the 
‘trigger date’). The increase in shareholder value is calculated as 
the difference between the market capitalisation on the trigger 
date (determined by reference to the average market price of an 
Ordinary Share over 40 business days prior to the trigger date, or 
the offer price as appropriate) and the net invested capital in the 
Company. The net invested capital is the issued share capital at  
18 July 2007, plus any amounts paid up for the issue of new 
Ordinary Shares, less all dividend payments or other distributions 
made by the Company in respect of its Ordinary Shares, as 
adjusted in line with the movement in the RPI (plus 2 per cent per 
annum).
As at 31 December 2011, the fair value attributable to the 2009 
Incentive Shares (including those held by the Employee Benefit 
Trust) was £99.4 million (2010: £70.7 million), of which £86.5 million 
(2010: £61.5 million) was attributable to the executive Directors. 
Details of the Directors’ beneficial interest in the 2009 Incentive 
Shares as at 7 March 2012 are shown in the table of Directors’ 
shareholdings later in this report.
As at 7 March 2012, the Melrose Employee Benefit Trust held 500 
of the 2009 Incentive Shares.
DIVISIONAL LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
Divisional long term incentive plans have been implemented for 
certain divisional senior managers. It is the intention of the Board 
that participants will receive a cash payment upon the sale of a 
division or based upon financial performance as measured by 
growth in operating profit from the date of the FKI acquisition in July 
2008, through to variable end dates which vary by business.
FKI CASH LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The cash long term incentive plan for senior management of the 
FKI businesses ended on 31 March 2011. It was replaced by 
the divisional long term incentive plan arrangements for certain 
divisional senior managers, as mentioned above.
PENSION
No Director is a member of any Group pension arrangement. The 
executive Directors may elect to receive a Company contribution 
to their individual pension arrangement, or a supplement to base 
salary in lieu of a pension arrangement. Company contributions are 
calculated on base salary only.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Consistent with the best practice guidance provided by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Company’s policy is for 
Directors’ service contracts to be terminable on a maximum of 
one year’s notice. Directors’ service contracts do not provide for 
pre-determined compensation in the event of termination. Any 
payments made would be subject to normal contractual principles, 
including mitigation as appropriate. The length of service for any 
one executive Director is not defined and is subject to both the 
requirements of annual re-elections under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but 
have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years, which 
may be renewed by mutual agreement. Generally, a non-executive 
Director may be appointed for up to a further two periods of three 
years after the initial three year period has expired. The terms of 
appointment do not contain any contractual provisions regarding a 
notice period or the right to receive compensation in the event of 
early termination.
Details of the Directors’ appointment or reappointment dates and 
notice periods are as set out below:

DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDINGS
Ordinary Shares
Following the sale of the Company’s Dynacast business and subsequent return of £373.2 million to shareholders, a share consolidation and 
sub-division took place on 8 August 2011 pursuant to which every 14 Ordinary Shares of 0.2p nominal value in the capital of the Company 
(‘Old Ordinary Shares’) were converted into 11 Ordinary Shares of 14/55p nominal value in the capital of the Company (‘New Ordinary 
Shares’) (the ‘Share Capital Consolidation’). The information in the table below shows the Directors’ beneficial interests, including interests of 
connected persons (within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006), in the New Ordinary Shares of the Company as at  
31 December 2011. Holdings at the start of the period and prior to the Share Capital Consolidation are shown as Old Ordinary Shares.

Shareholder information Financials Business performance Governance
The source data for the graph on the previous page assumes that the £220 million of cash returned to shareholders in August 2007, 
following the McKechnie Aerospace and PSM Fasteners disposals, together with the £373.2 million that was approved to be returned 
to shareholders in August 2011 following the sale of Dynacast, was reinvested to purchase shares in the Company. This results in an 
adjustment factor on the price and this factor is used in ongoing calculations of shareholder return for the Company, as ordinarily a return of 
capital would reduce the share price and an analysis of returns going forward would not reflect value already returned to shareholders. The 
benefit of any cash distribution is thereby reflected within the shareholder return performance of the Company.

Melrose PLC
Annual Report 2011
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
chosen to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under Company law the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
•	 the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, Finance 
Director’s review and Directors’ report include a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Auditor’s report on the  
consolidated financial statements
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Melrose PLC
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Melrose 
PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the 
consolidated Income Statement, the consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flows, the consolidated Balance Sheet, the consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 30. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as

Notes to the financial statements
1. Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Melrose PLC (‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised in accordance 
with a resolution of the Directors of Melrose PLC on 7 March 2012.
Melrose PLC (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 121. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company is based. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
The comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2010 in these financial statements has been restated to include the results 
and cash flows of the Dynacast segment along with four businesses previously shown in the Other Industrial segment; namely Brush 
Traction, Logistex UK, Madico and Weber Knapp, within discontinued operations.
1.1 New Standards and Interpretations affecting amounts, presentation or disclosure reported in the current period
During the period, the Group adopted three new or revised Standards and Interpretations, none of which significantly affected the amounts 
reported in these financial statements. Details of the Standards and Interpretations that were adopted are set out in section 1.2.
1.2  New Standards and Interpretations adopted with no significant effect on financial statements
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements, but may impact the accounting for future transactions and 
arrangements.
IAS 24 (revised): Related party disclosures
Amendments to IFRIC 14: Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010
1.3  New Standards and Interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations are in issue but not yet effective:
Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of items of other comprehensive income
Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred tax — recovery of underlying assets
IAS 19 (revised): Employee benefits
IAS 27 (revised): Separate financial statements 
IAS 28 (revised): Investments in associates and joint ventures 
Amendments to IFRS 7: Financial instruments disclosures
IFRS 9: Financial instruments
IFRS 10: Consolidated financial statements
IFRS 11: Joint arrangements
IFRS 12: Disclosure of interest in other entities
IFRS 13: Fair value measurement
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements in the period of initial application, except as follows:
IAS 19 (revised) will impact the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation 
and associated disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. Following the adoption of IAS 19 (revised), effective from 1 January 2013, 
the net retirement benefit obligation in the Balance Sheet will not be impacted but the net finance cost of pensions, within the Income 
Statement, will increase. This will reduce profit for the year and accordingly increase Other Comprehensive Income. 69

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’). The 
consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments which are recognised at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for 
these assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are consistent with the prior year and are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the parent undertaking and all of its subsidiary undertakings. The results of businesses 
acquired during the period are included from the effective date of acquisition and for those sold during the period to the effective date of 
disposal. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the Group. All inter-Group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, 
have been eliminated in full.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interest of non-controlling shareholders 
is initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportion of the share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-
controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this 
results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ statement of going concern on page 48 of the 
Directors’ report.
Business combinations and goodwill
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value of assets given, 
the liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange of control and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Costs directly attributable to business combinations are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred. 
The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition except those where specific guidance 
is provided by IFRSs. Non-current assets and directly attributable liabilities that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5: 
‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’, are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. Also, deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12: ‘Income taxes’, liabilities and assets related to employee benefit 
arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19: ‘Employee benefits’ and liabilities or equity instruments related to the 
replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payments awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2: ‘Share-based payments’. 
Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts where appropriate. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional 
assets or liabilities recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, 
if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum period of one year.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the acquirer’s interest 
in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. Melrose PLC

21012-04   26/03/2012   Proof 6
Notes to the financial statements continued
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units acquired. Impairment is determined 
by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement and is not subsequently 
reversed. When there is a disposal of a cash-generating unit, goodwill relating to the operation disposed of is taken into account in 
determining the gain or loss on disposal of that operation. The amount of goodwill allocated to a partial disposal is measured on the basis of 
the relative values of the operation disposed of and the operation retained.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity which is not a subsidiary undertaking but the interest of the Group is that of a partner in a business over which the 
Group exercises joint control. The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Where percentage of completion accounting is applied and where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, 
revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the Balance Sheet date. This is normally 
measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except 
where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included 
to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs 
incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest applicable.
Exceptional costs/income
Exceptional costs/income are those costs/income of a significant and non-recurring nature or those associated with significant restructuring 
programmes, acquisitions or disposals.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after exceptional operating costs and income, intangible asset amortisation and the Group’s share of results of joint 
ventures, but before finance income and finance costs.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets 
are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans
The finance cost recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the issue costs of borrowings is allocated to periods over the terms of 
the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, and any costs directly attributable to bring the asset into 
operation. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to 
acquire the asset.  71

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold land nil 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property over expected economic life not exceeding 50 years
Short leasehold property over the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3–12 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are 
accounted for prospectively.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists an impairment review is performed and, where the carrying values 
exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of property, 
plant and equipment is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds or costs and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the Income Statement in the year that the item is derecognised.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
On acquisition of businesses, separately identifiable intangible assets are determined in relation to the specific circumstances of the business 
acquired and are valued on an appropriate basis.
Access to the use of patented technology and trade names are valued using a ‘relief from royalty’ method which determines the net present 
value of future additional cash flows arising from the use of the intangible asset.
Customer relationships are valued on the basis of the net present value of the future additional cash flows arising from customer 
relationships with appropriate allowance for attrition of customers.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are:
Computer software 5 years or less
Patented technology 5 years or less
Customer relationships 10 years or less
Trade names 20 years or less
Computer software is initially recorded at cost. Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair 
value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Where these have been acquired other than through a business combination, the initial cost is 
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Computer software assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are measured on a similar basis to property, plant and equipment. Useful lives are 
also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to clearly defined and identifiable development projects are capitalised when there is a technical degree of exploitation, 
adequacy of resources and a potential market or development possibility in the undertaking that are recognisable; and where it is the 
intention to produce, market or execute the project. A correlation must also exist between the costs incurred and future benefits and those 
costs can be measured reliably. Capitalised expenses are expensed on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Costs not meeting such 
criteria are expensed as incurred. Melrose PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all direct expenditure and appropriate production overhead 
expenditure incurred in bringing goods to their current state under normal operating conditions. Net realisable value is based on estimated 
selling price less costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. Provisions have been made for obsolescence or other expected 
losses where necessary.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are measured and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. The carrying amount of other receivables is reduced by the impairment loss directly and a charge is recorded in the Income 
Statement. For trade receivables, the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account and changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are 
recognised in the Income Statement.
Trade receivables that are assessed not to be impaired individually are also assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective 
evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting receipts, an increase in the 
number of delayed receipts in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic 
conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions and short-
term deposits which are readily convertible to cash which are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
For the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised 
at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding 
liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance 
charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life 
of the asset or the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental 
income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest 
method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant periods. The 
effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments throughout the expected life of the financial liability, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity risks, arising 
from operating and financing activities. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Details of 
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 24 of the financial statements. Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are detailed 
in note 25. 73

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. Their fair value is recalculated at each reporting date. The accounting 
treatment for the resulting gain or loss will depend on whether the derivative meets the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on the revaluation to fair value at the period 
end are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Where derivatives do meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, recognition 
of any resulting gain or loss on revaluation depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of less than one year from the period end date are classified as current in the  
Balance Sheet. 
Hedge accounting
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged 
and the hedging instrument and to show that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed 
at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations.
Fair value hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the 
Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.  
Cash flow hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to the variability in cash flows that 
are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted cash flow. 
The effective portion of any gain or loss from revaluing the derivative financial instrument is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and accumulated in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.  
Amounts previously recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are recycled to the Income 
Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement or the hedged relationship is discontinued.  
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains 
and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations.  
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from revaluing the derivative at a reporting period end is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is disposed of or 
the hedged relationship is discontinued.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Environmental liabilities
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognised when environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated costs 
can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action. The 
amount recognised is the best estimate of the expenditure required. Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount 
recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure. Melrose PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the associated 
services are rendered by employees of the Group. The accounting policy for pensions and other retirement benefits is described below.
The Group also operates long term incentive plans (LTIPs) for Directors and certain employees. The expected settlement costs of these 
plans are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the plans.
Pensions and other retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans, some of which require contributions to be made to 
administered funds separate from the Group. In some jurisdictions, funds are not administered separately from the Group but appropriate 
liabilities are recognised in the Balance Sheet.
For the defined benefit pension and retirement benefit plans, plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are measured on an 
actuarial basis, using the projected unit credit method and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high 
quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the plan liabilities. Any assets resulting from this calculation are limited to past 
service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The service cost of providing pension and other retirement benefits to employees for the period is charged to the Income Statement.
A charge representing the unwinding of the discount on the plan liabilities during the period is included within finance costs.
A credit representing the expected return on the plan assets during the period is included within finance costs. This credit is based on the 
market value of the plan assets, and expected rates of return, at the beginning of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from: differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets; differences 
between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan liabilities and actual experience during the period; or changes in the actuarial 
assumptions used in the valuation of the plan liabilities. Actuarial gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in full in the period 
in which they occur, in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For defined contribution plans, contributions payable are charged to the Income Statement as they fall due as an operating expense.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each Balance Sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair 
value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the Income 
Statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the 
Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and 
losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised 
directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the 
period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are 
used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity (attributed 
to non-controlling interests as appropriate). Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the 
related operation is disposed of. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests are derecognised 
but they are not reclassified to the Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the rate prevailing at the Balance Sheet date. 75

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Taxation
The tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the period and represents the sum of the tax paid or currently payable and deferred tax.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:
 • where the deferred tax liability arises on goodwill that is not tax deductible or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 • where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures 
can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and carry-forward of 
unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
 • where the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 • in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax 
assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the relevant Balance Sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and not in 
the Income Statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
 • where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales 
tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
 • where receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
Balance Sheet.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: ‘Share-based payments’. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instrument excluding the effect of non-
market based vesting conditions at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted 
for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Melrose PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Non-current assets and businesses held for sale
Non-current assets and businesses classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and businesses are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable and 
the asset or business is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as set out in note 2, management has made critical accounting judgements in the quantification 
of provisions, the impairment of non-current assets and the valuation of retirement benefit obligations and taxation. Due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes will differ from those assumptions and estimates. An analysis 
of the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is provided below.
Provisions
The quantification of certain liabilities within provisions (environmental remediation obligations and future costs and settlements in relation 
to certain legal claims) have been estimated using the best information available. However, such liabilities depend on the actions of third 
parties and on the specific circumstances pertaining to each obligation, neither of which is controlled by the Group. Although provisions are 
reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that future 
amounts settled may be different from those provided. Further details are set out in note 6 and note 20.
Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be 
impaired and at least annually. Such events and circumstances include the effects of restructuring initiated by management. 
To determine whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units 
to which goodwill and other intangible assets has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future 
cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Such calculations 
require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long term growth prevalent in a particular market as well as short and 
medium term business plans. The Directors draw upon experience as well as external resources in making these judgements.
The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets (including computer software) at the Balance Sheet date was £906.1 million  
(31 December 2010: £1,181.6 million). At 31 December 2011 and 2010, the Group recognised no impairment loss in respect of these assets. 
Retirement benefit obligations
Retirement benefits are accounted for under IAS 19: ‘Employee benefits’. For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted 
present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. Because of changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and 
liabilities actually arising under the plans in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of these actuarial 
assumptions. Therefore, declining returns on equity markets and markets for fixed-income instruments could necessitate additional 
contributions to the plans in order to cover future pension obligations. Also, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life of 
participants may have an impact on the amount of pension income or expense recorded in the future.
The interest rate used to discount retirement benefit obligations to present value is derived from the yields of senior, high-quality corporate 
bonds at the Balance Sheet date. These generally include AA-rated securities. The discount rate is based on the yield of a portfolio of bonds 
whose weighted residual maturities approximately correspond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.
Pension and other retirement benefits are inherently long term and future experience may differ from the actuarial assumptions used 
to determine the net charge for retirement benefit obligations. Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements describes the principal 
discount rate, earnings increase and pension retirement benefit obligation assumptions that have been used to determine the net charge 
for retirement benefit obligations in accordance with IAS 19. The calculation of any charge relating to retirement benefit obligations is clearly 
dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of judgement. The assumptions adopted are based on prior experience, 
market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries.
At 31 December 2011, the Group’s retirement benefit obligation deficit was £117.7 million (31 December 2010: £119.6 million). Further 
details on the sensitivities and assumptions are discussed in the Finance Director’s review on pages 23 to 30. 77

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Taxation
The Group is subject to income tax in most of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Management is required to exercise judgement in 
determining the Group’s provision for income taxes. Management’s judgement is required in estimating tax provisions where additional 
current tax may become payable in the future following the audit by the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns. Management’s 
judgement is also required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. While 
the Group aims to ensure that the estimates recorded are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected.

5. Segment information
Segment information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8: ‘Operating segments’ which requires operating segments to be identified on 
the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reported to the Group’s Board in order to allocate resources 
to the segments and assess their performance. The Group’s reportable operating segments under IFRS 8 are as follows:
 • Energy
 • Lifting
 • Other Industrial
The Energy segment incorporates the Turbogenerators (now including the Hawker Siddeley Switchgear business unit) and Marelli business 
units, specialist suppliers of energy industrial products to the global market. The Lifting segment consists of the businesses of Bridon, 
Crosby and Acco, serving oil & gas production, mining, petrochemical, alternative energy and general construction markets. The Other 
Industrial segment consists of the businesses of Truth, Harris and MPC primarily serving the housing, scrap processing, engineered plastic 
and automotive markets. 
There are two central cost centres which are also separately reported to the Board:
 • Central — corporate
 • Central — LTIPs

During the year, a legal provision, in respect of two Bridon companies, in connection with product liability litigation in the US inherited, 
in part, from the FKI acquisition has been increased to £25.8 million (US $40.0 million). Noble Drilling Services (‘Noble’) is claiming from 
Bridon and its US distributor for alleged losses arising from Hurricane Ike causing two offshore drilling rigs secured by Bridon ropes to break 
station in the Gulf of Mexico. The operator of the wells, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., then opportunistically joined the litigation seeking to 
recover alleged losses of its own from all parties, including Noble, but the court endorsed Bridon’s analysis that this claim was meritless 
and dismissed it in full by way of summary judgement. The amount of the Noble claim is US $104 million which, based on legal and factual 
analysis, Bridon considers to be grossly inflated. Bridon intends to vigorously defend against all claims asserted against it at trial, which is 
set for later this year, and has robust defences to all allegations. In the event of an adverse ruling, Bridon already has a number of strong 
grounds for appeal, which itself could take a further six to eighteen months. Bridon has an insurance programme of up to £105 million 
(US$163 million at 31 December 2011) that may be available to respond and Bridon is currently in discussions with its insurers in relation to 
the extent of this coverage. 
During 2011, the Group incurred £15.9 million (2010: £5.9 million) of costs relating to restructuring programmes which include the 
integration of the Hawker Siddeley Switchgear business into the Turbogenerators business within the Energy division, the reorganisation of 
the Brush facility in the Netherlands also within the Energy division and, within the Lifting division, the restructuring at Bridon’s Doncaster 
works following the large scale investment to relocate certain activities from Doncaster to the newly invested Neptune Energy Park facility in 
Newcastle upon Tyne. 81

6. Exceptional costs and income (continued)
Costs associated with acquisitions and disposals of businesses consist predominately of the expenses arising during the aborted process to 
acquire Charter International plc and the costs associated with the return of capital following the disposal of Dynacast.
In addition, the Group incurred two exceptional cash costs during the year, both were fully anticipated and fully provided and represented 
two exceptional liabilities that were acquired with FKI plc. The first related to the transfer of £10.4 million, at a cash cost of £9.0 million, of 
FKI captive insurance liabilities to an external party so that the Group has no further exposure to these risks. The second related to a legal 
settlement in respect of an historical FKI owned company, DeWind GmbH, paid in two tranches totalling £10.4 million. 
On 12 February 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Generator & Motor Services of Pennsylvania, LLC. Also during 2010, 
the Prelok France business was disposed of. A net loss of £0.2 million was incurred which included a cumulative exchange gain of £0.1 
million recycled from equity.
In 2010, the Group entered into a buyout arrangement to dispose of the liabilities of the Bridon Group Senior Executive Plan for £4.0 million 
in excess of the IAS 19 carrying value of plan net liabilities.

In 2010, it was announced to the members that the FKI UK Pension Plan would be closed to the accrual of future benefits for existing 
members on 28 February 2011, resulting in a curtailment gain of £13.1 million in that year.
In 2010, a gain of £5.6 million was generated by the commutation of certain insurance policies within the FKI captive insurance company.
The net release of provisions of £2.7 million during 2010 represented the release of a provision set up on the acquisition of FKI net of an 
additional environmental and legal provision.

The tax credit for the year ended 31 December 2011 (charge for the year ended 31 December 2010) includes an exceptional tax credit 
of £38.1 million (2010: £23.5 million). Of this exceptional tax credit, £28.6 million (2010: £nil) relates to the change in the Company’s 
expectation of the outcome of overseas tax audits inherited on the acquisition of FKI and £9.5 million (2010: £23.5 million) relates to the 
recognition of a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset during the period that is now considered to be recoverable. 
The income tax rate for the current year is lower (2010: lower) than the average standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for the year of 
26.5% (2010: 28.0%). The differences are explained in the following table:

(1) Restated to include the goodwill of Dynacast, Brush Traction, Logistex UK, Madico and Weber Knapp within discontinued operations.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the 
period. The Group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to each cash-generating unit. The growth rates are based on a prudent estimate of long term industry growth forecasts. 
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. 89

12. Goodwill and other intangible assets (continued)
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates pre-tax cash flows 
based on estimated growth rates of between 2% and 3% (2010: 2% and 3%). This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate 
for the relevant markets. The pre-tax discount rate applied is between 9% and 10% (2010: 8% and 10%) depending on the risk elements 
associated with each cash-generating unit. The key assumptions used in forecasting pre-tax cash flows relate to future budgeted revenue 
and operating margins likely to be achieved and likely rates of long-term growth by market sector. Budgeted revenue and operating margins 
are based on views on past performance, secured orders and orders likely to be achieved in the short to medium-term, given trends in the 
relevant market sector. No impairment was identified and a reasonable possible change in the assumptions applied would not result in any 
impairment.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers and because they are unrelated to each other. Credit 
control procedures are implemented to ensure that sales are only made to organisations that are willing and able to pay for them. Such 
procedures include the establishment and review of customer credit limits and terms. The Group does not hold any collateral or any other 
credit enhancements over any of its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to the 
counterparty. Melrose PLC

During 2011, the Group utilised a £750 million multi-currency committed bank facility that provided term loan and revolving credit facilities 
through to 22 April 2013. A number of Group companies act as guarantors to this facility. Drawdowns bear interest at interbank rates of 
interest plus a margin determined by reference to the Group’s performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges between 1.25% 
and 2.35%. The margin as at 31 December 2011 was 1.35% (31 December 2010: 1.50%). Melrose PLC

19. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (continued)
Throughout the year, the Group remained compliant with all covenants under these facilities. The term loan facility is fully drawn down having 
originally been set at £500 million. In 2009, the Group repaid and cancelled US $80 million of this term loan facility following the disposal of 
the Logistex business. 
On 22 December 2011, the Group agreed a new five year banking facility. On 31 January 2012, all amounts outstanding on the original 
facility were repaid using surplus cash in the Group at that time and by partially utilising the new facility. 
The new facility is a £600 million, multi-currency, committed, revolving credit facility. A number of Group companies continue to act as 
guarantors under the new facility. Drawdowns bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to the 
Group’s performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges between 1.20% and 2.00%.
The interest rate re-pricing profile of financial liabilities, after taking into account hedging interest rate derivatives, is described in note 24.
As described in note 25, the 1,392,194 redeemable preference C shares will be redeemed on 30 April 2012 at a value of £1.1 million. In 
accordance with applicable accounting standards, the liability is not included in net debt. 
Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and 
which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value is shown in the table below. Interest on floating rate debt is based on the 
relevant LIBOR curve for US Dollar and Sterling balances and EURIBOR curve for Euro balances. Interest on hedging interest rate swaps is 
based on the relevant forward LIBOR curve for US Dollar amounts and EURIBOR curve for Euro amounts and is illustrated as a net cash flow.

20. Provisions (continued)
The provision for surplus leasehold property costs represents the estimated net payments payable over the term of these leases together 
with any dilapidation costs. This is expected to result in cash expenditure over the next one to seven years.
Environmental and legal costs provisions relate to the estimated remediation costs of pollution, soil and groundwater contamination at 
certain sites and estimated future costs and settlements in relation to legal claims. Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict precisely 
when these provisions will be utilised. 
Incentive scheme related provisions are in respect of long term incentive plans for divisional senior management, expected to result in cash 
expenditure in the next three to four years.
The FKI captive insurance provision related to known and actuarial assessments of future claims covered by the captive including, but not 
limited to, public and product liability, employer’s liability in the UK, workers’ compensation in the US and US automotive claims. Following 
the sale of these liabilities, within the year, at 31 December 2011 the Group has no further exposure to these claims. 
Other provisions relate primarily to costs that will be incurred in respect of restructuring programmes and warranty provisions. 
Where appropriate, provisions have been discounted using a discount rate of 3% (31 December 2010: 3%).

As at 31 December 2011, the Group has gross unused losses of £201.4 million (31 December 2010: £251.7 million) available for offset 
against future profits. The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of certain unused losses during the year. At 31 December 
2011, an £8.9 million deferred tax asset (31 December 2010: £nil) in respect of £35.0 million of these gross losses remains in the Balance 
Sheet. No asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the divisional and geographic split of anticipated future profit 
streams. The majority of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely subject to certain continuity of business requirements. 
A significant part of the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group accounts relates to the FKI UK Pension Plan, the McKechnie 
UK Pension Plan and the FKI US Pension Plan. A deferred tax asset of £18.4 million (31 December 2010: £12.9 million) has been 
recognised on these obligations, being the extent to which they are expected to generate tax deductions against foreseeable profits.
As at 31 December 2011, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £3.4 million (31 December 2010: £4.5 million). No liability has been recognised in 
respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is 
probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Melrose PLC

22. Share-based payments
Melrose 2009 Incentive Scheme
The Company has 50,000 2009 Incentive Shares held by Directors, employees and the Melrose Employee Benefit Trust. Further details of 
the scheme are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 56 to 59.
The estimated fair value attributable to the 2009 Incentive Shares (formerly the 2007 Incentive Shares), using a Black–Scholes option pricing 
model, at 31 December 2011 was £99.4 million (31 December 2010: £70.7 million). 
The inputs into the Black–Scholes model that were used to fair value the scheme when it was originally established in 2007 were as follows:
Valuation 
assumptions
Weighted average share price £1.67
Weighted average exercise price £1.00
Expected volatility 25.0%
Expected life as at inception 4.8yrs
Risk free interest 2.0%
Expected dividend yield 3.2%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price. 
The Group recognised an IFRS 2 charge of £1.8 million (2010: £1.8 million) in relation to the Melrose 2009 Incentive Scheme in the year 
ended 31 December 2011. 
23. Retirement benefit obligations
Melrose holds several pension plans covering many of its employees, operating in several jurisdictions.
The most significant defined benefit plans are:
 • The FKI UK Pension Plan is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan where the future liabilities for members’ benefits are provided for 
by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds. The plan is closed to new members 
and on 28 February 2011 was closed to the accrual of future benefits for existing members.
 • The McKechnie UK Pension Plan is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan (other than £3.5 million of unfunded liabilities) where the 
future liabilities for members’ benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee 
administered funds. The plan is closed to the accrual of future benefits.
 • The FKI US Pension Plan is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan where the future liabilities for members’ benefits are provided for 
by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds. The plan is closed to the accrual of 
future benefits.
Other plans include a number of funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements across Europe.
Further details of the status of the significant plans are disclosed in the Directors’ report on page 44.
Upon the sale of Dynacast and Logistex UK, £41.1 million of plan obligations and £30.5 million of plan assets were disposed.
The cost of the Group’s defined benefit plans is determined in accordance with IAS 19 with the advice of independent professionally qualified 
actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method. In line with normal practice, these valuations are 
undertaken triennially in the UK and annually in the US.
The valuations are based on the UK full actuarial valuations as of 31 December 2008 updated at 31 December 2011 by independent 
actuaries and US full actuarial valuations as of 31 December 2010 updated at 31 December 2011 by independent actuaries. The next formal 
UK valuations as at 31 December 2011 are currently being undertaken.
The Group also operates unfunded retiree medical and welfare benefit plans, principally in the US.

Mortality
FKI UK Pension Plan 
Mortality assumptions for the most significant plan in the Group, the FKI UK Plan, as at 31 December 2011 are based on 90% of the ‘heavy’ 
Self Administered Pension Scheme (SAPS) tables, reflecting the plan membership being largely employed in the industrial sector. Future 
improvements are in line with 80% (60% for women) of the Long Cohort, subject to a minimum underpin of 1% p.a.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.3 years if they are male and for a further 23.7 
years if they are female. For a member who retires in 2036 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live for a further 22.8 years after 
retirement if they are male and for a further 26.0 years after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions are in line with those adopted for the triennial valuation results as at 31 December 2008.
Sensitivities
Sensitivities around movements in the principal assumptions of the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality are discussed in the Finance 
Director’s review on page 28.

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and derivative financial assets which represent the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are 
banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. Note 16 provides further details 
regarding the recovery of trade receivables. Melrose PLC

Capital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the Group’s net debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, after deducting cash and cash 
equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy for managing liquidity rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
Fair values
The Directors consider that the financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.
Foreign exchange contracts
As at 31 December 2011, the Group held foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate expected exchange fluctuations on cash flows on 
sales to customers and purchases from suppliers. These instruments operate as cash flow hedges unless the amounts involved are small.

Interest rate risk management
The Group’s policy for managing interest rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
In January 2009, the Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps to hedge US $546.0 million of US Dollar denominated bank debt 
into fixed rates of interest. Under the terms of these swaps the Group will pay an average rate of 2.1% p.a. plus a 2.0% margin annually in 
arrears and receive 3 month US Dollar LIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears. These swaps were all due to mature in January 2013.  Melrose PLC

24. Financial instruments and risk management (continued)
In April 2009, the Group also took out an interest rate swap to hedge €33.3 million of Euro denominated debt into fixed rates of interest. The 
swap is structured in a similar way to the US Dollar interest rate swaps with the Group paying 2.6% plus a 2.0% margin annually in arrears 
and receiving 3 month EURIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears. This swap was due to mature in April 2013. 
A corresponding amount of debt drawn under the £500 million term loan is matched with these swaps.
These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and were highly effective throughout 2011. The fair value of the 
contracts at 31 December 2011 was a net liability of £5.7 million (31 December 2010: net liability of £10.0 million).
In February 2012, the Group closed out the swap arrangements which were entered into in 2009 and entered into a number of new interest 
swaps to hedge US $231.0 million, €42.0 million and £105.0 million denominated bank debt. These swaps mature in January 2017. Under 
the terms of these swaps, the Group will pay annually in arrears 1.0% for US Dollar swaps, 1.1% for Euro swaps and 1.1% for Sterling 
swaps plus a margin of 1.5%. These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s policy for managing foreign currency risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review on pages 29 and 30. 
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7 as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial asset or liability will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table details the transactional impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at 
the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the (decrease)/increase in Group operating profit caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar 
and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna against Sterling compared to the year end spot rate. The analysis 
assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The Group operates in a range of 
different currencies, and those with a material impact are noted here:

The following table details the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at the Balance 
Sheet date, illustrating the (decrease)/increase in Group equity caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling 
and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna against Sterling. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign 
currency exchange rates, remain constant. The Group operates in a range of different currencies, and those with a material impact are noted 
here:

31 December 
2010

US Dollar (0.7) (1.6)
Euro 2.3  0.4 
Czech Koruna 0.1  (0.1)
In addition, the change in equity due to a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling for the translation of net 
investment hedging instruments would be a decrease of £26.8 million (31 December 2010: £26.6 million) and £4.4 million (31 December 
2010: £4.7 million) respectively. However, there would be no overall effect on equity because there would be an offset in the currency 
translation of the foreign operation. 105

On 8 August 2011 at a General Meeting, shareholders approved resolutions to return capital of £373.2 million to shareholders.
The return of capital took place by increasing the authorised share capital by £373.2 million through the issue of 497,586,779 redeemable 
preference C shares (‘C Shares’) of 75.0p nominal value each and capitalising £220.1 million of the capital redemption reserve and £153.1 
million of the share premium account to pay up in full the C Shares. The C Shares were allotted on the basis of one C Share for each 
Ordinary Share of 0.2p each held on 8 August 2011. Shareholders had the option to receive the cash value inherent in the C Share by way 
of income or the choice of two capital options. As a result of the elections made by shareholders in respect of the return of capital:
 • 461,862,929 C Shares were redeemed and subsequently cancelled with effect from 19 August 2011
 • 1,392,194 C Shares will be redeemed on 30 April 2012
 • 34,331,656 C Shares were paid a dividend which was paid on 19 August 2011 and these C Shares converted into C Deferred Shares
Both the remaining 1,392,194 C Shares and the 34,331,656 C Deferred Shares carry no voting rights or rights to dividends.
In conjunction with the return of capital, on 9 August 2011 an 11 for 14 share consolidation took place which reduced the issued Ordinary 
Share capital to 390,961,043 shares of 14/55 pence each.
Redemption of the C Deferred Shares on 30 April 2012 will result in a £25.7 million transfer from share capital into the capital redemption 
reserve. In addition, the 1,392,194 C Shares will be redeemed and cancelled on 30 April 2012 at a value of £1.1 million which will also be 
transferred to the capital redemption reserve. Melrose PLC

30. Contingent liabilities
Two Bridon companies that Melrose acquired as part of the acquisition of FKI plc have been sued in U.S. federal court in Houston, Texas, 
along with their American distributor, Certex USA Inc. (‘Certex’), by Noble Drilling Services, Inc. (‘Noble’), a purchaser of wire anchor lines 
that were manufactured by Bridon (prior to its acquisition by Melrose), sold by Certex and used by Noble to moor certain of its mobile, 
semisubmersible offshore drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Noble alleges that certain ropes were defective and broke during Hurricane Ike in 
2008 when they should not have. Noble claims approximately US $104 million in damages, based upon allegations of product defect which 
the court has ruled are governed by Louisiana law. Bridon believes Noble’s damages are grossly inflated and that the purported defect with 
the product did not cause the claimed damages rather Noble’s use of the product in violation of industry requirements did so. Bridon intends 
vigorously to defend against the claims asserted against it at trial and has robust defences to all allegations. 
 
In a separate case previously consolidated with the Noble action before the same court, the lessee of the rigs, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. 
(‘Anadarko’) opportunistically sued Noble, Bridon and Certex claiming that the rigs that employed these ropes were unseaworthy. Bridon’s 
(and Noble’s) legal and factual analysis of Anadarko’s claim was that it was meritless and this analysis was endorsed by the court when it 
ruled in summary judgment on 2 March 2012 to dismiss Anadarko’s claims in full, enter final judgment to that effect, and administratively 
close the case.     
 
Discovery concluded on 15 December 2011 and the trial of Noble’s claims is scheduled for later this year. Any appeal thereafter could itself 
be expected to take well over a year and Bridon considers it already has a number of strong grounds for appeal in the event of an adverse 
ruling.  
 
Bridon has an insurance programme providing coverage of up to £105 million (US $163 million at 31 December 2011) that may be available 
to respond should the Noble claim succeed and Bridon is currently in discussions with its insurers in relation to the extent of this coverage.   
In recognition of the inherent risk associated with US litigation, Bridon has increased the legal provision to US $40 million in respect of this 
claim.
 
In addition, as a result of the acquisition of the McKechnie and FKI businesses, certain further contingent legal, environmental and tax 
liabilities were identified. Whilst it is difficult to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these claims, the Directors’ best estimate of the 
outcome of these claims has been included in the Balance Sheet.
The Group has contingent liabilities representing guarantees and contract bonds given in the ordinary course of business on behalf of 
trading subsidiaries. No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities. 109

them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’

Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Company financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2011;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
•	 the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the Company financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
Melrose PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Notes to the Company Balance Sheet
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments which are recognised at fair value, and in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’) and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year. 
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ statement of going concern on page 48 of the Directors’ report.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured at the 
fair value of the consideration paid. Any premium is ignored.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including direct 
issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Profit and Loss Account using the effective interest rate method and are added to 
the carrying amount of the investment to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. The initial cost of an asset comprises 
its purchase price or construction cost, and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation. The purchase price or 
construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Depreciation of fixtures and fittings is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of the assets being three to twelve 
years. The estimated useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
A tangible fixed asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the item) is included in the Profit and Loss Account in the year the item is derecognised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions and short-
term deposits which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the Balance Sheet at cost and subsequently remeasured to their fair value. The 
method of recognising the resulting gain or loss is dependent on whether the derivative contract is designed to hedge a specific risk and 
qualifies for hedge accounting. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates derivatives which qualify as 
hedges for accounting purposes as either a) a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge), or b) a hedge of a 
forecast transaction or firm commitment (cash flow hedge) or c) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which are fair value hedges and that are highly effective are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the 
fair value of derivatives in cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. Where the forecasted transaction or firm commitment results in the 
recognition of an asset or liability, the gains and losses previously included in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or 
liability. Otherwise, amounts recorded in equity are transferred to the Profit and Loss Account and classified as revenue or expense in the 
same period in which the forecasted transaction affects the Profit and Loss Account.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. The Company hedges certain net investments 
in foreign operations with foreign currency borrowings. All foreign exchange gains or losses arising on translation are recognised in equity and 
included in cumulative translation differences and are recycled through the Profit and Loss Account upon derecognition of the hedged item. Melrose PLC
Annual Report 2011 112
21012-04   26/03/2012   Proof 6
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Certain derivative instruments, while providing effective economic hedges under the Company’s policies, do not qualify for hedge 
accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are recognised 
immediately in the Profit and Loss Account along with any ineffectiveness on cash flow and net investment hedges.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20: ‘Share-based payments’. The Company issues equity-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based 
vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the 
effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Cash Flow Statement
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised): ‘Cash 
Flow Statements’ because it prepares a consolidated Cash Flow Statement which is shown on page 65 of the Group financial statements.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
Balance Sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the financial statements.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end or, if hedged, 
at the forward contract rate. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the 
transactions or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate. Profits and losses on exchange arising in the normal course of trading and realised 
exchange differences arising on the conversion of foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised within the Profit and Loss Account. 
2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own Profit and Loss Account for the 
year. Melrose PLC reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2011 of £156.1 million (2010: £519.7 million). The Company 
paid a dividend of £52.8 million (2010: £43.8 million) during the year and in addition, the shareholders authorised a return of capital of 
£373.2 million of which £372.1 million was paid during the year. Further details are provided in the Directors’ report on pages 38 to 49.
The Company has unused tax losses of approximately £7.3 million (31 December 2010: £19.7 million) available to carry forward and offset 
against future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to uncertainty over future taxable profits 
arising in the foreseeable future. 
The estimated value of the deferred tax asset not recognised at a tax rate of 25% (31 December 2010: 27%) is £1.8 million (31 December 
2010: £5.3 million).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services to the Company is disclosed in note 7 to the Group consolidated financial statements.

During 2011, the Company utilised a £750 million multi-currency committed bank facility that provided term loan and revolving credit facilities 
through to 22 April 2013. A number of Group companies act as guarantors to this facility. Drawdowns bear interest at interbank rates of 
interest plus a margin determined by reference to the Group’s performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges between 1.25% 
and 2.35%. The margin as at 31 December 2011 was 1.35% (31 December 2010: 1.50%).
Throughout the year, the Company remained compliant with all covenants under these facilities. The term loan facility is fully drawn down 
having originally been set at £500 million. In 2009, the Company repaid and cancelled US $80 million of this term loan facility following the 
disposal of the Logistex business. 
On 22 December 2011, the Company agreed a new five year banking facility. On 31 January 2012, all amounts outstanding on the original 
facility were repaid using surplus cash in the Group at that time and by partially utilising the new facility. 
The new facility is a £600 million, multi-currency, committed, revolving credit facility. A number of Group companies continue to act as 
guarantors under the new facility. Drawdowns bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to the 
Group’s performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges between 1.20% and 2.00%.
The interest rate re-pricing profile of financial liabilities, after taking into account hedging interest rate derivatives, is described in note 24 of

On 8 August 2011 at a General Meeting, shareholders approved resolutions to return capital of £373.2 million to shareholders.
The return of capital took place by increasing the authorised share capital by £373.2 million through the issue of 497,586,779 redeemable 
preference C shares (‘C Shares’) of 75.0p nominal value each and capitalising £220.1 million of the capital redemption reserve and £153.1 
million of the share premium account to pay up in full the C Shares. The C Shares were allotted on the basis of one C Share for each 
Ordinary Share of 0.2p each held on 8 August 2011. Shareholders had the option to receive the cash value inherent in the C Share by way 
of income or the choice of two capital options. As a result of the elections made by shareholders in respect of the return of capital:
 • 461,862,929 C Shares were redeemed and subsequently cancelled with effect from 19 August 2011
 • 1,392,194 C Shares will be redeemed on 30 April 2012
 • 34,331,656 C Shares were paid a dividend which was paid on 19 August 2011 and these C Shares converted into C Deferred Shares
Both the remaining 1,392,194 C Shares and the 34,331,656 C Deferred Shares carry no voting rights or rights to dividends.
In conjunction with the return of capital, on 9 August 2011 an 11 for 14 share consolidation took place which reduced the issued Ordinary 
Share capital to 390,961,043 shares of 14/55 pence each.
Redemption of the C Deferred Shares on 30 April 2012 will result in a £25.7 million transfer from share capital into the capital redemption 
reserve. In addition, the 1,392,194 C Shares will be redeemed and cancelled on 30 April 2012 at a value of £1.1 million which will also be 
transferred to the capital redemption reserve.
The rights of each class of share are described in the Directors’ report on pages 40 to 42.
Own shares
The Trustee of the Melrose PLC Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) holds 500 2009 Incentive Shares of £1 each (31 December 2010: 500). The 
Melrose PLC EBT also holds 19,862 Ordinary Shares of 14/55p each in Melrose PLC (31 December 2010: 25,279 Ordinary Shares of 0.2p 
each) relating to unallocated shares following the crystallisation of the Original Incentive Scheme in August 2007. The FKI EBT holds 124,232 
Ordinary Shares of 14/55p each in Melrose PLC (31 December 2010: 158,114 Ordinary Shares of 0.2p each) which arose upon disposal of 
its FKI plc shares when FKI plc was acquired by Melrose PLC.

Notes
1. The holders of ordinary shares and 2009 Incentive Shares in the 
Company are entitled to attend the Annual General Meeting, but 
only holders of ordinary shares are entitled to vote. The holders 
of Non-Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares of 75 pence 
each and C Deferred Shares of 75 pence each in the capital of 
the Company shall not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at the 
Annual General Meeting. A member entitled to attend and vote 
may appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend, 
speak and vote at a general meeting of the Company. Such a 
member may appoint more than one proxy, provided that each 
proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to different 
shares. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2. A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice. To be effective, a 
form of proxy must be completed and returned, together with 
any power of attorney or authority under which it is completed or 
a certified copy of such power or authority, so that it is received 
by the Company’s registrars at the address specified on the form 
of proxy not less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day that 
is not a working day) before the time for holding the meeting. 
Returning a completed form of proxy will not preclude a member 
from attending the meeting and voting in person.
3. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information 
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement 
between him and the shareholder by whom he was nominated, 
have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else 
appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a 
Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right 
or does not wish to exercise it, he may, under any such 
agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder 
as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement of the rights 
of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in 
paragraphs 1 and 2 above does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in paragraphs 1 and 2 can only 
be exercised by ordinary shareholders of the Company.
4. T o be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting 
(and for the purposes of the determination by the Company of the 
number of votes they may cast), members must be entered on 
the Company’ s register of members by 6.00 pm on 4 May 2012 
(or, in the event of an adjournment, on the date which is two days 
before the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to entries 
on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in 
determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
5. As at 7 March 2012, the Company’s issued share capital 
consists of (i) 390,961,043 ordinary shares, carrying one 
vote each, and (ii) 50,000 2009 Incentive Shares of £1 each, 
1,392,194 Non-Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares of 
75 pence each and 34,331,656 C Deferred Shares of 75 pence 
each in the capital of the Company, each of which shall not 
carry a right to vote on the resolutions to be considered at the 
Annual General Meeting. Therefore, the total voting rights in the 
Company as at 7 March 2012 are 390,961,043. 120

6. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by 
using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST 
Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and 
those CREST members who have appointed a service provider(s), 
should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
7. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using  
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated  
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications, and must contain the information required for 
such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual (available 
via www.euroclear.com/CREST). The message, regardless 
of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an 
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed 
proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be 
received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by 11.00 am on  
4 May 2012. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken 
to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to 
the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to 
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any 
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST 
should be communicated to the appointee through other 
means.
8. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, 
or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & 
Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in 
CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and 
limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST 
Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member 
concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST 
personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed 
a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor 
or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be 
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means 
of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors 
or voting system providers are referred, in particular, to those 
sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations 
of the CREST system and timings.
9. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
10. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all 
of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in 
relation to the same shares.
11. Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold 
requirements set out in that section have the right to require 
the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out 
any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) 
that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) 
any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company 
ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which 
annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with 
section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the 
shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay 
its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the 
Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement 
on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward 
the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the 
time when it makes the statement available on the website.

On 23 March 2012, the Board announced an amendment to the dividend timetable that had originally been announced on 7 March 2012. The final dividend payment  
 date of 14 May 2012 remains unchanged and it will be paid to those shareholders on the register on 10 April 2012 (instead of 13 April 2012 as announced previously),  
 subject to approval at the AGM on 9 May 2012. This change has been made in order to prevent the New Ordinary Shares resulting from the proposed conversion of the  
 Existing Incentive Shares (as defined in the circular sent to shareholders on 23 March 2012) qualifying for the proposed final dividend payment.

SHAREHOLDER REFERENCE NUMBER
If you come to the meeting please bring this card with you.
It is evidence of your right to attend and vote at the meeting
and will help you gain admission as quickly as possible.
A map of the venue is shown overleaf.
NOTES:
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting may appoint a proxy 
to exercise all or any of its rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting. 
A member may appoint more than one proxy, provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights attached to different shares. A proxy need not 
be a member of the Company.
2. If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than your full voting entitlement, 
please enter the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act 
as your proxy. If left blank, your proxy will be deemed to be authorised in respect 
of your full voting entitlement.
3. To appoint more than one proxy, you may photocopy this form. Please indicate in 
the box next to the proxy holder’s name the number of shares in relation to which 
they are authorised to act as your proxy, and tick the box to indicate if the proxy 
instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms should be signed 
and returned together in the same envelope.
4. To be valid your signed and dated proxy form(s) must be completed and 
deposited together with any power of attorney or authority under which it 
is signed or a certified copy of such power or authority at the offices of the 
Company’s Registrars, Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West 
Sussex, BN99 6DA as soon as possible and no later than 11.00am on 4 May 
2012. In the case of a corporation, the proxy form(s) should be executed under 
its common seal and/or the hand of a duly authorised officer or person.
5. If you wish, you may register the appointment of a proxy for this meeting 
electronically, by contacting the website www.sharevote.co.uk and following the 
on-screen instructions. You will need your Voting ID, Task ID and Shareholder 
Reference Number shown on this form of proxy. CREST members may appoint a 
proxy or proxies electronically via Equiniti (ID RA19) not later than 11.00am on 4 
May 2012.
6. The “Withheld” box is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular 
resolution. However, it should be noted that a “vote withheld” is not a vote in law 
and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “for” and 
“against” a resolution but will be counted to establish if a quorum is present.
7. Only those members registered in the register of members of the Company at 
6.00pm on 4 May 2012 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in 
respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes 
to the entries on the register of members after 6.00pm on 4 May 2012 shall 
be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the 
meeting.
8. In the case of joint registered holders, the signature of one holder on a proxy 
card will be accepted and the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote 
whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes 
of the other joint holders. For this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the 
order in which the names appear on the register of members of the Company in 
respect of the relevant joint holding.
9. Returning this form of proxy will not prevent a registered member from attending 
the meeting and voting in person. 
If you will not be attending the Annual General Meeting please complete, detach and return this Proxy Form. Alternatively, 
you can submit your Proxy Form electronically at www.sharevote.co.uk (see Notes opposite) using the above numbers.

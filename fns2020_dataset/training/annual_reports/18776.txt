We have one of the most 
attractive landbanks in the 
southeast of England and 
are currently reviewing how 
best to achieve the greatest 
return on these assets for 
our shareholders.
cHairman’s 
statement intrOductiOn these results come on the back of a vicious 
downturn in both the general economic climate 
and the housebuilding industry unlike any other 
in recent history. t he effect on the housing market 
has been further exacerbated due to the severe 
constraints in the availability of credit. 
the results for the year ended 30 June 2009 
show an operating loss before exceptional costs 
of £3.93m (2008: operating profit before 
exceptional costs £0.71m) and a loss before tax 
of £10.47m (2008: £4.19m). In line with others 
in the sector, it has been necessary to make 
a substantial writedown in the carrying value 
of our landbank of £3.80m (2008: £4.78m). 
In addition, in the interests of prudence the 
Board has decided to make a full provision 
amounting to £1.43m against the carrying value 
of our associate company which like many 
other housebuilders has also been significantly 
affected by the current downturn in the sector. 
We have also written off a significant amount 
of the deferred tax asset due to the fall in value 
of our site in poole.
OperatiOns the year has been one where we have 
concentrated on preserving cash and as 
a consequence we did not acquire any new 
sites in our own right. our focus has been in 
securing planning consents on the sites in 
our landbank many of which have now been 
obtained on appeal. I am pleased to report 
that during the year we obtained residential 
planning consents on eleven sites for 296 plots 
and 100,000 sq ft of commercial space. 
the varied and attractive nature of our land 
portfolio has meant that although there was 
a general view that no-one was buying land 
with planning consent, we managed to sell 
five sites and two properties during the year 
generating £4.51m of cashflow through the 
most difficult times that the industry has 
had to face, albeit that a number of the 
sales were achieved at values below those 
that had been originally anticipated. 
as reported in the interim statement, the master 
planning process on our joint venture raF 
West drayton has progressed well and we 
anticipate submitting a planning application 
within the next few weeks for approximately 
775 residential units and 65,000 sq ft of 
commercial space that will include a primary 
healthcare centre, a pharmacy and an 80 bed 
care home. the joint venture agreement with 
our partner has been varied whereby in the 
event of a change of control of Inland plc 
prior to receipt of planning consent, our partner 
will be entitled, at any time during the period 
of 60 business days following the date of the 
change of control, to terminate the joint 
venture. In return for agreeing to this variation 
Inland has the ability to charge management 
fees to the joint venture company of up to 
£2.5m. t o date, Inland’s investment 
in the project amounts to £250,000.  annual report and accounts 2009   Inland plc   03
We are no W in a position to move 
the business forW ard from an 
appropriate base and if current 
conditions persist We do not 
envisage further Write do Wns of 
our landbank being required.
our current land portfolio comprises 
approximately 2,080 residential plots and 
290,000 sq ft of commercial space. consent 
has been secured on 690 residential plots. 
the Board believes that on a fully consented 
basis the residential element of our land 
portfolio would have a gross development 
value of approximately £420m, including 
West drayton.
Inland’s original objective was to obtain 
planning consent on the sites it acquired 
before selling them to housebuilders at a profit, 
having added significant value through the 
planning process. In the current climate, in 
order to maximise the value from some of our 
sites the Board is exploring the prospect of 
building out some of the sites either as principals 
or by way of joint ventures. as part of this 
evaluation the Board has selected two sites 
and accordingly we have developed our site in 
Byfleet, surrey as principals and the marketing 
campaign for the 14 two bedroom apartments 
will be launched shortly. the construction of 
this project has been substantially funded by 
way of senior debt provided by a merchant bank 
and secured on the development. We have also 
commenced construction of a showhouse 
complex at Queensgate, Farnborough where 
Inland will develop part of the 370 consented 
plots, again by utilising senior debt finance 
secured against the development. In recent 
weeks there has been a noticeable increase in 
interest from housebuilders in our landbank 
and the Board still expects to sell certain of 
our sites to generate cash where we receive 
offers that match our expectations.
the Board notes that in recent weeks, 
a number of the major housebuilders have 
announced fund raisings in order to facilitate 
further investment in their respective 
businesses including land purchases. 
Financial summary
during the year ended 30 June 2009, the Group 
generated revenue of £5.22m of which £4.51m 
was achieved by way of land sales and £0.71m 
from rental and other income. t he current 
annualised rental income amounts to £726,000 
including £72,000 at ra F West d rayton. 
o verheads have been strictly controlled and 
were reduced by £184,000 over the previous year .
as referred to above, due to deteriorating 
market conditions, we have made a write 
down of £3.80m in the carrying value of our 
land portfolio and we have taken a full provision 
against the carrying value of our investment in 
associate of £1.43m as an exceptional cost.
the Board do not recommend the payment 
of a dividend.
n et assets at 30 June 2009 stood at £40.38m 
(2008: £53.32m) representing 24.9p per share 
at that date. Bank borrowings at the year end 
amounted to £6.57m equating to gearing of 
16.3%. the Group’s revolving credit facility of 
£10m with the royal Bank of scotland expires 
on 15 december 2009 and initial discussions 
have already commenced with the bank and 
the Board has a reasonable expectation for the 
facility to be renewed. a number of our sites 
were purchased on deferred consideration 
terms and we successfully renegotiated the 
terms on four sites so that the payments were 
managed in line with our cash flow. as at the 
date of this report the outstanding deferred 
considerations amounts to £9.50m of which 
£3.50m is due in the current financial year and 
the balance in the following financial year. 
during July 2009, under the authority granted 
at the last annual General Meeting, the Board 
issued 12,665,000 shares at 10p per share 
raising further equity of £1.27m.
Outl OOk there are some signs that whilst weak, the 
market is stabilising and our immediate task 
will be to capitalise on the value of our substantial 
and well located landbank. We are now in a 
position to move the business forward from 
an appropriate base and if current conditions 
persist we do not envisage further write downs 
of our landbank being required. the Board 
remains cautiously optimistic that provided 
conditions do not deteriorate further an early 
return to profitability will now be achieved.
terry rO ydOn chaIrman 04   Inland plc   annual report and accounts 2009
this has been an intensely difficult year 
following the sharp decline in the uK housing 
market and the onslaught of a banking crisis 
that has severely restricted the availability of 
credit to both developers and their customers.
the focus over the last year has been very 
much on control and generation of cash and 
the renegotiation of the timing of deferred 
land payments. some of these renegotiations 
were very demanding but I am pleased to 
say we were successful on all counts and 
outstanding land creditors have been reduced 
from £23.8m at June 2008 to £9.5m at the 
date of these financial statements. this was 
achieved within a landscape where banks were 
not really open for business and as stated in our 
Interim r eport we signed up to a bank facility 
of £10m which fell far short of our original 
expectations. as a result we had to work 
hard to achieve the sale of five sites and two 
properties during the second half of the 
financial year, which helped maintain cash flow. 
as referred to in the c hairman’s statement, the 
revolving credit facility of £10m is due to expire 
on 15 december 2009 and we are already in 
discussions with our bank for its renewal. 
I am confident that the facility will be 
renewed prior to its current expiry date.
our small team of only nine has worked 
tirelessly over the last period under difficult 
circumstances for which I am extremely 
grateful; whilst the focus is on the Group’s 
property assets sometimes it is easy to 
overlook the considerable value of our staff. 
I believe our team is one of the best in our 
industry and we also have a superb compliment 
of consultants working alongside us which 
enable us to achieve attractive planning 
consents in a generally very hostile 
planning environment.
as set out in the chairman’s statement 
considerable effort has gone into the 
preparation of the planning application for  
raF West drayton; our joint venture project. 
over the last twelve months our land director, 
paul Brett has led a team of over 20 consultants 
in the preparation of this very complex planning 
application. the detailed master planning of 
this site has been subject to intense negotiation 
with the planners such that we believe we now 
have broad agreement to our proposals from 
l ondon Borough of Hillingdon and once the 
application has been submitted in october 2009 
we anticipate a consent being granted in 
spring 2010.

Inland’s stated net asset value does not 
reflect the potential value of this project. 
I believe that this will be a very significant profit 
centre for Inland in the future and thus enhance 
shareholders’ funds.
this project which has been renamed ‘drayton 
Garden Village’ is one of the largest brownfield 
developments in the london area and will have 
considerable ‘green credentials’ including 
combined heat and power, traffic-free home 
zones and spacious amenity areas.
our landbank comprises of 16 sites, all of 
which are within easy reach from london and 
situated in appealing locations. the majority 
of the planning consents are for houses as 
opposed to apartments, which is where the 
demand is stronger. the value of our portfolio 
has been affected significantly due to the 
severe fall in house prices, but thankfully 
we are beginning to see some stabilisation 
in the market.
the focus going forward for the foreseeable 
future will be based on the following strategy:
A  no further land purchases unless we have 
a joint venture partner to underwrite the 
project using our planning skills to maximise 
the project.
A  Joint ventures with major housebuilders 
or investors where development on our 
land is funded by those parties.
A  Maintaining and increasing where possible 
our commercial rental income (currently 
at circa £726,000 per annum).
A  a selective ‘build out’ of some of our 
land bank subject to satisfactory funding 
being available.
despite the difficult market conditions that 
have been experienced the fundamentals of 
our business remain sound, land with planning 
permission in attractive locations remains a 
very scarce commodity.
Most of the major quoted housebuilders have 
recapitalised their balance sheets and we are 
seeing renewed interest in land purchases from 
these parties. under current conditions we are 
optimistic that an early return to profitability 
and asset growth will be achieved.

directors’ report
the directors present their report and the financial statements of the Group and the company for the year ended 30 June 2009.
principal activity the principal activity of the company and its subsidiaries (together called the Group) is to acquire residential and mixed use sites and seek 
planning consent for development.
results and dividends
the trading results for the year are set out in the Group Income statement on page 14 and the Group’s financial position at the end of the year is 
set out in the Group statement of Financial p osition on page 15. Further details of the performance during the financial year and expected future 
developments are contained in the chairman’s statement, which forms part of the directors’ report.
the company has paid no dividends during the year and does not recommend the payment of a final dividend.
Business review
a review of the development and performance of the business during the year and the future outlook of the Group is set out in the chairman’s 
statement on pages 2 to 3. the Group’s key performance indicators are turnover, profit before tax, net assets per share and the number of plots 
with and without planning consent. these indicators are monitored closely by the Board and the details of performance against these are given 
in the chairman’s statement.
principal risks and uncertainties
the management of the business and the nature of the Group’s strategy are subject to a number of risks.
the directors have set out below the principal risks facing the business. Where possible, processes are in place to monitor and mitigate such risks. 
these are general in nature and include: obtaining business on competitive terms, retaining key personnel and market competition. the Group 
operates a system of internal control and risk management in order to provide assurance that the Board is managing risk whilst achieving its 
business objectives. no system can fully eliminate risk and therefore the understanding of operational risk is central to the management process.
t o enable shareholders to appreciate what the business considers are the main operational risks, they are briefly outlined below:
land – the inability to source, acquire and promote land would result in the business not being able to generate profit and cash flow for the longer 
term and accordingly this could have a detrimental effect to the financial position of the Group. the Group has an experienced management team 
with a strong track record in the industry which should mitigate this risk.
plannIng – increased complexity and delay in the planning process may impede sales and thus affect the rate of growth of the business. 
the proposed community Infrastructure levy may have a detrimental effect on the supply and pricing of land being marketed by landowners.
Market – to realise maximum value in a timely fashion will depend on the state of the property market in the regions in which the Group chooses 
to operate. a severe fall in the housing market would have an adverse effect on land values and would also effect timing of sales. the Group tries 
to ensure that its sites are in good locations thus providing some protection against any downturn in the market.
personnel – the attraction and retention of staff of the highest calibre with appropriate experience is crucial to the growth of the business in 
the highly competitive markets in which we operate. this is achieved by maintaining a good morale in the work place and setting remuneration 
packages at attractive levels.
Interest rates – significant upward changes in interest rates could affect residential land prices as the demand for residential property would 
be affected. It will also lead to increased borrowing costs and thus have a detrimental effect on profit.
envIronMental – the assessment of environmental risk is an important element of the due diligence undertaken when buying land. unexpected 
liabilities in respect of decontamination works or fines for environmental pollution could affect the outcome of a project. the Group uses reputable 
environmental consultancy firms to assist in this area.
regulatIon – changes in legislation, government regulations, planning policies and guidelines may have a detrimental affect to the Group’s business.
Financial risk management oB jectives and policies
all potential areas of financial risk are regularly monitored and reviewed by directors and management. any preventative or corrective measures 
are taken as necessary.
the Group uses various financial instruments. these include loans, cash and trade receivables that arise directly from its operations. the main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
the existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are described in more detail below.
the main risks arising from the company’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk. the directors review 
and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised on the following page.  annual report and accounts 2009   Inland plc   09
Financial risk management oB jectives and policies continued
lIquIdIty rIsk
the Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely 
and profitably.
Flexibility is achieved by bank loans and overdraft facilities.
Interest rate rIsk
the Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and bank borrowings. the Group controls the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
by ensuring that the level of gearing is maintained at a reasonable level.
credIt rIsk
the Group’s principal financial asset is trade receivables. the Group trades with counterparties after having considered their credit rating. 
In certain circumstances the Group may seek additional security.
capItal rIsk ManageMent
the Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital in relation to overall financing. Further information can be found in note 27 
to the financial statements.

the Group is managed through its Board of directors. the Board comprises the non-executive chairman, one other non-executive director, 
the chief executive and the Finance director. the Board’s main roles are to create value for the shareholders, to approve the Group’s strategic 
objectives and to ensure that the necessary financial and other resources are made available to enable them to meet these objectives.
specific responsibilities reserved to the Board include: setting Group strategy; reviewing operational and financial performance; approving 
certain land acquisitions; approving appointments to the Board; and approving policies relating to directors’ and senior management’s 
remuneration. In addition the Board reviews the risk profile of the Group and ensures that an adequate system of internal control is in place.
t he roles of the c hairman and the c hief executive are separate. t he c hairman is responsible for running the Board and he meets 
the chief executive and the other non-executive director separately as and when required to discuss matters of the Board.
one third of the directors retire annually by rotation in accordance with the company’s articles of association and this enables the shareholders 
to decide on the election of their company’s Board.
audit committee 
the audit committee comprises of t erry roydon (chairman) and simon Bennett. the audit committee meets at least three times a year and is 
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported and monitored and for meeting the auditor and reviewing 
their reports in relation to the financial statements and internal control systems. the Group’s auditor provides some non-audit services, but these 
are not considered to threaten their independence. the committee reviews the level of non-audit fees on an annual basis. the audit committee 
meetings are also attended by invitation by representatives of the Group’s auditor, the Finance director and the chief executive.
since 30 June 2008 the audit committee has met four times to consider the planning of the statutory audit and to review the Group’s draft half 
and full year results prior to Board approval and to consider the external auditor’s detailed reports thereon.  annual report and accounts 2009   Inland plc   11
remuneration committee
the remuneration committee consists of simon Bennett (chairman) and t erry roydon. the principal functions of the committee are to determine 
the Group’s policy on the remuneration of the executive d irectors and senior management and to determine the remuneration package of each 
executive director . t he committee also determines the allocation of share options to the executive directors and other employees. t he remuneration 
committee meetings are also attended by invitation by the chief executive. 
during the year the committee met once to review the executive directors’ remuneration package.
the directors comply with rule 21 of the aIM rules relating to directors’ dealings and take all reasonable steps to ensure compliance by the 
company’s applicable employees. the company has adopted and operates a share dealing code for directors and employees in accordance with 
the aIM rules.
internal control
the Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. such a system is designed to manage, but not eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. there 
are inherent limitations in any control system and accordingly even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
the Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control on an ongoing basis. annual budgets are prepared and detailed 
management reports are presented to the Board and used to monitor financial performance and compliance with the Group’s policies and 
procedures. all controls are covered including financial and operational controls to manage risk. the Board meetings are also used to consider 
the Group’s major risks.
relations with shareholders
the company has institutional shareholders and is, where practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with them. the chief executive and Finance 
director meet with institutional investors within the confines of relevant legislation and guidance.
the Board invites communication from its private investors and encourages participation by them at the annual General Meeting (a GM). all Board 
members are present at the aGM and are available to answer questions from shareholders.
internal audit 
the Board reviews from time to time the need for an internal audit function and remains of the opinion that the systems of internal financial control 
are appropriate to the Group’s present activities and that such a function is unnecessary.
going concern
the Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and forecasts for the future period. It has also considered the risks and uncertainties, 
including credit risk and liquidity. the directors have also considered the current economic climate and in particular the current state of the housing 
market and its effect on the market for land. the Group has recently seen an increase in enquiries for land from prospective purchasers which 
should improve the prospects of its potential liquidity. t he Group’s revolving credit facility of £10m with the r oyal Bank of scotland expires 
on 15 december 2009 and initial discussions have already commenced with the bank for the facility to be renewed. the Board has a reasonable 
expectation for the facility to be renewed and has formed a judgement that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern 
for at least the next twelve months from the date of signing the financial statements.
directors’ responsiBilities
the directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. under that law the directors have to prepare Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial reporting standards (IFrss) as adopted by the european union and have elected

Financial statements
f or the year ended 30 June 2009
1. accounting policies 
the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group’s IFrs financial statements are set out below.
basIs of preparatIon
the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial reporting standards (IFrs) as adopted 
by the eu and as issued by the International accounting standards Board.
the accounting policies that have been applied in the opening balance sheet have also been applied throughout all periods presented in these 
financial statements. these accounting policies comply with each IFrs that is mandatory for accounting periods ending on 30 June 2009.
a new standard, Ias 1 (revised) presentation of Financial statements has become mandatory for reporting periods beginning on 1 January 2009 
or later. the Group has elected to adopt this standard early in its 2009 Group financial statements and its adoption does not affect the financial 
position or profits of the Group but gives rise to additional disclosures. the measurement and recognition of the Group’s assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses is unchanged, however items that were recognised in equity are now recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive Income. 
the first time application of Ias 1 has not resulted in any prior year adjustments of cash flows, net income or balance sheet line items. Ias 1 affects 
the presentation of owner changes in equity and introduces a ‘Group statement of comprehensive Income’. In accordance with the new standard 
the Group does not present a ‘statement of recognised Income and expenses’ but instead a ‘Group statement of changes in equity’ is presented.
standards In Issue but not yet effectIve
A Ias 23 Borrowing costs (revised 2007) (effective 1 January 2009)
A  amendment to Ias 32 Financial Instruments: presentation and Ias 1 presentation of Financial statements – puttable Financial Instruments 
and obligations arising on liquidation (effective 1 January 2009)

A IFrIc 17 distributions of non-cash assets to owners (effective 1 July 2009)
A IFrIc 18 t ransfers of assets from customers (effective prospectively for transfers on or after 1 July 2009)
none of these standards will have an impact on the Group’s financial statements except Ias 23 the effect of which is currently being evaluated. 
basIs of consolIdatIon 
the Group’s financial statements consolidate those of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 June 2009. subsidiaries 
are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities. the Group 
obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated. unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the 
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have 
been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the purchase method. the purchase method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable 
assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not they were recorded in 
the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. on initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the 
Group statement of Financial p osition at their fair values, which are also used as the basis for subsequent measurement in accordance with the 
Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.  annual report and accounts 2009   Inland plc   19
1. accounting policies continued
goIng concern
t he Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and forecasts for the future period. It has also considered the risks and uncertainties, 
including credit risk and liquidity. the directors have also considered the current economic climate and in particular the current state of the 
housing market and its effect on the market for land. the Group has recently seen an increase in enquiries for land from prospective purchasers 
which should improve the prospects of its potential liquidity. the Group’s revolving credit facility of £10m with the royal Bank of scotland expires 
on 15 december 2009 and initial discussions have already commenced with the bank for the facility to be renewed. the Board has a reasonable 
expectation for the facility to be renewed and has formed a judgement that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for 
at least the next twelve months from the date of signing the financial statements.
assocIates
associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence through Board representation but which are neither subsidiaries 
nor interests in joint ventures. Investments in associates are recognised initially at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method. 
acquired investments in associates are also subject to purchase method accounting. However, any goodwill or fair value adjustment attributable 
to the share in the associate is included in the amount recognised as investment in associates.
all subsequent changes to the share of interest in the equity of the associate are recognised in the Group’s carrying amount of the investment. 
changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the associate are reported in “share of profits of associates” in the Group Income statement 
and therefore affect net results of the Group. these changes include subsequent depreciation, amortisation or impairment of the fair value 
adjustments of assets and liabilities. 
Items that have been recognised directly in the associate’s equity are recognised in the consolidated equity of the Group. However, when the 
Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any unsecured receivables, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports 
profits, the investor resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. 
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. amounts reported in the 
financial statements of associates have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
revenue 
revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied, excluding V at and 
trade discounts. 
sale oF land
revenue from the sale of land is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied:

Interest
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocates the interest income 
over the relevant period. the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
rental IncoMe
rental income derived from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
dIVIdends
dividends are recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
exceptIonal IteMs
exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which 
individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give 
a fair presentation.

dIsposal of assets 
the gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in the income statement. the gain or loss arising from the sale or revaluation of held for sale assets is included in “other 
income” or “other expense”. any revaluation surplus remaining in equity on disposal of the asset is transferred to the profit and loss reserve.
deprecIatIon
depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by the straight line method 
where it reflects the basis of consumption of the asset. the rates generally applicable are:
Fixtures and fittings  – 25% 
office equipment  – 25% 
Motor vehicles  – 25%
Material residual value estimates are updated as required, but at least annually, whether or not the asset is revalued.
InvestMent property
Investment properties are accounted for using the fair value model. Investment properties are revalued annually and are included in the Group 
statement of Financial position at their open market values. any gain or loss resulting from either a change in the fair value or the sale of an 
investment property is immediately recognised in profit or loss. an investment property shall be derecognised on disposal or when the investment 
property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from its disposal.
InventorIes
Inventories consist of land and work-in-progress and valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. net realisable value is estimated based 
upon the future expected selling price, less estimated costs to sell.
IMpaIrMent testIng of property, plant and equIpMent
t he Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. an asset’s recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of 
an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the Group Income statement 
in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer 
exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. a previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. 
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. t hat increased amount cannot exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. such reversal 
is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. after 
such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a 
systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
t axatIon
current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the period.
deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. deferred tax is generally provided on the difference 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of 
goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting 
profit. t emporary differences include those associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures unless reversal of these temporary differences 
can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried 
forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
d eferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. d eferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at 
the year end date.
changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Group Income statement except where they relate 
to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income (such as the revaluation of land not included in inventories) or directly in equity in 
which case the related deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.  annual report and accounts 2009   Inland plc   21

leased assets 
lease payments (excluding costs for services such as insurance and maintenance) applicable to operating leases where substantially all the 
benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.
eMployee benefIts
deFIned contrIButIon pensIon scHeMe
the pension costs charged against operating profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. 
equIty settled share-based p ayMent
all share-based payment arrangements are recognised in the Group financial statements.
all goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the Black-scholes 
options pricing model. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined 
indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. this fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
all equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Group Income statement with a corresponding credit 
to retained earnings.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share 
options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. 
no adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where appropriate 
share premium.
fInancIal assets
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and available 
for sale financial assets. Financial assets are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose 
for which they were acquired. 
all financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets other than 
those categorised as at fair value through profit and loss are recognised at fair value plus finance costs. Financial assets categorised as at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs expensed through the Group Income statement.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets that are either classified as held for trading or are designated by the 
entity as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition. subsequent to initial recognition, the financial assets included in this category 
are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income statement. Financial assets originally designated as financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss may not be re-classified subsequently.
available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for inclusion 
in any of the other categories of financial assets. the Group’s available-for-sale financial assets include listed securities.
all other financial assets within this category are subsequently measured at fair value with changes in value recognised in equity. Gains and losses 
arising from financial instruments classified as available-for-sale are recognised in other comprehensive Income when they are sold or when the 
investment is impaired. In the case of impairment, any loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to other comprehensive Income.
loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. t rade 
receivables and loans to associate are classified as loans and receivables. loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. any change in their value through impairment or reversal 
of impairment is recognised in the Group Income statement.
provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in 
accordance with the original terms of those receivables. t he amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
regular way purchases and sales are accounted for on trade date. 
Interest and other cash flows resulting from holding financial assets are recognised in the Group Income statement when receivable, regardless 
of how the related carrying amount of financial assets is measured.
a financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or the financial asset is transferred 
and that transfer qualifies for derecognition. a financial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset have 
been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the 
cash flows to one or more recipients. a financial asset that is transferred qualifies for derecognition if the Group transfers substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but does 
transfer control of that asset. 22   Inland plc   annual report and accounts 2009

fInancIal lIabIlItIes
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recorded initially at fair value, all transaction 
costs are recognised immediately in the Group Income statement. all other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct 
issue costs.
all financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an expense 
in finance cost in the Group Income statement. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are charged to the Group Income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Financial liabilities are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss where they are classified as held-for-trading or designated as at fair value 
through profit or loss on initial recognition (including deferred purchase consideration). Financial liabilities are designated as at fair value through 
profit or loss where they eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement (or recognition) mismatch.
a financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.
c ash and cash eQuivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
dividends
dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in ‘other short term financial liabilities’ when the dividends are approved 
in general meeting prior to the year end date.
eQuity an equity instrument is a contract which evidences a residual interest in the assets after deducting all liabilities. equity comprises the following:
A ‘share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares.
A ‘ share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of the 
share issue.
A ‘ t reasury shares’ represent the purchase of the company’s own shares and is deducted from total equity as treasury shares until they are sold 
or cancelled where such shares are subsequently sold or re-issued, any consideration received is included in total equity.
A ‘other reserves’ represent amounts written off relating to available for sale financial assets through equity.
A ‘profit and loss reserve’ represents retained profits.
2. Financial risk management fInancIal rIsk factors
the Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk and fair value interest-rate risk. the Group’s 
overall risk management programmes focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the 
Group’s financial performance.
risk management is carried out centrally under policies approved by the Board of directors.
(a) credIt rIsK
the Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to 
customers with an appropriate credit history.
the Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the year end date, as summarised below:

2. Financial risk management continued
fInancIal rIsk factors contInued
(a) credIt rIsK contInued
the Group’s policy is to deal with creditworthy counterparties.
the Group’s management considers that all the above financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review are 
of good credit quality.
some of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral.
the credit risk for liquid funds and other short term financial assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with 
high quality credit ratings.
(B) lIQuIdItY rIsK
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and ensuring availability of funding through an adequate amount 
of credit facilities. the Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping credit lines available. the Group also purchases property under 
deferred consideration arrangements.
(c) c asH Flo W and F aIr V alue Interest rate rIsK
the Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow 
interest rate risk. all the Group’s borrowings are at variable rates but the Group does not consider the risk to be significant.
(d) prIce rIsK
the Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the Group and classified on the Group statement of Financial 
position either as available for sale or at fair value through profit or loss.
For the listed equity securities, an average volatility of 15% has been observed during the year ended 30 June 2009. If the quoted stock price of these 
securities had increased or decreased by that amount, the net result for the year would have been increased/reduced by £71,000 (2008: £508,000). 
equity would have changed by £71,000 (2008: £508,000). the average volatility has been derived by using the movement in the share prices of the 
underlying securities at each month end and taking the average across all the securities.
the investments in listed equity securities that are held as available for sale financial assets are considered long term strategic investments. 
In accordance with the Group’s policies, no specific hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these investments.
3. segment inF ormation prIMary reportIng forMat – busIness segMents
at 30 June 2009, the Group is organised into one business segment in one geographical area consequently there is no segmental information 
presented in these Group financial statements.
4. critical accounting estimates and judgements
estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historic experience and other factors, including expectations of future events 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
crItIcal accountIng estIMates
the Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related 
actual results. the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
(a) ValuatIon oF InVentorIes
In applying the Group’s accounting policy for the valuation of inventories the directors are required to assess the expected selling price and costs 
to sell each of the plots or units that constitute the Group’s landbank and work in progress. estimation of the selling price is subject to significant 
inherent uncertainties, in particular the prediction of future trends in land market values.
Whilst the directors exercise due care and attention to make reasonable estimates taking into account all available information in estimating the 
future selling price, the estimates will, in all likelihood, differ from the actual selling prices achieved in future periods and these differences may, 
in certain circumstances be very significant. t he critical judgement in respect of planning consent (see below) further increases the level of 
estimation uncertainty in this area.
(B) IncoMe taxes
the Group recognises tax/deferred tax assets and liabilities for anticipated tax based on estimates of when the tax/deferred tax will be paid or 
recovered. When the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded such differences impact the period in which 
the determination is made.
(c) FaIr V alue oF derIV atIVes and otHer FInancIal InstruMents
the fair value of instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. the Group uses its judgement 
to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing. 24   Inland plc   annual report and accounts 2009

(d) InVestMent propertIes
properties are classified as investment properties if there are significant rentals and the intention is to hold those properties for a significantly 
longer time than inventory property.
(e) dIscountInG on deFerred consIderatIon oF InVentorIes
the Group discounts deferred consideration of inventories by discounted cash flow method.
crItIcal JudgeMents In applyIng the entIty’s accountIng polIcIes
(a) InVentorIes 
the Group values inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. the net realisable value is based on the judgement that planning consent 
will be given for each site. the Group believes that, based on the directors’ experience, planning consent will be given. If planning consent was not 
achieved then a provision would be required against inventories. 
(B) assocIate
the Group has equity accounted for its 15% investment in Howarth Homes plc (Howarth) as an associate, as the company has significant influence 
over Howarth through Board representation and participation in policy making.
5. exceptional costs
the Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its landbank in view of the deterioration in the uK housing market. Where the 
estimated future net realisable value of the site is less than its carrying value within the balance sheet, the Group has impaired the land value. 
this has resulted in an impairment of £3.798m (2008: £4.783m).
due to the current downturn in the housing market, our associate company, Howarth has suffered significant losses and the directors have taken 
the view that the carrying value of the investment in Howarth, both by way of equity and convertible loan has been permanently impaired and have 
therefore provided £1.426m (2008: £nil) against this investment.
upon the acquisition of p oole Investments plc, the fair value of the consideration was allocated to the assets in the appropriate category. one 
of these categories was deferred tax of £6.23m. as a result of the substantial fall in the housing market the anticipated taxable profit has reduced 
significantly and accordingly £2.36m of deferred tax has been written off as an exceptional cost.

In december 2005, Inland plc invested £200,000 in its associate, Howarth and in return received ordinary shares amounting to 10% of the issued 
share capital of Howarth. In January 2008, Inland plc made a further investment of £359,000 in Howarth to increase its interest to 15% of the 
issued share capital of Howarth.
Inland plc also subscribed for £800,000 convertible loan stock which can be convertible into ordinary shares at the option of Inland plc.
there are two dates when Inland plc could convert the loan stock:
(a) £350,000 of these notes are convertible into 10% on 30 days’ notice between 1 october 2006 to 31 July 2009.
(b) £450,000 of these notes are convertible into 10% on 30 days’ notice between 1 october 2006 to 31 december 2010.
as per the terms of the agreement with Howarth, Inland plc is entitled to receive the full amount invested in these convertible loans, should the 
option to exercise these at the above dates not be taken up. 
due to the current downturn in the housing market, Howarth has suffered significant losses and the directors have taken the view that the carrying 
value of the investment in Howarth, both by way of equity and convertible loan has been permanently impaired and have therefore provided in full 
against the investment.
at 30 June 2009 the company held or potentially held 10% or more of the equity of the following:
company name country of registration principal activity Holding class of shares
Inland Homes limited england & Wales real estate development 100% ordinary

Where the estimated future net present realisable value of the site was less than its carrying value within the Group statement of Financial position, 
the Group has impaired the land values. this has resulted in an exceptional impairment of £3,798,000. Included in the value of inventories above is 
£20.0m (2008: £17.0m) which is carried at fair value less costs to sell (net realisable value). the amount of inventories pledged as security against

the redeemable shares are not entitled to receive any dividends and carry one vote per share in general meetings. on a return of capital, 
the holders of redeemable shares will receive £1.00 per share unless the conditions described below are met, in which event the entitlement of 
holders of redeemable shares will be enhanced as described below.
In the event that (i) the return to holders of ordinary shares (calculated as dividends received, together with the increase in share price over 50p 
exceeds 10% per annum compounded annually); and (ii) the relevant holder of redeemable shares has not voluntarily ceased to be employed 
by or engaged to provide services to the company or any Group company or been dismissed for cause then the following provisions will apply:
(i)  on a takeover (including a takeover effected by a scheme of arrangement) the holders of the redeemable shares will become entitled to redeem 
their shares at a price which is calculated so as to attribute to all the redeemable shares the difference between the takeover offer price per 
share and 35p (or such other sum as is agreed with HM revenue & customs) multiplied by 11,350,504; or
(ii)  on a winding up, the assets attributable to the redeemable shares will likewise be calculated to be such amount as would represent the 
difference between the amount attributable to each ordinary share and 35p (or such other sum as is agreed with HM revenue & customs) 
multiplied by 11,350,504.
according to the company’s articles of association, the redeemable shares can convert into deferred shares of 10p each. the deferred shares shall 
not confer the right to be paid a dividend or to receive notice of or attend or vote at a general meeting. on a winding up, after the distribution of the 
first £10,000,000 of the assets of the company, the holders of the deferred share (if any) shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the nominal 
value of such deferred shares pro rata to their respective holdings.
an employee that held 20 redeemable shares of £1 each left the company on 25 november 2008 and as a result, on 9 december 2008 these shares 
were converted into 20 fully paid ordinary shares of 10p each and 180 fully paid deferred shares of 10p each in accordance with the articles of association. 32   Inland plc   annual report and accounts 2009

Financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2009
1. principal accounting policies
basIs of preparatIon
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable united Kingdom accounting standards and under the historical 
cost convention. the directors have reviewed the principal accounting policies and consider they remain the most appropriate for the company. 
the principal accounting policies of the company have remained unchanged from the previous year.
InvestMents
Investments are included at cost less amounts written off.
equIty settled share-based p ayMent
all share-based payment arrangements are recognised in the financial statements.
all goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the Black-scholes 
options pricing model. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined 
indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. this fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
all equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit to reserves 
brought forward.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share 
options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. n o adjustment 
is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where appropriate 
share premium.
deferred taxatIon
deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the company an obligation to pay more tax in the 
future or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely 
than not that they will be recovered. deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
date on an undiscounted basis.
2. proFit attriButaBle to memBers oF the parent company as permitted by section 408 of the companies act 2006, the parent company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
the company’s loss for the year of £3,923,000 (2008: profit of £4,940,000) has been transferred to reserves.
audItor’s reMuneratIon

the provision against listed investments represents the diminution in value of the assets based on the market prices at the balance sheet date.
due to the current downturn in the housing market, Howarth has suffered significant losses and the directors have taken the view that the carrying 
value of the investment in Howarth, both by way of equity and convertible loan has been permanently impaired and have therefore provided in full 
against the investment.

t he redeemable shares are not entitled to receive any dividends and carry one vote per share in general meetings. o n a return of capital, 
the holders of redeemable shares will receive £1.00 per share unless the conditions described below are met, in which event the entitlement of 
holders of redeemable shares will be enhanced as described below.
In the event that (i) the return to holders of ordinary shares (calculated as dividends received, together with the increase in share price over 50p 
exceeds 10% per annum compounded annually); and (ii) the relevant holder of redeemable shares has not voluntarily ceased to be employed by 
or engaged to provide services to the company or any Group company or been dismissed for cause then the following provisions will apply:
(iii)  on a takeover (including a takeover effected by a scheme of arrangement) the holders of the redeemable shares will become entitled to redeem 
their shares at a price which is calculated so as to attribute to all the redeemable shares the difference between the takeover offer price per 
share and 35p (or such other sum as is agreed with HM revenue & customs) multiplied by 11,350,504; or
(iv)  on a winding up, the assets attributable to the redeemable shares will likewise be calculated to be such amount as would represent the 
difference between the amount attributable to each ordinary share and 35p (or such other sum as is agreed with HM revenue & customs) 
multiplied by 11,350,504.  annual report and accounts 2009   Inland plc   41
8. share capital continued
according to the company’s articles of association, the redeemable shares can convert into deferred shares of 10p each. the deferred shares shall 
not confer the right to be paid a dividend or to receive notice of or attend or vote at a general meeting. on a winding up, after the distribution of the 
first £10,000,000 of the assets of the company, the holders of the deferred share (if any) shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the nominal 
value of such deferred shares pro rata to their respective holdings.
an employee that held 20 redeemable shares of £1 each left the company on 25 november 2008 and as a result, on 9 december 2009 these 
shares were converted into 20 fully paid ordinary shares of 10p each and 180 fully paid deferred shares of 10p each in accordance with the 
articles of association.
on 9 July 2009, the company issued 5,280,000 ordinary shares of 10p each at a price of 10p per share. on 30 July 2009, the company issued 
7,385,000 ordinary shares of 10p each at a price of 10p per share.
the company operates an unapproved share option scheme. awards under each scheme are made periodically to employees.
t he c ompany has used the Black-scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding options and redeemable shares. t he assumptions 
applied to the Black-scholes-Merton formula for share options issued and the fair value per option are as follows:
        share redeemable 
         options shares
expected life of options based on options exercised to date       3 years 5 years
Volatility of share price        30% 30%
dividend yield       0% 0%
risk free interest rate       5.38% 5.38%
share price at date of grant       50p 35p
exercise price       50p 35p
Fair value per option        £0.08 £0.07
the charge calculated for the year ended 30 June 2009 is £159,000 with a corresponding deferred tax asset at that date of £44,000.
Volatility was assessed over the period since the shares have been listed.
a reconciliation of option movements over the year ended 30 June 2009 is shown below:

 16.  crest members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the crest electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the annual General Meeting to be 
held at 11.00am on 26 november 2009 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the crest Manual. crest personal members or other 
crest sponsored members, and those crest members who have appointed a voting service provider should refer to their crest sponsors or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of crest to be valid, the appropriate crest message (a “crest proxy Instruction”) must be 
properly authenticated in accordance with euroclear uK & Ireland limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as 
described in the crest Manual. the message must be transmitted so as to be received by the company’s agent, capita registrars limited (crest p articipant Id: 
ra10), no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time 
stamp applied to the message by the crest application Host) from which the company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to crest in the manner 
prescribed by crest . 
  crest members and, where applicable, their crest sponsor or voting service provider should note that euroclear uK & Ireland limited does not make available 
special procedures in crest for any particular messages. normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of crest proxy 
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the crest member concerned to take (or, if the crest member is a crest personal member or sponsored member or has 
appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his crest sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message 
is transmitted by means of the crest system by any particular time. In this connection, crest members and, where applicable, their crest sponsor or voting 
service provider are referred in particular to those sections of the crest Manual concerning practical limitations of the crest system and timings.  Inland pl C

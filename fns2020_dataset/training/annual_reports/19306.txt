Overview | Strategy | Performance Market overview
The UK pet market is large,  
resilient and growing 
The pet care market has outgrown the  
UK retail market over the past six years.
Underlying market drivers
Pet population
•  The market is supported by a stable 
pet population
•  Around 9m dogs in the UK, broadly 
stable since 2008
•  Around 9m cats in the UK, stable  
to slightly growing since 2008
•  Shift in dog breeds towards specialist 
and cross-breeds, which often require 
grooming and are more likely to be  
fed on Advanced Nutrition 
Humanisation of pets
•  Treating pets as part of the family 
creates a market spend that is 
resilient 
•  Trends towards purchasing premium 
products
•  A desire by owners for innovation,  
with continual product refreshment 
and change
Shift to Advanced Nutrition
•  Advanced Nutrition is a premium,  
high quality pet food diet 
• Switching to Advanced Nutrition is 
driven by the superior nutritional value 
and resultant health benefits to pets 
• Advanced Nutrition market grew at  
a CAGR of 14.0% from 2012–14 
compared with grocery food at 0.4%
• The UK lags the US market in regard  
to this trend, with 11% of the UK pet 
food market penetrated by Advanced 
Nutrition products, compared with  
25% in the US
Use of services
•  Vet and grooming services grew at a 
CAGR of 4.1% from 2012–14, ahead of 
the general pet market growth of 3.5%
•  Vet service spend will be driven  
by increased availability of complex 
procedures, widening insurance 
coverage and a desire by owners to  
treat their pets’ health as they would 
their own
•  Grooming will be driven by both the  
pet humanisation trend, as well as  
the increasing popularity of specialist 
dog breeds that require grooming
• The UK market lags the US market  
in regard to grooming popularity.  
In the UK, 4% of dogs are groomed, 
versus 10% in the US
Nearly half of households in the UK own  
a pet, with more than one pet per person 
across the country as a whole. Within  
this population of pet owners, some  
are perceived to be more ‘engaged’ than 
others, based on whether they visit the  
vet regularly and whether they tell their pet 
that they love them twice a day. Engaged 
customers are our key focus and we believe 
they represent over 70% of the pet owning 
population
1
. Our customer research shows 
that the most highly valued aspects for 
customers with a high engagement score are 
a wide product range, high quality products 
and colleague advice and availability.
The UK pet care market was worth 
approximately £6.1 billion in 2014.  
Pet food and accessories accounted for 
approximately £3.3 billion, whilst services 
including small animal vet services, 
grooming and insurance totalled 
approximately £2.8 billion.
The pet care market has grown at a 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 
3.5% each year since 2012, ahead of the 
UK retail market which grew at approximately 
1.5% during the same period.
The higher growth segments in the market 
are Advanced Nutrition food, treats, and 
pet services such as veterinary practices 
and grooming salons. The potential for 
sustained future growth in two of these 
segments can be referenced to trends in 
the US, which are often reflected in the  
UK market. Advanced Nutrition is one such 
segment, where participation of the total 
US pet food market is at 25%, compared 
with 11% in the UK. Pets at Home is the 
key driver of Advanced Nutrition growth in 
the UK market, as it is a product requiring 
advice and specialist knowledge to sell, 
which we can provide through highly trained 
nutrition consultants in our stores. Within 
grooming, around 4% of dogs in the UK are 
groomed, compared with 10% in the US. 
Part of the growth trend in the UK grooming 
market can be attributed to the growing 
popularity of mixed and specialist breed 
dogs, which often have more complicated 
coat care and grooming requirements.

Market size
Market growth
The pet market has been slower to migrate 
online than other retail categories and 
online sales represent 8.6% of the total  
UK pet market spend. Whilst the online 
channel is growing strongly, overall 
participation of the pet market has been 
increasing slowly but steadily, at less than  
1% each year, and is expected to continue 
at this rate in the coming years
2
. Within  
the overall growth of the online pet market, 
Click and Collect deliveries represent  
6% of online sales, but have been growing 
significantly ahead of home delivery.  
With our UK wide network of 400 stores, 
Pets at Home is uniquely placed to 
capitalise upon the opportunity Click & 
Collect represents.
The product categories growing strongly 
online are those of higher value, such as 
Advanced Nutrition and large accessories, 
alongside Health & Hygiene products, 
which due to their small size can be delivered 
easily through a letterbox. Within these 
categories, we believe Pets at Home is well 
placed to capture market growth, through 
our exclusive own brands and private  
labels which are competitively priced, our 
promotional pricing on branded products 
and our significant range of more than 
11,500 products.

Market overview continued
Pets at Home is the leader  
in the UK pet care market
We are the only provider in the market to offer  
a full range of both pet products and services.
Pets at Home is the standout leader in  
the highly attractive UK pet care market,  
with a margin of over 60 stores ahead  
of the six closest specialist competitors 
combined. We are also the UK’s leading 
small animal veterinary services provider, 
with 338 practices, more than 60 ahead  
of the closest competitor. Our vet practices 
are part of the only branded group of scale  
in the UK in what is still a fragmented market, 
with corporate ownership of practices only 
representing 20% of the market. Grooming is 
a highly fragmented market, with more than 
eight thousand grooming businesses listed  
in the UK. Our grooming salons are the only 
nationally branded UK chain, with 179 salons.
We have market leadership, with 53%  
share in Advanced Nutrition, 36% in pet 
accessories, 9% in vet services and 6% in 
grooming, and we have been gaining share 
across all these segments since 2012.  
We have an opportunity to continue to take 
further market share, with the rollout of our 
stores, vet practices and grooming salons, 
increasing share of customer spend through 
our VIP loyalty club scheme, developing own 
brands and innovating our product mix.
Our website, petsathome.com, has the 
largest share of online pet retail traffic, 
which drives footfall to stores, allows 
booking of vet appointments and drives 
brand engagement, as well as enabling 
direct online sales of an extensive product 
range of over 11,500 products, over 4,400 
more than the range in-stores. The fastest 
growing delivery options for our customers, 
representing over 40% of our online revenues 
in the final quarter, are those that allow a 
collection of product in-store, which is often 
more convenient than a delivery to home.

Overview | Strategy | Performance Chairman’s statement
We are proud to be delivering upon 
our goals in our first year as a public 
company and are confident in the 
outlook for the Group.
Tony DeNunzio 
Non-Executive Chairman 
12
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Paul Moody 
Independent  
Non-Executive 
Director 
It has been another successful 
year for Pets at Home. I am 
pleased to report a year  
of excellent progress across  
the Group, delivering upon  
our goals in our first year  
as a public company. 
Market dynamics continue to be  
positive, supported by the themes of  
pet humanisation, the move towards 
premium Advanced Nutrition foods and the 
increasing use of pet services, such as 
veterinary treatment and pet grooming. 
Whilst the market offers supportive 
dynamics, our Executive Team has also 
executed successfully upon our strategy, 
enabling us to outperform the pet market. 
All three pillars of the strategy have shown 
positive progression; we have grown 
like-for-like sales through a number of 
commercial levers, we have achieved gross 
margin expansion, and we have increased 
our portfolio, opening 25 new stores,  
61 vet practices and 50 grooming salons.
During the year we have continued to  
take market share across the key growth 
segments; Advanced Nutrition, pet 
accessories, veterinary services and pet 
grooming. We also reached some important 
milestones; opening our 400th store,  
our 300th vet practice and our VIP loyalty 
scheme surpassed three million members. 
In the financial year 2015, revenues grew 
by 9.6% to £729.1m, supported by our 
store and services rollout and like-for-like 
growth of 4.2%. This growth was 
underpinned by strength in a number  
of areas; Advanced Nutrition, Health and 
Hygiene products, VIP club, pet services 
and omni-channel. Gross margin expanded 
by 40bps to 54.2% and underlying EPS  
was 13.5 pence. We have continued  
to deleverage the business as a result  
of strong cash flow and underlying free 
cashflow generation at the end of the  
year was £92.8m. 
Based on the successful financial 
performance of the business, the Board  
is recommending a total dividend for the 
year of 5.4 pence per share, at the top end 
of our commitment.
One of our most important values is to  
put pets before profit, which touches every 
area of our business, from strategy through 
to the daily activities of our colleagues  
in stores. Charitable initiatives therefore 
remain a key priority. Support Adoption  
For Pets, which we helped to establish and  
is widely supported across the business,  
is the largest animal rehoming charity in 
the UK and raised over £3m during the year. 
Our VIP loyalty club also generates charity 
lifelines every time a customer swipes their 
card, resulting in £1.4m raised for customer 
chosen animal charities in 2015.
 
Looking ahead, we believe growth in the  
UK pet market will be supportive to our 
business. We also have strong strategic 
levers that will enable us to deliver another 
year of expansion and profitable growth. We 
are confident in the outlook for the Group. 
 
Finally, I would like to express my thanks 
and admiration for all our colleagues.  
We are at heart a people business;  
reliant on the expertise and passion of our 
colleagues, and the bond they have with 
our highly engaged customers and their 
pets. Without them, we would be unable  
to deliver the exceptional customer service

The leadership team
In our first year as a  
public company, with newly 
appointed Independent  
Non-Executive Directors,  
we have dedicated considerable 
time to discussing the Group’s 
strategy, understanding  
progress against strategic 
priorities and confirmed those 
areas which require ongoing 
Board oversight.

Chief Executive’s statement
We have successfully delivered across 
all strategic pillars in 2015 and we  
look forward to further expansion  
and profitable growth.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 We have seen excellent progress in 
Advanced Nutrition, a product area that 
benefits significantly from the specialist 
knowledge of our highly-trained colleagues 
and where we have a strong market 
presence through our private brand, 
Wainwright’s. We have also seen excellent 
growth in pet services as we rollout  
new vet practices and groom rooms and 
the existing estate continues to mature.  
I am particularly proud of our colleagues 
whose passion for pets mirrors that  
of our customers and helps to keep our 
focus firmly on customer engagement.
Strategic update
Expanding like-for-like growth
VIP club
Our loyalty scheme, VIP club, is a key 
underpin to like-for-like growth and customer 
engagement. Analysing our customers’ 
spend, combined with our knowledge of 
their pet type, breed and age, allows us 
to send personalised marketing offers 
across both Merchandise products and 
Services to grow our share of spend with 
these customers.
VIP club reached 3.2 million members  
at year end, adding 1.2 million members 
during the year, and has over 10.5 million 
pets registered. VIP card swipe rate 
represented 65% of revenues captured  
on store tills in the final quarter of FY15, 
compared with 52% at the end of FY14. 
Although the scheme is still immature, we 
are seeing that VIP members spend more 
with us the longer they are a VIP member.
Encouraging VIP members’ participation in 
vet and grooming services is a significant 
opportunity through which we can grow 
incremental sales. As part of this strategy, 
we successfully launched the VIP Groom 
Room Rewards programme during the year, 
where new VIPs receive a 25% discount  
on a full dog groom and further discount 
vouchers after any subsequent grooms.
 
I am delighted to report on another year of progress as  
we continue to deliver on our targets for growth, with strong 
cash flows allowing us to deliver a dividend payment at the 
top end of our commitment.
Mission and strategy

Product and pricing
Our annual customer survey continues  
to demonstrate that innovative and unique 
products are highly valued by Pets at Home 
shoppers. To ensure our customers are 
seeing something new and different each 
time they visit, we have continued to 
refresh our product range, changing more 
than 3,100 SKUs (Stock Keeping Units)  
in the year, representing 44% of the  
total range. Of those products refreshed,  
over 40% were private or own labels. 
Range expansion and refreshment within 
Advanced Nutrition is vital for attracting 
new customers, who are often very brand 
loyal, as well as offering innovation and 
choice to our existing customers. We  
added new brands during the year, such  
as Meowing Heads, as well as introducing 
new high protein products, including  
a private label, Evolution Naturally, and 
branded alternative, Aatu. We believe there 
is significant capacity for further growth  
in Advanced Nutrition, through stocking 
additional brands, widening our own brand 
and private label ranges and entering new 
Advanced Nutrition segments. 
During the year we also invested in pricing, 
widening our ranges to create entry price 
products in wild bird food, small animal 
cages and large accessories. In the coming 
year, we will continue to increase product 
breadth with lower entry price products in  
a number of other categories.
Omni-channel
We are on a journey to create a seamless 
shopping experience, giving our customers 
access to a wide product range whether 
they wish to shop in-store, order online, 
receive their delivery at home or, as is 
becoming increasingly popular, collect  
at their convenience in our stores.
During the year, the development of  
our exclusive online-only product range 
increased nearly four-fold, taking our online 
product range to more than 11,500 SKUs, 
an uplift of more than 4,400 to those 
in-store. All of the extended range can be 
ordered for pickup in-store with no delivery 
charge. Our Click & Collect and Deliver To 
Store services have been key contributors 
to omni-channel sales, representing over 
40% of online revenues in the final quarter. 
As part of developing a seamless shopping 
experience, we implemented the JDA 
supply chain system in both our distribution 
centres, which provides a unified view of 
product across the Group. We also recently 
launched a dedicated mobile version of  
our website. 
In the year ahead, we will invest in the 
omni-channel shopping experience through 
a number of strategic initiatives. We will 
launch an App for VIP customers which,  
in its first phase, will give members an 
electronic copy of their loyalty card and 
enable promotions and offers to be 
scanned, removing the need to bring 
vouchers into store. We are rolling out Wifi 
across our estate so that ordering from our 
extended online range can be facilitated  
by colleagues on PetPads or by customers 
using their own devices. Ordering from  
the extended range whilst in-store will also 
become significantly easier, as we install 
‘order in store’ kiosks and develop digital 
screens to showcase our extended range. 
We will also be investing in richer online 
content and imagery, and additional 
colleagues and systems to support the 
seamless shopping strategy.
We are actively evaluating opportunities  
to further develop and extend our online 
business organically and through bolt-on 
acquisitions. Our focus remains on  
building the UK’s leading Pet focussed 
omni-channel business whilst securing 
appropriate returns for shareholders.

Services
Retrofitting of veterinary practices and 
Groom Rooms to existing stores increases 
like-for-like Merchandise sales by 
enhancing our overall proposition, driving 
store footfall and enabling cross-selling  
of products. Retrofitting vet practices  
also offsets a portion of our store property 
costs through a service charge to the 
practice for the space occupied. During  
the year, just over half of both vet practice 
and Groom Room openings were retrofits 
into the existing store estate, converting 
the equivalent square footage of more than  
six stores into services.
We also commenced a number of strategic 
initiatives in the Vet Group, to increase 
like-for-like growth in our existing Joint 
Venture practice network. These included 
space extensions to our more mature 
practices, our first trials of 24/7 opening 
and extended hours, and the development  
of our pet care plans to increase  
customer loyalty and spend.
Engagement
Colleague expertise and engagement  
is central to our success, creating a  
great shopping experience for customers 
and their pets. Our specialist colleagues 
continue to learn and develop with us, 
allowing us to maintain our industry  
leading retention rate of 81% (FY14: 81%). 
Engagement levels, which we measure 
through an annual colleague survey, 
improved to 94% (FY14: 93%).
During the year, customer advocacy 
measured by a Net Promoter Score, 
improved again to 86% (FY14: 84%),  
having risen from 75% in FY11.
Marketing
We returned to TV advertising this year, 
through the launch of the ‘My Pet Moments’ 
campaign, which features crowd sourced 
clips of our customers’ pets, as well as 
sponsoring ‘For The Love Of Dogs’, one of 
ITV’s highest rating programmes. Our Vet 
Group also participated in TV advertising 
under the Vets4Pets brand. We will 
continue to invest in our brands and new 
customer acquisition in the coming year. 
Space rollout and footprint development
A key part of the Group’s strategy is to 
increase the number of stores, in-store and 
standalone veterinary practices, and Groom 
Room salons. We finished the year with 
400 stores; opening 25 new stores, closing 
one end of lease store, and temporarily 
closing our Rugby store which will relocate 
in the first half of FY16. We are becoming 
increasingly space efficient with new 
stores, our FY15 openings had smaller 
ground floor footprints, with 60% receiving 
a mezzanine floor installation. 
We opened 61 vet practices in FY15, 
bringing the total portfolio to 338. Over half 
of our store estate now has a vet practice 
and we remain committed to working 
towards our eventual target of 90% of 
stores with a vet practice. Since the 
financial year end, we have commenced our 
entry into the specialist referral veterinary 
care market, acquiring Northwest Surgeons 
based in Cheshire. The practice specialises 
in orthopaedic, soft tissue and spinal 
surgery and internal medicine. Northwest 
Surgeons will continue to operate as a 
stand-alone brand and business within  
our practice network and we will seek to 
develop a shared ownership model, similar 
to our joint venture model. We will look  
to build upon our entry into the specialist 
referral veterinary market with further 
standalone acquisitions.
Groom Room openings progressed 
strongly, with 50 new salons, taking the 
total number of Groom Rooms to 179.
The performance and returns of new 
stores, vet practices and Groom Rooms 
remain in line with our expectations.
Looking forward, we plan to open at least 
20–25 Pets at Home stores, 50–55  
vet practices and 55–60 Groom Rooms  
in the coming financial year. We will also  
open five Barkers stores, moving to a phase 
of trialling the concept in other locations 
across the UK. Barkers is our dog focused 
local high street format, currently based  
in one location in Wilmslow, Cheshire. 
Barkers offers premium and exclusive 
products, a high end grooming spa and has 
differentiated brands and merchandising  
to those available in Pets at Home. In its 
first year of opening, Barkers of Wilmslow 
has exceeded our expectations and we 
view the format as an important strategic 
asset that reaffirms our specialist 
credentials in the pet market, giving us 
access to a valuable customer segment. 
Focus on margins
Advanced Nutrition growth and own brand 
participation are supportive to Merchandise 
gross margin, which expanded by 19bps  
to 56.3% in FY15 (FY14: 56.1%).
 
Own brand and private label products 
represented 42.6% of store revenues 
during FY15 (FY14: 42.4%). 
Advanced Nutrition revenues grew by  
17.2% to £145.4m (FY14: £124.0m),  
with our private label brand Wainwright’s  
an important contributor, growing by  
44.1% to £40.1m (FY14: £27.8m). 
Wainwright’s growth has been boosted  
by new additions such as Grain Free for 
dogs and Wainwright’s for cats, which were 
launched in H2 FY14, alongside Grain Free 
for cats which launched in FY15. Advanced 
Nutrition now represents 40% of total  
Food revenues (FY14: 38%).
Services gross margin, which was 32.6%  
in FY15 (FY14: 26.3%), has expanded 
through the growing maturity of our 
veterinary practices and incremental 
synergies from the integration of 
Vets4Pets, which was acquired in FY14.  
We also saw good gross margin expansion 
in our grooming business through its 
growing maturity and measures taken to 
improve profitability across the portfolio.

Making our entry into  
the referral market
Our Vet Group operates the largest small 
animal first opinion veterinary practice 
network in the UK.
 
Within the veterinary services market, 
there will be complex patient cases  
which require treatment that cannot be 
met within first opinion practice and need 
to be referred to a specialist practice. 
 
We recently made our entry into  
the specialist referral market, acquiring 
Northwest Surgeons based in Cheshire. 
Northwest Surgeons specialises  
in orthopaedic, soft tissue and spinal 
surgery, and internal medicine. This 
is an important strategic move for us  
as it offers an opportunity to capture  
an additional segment of the market.  
It also means we can further support  
our Joint Venture Partners with additional 
expertise from within the Group, 
underlining our commitment to quality.
Northwest Surgeons will continue to 
operate as a stand-alone brand and 
business within our practice network  
and we will seek to develop a shared 
ownership model, similar to our joint 
venture model, in the future.
Looking forward, we will continue to  
drive Advanced Nutrition growth and 
participation in the Food business.  
Whilst we will broaden our own brand  
and private label ranges to ensure we  
offer great value to customers, we will  
not seek to increase their participation at 
the expense of the brands our customers 
are loyal to. Within our higher operating 
margin Services business, as our vet 
practices mature there is an opportunity  
for our revenue stream to increase  
without a significant rise in our cost base, 
delivering margin leverage. Whilst the 
Groom Room business is also maturing, 
the large number of new openings in  
the past and coming year will continue  
to moderate margin improvement within 
Services in the short term.
Investing in the organisation
Our business has grown significantly  
in recent years and we are continuing  
to rollout our stores and services at  
a fast pace. We see significant growth 
opportunities across the Group and  
have therefore decided to implement  
a new management structure to drive 
performance across the business.  
Ian Kellett will take up a new role as  
CEO of the Retail Division. Sally Hopson, 
previously Customer and People Director 
and CEO of our Vet Group, will take  
on an enhanced role as the CEO of  
the Services Division. Both will report  
to Nick Wood who, as Group CEO, will 
continue to focus on overall Group 
operations and strategy. 
The search for a new Group CFO is  
starting with immediate effect. During  
this process, Ian Kellett will remain  
as CFO and commence the transition  
to his new role.

VIP club: unique 
engagement with  
our customers
Our loyalty scheme, VIP club, is a key 
underpin to like-for-like growth and 
increasing our market share. Members  
of the club receive exclusive offers on 
everything from food, to grooming and 
health checks with our vets, as well as 
helpful advice to ensure they get the  
best for their pets. 
Analysing our customers’ spend, 
combined with our knowledge of their  
pet type, breed and age, allows us to 
send personalised marketing offers 
across both Merchandise products and 
Services. We send out offers via direct 
mail, addressed to the customer’s pet,  
or through email. Members can also 
pickup a free copy of the quarterly VIP 
magazine in-store. VIP Lifelines are 
another benefit, with donations made to 
customers’ chosen animal charities each 
time their VIP card is swiped in our stores, 
Groom Rooms, vet practices or online.  
VIP club enabled £1.4m of donations to 
customer chosen animal charities in 2015.
How do we use VIP? 
We recently sent a direct mail to over 
190,000 of our VIPs who own dogs  
and cats of a senior age, but were not 
purchasing Senior Advanced Nutrition.  
The mailer highlighted the health benefits 
that a lifestage focused Advanced Nutrition 
diet can bring and how changes in age can 
lead to differing nutritional requirements.  
Of those VIPs who received the mail, 15% 
responded positively, with a subsequent 
purchase of Senior Advanced Nutrition 
linked to the offer. Within the group that 
responded, of those who had never 
purchased Advanced Nutrition of any  
kind before, 38% went on to make  
a repeat purchase.

Fantastic stores and 
services, giving a one  
stop shopping experience 
for the pet lover
Services are critical to our one-stop  
shop offer for engaged pet owners. By 
enhancing our stores with vet practices 
and grooming salons, we are widening  
our proposition to customers, which also 
increases footfall and lifts Merchandise 
sales. Grooming salons are an important 
part of the theatre and experience in 
stores, whilst vet practices drive cost 
efficiencies, paying a service charge  
for the space occupied. 
Retrofitting services to our existing store 
estate increases like-for-like sales.
Our store in Corby was retrofitted with  
both a Vets4Pets and Groom Room salon 
in July 2014.
As one of our smaller stores, at 6,000 
square feet, the Services offer was 
constructed on a mezzanine floor, adding  
a further 2,800 square feet for the vet 
practice and grooming salon.
Adding Services attracts additional 
customers, as well as increasing the 
frequency with which those customers  
visit. Since retrofitting the vet practice  
and grooming salon, we have created  
two additional income streams, as well  
as lifting the Merchandise sales on the 
ground floor by 8.5%.
Strategy in action
Services in our stores increase customer  
loyalty and frequency 
A major part of our strategy is to open new stores 
in optimal locations and increase the number of 
in-store and standalone vet practices and in-store 
Groom Rooms.

immature pet services business.
Strategy in action
Wainwright’s Advanced Nutrition is our flagship 
private label brand 
Higher margin Advanced Nutrition and private label products  
are an important contributor to gross margin
We launched Wainwright’s, our private  
label Advanced Nutrition brand, in 2007.  
It has grown to become one of the largest 
Advanced Nutrition brands in the UK, now 
generating revenues of £40.1m, which 
represents 11% of our total pet food 
sales. Since launch, Wainwright’s has 
grown at a CAGR of over 30% for the past 
three years and our wide range covers 
dog, cat and puppy; wet and dry complete  
food; and treats. 
The success of the brand can be attributed 
to the attractive branding and high quality 
product, sold at a competitive price in the 
Advanced Nutrition segment. Continual 
innovation and range additions have 
allowed us to attract additional customers, 
and provide greater choice and add-ons  
for existing customers.
Recent additions to the range this year 
have included Wainwright’s Grain Free for 
cats, which has been very popular with 
customers. We will continue to grow and 
expand the range in the coming year.

Sourcing and terms 
• Refreshed >1,300 own brands or private  
label products during the year, with many

• Terms and working capital efficiencies 
progressing in-line with our expectations
Future plans
Generate the right balance between high margin 
and lower margin products by maintaining the 
participation of own brands and private labels, 
with a focus on Advanced Nutrition food. Our 
flagship brand, Wainwright’s Advanced Nutrition, 
provides an opportunity to enhance both 
revenues and margins. 
 
Continue to rollout new vet practices and 
grooming salons, which generate a higher 
operating margin than the Group. As these  
pet services mature, margin leverage translates 
into support to Group profitability. 
 
Build closer relationships with suppliers and 
improve contractual terms, improve product 
quality and access innovative new products. 
Continue to leverage our dedicated sourcing 
office in Hong Kong, Pets at Home Asia,  
to develop relationships with existing and  
new suppliers overseas.  
Improve buying terms by driving economies 
through increased quantities, providing financial 
support for TV and marketing campaigns and 
negotiating on working capital terms.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Sales and revenue 
Total revenues in FY15 grew by 9.6%  
to £729.1m (FY14: £665.4m), with good 
performance across all three business 
segments; Food, Accessories and 
Services. Like-for-like sales grew by 4.2%, 
driven by strength in Advanced Nutrition, 
Health & Hygiene, VIP club, Services and 
omni-channel. 
Total Merchandise revenues, which 
includes Food and Accessories, grew  
by 8.3% to £666.1m (FY14: £615.1m). 
Food revenues grew strongly by 9.8%  
to £359.3m (FY14: £327.3m), reflective  
of excellent performance in dog and  
cat Advanced Nutrition, dog treats and 
premium wet cat food. Advanced Nutrition 
revenues grew by 17.2% to £145.4m (FY14: 
£124.0m), with our flagship private label 
Wainwright’s a key contributor, growing  
by 44.1% to £40.1m (FY14: £27.8m).  
This compares to the Advanced Nutrition 
market in the UK growing at around 14%
*
. 
Grocery dog food performance was weaker 
following our Autumn space re-allocation  
to Advanced Nutrition, but sales densities 
improved post the space re-allocation.
Accessories revenues grew by 6.6%  
to £306.8m (FY14: £287.8m), driven  
by Health and Hygiene sales, a strong 
Christmas range, and dog collars and 
leads. We saw some weakness in Cat  
Litter as a result of new range changes, 
and in Aquatics, reflecting a weaker market 
and the re-allocation of this product space 
when Services are retrofitted to stores.  
We have also experienced weak trading 
and sales in our equestrian business, 
Ride-away, which declined year-on-year.
Services revenues grew 25.2% to £63.0m 
(FY14: £50.3m), reflecting both new 
openings and the growing maturity of our 
vet practices and Groom Rooms. Growth  
in our Joint Venture veterinary practices 
was ahead of the UK veterinary services 
market, generating fee income of £28.2m 
(FY14: £21.6m), growth of 30.7% on the 
prior year.
*   Market data sourced from OC&C Strategy 
Consultants.
Gross margin 
Group gross margin expanded by 40bps  
to 54.2% (FY14: 53.8%), attributable  
to significant expansion in our Services 
margin, as well as good progression  
in Merchandise margin. 
Gross margins within Merchandise  
were 56.3%, an expansion of 19 bps  
on the prior year (FY14: 56.1%). This has  
been achieved primarily through the Food 
business; from the strength of our private 
labels such as Wainwright’s, the decreased 
participation of lower margin grocery food, 
improved terms negotiations, and a lower 
level of discounting across the year as  
our marketing to VIP customers becomes 
more targeted. Accessories margins  
were at a similar level to the prior year  
as we continued our price investment in  
large accessories, increased promotions  
across Aquatics and saw a changing mix  
in cat litter. We have also experienced 
challenge to the Accessories margin  
from omni-channel promotional activities, 
as well as the weakness in the Ride-away 
business.
Gross margin within the Services business 
expanded by 630 bps to 32.6% (H1 FY14: 
26.3%). Of the £7.3m growth in Services 
gross profit, the main contributors have 
been the maturation of our vet practices, 
incremental synergies of £2.6m from  
the Vets4Pets integration, and a benefit  
in grooming from both maturity and 
measures to increase profitability. Adverse 
movements within Services gross margin 
came from our continued investment in  
live pet care and welfare within stores.
In the coming year we expect to see a 
modest accretion in Group gross margin, 
reflecting the positive impacts of our 
maturing vet business and higher margin 
product categories, whilst allowing for 
further price investment in opening price 
point categories and the dilutive impact  
of a high proportion of new Groom Rooms. 
We do not expect any further synergy 
benefits from the Vets4Pets acquisition.

Operating costs
Selling and distribution expenses of 
£257.9m were broadly constant as a 
percentage of Group revenue at 35.4% 
(FY14: 35.2%). Occupation costs (rent, 
services charges and other costs) declined 
as a percentage of sales as we continue  
to benefit from a benign rental market  
and the offset to our rental costs from  
the retrofitting of vet practices to stores. 
Income from vet practice retrofits and 
sublets contributed more than £8.1m to 
our gross property rental costs of £66.5m 
in FY15 (FY14: £61.9m). Colleague costs  
of £136.5m (FY14: £120.9m) increased  
as a result of our new store rollout and 
‘learn to earn’ Steps training programme, 
coupled with our industry leading retention 
rate. Marketing costs also increased  
as we invested in our brand through  
TV advertising and sponsorship. 
In the year ahead we will invest further  
in our brand and marketing, and in the 
hardware and software required to support 
the seamless shopping strategy. We  
expect colleague costs to grow ahead of 
the rate in FY15 as we provide additional 
holiday pay, maintain retention and ensure  
we maintain our reputation as one of the  
best companies to work for in the UK. 
Administration expenses of £40.7m were 
5.6% of revenue (FY14: 5.2%), reflecting an 
additional £2.5m of costs associated with 
being a publicly listed company and £1.7m 
of IFRS2 share based payment charges. 
Underlying EBITDA
Underlying EBITDA of £121.3m, which 
excludes £1.7m of IFRS2 share based 
payment charges, represented a 9.6% 
increase on the previous year (FY14: 
£110.7m). Margin was equal to the prior 
year as we incorporated the first year  
of costs associated with being a public 
company, which totalled £2.5m. 
Our underlying EBITDA margin was 
supported by the increased participation of 
the Services business, which represented 
8.6% of Group revenues in FY15 (FY14: 
7.6%). Despite the considerable immaturity 
of our vet practices and grooming salons, 
the Services business has a higher EBITDA 
margin to that of the Group and this 
support will enable us to invest in the 
future growth of the Group.
 
Going forward, IFRS2 shared based 
payment charges will be considered part  
of ongoing operating expenses, as we 
move to our second year of being a public 
company and we will no longer report  
an underlying EBITDA measure.

items, related party fees, and IFRS2 related share

expenses of £10.6m were attributable to costs 
associated with the Initial Public Offering (£9.4m),  
and costs associated with the integration of the 
Vets4Pets business (£2.3m) net of a significant  
VAT refund (£1.1m).
Finance expense
Net finance expense for FY15 was £9.8m. 
As a result of our declining leverage  
profile and following our recent refinancing 
at more favourable rates, we expect  
net finance expense for FY16 to be 
£5.5–6.0m. Capitalised fees associated 
with the previous facility will be reflected  
as an exceptional charge to the income 
statement of approximately £4.3m in FY16.
Taxation, trading profit & EPS
Underlying total tax expense for the period 
was £19.1m, a rate of 22% on pre tax 
profit. Whilst the UK corporate tax rate for 
the period was 21%, the principal reason 
for the difference relates to items of capital 
expenditure for which depreciation is non 
deductible.
An exceptional tax credit, and cash  
receipt of £4.3m, related to the release  
of a provision made in the prior financial 
year in respect of interest deductability  
on debt associated with the pre IPO capital 
structure. 
Trading profit for the period, which includes 
IFRS2 share based payments, was £67.9m 
(FY14: £38.6m). Basic earnings per share 
were 13.5 pence (FY14: 0.5 pence).

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Working capital
The underlying cash working capital 
improvement for FY15 was £5.8m  
(FY14: £9.6m). 
An increase in inventory of £2.4m is mainly 
reflective of our investment in new food 
ranges and new store openings. Of the 
increase in trade receivables of £9.5m,  
the majority relates to temporary loans 
made to Joint Venture vet practices, 
whereby the Group funds initial setup costs 
until commercial funding is drawn down by 
the practice. The trade payables
*
 increase 
of £17.7m reflects both growth across the 
Group and our efforts to drive a wide range 
of efficiencies and improvements.
We expect a moderate working capital 
outflow in the coming financial year due  
to the additional trading week in the period 
and resultant outflow of trade payables.
*  Trade payables includes trade and other payables, 
with balances associated with fixed assets, tax  
and interest removed, and financial instruments. 
Excludes £25.2m of IPO related payables in the 
FY14 balance.
Borrowings and net debt
The Group’s underlying net debt position at 
the end of year was £192.0m, representing 
a leverage ratio of 1.6x underlying EBITDA, 
a reduction from the FY14 position of 2.3x. 
Whilst the net debt position is ahead of 
expectations, our underlying deleveraging 
plan remains unchanged, at an average of 
0.5x per annum from our prior year position 
of 2.3x reflective of the anticipated working 
capital outflow in FY16 and our dividend 
commitment.
 
Post year end, we announced the closing  
of a new financing agreement for a five 
year, £260m revolving credit facility, which 
is currently drawn to £235m. This replaced 
the Group’s previous £325m of drawn 
facilities, with the differential balance 
between the two facilities being settled 
from the Group’s existing cash resources. 
At current leverage, the facility carries  
a rate of LIBOR +1.5%.

Capital expenditure
Capital investment in the period totalled 
£33.2m (FY14: £30.0m), reflecting our 
increased Services retrofit programme, 
where we incur the capital outlays for 
grooming salons and store refurbishment, 
as well as investment in mezzanine  
floors across the estate which drive space 
and rental efficiencies in both new and 
existing stores.
On a cash basis, capital expenditure in  
the period was £30.4m (FY14: £26.3m).
We expect capital investment for FY16  
to be approximately £40m, reflecting 
investment in our seamless shopping 
strategy, additional mezzanine floors as  
we optimise new store openings and retrofit 
services to the existing estate, and store 
refurbishment as part of the services 
retrofit programme.

Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 3.6 pence per share, leading  
to a total dividend of 5.4 pence per share, 
in respect of the 2015 financial year.  
The final dividend will be proposed by  
the Directors at the 2015 AGM and  
is in addition to the interim dividend of  
1.8 pence per share, paid to shareholders 
on the 16 January 2015. The ex-dividend 
date will be 13 August 2015 and, if 
approved at the Company’s forthcoming 
AGM, will be paid to shareholders on  
14 September 2015 to those shareholders  
on the register at the close of business  
on 14 August 2015.
The Board is targeting a progressive 
dividend payment policy of 40% of earnings, 
reflective of the positive outlook for the

Merchandise
Food
Pet food is a fundamental part of our business, 
generating revenues of £359.3m in 2015, 
representing 54% of Merchandise revenues. 
We stock food products for dogs, cats, small 
mammals, fish, reptiles, birds and horses.
Within the food business, the fastest growing 
segment is Advanced Nutrition, a premium 
tier of food offering significant health benefits 
to dogs and cats. Advanced Nutrition 
represents 41% of our food revenues at 
£145.4m and grew by 44.1% during the year. 
As a premium price point product, a level of 
advice is required to drive sales and our highly 
trained colleagues are essential to increasing 
growth in this category. The distribution 
channels for Advanced Nutrition are selective 
and it is only sold by pet specialists, with  
Pets at Home holding 53% market share  
of this product segment in 2014.
Other important segments within food 
include grocery food, which can be found  
in both pet specialists and supermarkets, 
and treats. Treats are a fast growing 
market segment and we are adding new 
brands and innovation in this category 
which reflect humanisation and wellness 
trends, to further enhance our growth. 
 “ Within the food

as well as Purely for cats. We launched a 
new private label Advanced Nutrition brand 
during the year, Evolution Naturally, which 
brings the high protein dog and cat food 
trend, seen in the US market, to the UK. 
Our Merchandise segment is  
comprised of Food and Accessories

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Looking forward, we are aiming to increase 
our branded Advanced Nutrition ranges, 
continue re-allocating space away from 
grocery and into Advanced Nutrition, extend 
our Wainwright’s offering and add further 
private label ranges to complement the 
branded ranges.
Accessories
Accessories revenues grew by 6.6% to 
£306.8m in 2015 and represent 46%  
of Merchandise revenues. 
Dog and cat accessories include bedding, 
collars and leads, feeding bowls, clothing, 
toys, grooming products, training and 
behavioural products and travel 
accessories. Other accessories include 
small animal homes and bedding, 
equestrian accessories, and Health  
and Hygiene products.
We believe the pet accessories market 
follows many of the same trends as the 
human market, reflecting the increasing 
humanisation of pets by their engaged 
owners. This includes design trends  
and technological developments.
Own brands and private labels represent 
51% of store revenues within the 
Accessories business. Our flagship private 
label, Wainwright’s, includes collars, leads 
and toys. Other private label accessories 
brands include Ruffer & Tuffer toys, 3 Peaks 
dog beds and clothing, and Willows and 
Woodlands small animal accessories. 
Innovation and exclusivity
Innovation in our food and accessories 
business is a key strategic priority.  
Our highly engaged pet customers value 
product breadth, refreshment and being 
able to choose something new and 
different each time they are in-store.  
Our ability to develop such a large number 
of private label and own brand products  
is assisted by our in-house innovation  
and design teams, and our dedicated 
sourcing office in Asia.
Exclusivity is also crucial to attracting  
and retaining customers and we seek to 
source new and innovative products to the 
UK market on an exclusive basis, ahead  
of our competitors.

Services
Pet services provide customers with a 
further reason to visit our stores, as well  
as creating theatre for our customers and 
their children. Adding vet practices and 
grooming salons to stores increases the 
frequency with which customers visit, lifting 
merchandise product spend and enhancing 
brand loyalty. 
Veterinary practices
Pets at Home operates the only large scale 
joint venture veterinary services business  
in the UK market, under our two brands – 
Vets4Pets and Companion Care. Practices  
are operated within stores, as well as in 
standalone locations.
 “ Pets at Home operates 
the only large scale  
joint venture veterinary 
services business in  
the UK market.”
 
The JV model allows each vet practice  
to operate as an independent business, 
owned by a veterinary JV partner and  
Pets at Home, and is funded by small  
loans into the business by the JV partner 
and Pets at Home, alongside a larger, 
independent bank loan. The JV partner 
pays a percentage of their revenue in the 
form of fee income to Pets at Home, for 
which we provide all the administrative  
and back office support, allowing the vet 
partner and their colleagues to focus on 
clinical excellence and customer service.  
If the practice is located in one of our 
stores, a service charge is also payable  
to Pets at Home, reflecting the cost of the 
space occupied. The JV Partner has access 
to all profits in the business when the loans 
are repaid and is entitled to the increase  
in value of the business if they wish to  
sell the practice to a new JV partner.
We also operate nine practices wholly 
owned by Pets at Home. These enable  
us to trial new initiatives before rolling out 
across the JV practice network, as well as 
offering vets the opportunity to trial working 
in one of our practices before committing 
to the JV partnership.
Our Services segment is comprised 
of our vet practice, grooming salon 
and insurance businesses, as well as  
our pet sales.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 All new vet practices are opened under  
the Vets4Pets brand and this has become 
our primary brand, held by 71% of practices 
in the Group. 
Looking forward, we will continue to 
develop a number of strategic initiatives 
across the Vet Group, including the  
addition of specialist referral hospitals,  
the development of existing practices  
into 24/7 or extended hours surgeries, 
extending our pet care plans into chronic 
care and other segments, and continuing 
with Vets4Pets brand investment and 
advertisement. 
Grooming salons
We operate the largest branded chain  
of pet grooming salons in the UK. Groom 
Room salons are wholly owned and 
operated by Pets at Home and are primarily 
located within our stores, alongside two 
trials of grooming salons co-located with  
a standalone vet practice.
Groom Rooms offer both dog and cat 
grooming services, including bathing, 
clipping, coat cutting and nail trimming.  
The salons are operated by colleagues who 
have participated in extensive training and 
education programmes to become highly 
skilled grooming stylists.
In the fragmented UK grooming market, 
where service and quality levels can vary 
considerably, our aim is to create a national 
brand with consistent, outstanding service.
Pet insurance
We offer Pets at Home branded insurance  
in our stores and online, which provides 
cover for dogs, cats or rabbits. We operate 
on an introducer basis, with the insurance 
product issued and underwritten by a  
third party. 
The VIP loyalty club is allowing us to increase customer use of our grooming  
and vet services. 
The VIP card can be swiped and charity lifelines accumulated across our stores, 
grooming salons and vet practices, allowing us to track integrated customer spend 
behaviour. As part of the VIP signup process, customers share with us the details  
of their pets; name, type, breed and age.
How do we encourage VIPs to use pet services?
•  New VIP members receive 25% off a full dog groom
•  After any subsequent dog grooms, VIPs receive a follow up discount voucher
•  New VIP members can receive a health check with one of our vets for only £10
•  Vet and grooming services are marketed to VIP members who have pets suitable 
for such services, and are not currently using the Groom Room or vet practices.

Brand and 
reputation
The Group recognises the need to protect its 
brand and reputation. Failure to do so could 
result in a loss of trust and confidence by both 
customers and colleagues.
As a retailer of small pets across a large number of stores, the highest possible welfare 
standards must be maintained at all times. This also extends into the supply chain with  
our pet suppliers. We operate a comprehensive pet welfare audit process, utilising internal 
and external resources, where all stores receive unannounced visits on a regular basis.  
This helps ensure our high standards are maintained across the chain. With our suppliers, 
we expect the same high standards of welfare and all suppliers are visited regularly by vets, 
third party assessors, our field pet team and an animal welfare organisation and assessed 
against a comprehensive set of welfare and standards criteria. 
The Group also deals with customers’ pets on a daily basis through its veterinary practices, 
Groom Room salons and Support Adoption centres, which may on occasion result in the 
death or injury of pets whilst in our care. We have a clear set of operational protocols, with 
the veterinary practices subject to the professional standards mandated by the Royal College 
of Veterinary Surgeons. We also have highly visible field operations resource in respect of 
in-store pets, grooming and veterinary surgeries. Each area has specific resource focused  
on ensuring the highest pet welfare standards are maintained. 
We operate a confidential ‘Pet Promise Line’ where colleagues are able to raise concerns 
about pet care directly with our Head of Pets.
Pet welfare across the Group is overseen by the ‘Pets Before Profit’ Board committee.  
This meets regularly to review pet welfare and check that appropriate processes are  
in place to ensure we maintain our high welfare standards.
As we continue to increase our size and scale we must work to ensure pet welfare 
standards continue to be maintained at a high level across the Group. We will continue 
to monitor welfare standards closely and take appropriate steps where required to 
maintain them.

Competition
The Group competes with a wide variety  
of retailers and vet practices, including other  
pet specialists, supermarkets and discounters.
Online competition is also a risk, as large  
well known internet businesses expand into  
pet products and the established pet product sites 
improve and expand their offer.
Failure to keep abreast of, and respond to, 
developments by our competition in the areas  
of price, range, quality and service could have  
an adverse impact on the Group’s financial 
performance and impact opportunities for growth.
We continue to evolve our proposition through the addition of Vets and Groomers into our 
existing store estate whilst continuing to innovate with the regular introduction of new and 
exclusive products into our food and accessory ranges. As a specialist retailer, the delivery  
of friendly expertise through our highly engaged/trained store colleagues is a key element  
of our proposition and we continue to invest to ensure our service standards, as measured  
by our customers through Fish4opinion, are continually improved. The Pets at Home website 
was successfully upgraded in January 2014 to ensure that our technology platform is capable 
of supporting our online strategy. Further upgrades have taken place since then and the  
site has recently been optimised for mobile usage.
The VIP (Very Important Pet) club was launched in November 2012 and has been very 
successful – attracting 3.2m members at Financial year end. This customer and pet 
database enables more targeted marketing, which helps drive up basket values and enables 
us to build a stronger sense of engagement with our customers and their pets. 
We track and respond to competitor pricing movements where appropriate. Continuous 
market research is carried out to review the pet market both at home and abroad and 
understand what our competitors are doing worldwide. This helps identify further changes/
initiatives that need to be implemented to help keep Pets at Home ahead of the competition 
here in the UK and remain a leader in the market.
Recent competition for physical retail store space has been limited and we do  
not expect this to change in the near term. There is some increase in the number  
of pure-play online competitors but this is not expected to have a significant impact  
on our business. Competitor pricing strategies could become more competitive.
  
Grow like-for-like
Grow space and optimise footprint

Stores and 
services 
expansion
A key part of the Group’s growth strategy  
is to increase the number of stores and  
to grow its in-store and standalone veterinary 
practices and Groom Room grooming salons. 
If we are unable to deliver the number of sites 
necessary to fulfil the stores and services 
expansion laid out in our strategy and maintain 
our existing numbers of sites, our expected 
financial performance could be adversely 
impacted.
To successfully open a new store, we have to, in the first instance, identify an appropriate 
location with a store size appropriate to the local market and with lease terms that are 
acceptable. We have the ability, with smaller footprint stores, to utilise mezzanine space  
to deploy Vet and Groom Room offerings, maximising the opportunity to open the majority  
of stores with a full service proposition. Any proposed new store investment has to  
deliver an appropriate financial return after taking into account any financial impact on  
the existing store portfolio. These processes are equally applicable when the Group looks  
to open a standalone veterinary practice. However, in common with our in-store veterinary 
practice opening programme, we also need to recruit a joint venture veterinary partner  
with the ability to fund their investment into the joint venture and with the ability to provide 
the personal guarantee to the bank providing the third party financing to the joint venture 
veterinary practice. 
The business maintains new store and new joint venture partner pipelines which identify 
potential locations and potential partners at each stage of our process. This enables  
the Board to monitor progress in delivering the expected number of new stores, veterinary 
practices and groom rooms. Certain geographical areas (for example, within the M25) 
represent a particular risk as suitable space for new stores, Groom Rooms and vet  
practices is limited and existing sites may be redeveloped. Where existing sites are at  
risk of redevelopment or where leases may not be renewed, specific measures are taken  
to maximise the opportunity for the Group including considering purchasing the freehold  
if appropriate.
An increased proportion of our new stores will be located on newly developed  
retail parks and park extensions. Whilst this can create greater timing uncertainties,  
we do not expect any challenges in relation to the volume of new space available.

Our people
As a specialist retailer, retaining highly trained 
and engaged colleagues is fundamental to  
our continued success and the delivery of our 
future growth. 
If we do not retain and train our colleagues,  
it is unlikely that we will be able to deliver the 
outstanding customer service which is a key 
element of our proposition.
Our growth plans and future success are at risk  
if we do not recruit and retain high calibre, 
talented senior management.
We continue to invest in training to broaden the skill base of colleagues across the business. 
We also closely monitor colleague retention rates and engagement, the latter through  
our annual ‘We’re All Ears’ engagement survey which is followed up by ‘We’re All Action’  
to ensure the business responds appropriately to opportunities for improvement raised by 
colleagues. We also have a rolling programme of listening groups across the business to ensure 
we are addressing issues on an ongoing basis and we are participating in the ‘Great Place  
to Work’ programme.
Our remuneration policy, as set out on pages 86 to 103, is designed to ensure executives  
of the necessary calibre are attracted and retained and that through our Long-Term Incentive 
Plans and Company Share Option Plan, colleagues across the business can share in our 
success. Similarly we continually review the remuneration and benefits packages available  
to all colleagues to ensure our colleagues are appropriately rewarded for the substantial 
contribution they make to our growth and success. Succession plans are in place for key  
roles and these are regularly reviewed by the board and senior management.
We need to ensure that the Group continues to be an attractive place to work 
particularly if employment levels continue to increase nationally and there is more 
competition in the job market.

Business  
Systems and 
Information 
Security
We are aware of the need to keep core business 
systems up to date, with the capability to support 
the Group’s growth plans.
If our investments in both systems and 
infrastructure do not keep pace with the growth  
of the business there may be a consequent 
limitation to our ability to trade and expand. Also, 
the scale of system and infrastructure change  
is currently significant and this may impact on  
our ability to deliver IT services to the business.
We hold a significant amount of customer data  
and recognise the need to keep this secure. Any 
information security breach could adversely affect 
our reputation and the take up of our customer 
loyalty scheme.
We are in the process of upgrading our business critical systems to industry leading 
packages. SAP was implemented in the prior financial year and the HANA and BPC modules 
have recently been added. Our warehouse management system has been replaced with  
JDA during this year and core enterprise applications such as IBM Websphere have been 
upgraded. We continue to monitor the level of activity within the Business Systems function 
and will respond appropriately should IT project or service delivery be at risk.
Disaster recovery is a key part of our systems strategy, enabling us to continue to trade  
in the event of a system outage. Disaster Recovery plans have been reviewed and updated 
and a schedule for regular testing is now in place. The business also undertakes regular 
system penetration testing.
Our customer loyalty scheme data is held by a specialist third party who has industry  
standard information security accreditations and is regularly audited. Encryption is used to 
protect the transmission of customer data. Internal audits of IT security and data protection 
have recently taken place within Pets at Home, to ensure we have both a focus and 
improvement plan in respect of processes and control in this area.
Our systems stability and reliability will continue to improve as upgrades  
and enhancements take place and new systems are adopted. 
Information security risks are likely to continue to increase. We monitor  
this risk and will strengthen our controls as required.
  
Grow like-for-like
Supply Chain/
Sourcing
During the financial year, approximately 17%  
of the Group’s Merchandise cost of goods were 
globally sourced, and as a consequence we are 
exposed to the risks associated with international 
trade, such as inflation, changing regulatory 
frameworks and currency exposure. We are also 
exposed to the risks associated with the quality  
and safety of products produced globally on behalf 
of the Group, many of which are own branded or 
exclusive private labels. 
A failure to adequately manage this risk could lead to 
reputational damage, reflected in a lack of confidence 
by customers and colleagues in the Group brands.
We have two national distribution centres covering the 
north and south of the UK respectively. A disaster at 
one of the DCs may result in a significant interruption 
to the supply of stock for a large number of stores 
and in the fulfilment of internet orders.
Having Pets at Home colleagues on the ground working collaboratively with suppliers enables  
us to monitor closely compliance with the Group’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policy, 
as well as compliance with our Supplier Quality Manual. In addition, unannounced visits are 
undertaken by an independent third party to further monitor compliance with Group policies.  
A review of our sourcing activities in the Far East was carried out by our Internal Audit department 
during the year and no significant issues were noted.
Exposure to foreign currency movements is mitigated through our hedging strategy.  
More detail on this can be found on page 138.
Business continuity plans are in place for the distribution centres and plans are in place to 
mitigate the impact of any disaster by servicing all stores from a single distribution centre.
Further audit diligence in regard to the supply chain will take place over the next 
financial year. Our strong supplier relationships will help to ensure that risks in this area 
are well managed.

Liquidity and 
Credit Risk
The business requires adequate cash resources 
to enable it to fund its growth plans through  
its capital projects and/or an expansion of the 
Group’s working capital requirement. 
Without adequate cash resources the  
Group may be unable to deliver its growth  
plans, with a consequent impact on future 
financial performance.
The Group’s finances are continually monitored in the context of its growth plans.  
As a result the Group is confident that it has adequate medium-term financing in place,  
with a broad syndicate of ten banks. 
The Group’s growth plans in respect of joint venture veterinary practices is predicated  
on the availability of finance for new joint venture veterinary partners to fund both the capital 
cost and working capital requirement for each new practice opening. The Group has two 
revolving and two non-revolving facilities in place with major high street lenders which give  
us confidence that our medium-term growth plans are financed adequately. 
The Group ensures that all cash surpluses are invested with banks which have credit ratings 
and investment criteria that meet the requirements set out in the Group Treasury policy, 
which has been approved by the Board. 
The Group’s key suppliers are exposed to credit risk and as part of the Group’s overall risk 
management programme, the business has identified alternative suppliers and developed 
contingency plans, particularly in respect of own label and private label food products.
We will continue to monitor our finances and build relationships with our finance 
providers. We do not anticipate significant macroeconomic changes in the short  
to medium term that may impact on this risk area.

Treasury and 
Financial Risk
The Group has an exposure to exchange  
rate risk in respect of the US dollar which  
is the principal purchase currency for goods 
sourced from the Far East. The Group also  
faces risks from changes to interest rates  
and compliance with taxation legislation.
If we do not adequately manage this exposure 
there could be an impact on the Group’s financial 
performance with a consequential impact on 
operational and growth plans.
This exposure to FX fluctuation is managed via forward foreign currency contracts which  
are designated as cash flow hedges. 
The Group has borrowings with floating interest rates linked to LIBOR, thereby exposing the 
Group to fluctuations in LIBOR and the consequent impact on interest cost. To manage this 
risk the Group has interest rate swaps in place which fix the interest rate on a significant 
proportion of the Group borrowings. Further details can be found on page 134. 
All hedging activity is undertaken by the Group Treasury function in accordance with the 
Group Treasury policy which sets out the criteria for counterparties with whom the Group  
can transact and clearly states that all hedging activities are undertaken in the context  
of known and forecast cashflows, with speculative transactions specifically prohibited.
Dedicated tax resource is in place and specialist tax advisors are retained to assist in this area.
Ongoing currency movements between the US dollar and GBP may result in further 
foreign exchange risk. We will continue to monitor this and adjust our approach  
to hedging where necessary.
 
Grow margins
Regulatory  
and 
Compliance
Many of the Group’s activities are regulated  
by legislation and standards including, but not 
limited to, trading, advertising, product quality, 
health and safety, pet shop licensing, carbon 
emission reporting, bribery act and data 
protection. Failure to comply with these may 
result in financial or reputational damage.
We actively monitor compliance with our existing obligations and we have internal policies  
and standards to ensure compliance where appropriate. We also provide training for colleagues 
where required and operate a confidential hotline for colleagues to raise concerns in 
confidence.
Our suppliers commit to adhering to relevant regulations and standards as outlined in our 
Quality Manual. We carry out a rolling programme of supplier audits to check for compliance 
with our requirements.
We continue to monitor potential future developments such as the new European  
Data Protection Regulation and plan accordingly.

Extreme 
Weather
Prolonged extreme or unseasonal weather 
conditions may reduce footfall in our stores, 
resulting in weak sales, leading to adverse 
impacts on profit and inventory.
We actively monitor and forecast demand and, should this risk occur, we would review 
planned and tactical promotional activity to determine whether strengthening this would  
drive sales.
Planned improvements in our omni-channel offering, including the ability to use  
mobile devices, will improve our resilience to reduced store footfall during periods  
of extreme weather.

Business  
Systems and 
Information 
Security
We are aware of the need to keep core business 
systems up to date, with the capability to support 
the Group’s growth plans.
If our investments in both systems and 
infrastructure do not keep pace with the growth  
of the business there may be a consequent 
limitation to our ability to trade and expand. Also, 
the scale of system and infrastructure change  
is currently significant and this may impact on  
our ability to deliver IT services to the business.
We hold a significant amount of customer data  
and recognise the need to keep this secure. Any 
information security breach could adversely affect 
our reputation and the take up of our customer 
loyalty scheme.
We are in the process of upgrading our business critical systems to industry leading 
packages. SAP was implemented in the prior financial year and the HANA and BPC modules 
have recently been added. Our warehouse management system has been replaced with  
JDA during this year and core enterprise applications such as IBM Websphere have been 
upgraded. We continue to monitor the level of activity within the Business Systems function 
and will respond appropriately should IT project or service delivery be at risk.
Disaster recovery is a key part of our systems strategy, enabling us to continue to trade  
in the event of a system outage. Disaster Recovery plans have been reviewed and updated 
and a schedule for regular testing is now in place. The business also undertakes regular 
system penetration testing.
Our customer loyalty scheme data is held by a specialist third party who has industry  
standard information security accreditations and is regularly audited. Encryption is used to 
protect the transmission of customer data. Internal audits of IT security and data protection 
have recently taken place within Pets at Home, to ensure we have both a focus and 
improvement plan in respect of processes and control in this area.
Our systems stability and reliability will continue to improve as upgrades  
and enhancements take place and new systems are adopted. 
Information security risks are likely to continue to increase. We monitor  
this risk and will strengthen our controls as required.
  
Grow like-for-like
Supply Chain/
Sourcing
During the financial year, approximately 17%  
of the Group’s Merchandise cost of goods were 
globally sourced, and as a consequence we are 
exposed to the risks associated with international 
trade, such as inflation, changing regulatory 
frameworks and currency exposure. We are also 
exposed to the risks associated with the quality  
and safety of products produced globally on behalf 
of the Group, many of which are own branded or 
exclusive private labels. 
A failure to adequately manage this risk could lead to 
reputational damage, reflected in a lack of confidence 
by customers and colleagues in the Group brands.
We have two national distribution centres covering the 
north and south of the UK respectively. A disaster at 
one of the DCs may result in a significant interruption 
to the supply of stock for a large number of stores 
and in the fulfilment of internet orders.
Having Pets at Home colleagues on the ground working collaboratively with suppliers enables  
us to monitor closely compliance with the Group’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policy, 
as well as compliance with our Supplier Quality Manual. In addition, unannounced visits are 
undertaken by an independent third party to further monitor compliance with Group policies.  
A review of our sourcing activities in the Far East was carried out by our Internal Audit department 
during the year and no significant issues were noted.
Exposure to foreign currency movements is mitigated through our hedging strategy.  
More detail on this can be found on page 138.
Business continuity plans are in place for the distribution centres and plans are in place to 
mitigate the impact of any disaster by servicing all stores from a single distribution centre.
Further audit diligence in regard to the supply chain will take place over the next 
financial year. Our strong supplier relationships will help to ensure that risks in this area 
are well managed.
  
Grow like-for-like

Liquidity and 
Credit Risk
The business requires adequate cash resources 
to enable it to fund its growth plans through  
its capital projects and/or an expansion of the 
Group’s working capital requirement. 
Without adequate cash resources the  
Group may be unable to deliver its growth  
plans, with a consequent impact on future 
financial performance.
The Group’s finances are continually monitored in the context of its growth plans.  
As a result the Group is confident that it has adequate medium-term financing in place,  
with a broad syndicate of ten banks. 
The Group’s growth plans in respect of joint venture veterinary practices is predicated  
on the availability of finance for new joint venture veterinary partners to fund both the capital 
cost and working capital requirement for each new practice opening. The Group has two 
revolving and two non-revolving facilities in place with major high street lenders which give  
us confidence that our medium-term growth plans are financed adequately. 
The Group ensures that all cash surpluses are invested with banks which have credit ratings 
and investment criteria that meet the requirements set out in the Group Treasury policy, 
which has been approved by the Board. 
The Group’s key suppliers are exposed to credit risk and as part of the Group’s overall risk 
management programme, the business has identified alternative suppliers and developed 
contingency plans, particularly in respect of own label and private label food products.

Overview | Strategy | Performance Corporate Social Responsibility
Responsible retailing is 
at the heart of our business
Introduction
I am proud to introduce  
our 2015 Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) report. 
Behaving responsibly is 
integral to how our business 
operates and fundamental to 
delivering across our PawPrint.
Our customers expect us to live our values, 
our investors see the strength of our 
practices as a key driver of our business 
model and our pets certainly rely on  
us to deliver on our principles. Setting  
the highest standards and the clearest 
expectations about the way we engage 
with our colleagues, communities, 
suppliers and environment is therefore 
critical to our ongoing success and makes 
us the unique business that we are today. 
At Pets at Home, we have a long history  
of successfully driving our CSR values 
throughout our business and we are 
committed to living the values which are 
important to our colleagues, customers 
and broader stakeholders. 
At the start of the year we formally 
established our CSR Board Committee.  
The role of the Committee is to advise the 
Board on the development and direction  
of the Group’s CSR objectives and strategy 
and to ensure that it is aligned with and 
supports our values whilst simultaneously 
innovating and helping to drive our 
business forward. To ensure that we live 
our number one value, Pets Before Profit, 
we have also established a second Board 
Committee, specifically to help ensure that 
we maintain the highest possible welfare 
standards for all pets in our care.
We have been developing our CSR strategy 
for some time and CSR is reflected in  
our colleagues’ roles and responsibilities,  
in our strategy development processes  
and in our reporting structures. To drive  
the implementation of our CSR strategy 
throughout the Group we have recently 
formed a CSR Operations Board made up  
of the key members of our team, reporting 
directly into the CSR Board Committee. 
2015 has been a year of considerable 
progress. Some of the developments that 
we are most proud of include:
Our Pets People
• Entered Great Places to Work survey  
and gained 15th place;
• Increased colleague engagement to 94%;
Heart of the community
• Over 20,000 pet workshops carried out 
with school children in our stores;
• £1.4m worth of lifelines donated by VIP 
members to customer’s chosen charities;
Sourcing with integrity 
• The RSPCA inspected all of our primary 
pet suppliers;
• 100% of Pets at Home branded and 
Pets at Home registered branded 
suppliers managed by PAH Asia  
have now received and passed  
an independent ethical audit;

Looking forward, we will continue to focus 
on the four pillars of our CSR strategy  
and which you can read about in the 
following pages. This coming year we  
will also undertake a detailed strategy 
review across each area, setting ourselves 
challenging longer-term targets that will 
guide our journey year on year. 
I hope that you will enjoy reading our 
report and be as excited as we are about 
our plans for next year and beyond.

colleague engagement
Listening to our colleagues is a key part  
of the Pets at Home culture and we do  
this in several ways. ‘We’re all Ears’ is our 
own internal engagement survey. In 2015, 
96% of colleagues, 6,643, took part and  
we received some great feedback. However,  
the survey is only the start and the real  
work comes once we have the results  
and move into ‘We’re all Action’ mode, 
proactively responding to the feedback  
we have received. 
In addition to our own internal survey,  
this year we have also taken part in  
the independent external Great Place  
to Work survey, giving colleagues further 
opportunities to tell us what they like  
about working for Pets at Home and how 
we can become even better. We achieved 
15th position.
Throughout the business we hold regular 
focus groups/listening groups and 
feedback sessions at all colleague levels. 
We also believe it’s important that we  
say ‘thank you’ to all of our colleagues who  
have really gone above and beyond for us  
in the year. Last Christmas we re-launched 
our ‘Values Challenge’ and encouraged 
colleagues to recognise each other for 
living our values. In December 2014, more 
than 12,000 ‘thank yous’ were received  
by colleagues. 
 
Our Pets People
World-class training  
 5 , 5 46
colleagues completed Steps 1 and 2
At the heart of the training we provide  
for our store colleagues is our earn as you 
learn steps programme. Steps 1 and 2 
provide the knowledge we believe is 
essential for our colleagues to deliver a 
consistently high level of customer service 
and are compulsory. At the end of the  
year, we had 5,546 (89%) colleagues who  
have completed both Step 1 and 2. Step 3 
provides more specialised knowledge in 
nutrition, aquatics, reptile, small animals, 
dog and cat. Following feedback from 
colleagues who told us they really wanted 
an opportunity to develop their knowledge 
and skills further, we have opened up 
opportunities for colleagues to gain Step 3 
qualification in up to three specialisms  
and actively encourage colleagues to take 
that next step. As a result of that feedback,  
the numbers studying for Step 3 have  
risen to 421 at the end of this year from 
366 at the end of the previous year. 
Two years ago we also launched Step 4. 
This Step is specifically targeted at 
colleagues who want to develop a career 
with pets rather than into management  
and enables them to complete a year-long 
programme on their area of speciality.  
Once qualified, they are given a pay 
increase equivalent to that of an Assistant 
Manager’s salary. 
We also have a detailed three steps 
training programme in our Groom Rooms 
called “Prep It, “Snip It” and “Clip It”.  
Each part of the steps is supported by  
a grooming portfolio of evidence which 
includes text and supporting photographs 
which cover all aspects of grooming that 
the colleagues complete in the salon.  
The steps take nine months to complete 
following nine practical assessments,  
three underpinning knowledge work books, 
three pet pawtal tests, three CPD courses 
and over 1,400 hours of training.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Training with Pets at Home
“I joined Pets at Home in August 2004  
and immediately started my training with 
Step 1. It was great to feel that the 
business was investing in me as a person 
and I was really excited to complete the 
first Step because it then meant that  
I was able to start selling pets. This is 
something you can’t do until the Field Pet 
Manager has signed off the training and 
is happy that you have all of the skills 
necessary to be able to advise customers 
on the best pets for them and, more 
importantly, how they should look after 
them once they have got them home. 
I then started Step 2, which focused  
in more detail on areas such as  
expertise in cats, dogs, fish and reptiles 
plus specialist areas such as nutrition, 
parasites and other pests. Because of 
the extra skills I had learnt I also received 
a pay increase when I had finished.
Although Step 3 is voluntary, I wanted  
to do it to gain more pet care expertise  
and so I decided on a course in Aquatics.  
The work was quite intense and it takes 
about a year to complete it. Pets at Home 
also gave me another pay increase to say 
well done and to recognise my expertise. 
Last year, Step 4 was launched and  
I decided to go for that one too. Again,  
I specialised in Aquatics. It has taken  
me another year to complete it but I was 
really pleased to hear that I passed it  
on 8 May 2014.
For me, the training that Pets at Home 
provides to its colleagues is really 
amazing. It’s given me the chance to 
learn, improve my skills and build my 
expertise in the areas that I am interested 
in. It means that when a customer  
comes into my store and needs to know 
about Aquatics, I’m the man who can 
really help.”

In addition, our Groom Room salon manager 
training now embeds the practical skills, 
knowledge and understanding of the  
City and Guild Level 3 Professional Diploma  
for Grooming Stylists. With over 60 Groom 
Room managers already enrolled to this 
level, we plan for every salon to have  
a colleague qualified to this level. These  
will be trained through our three training 
academies which will provide this 
qualification.
 
For colleagues wishing to develop their 
management careers, we also have 
programmes to support them as they  
move through the business. Our Rising Star 
programme supports our store colleagues 
as they rise to Assistant Manager level,  
our Moving on Up programme supports 
them through to Deputy Manager level  
and our Fast Track programme supports 
them through to becoming Store Manager.  
We are proud that more than 50% of our 
Store Managers have come through the 
Fast Track system.

Reduction in colleague accident rate 
We are committed to providing a safe  
and healthy environment for all of our 
colleagues, customers and third party 
contractors and we have robust control 
measures in place to minimise the risk of 
incidents. We actively encourage a positive 
health and safety culture throughout our 
stores, veterinary practices, groomers, 
distribution centres and support offices.
We continue to benchmark the Group 
Accident Incident Rate which also includes 
the accidents which have taken place in our 
joint venture veterinary surgeries. During 
the financial year, total accidents across 
the Group increased by 0.5%, due to the 
expansion of the Group across all areas. 
However, there has been a significant 
reduction in the Colleague Accident  
Rate from 11.68 to 8.17 accidents per 
1,000 colleagues, and a reduction in the 
Customer Accident Rate from 1.50 to 1.29 
per 100,000 transactions. The number  
of RIDDOR accidents decreased by 15%  
in our Stores/Practices during the year.  
In Distribution, there was a slight increase 
of 0.02 accidents per 100,000 hours 
worked but a 0.24 decrease in RIDDOR 
accidents for the year. 
Our health and safety handbook has been 
revised and re-launched to bring together 
the Group’s standards on health and safety. 
It includes the fundamental safety systems 
in all parts of the business that colleagues 
and visitors are expected to follow.
This year for the first time, our two 
distribution centres applied for the British 
Safety Council’s International Safety 
Awards. Both sites received Merits. The 
award is marked out of 60 points and to 
gain a merit a score of between 48 and 59 
must be achieved. Our distribution centre, 
in Stoke, achieved 58 and our distribution 
centre, in Northampton, achieved 57.  
In addition, we also won the “Best in Sector 
Award for Wholesale and Retail services” 
being one out of only 11 organisations  
that won a best in sector award.
We continue to promote health and safety 
through the Group to all of our colleagues 
and promote a “Stay Safe” culture.

Our commitment
Being at the ‘Heart of Every Community’ is one of the core  
values we live by. With 400 stores and 338 vet practices serving 
neighbourhoods the length and breadth of the UK we believe  
that we have a responsibility to contribute positively towards the 
wellbeing of our local communities.
Leading the way on responsible  
pet ownership 
 76 3
Beaver, Cubs and Brownie 
workshops held in stores
Young people are the pet owners of 
tomorrow. Their knowledge about pet  
care and commitment to their pets flows 
through to their parents today. Educating 
children about responsible pet ownership  
is therefore an incredibly important job and 
one that we take very seriously. 
To maintain the momentum in this initiative, 
we run “My Pond League”, our internal 
programme that awards points to each  
of our stores for the number of events that 
they hold for their local community. The 
number of Pond League points awarded to 
stores continues to increase year on year.
As part of “My Pond League”, we have been 
running our children education programme 
for a number of years. In the last year, 714 
schools have visited our stores, an increase 
from 417 last year. In addition, over 19,000 
events have been held during weekends  
and school holidays where we have held 
dedicated workshops to teach children 
about responsible pet ownership. 
We also continue to work closely with the 
Scout Association and sponsor their Animal 
Care badge. This year we have also started 
sponsorship of a similar badge for the  
Girl Guides Association. To gain this badge,  
we offer free workshops through “My Pond 
League” and this year we held 910 events 
(an increase from 622 last year).
To make it easier for children to participate 
in our events, we have put in place an 
online booking system for each of our 
stores. We rolled this out during Easter 
week this year and we received over 
10,500 bookings for a seven day period.

pets rehomed through adoption 
centres in our stores
We take great care when we sell a pet  
to make sure that they all go to loving 
forever homes. But that’s not where we  
see our responsibility ending. Sometimes, 
due to circumstances beyond their control, 
owners can find that they are no longer 
able to look after their pet. Through our 
dedicated in-store adoption centres, we  
are committed to rehoming any pet that  
we have sold and that subsequently needs 
a new family. We will also rehome pets that 
did not come from us originally, if they are  
a type that we sell and our colleagues are 
trained to care for. This year we rehomed 
over 68,000 pets through the adoption 
centres in our stores.

In addition to the loyalty rewards offered by 
our VIP club, we also award our customers 
points for every purchase they make with

‘VIP Lifelines’ which our customers can 
donate to local animal charities. This year, 
our VIP club members across the country 
have helped us raise over £1.4m worth of 
Lifelines donations, supporting more than 
600 animal charities throughout the UK. 
 
Providing work inspiration 
 1 , 000
work inspiration placements
We have offered work experience for many 
years to a wide variety of people within our 
communities, however, next year, we want 
to elevate our work experience into work 
inspiration. We aim to offer a programme 
that will not only provide those on 
placement with the skills and knowledge 
about the world of work but also inspiration 
to be the best that they can be. We will be 
working with the Shaw Trust, who support 
disabled people, the Retail Trust, in their 
Retail Right programme which support 
18–22 year old NEETs (not in education, 
employment or training) and local schools 
and colleagues for year 10 pupils and 
Animal Management (year 1) students.  
The programme we offer is designed to  
give them key skills, from the importance  
of timekeeping and appearance to softer 
skills of team work and customer service, 
and will provide all those on placement with 
a record of the skills learned, their self-
review and a reference to help to support 
them gain future employment. We aim  
to have up to 1,000 of these placements 
each year. 
Support Adoption for Pets
Support Adoption for Pets is a charity  
with a single passionate aim. It exists  
to help give abandoned and homeless  
pets a second chance of happiness.  
Most Animal Rescue Centres are 
completely reliant on donations and public 
support to help provide sanctuary for the 
pets in their care and Support Adoption  
for Pets provides much needed funding and 
grants to these organisations. Every year, 
Support Adoption for Pets hosts a number 
of events in our stores to raise much 
needed funds to enable it to support these 
Centres. This year, our stores raised £1.9m 
against a target of £1m. In total, £3.1m 
was raised for Support Adoption for Pets, 
beating the target of £2.8m.
Feeding the Dogs Trust
In August 2013, we made a commitment 
that, for the next three years, we would 
fund and provide Wainwright’s dog food for 
all of the dogs at the Dogs Trust. With more 
than 1,400 dogs in their care at any one 
time, they need a lot of food! Plus, each 
dog that is re-homed from the Dogs Trust 
takes home a 2kg bag of Wainwright’s dog 
food to help start the next chapter of their 
lives in the best way possible. This means 
that this year alone we have provided 
£635,493 worth of Wainwright’s dog food  
to the Dogs Trust. 
Charity days
We provide every colleague the opportunity 
to help out at a charity of their choice  
for one day in the year, which amounted  
to 7,400 charity leave days this year.

Our commitment
Pets are both our business and our passion and ‘Pets before Profits’ 
has always been our number one core value. Advocating the ethical 
and responsible treatment of pets is incredibly important to us and  
we believe the best way to do this is to lead by example, so we keep  
every aspect of our pet operations under regular scrutiny.
 
Sourcing with Integrity
Driving the standards  
in the pet industry
 10 0 %
of our primary pet suppliers visited 
by the RSPCA
We continue to challenge and revise  
our own internal standards and codes  
of practice, as well as our methodologies 
for auditing our suppliers. 
Quarterly inspections of all primary pet 
suppliers are carried out by our Pet Supply 
Manager and an annual welfare audit  
is conducted by our consultant vet. Twice  
a year, we also commission independent 
annual audits of all of our primary suppliers 
by SAI Global to make sure that they 
continue to meet our high standards. 
This year, in addition to our internal audits, 
all of our primary pet suppliers have been 
inspected by the RSPCA and we have 
introduced an additional annual health 
audit by an RCVS Lab Specialist Vet.
We don’t just stop at our primary pet 
suppliers; all suppliers are required to 
follow our Ethical Trading Policy, which is 
complemented by a detailed quality manual. 
Last year we ensured that all of our Asian 
suppliers of Pets at Home registered 
brands and Pets at Home branded products 
submitted evidence of compliance to our 
requirements with corrective action plans  
in place for any minor non-conformances.
This year, we have focused on our remaining 
Pets at Home registered brands and Pets  
at Home branded suppliers who supply  
either directly to the UK or through agents/ 
UK managed offices. 100% of these  
have submitted evidence of compliance  
to our Ethical Trading Policy through audit 
documentation that has been conducted 
independently by third party regulated bodies. 
This is in addition to the regular direct 
interaction we have with our Asian suppliers.
We are the only UK pet retailer to have  
a dedicated Hong Kong sourcing office  
which was established in 2012. The office 
has facilitated the implementation of a 
programme where Pets at Home Asia and UK 
colleagues regularly visit and meet with their 
Asian partners to educate them, resolve any 
challenges faced, share the PAH factory/
product standards and monitor performance.
Our ethical audit covers detailed levels  
of standards required in relation to:
• Hours of work
• Labour practices
• Working conditions
• Onsite accommodation
• Health & safety
• Environment
• Supply chain management 
• Wages
• Home workers & sub-contractors
Our internal store pet audit is reviewed annually 
to ensure that we are incorporating best 
practice in pet welfare. We revamped our store 
audit this year so that hay racks were installed 
in all of our rabbit villages so that the hay stays 
fresh for the rabbits for longer. Our stores 
continue to receive a strict annual external 
audit from SAI Global under the Excellence 
Assured Petcare Scheme as we believe that 
external verification is vital to maintaining 
standards. 374 stores were audited this year. 
We only work with pet suppliers who fulfil 
the five freedoms laid down in the Animal 
Welfare Act 2006 and the high standards 
set down in our own code of practice.

 10 0 %
of all rabbits sold or adopted  
in stores to be microchipped
Our focus on the welfare and responsible 
ownership of pets means that we frequently 
interact with, and seek to work alongside,  
a wide range of animal welfare groups 
including the RSCPA, RWAF and Animal Kind. 
This year we have also completed a detailed 
review of our main pet care leaflets in store 
in conjunction with the RSPCA to ensure 
that we are always providing the best 
advice care possible to our customers.
We continue to employ a strong in-house 
team of pet experts to oversee our animal 
welfare practices and ensure that our pets 
are always put first. This includes: 
• Our Head of Pets; a vet with over  
20 years’ experience;
• Our Head of Pets Operations; over 17 
years’ retail experience at Pets at Home;
• Our Aquatics Operations Manager –  
over 20 years’ experience in Freshwater 
and Marine Biology;
• Our Pet and Reptile Operation Manager 
– over 15 years’ experience in pet & 
reptile welfare;
• Our Veterinary Nurse Assistant –  
a qualified veterinary nurse with  
over 12 years’ experience in exotic  
vet nursing; and
• Our Veterinary Care Advisor – a highly 
experienced head veterinary nurse.
Looking after  
our rabbits
Every year 300,000 animals go astray  
in the UK alone and rabbits can be  
very good escape artists, especially 
from gardens. It’s fairly common for 
them to be handed into a veterinary 
practice or a pet charity that will have  
no idea where they have come from. 
Microchipping rabbits helps to reunite 
upset and worried owners with their 
beloved pet and so this year we have 
invested £171,217 in microchipping all 
rabbits sold in our stores or adopted 
from our in-store adoption centres.
The microchipping of our rabbits is  
a clear demonstration of the steps  
we take to promote responsible pet 
ownership. This year, we have re-homed 
over 19,000 rabbits through our in-store 
adoption centres. The number rehomed 
nationally every year is currently unknown 
and much of the time there is no way  
to track where these rabbits originated. 
By microchipping our rabbits, working 
with rehoming charities we will be able 
to monitor the numbers being offered for 
adoption. This is something that hasn’t 
been possible before and we are very 
excited to be pioneering this innovation 
in pet welfare and retailing.
From 13 June 2014, we have also 
offered to every customer who bought  
or adopted a rabbit from our stores  
a voucher for a free combined 
vaccination to protect their rabbit 
against myxomatosis and Rabbit 
Haemorrhagic Disease. These are two 
diseases that can often be fatal but are 
easily prevented through vaccination. 
Highest quality  
and safety standards 
 19
tests carried out on our leads  
and harnesses
We are committed to ensuring that our 
products meet the highest quality and 
safety standards in the UK pet market. 
There are no formal regulations specific  
to pet products in the UK, therefore we 
have developed our own testing protocols 
for each of our product categories. These  
have been developed in conjunction with 
approved third party testing laboratories 
and detail any general legal requirements 
(SVHC/REACH), and specific performance 
and safety related testing requirements  
for all our products. We review our 
protocols on a regular basis to ensure  
that all products we develop are safe,  
legal and fit for purpose.
One such example is our testing protocol 
on collars, leads and harnesses. On top  
of any legal requirements, we choose to 
carry out 19 tests across our registered 
brands and PAH branded collars, leads and 
harnesses. Additionally, we are receiving 
requests from some of our branded 
suppliers to share our testing protocols 
enabling them to deliver products to the 
same high standards we adhere to on 
safety and performance of our own brand 
and registered branded product.

Eliminating waste sent to landfill 
 90 %
of waste diverted from landfill
We are committed to minimising our  
waste consumption with the aspiration 
ultimately to divert 100% waste from landfill 
whilst maximising our recycling rates.  
This year we diverted 90% of our waste 
from landfill. 
We are always seeking new innovative 
solutions to help us manage our waste 
more effectively. In recent years one of  
our most successful innovations has seen 
the soiled bedding removed in our daily  
pet cleaning routines collected, compacted  
and then sent for treatment via a mixture  
of in-vessel composting and Bio-Mass. In 
the last year we diverted over 3,131 tonnes 
of used animal bedding from landfill, an 
increase of 9% on the previous year.
Once we have delivered products to store, 
we utilise the empty space in our delivery 
vehicles to send cardboard, plastic  
and used animal bedding back to our 
distribution centres. Through doing this  
we were able to recycle over 3,000 tonnes 
of cardboard and 480 tonnes of plastic.
This year we have also piloted food  
waste collections from Northampton DC to 
dispose of the small volumes of damaged 
dog and cat food generated and deployed  
a Dry Mixed Recycling bin at all of our 
stores that have a vets and groomers. 
Our commitment
We aim to minimise the impact of our operations on the environment. 
We proactively seek to minimise our consumption of core resources 
and maximise efficiency and we are always on the lookout for new  
and better ways to do things. With a rapidly growing business this is 
an ongoing challenge for us and we recognise that we still have a long 
way to go. Despite that, we are proud of the progress we are making.
In the past year we prioritised those areas of our environmental 
performance that are most material to our business and where  
we believe we can make the biggest impact. These were our waste 
management, energy consumption and transportation activities.  
In the coming year we will continue to drive these areas forward  
and will broaden our focus to include strategies to reduce packaging 
and water consumption. 
As a result of our commitment to improving our environmental 
performance, we have now recruited a dedicated Energy Manager  
into our team. This new specialist role will work alongside our current 
team to provide expert assistance and guidance in developing  
our ongoing targets, and the strategies, systems and processes 
that will help us to deliver them.

Overview | Strategy | Performance Using less electricity 
4%
reduction in electricity consumption 
in our stores (kWh per square foot)
Our expanding footprint of stores and  
vet practices makes reducing electricity 
use in our buildings a priority for our  
CSR strategy, whilst rising energy prices 
and increasing climate change legislation  
make it commercially important. Last  
year, our electricity use generated over 
35,000 tonnes of CO
2
e. This year we  
have accelerated the implementation  
of measures that reduce our electricity 
consumption. Our key successes were:
• Following on from our successful 
programme last year to install LED lights 
in all our aquariums and bunny villages, 
this is now our standard specification 
for pet housing in all new and 
refurbished stores;
• We have upgraded more than 80 of our 
external signs to energy efficient LEDs, 
saving over £130,000 and 750 tonnes 
of CO
2
e;
• We have initiated a pilot to assess the 
feasibility of LED lights for general sales 
floor lighting in two stores (Sheffield 
Drake House and Lincoln North); and
• We have upgraded over 500 emergency 
lights to LED, with further upgrades 
planned for 2015–2016.
Rethinking our packaging 
84%
compliance score across  
packs checked
Last year we maintained our commitment 
to the implementation WRAP’s OPRL 
recycling information on all own and private 
brand consumer packaging. In our most 
recent monitoring survey, we achieved a 
compliance score of 84% across the packs 
checked, with minor discrepancies in the 
interpretation of the guidelines reducing  
our score rather than non-application of 
information. We are committed to reducing, 
recycling and reusing packaging materials 
as a matter of course and will continue to 
engage with WRAP over the development  
of future policies and opportunities to 
achieve more.
Becoming more fuel efficient 
 18 %
decrease in fuel usage compared  
to FY09
Through operating a fleet of over 40 Heavy 
Good Vehicles from our distribution centres 
plus additional smaller vehicles for pet 
delivery, we consume a significant amount 
of diesel.
We only purchase the new fuel efficient and 
low emission Euro 6 vehicles for our heavy 
fleet. To date we have replaced over 50%  
of our heavy fleet with Euro 6 vehicles.
We have started a driver behaviour change 
programme at our distribution centres  
to encourage all our drivers to drive more 
defensively and eco-efficiently. We have 
also installed a vehicle telemetry system, 
Microlise, across all of our heavy fleet  
and plan to use this improved information 
to further improve driver efficiency.
Monitoring our water consumption
Water is one area where we have yet to 
develop a formal reduction and efficiency 
strategy and to set ourselves clear targets. 
In the coming year, we will review our water 
consumption and will develop a strategy  
to ensure we make the most efficient use 
of water and resources.

e footprint has been calculated using the 2015 DEFRA emissions factor and based  
on a Financial Control approach.
•  In FY14, the CRC emission factors were used for electricity as opposed to 2013 DEFRA emissions and  
so the figures for FY14 have been restated as above.
•  In line with DEFRA recommendations, electricity emissions have been split out into scope 2 indirect 
consumption and scope 3 for transmission and distribution losses. This has been restated for FY14.
•  FY15 saw the inclusion of limited scope 3 emissions including: outsourced transportation and business 
travel (car, rail and air).
• FY15 saw the inclusion of red diesel for the first time. Data is not available for FY14.
•  Data for third party logistics was included in FY15 for the first time, data for FY14 was retrospectively added.
•  The contractors who maintain Pets at Home air-conditioning units do not have the systems in place to provide 
the volume of F-Gas used each year. Due to the small volumes involved, this is considered to be de minimis.
We believe that it is essential that we 
maintain a dialogue with each of our  
core stakeholder groups to find out what  
is important to them and reflect their 
concerns in the development of our CSR 
strategy and priorities. The following table 
shows how we engage with each group. 
In the coming year, as we continue to 
develop our CSR strategy, and in particular 
as we look to set our longer term targets, 
we have committed to undertake a

engagement process, ensuring that these 
key groups continue to drive our strategic

Chairman’s introduction
We are committed to managing the Group with business integrity 
and high ethical standards to ensure that our vision and values  
are in place and adhered to. We aim to identify and control 
commercial and operational risks without inhibiting the efficient 
running of the Company.
The Board is accountable for the long term success of the Group, 
as well as for setting the strategic priorities and objectives of the 
Group and its risk appetite. During our first full financial year as  
a listed company with newly appointed Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, we have dedicated considerable time to discussing the 
Group’s strategy, not least as part of our two day annual strategy 
meeting which enabled the Board to look in depth at the long term 
strategic direction of the Group, understand progress against  
key strategic priorities and objectives, and confirm those areas 
which require ongoing Board oversight. There have also been 
opportunities throughout the year to visit stores with the Executive 
Team and Operating Board as well as the Group’s distribution 
centres and joint venture veterinary surgeries. Further information 
on how the Board spent its time during this financial year can be 
found on page 76.
We continue to review our governance framework and processes  
to enhance the way we operate as a Board and deepen our strategic 
debates. We introduced a number of improvements to this effect 
in this financial year. This included a review of the financial materials 
received by the Board, with further enhancements to be made 
during FY16, which will be informed by an external evaluation of 
Board effectiveness which was carried out by an external facilitator 
during the year.
As ever, the Board is committed to the highest standards of  
corporate governance. Save as set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report, the Board has complied with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in September 2012 by  
the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”) in respect of the year 
ended 26 March 2015 and since then has complied and intends  
to comply with the requirements of the updated version of the 
Code which applies to financial periods beginning on or after  
1 October 2014.

Directors’ Report, are shown in the Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 66 and 67.
Appointment and removal of a Director 
The Company may, by ordinary resolution of the shareholders of  
the Company at a general meeting, remove any Director from office 
and elect another person in place of a Director so removed from 
office following recommendation by the Nomination & Corporate 
Governance Committee in accordance with its terms of reference 
for approval by the Board. 
Pursuant to the terms of Relationship Agreement, the Company has 
agreed with the Principal Shareholder, KKR My Best Friend Limited, 
an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., that it may 
appoint and remove two Non-Executive Directors to the Board for 
so long as the Principal Shareholder (and/or any of its associates, 
when taken together) holds 20% or more of the voting rights over 
the Company’s ordinary shares and one Non-Executive Director  
to the Board for so long as it (and/or any of its associates, when 
taken together) holds 10% or more but less than 20% over the 
voting rights in respect of the Company’s ordinary shares.
At each Annual General Meeting of the Company (“AGM”) each 
Director then in office shall retire from office with effect from  
the conclusion of the meeting. When a Director retires at an AGM  
in accordance with the articles of association of the Company 
(“Articles”), the Company may, by ordinary resolution at the 
meeting, fill the office being vacated by re-electing the retiring 
Director. In the absence of such a resolution, the retiring Director 
shall nevertheless be deemed to have been re-elected, except  
in the cases identified by the Articles.
All Directors will stand for re-election on an annual basis in line 
with the recommendations of the Code.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and any directions given 
by the Company by special resolution and any relevant statues  
and regulations, the business of the Company will be managed  
by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company.
Specific powers relating to the allotment and issuance of ordinary 
shares and the ability of the Company to purchase its own securities 
are also included within the Articles and such authorities are 
submitted for approval by the shareholders at the AGM each year. 
The authorities conferred on the Directors at the 2014 AGM, held  
on 9 September 2014, will expire on the date of the 2015 AGM. 
Since the date of the 2014 AGM, the Directors have not exercised 
any of their powers to issue, or purchase, ordinary shares in the 
share capital of the Company.
Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests in shares and options over ordinary shares 
in the Company as at 26 March 2015 are shown in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 90. 
Since the end of the financial year and the date of this report, 
there have been no changes to such interests.
In line with the requirements of the Companies Act, each  
Director has notified the Company of any situation in which he or  
she has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts,  
or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company  
(a situational conflict). These were considered and approved  
by the Board in accordance with the Articles and the provisions  
of the Companies Act and each Director was informed of the 
authorisation and any terms on which it was given. The Board has 
formal procedures to deal with Directors’ conflicts of interest. The 
Board reviews and, where appropriate, approves certain situational 
conflicts of interest that were reported to it by Directors, and a 
register of those situational conflicts is maintained and is reviewed 
by the Board on an ongoing basis.

Directors’ indemnities
Each Director of the Company has the benefit of a qualifying 
indemnity, as defined by section 236 of the Companies Act,  
and as permitted by the Articles, as well as prospectus liability 
insurance which provides cover for liabilities incurred by Directors 
in the performance of their duties or powers in connection with  
the issue of the Company’s prospectus dated 28 February 2014  
in relation to the Listing. In addition, all directors and officers  
of Group companies are covered by Directors & Officers liability 
insurance.
No amount was paid under any of these indemnities or insurances 
during the year other than the applicable insurance premiums.
Share capital 
The issued share capital of the Company as at 26 March  
2015 and 3 June 2015, being the latest practicable date prior  
to the date of this Annual Report comprises 500,000,000  
ordinary shares of 1 pence each. Further information regarding  
the Company’s issued share capital can be found in note 20  
on page 136 of the financial statements.
There have been no movements in the Company’s issued share 
capital in the 2015 reporting period.
During the year the Company completed a reduction of capital 
whereby £1,080,477,000 standing to the credit of the Company’s 
share premium account was cancelled, creating distributable 
reserves of an equivalent amount. The cancellation was formally 
approved by the High Court and the court order was registered  
by the Registrar of Companies and became effective on 30 July 
2014. The cancellation had no effect on the overall net asset 
position of the Company and/or the Group.
Shareholder’s voting rights 
All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and 
vote at the AGM. On a show of hands at a general meeting every 
member present in person shall have one vote and on a poll, every 
member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every 
ordinary share held. No shareholder holds ordinary shares carrying 
special rights relating to the control of the Company.
Restrictions on transfer of ordinary shares 
The Articles do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the Company other than the usual restrictions 
applicable where any amount is unpaid on a share. All issued 
share capital of the Company at the date of this Annual Report  
is fully paid. Certain restrictions are also imposed by laws and 
regulations (such as insider trading and market abuse provisions 
relating to prohibited periods). The LRs and the Company’s share 
dealing code provide that whereby Directors PDMRS and certain 
Group employees together with their connected persons require 
prior Board approval to deal in the Company’s securities.
For a period of one year following the date of the Company’s 
Listing, each of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and the 
Senior Executives (excluding the Group Company Secretary) (each, 
a “Restricted Shareholder”) agreed, on the terms and subject to 
the conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, not to dispose of 
any of the ordinary shares they hold in the Company (the “Initial 
Lock-Up Period”). Although the Initial Lock-Up Period has now 
expired, each Restricted Shareholder also entered into a lock-up 
deed dated 12 March 2014 with the Company. On the terms  
of each lock-up deed, each Restricted Shareholder undertook,  
for an additional period of 365 days (commencing on the 
termination of the Initial Lock-Up Period), not to dispose of  
more than a specified number of ordinary shares in the Company  
(in each case, approximately 50% of the relevant Restricted 
Shareholder’s holding of ordinary shares). The additional lock-up 
periods each expire on 16 March 2016.
All of the above arrangements are subject to certain customary 
exceptions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Transactions with related parties
The only subsisting material transactions which the Company  
has entered into with related parties are: 
•  Relationship Agreement: The Relationship Agreement  
was entered into on 28 February 2014 and regulates  
the relationship between KKR My Best Friend Limited  
(the “Principal Shareholder”), its associates and the Company 
following Listing. Subject to a certain minimum shareholding, 
the Relationship Agreement details the rights the Principal 
Shareholder has to representation on the Board and 
Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee; to appoint 
observers to the Remuneration, Audit & Risk, the Pets Before 
Profit Committee and the CSR Committee and certain anti-
dilution rights. The Company has also undertaken to cooperate 
with the Principal Shareholder in the event of a sale of the 
ordinary shares by the Principal Shareholder at any time.  
 
The Relationship Agreement complies with the requirements  
of the LRs, including LR 9.2.2AR(2)(a), which came into effect 
on 16 May 2014, and LR 6.1.4DR. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of LR 9.8.4(14), the Board 
confirms that the Company has complied with its obligations 
under the Relationship Agreement, including in respect of the 
independence provisions set out therein, at all times since it 
was entered into, including throughout the period under review, 
and, so far as the Company is aware, the Principal Shareholder 
and its associates have complied with the provisions  
of the Relationship Agreement (including the independence 
provisions set out therein), at all times since it was entered 
into, including throughout the period under review.  
• Senior Facilities Agreement: KKR Capital Markets Limited 
(“KCM”), an affiliate of the Principal Shareholder, was entitled  
to receive a syndication agent fee equal to 0.50% of the total 
commitments under the terms of a senior facilities agreement 
dated 18 February 2014 (“Senior Facilities Agreement”) 
entered into in connection with the Listing. Further details  
of the Group’s banking facilities are shown in note 17 on  
page 134 of the financial statements. Certain payments under 
the Senior Facilities Agreement were made during FY15. 
•  Amendment to the Senior Facilities Agreement: On 14 April 
2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered  
into an amendment agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) 
to the Senior Facilities Agreement. Further detail on the 
Amendment Agreement is provided below under the heading 
“Events post year end” on page 74.
Amendment of the Articles
The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders in a general meeting, in accordance with 
the Companies Act.
Profits and dividend
The consolidated profit for the year after taxation was 
£67,876,000 (FY14: £38,565,000). The results are discussed  
in greater detail in the CFO’s review on pages 36 to 39. 
A final dividend of 3.6 pence per share (FY14: Nil) will be 
recommended to the Company’s shareholders in respect of  
the 2015 financial year. The final dividend will be proposed by  
the Directors at the AGM on 9 September 2015 in respect  
of the year ended 26 March 2015 to add to an interim dividend  
of 1.8 pence per share paid on 16 January 2015 (FY14: Nil).
The Directors’ proposed final dividend of 3.6 pence per share 
takes the total dividend payable in respect of the 2015 financial 
year to 5.4 pence per share. The ex-dividend date will be  
13 August 2015 and, subject to shareholder approval at the  
2015 AGM, the final dividend of 3.6 pence per share will be  
paid to shareholders on the register at the close of business  
on 14 August 2015.
Change of control
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors 
or colleagues providing for additional compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, redundancy  
or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
The only significant agreements to which the Company is a party 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of  
the Company following a takeover bid, and the effect thereof,  
are as follows:
• The Relationship Agreement with the Principal Shareholder 
contains a provision allowing the Principal Shareholder to 
terminate the agreement with immediate effect if any person 
acquires control of the Company (namely holding and/or 
ownership of the beneficial interest in and/or the ability to 
exercise the voting rights applicable to ordinary shares or other 
securities in the Company which confer, in aggregate on the 
holders, whether directly or indirectly, more than 50%. of the 
voting rights exercisable at general meetings of the Company) 
or the Company ceases to be listed.
• The SFA and the Amendment Agreement contain customary 
prepayment, cancellation and default provisions including, if 
required by a lender, mandatory prepayment of all utilisations 
provided by that lender upon the sale of all or substantially all 
of the business and assets of the Group or a change of control.
Political donations
The Company’s policy is not to make any political donations and  
no political donations or expenditure were made or incurred during 
the year.
Suppliers
The Group understands the importance of maintaining good 
relationships with suppliers and it is Group policy to agree 
appropriate terms and conditions for its transactions with 
suppliers (ranging from standard written terms to individually 
negotiated contracts) and for payment to be made in accordance 
with these terms, provided the supplier has complied with its 
obligations. Average trade creditors of the Group’s UK operations 
for FY15 were 42 days (FY14: 38 days).

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report Events post year end
On 14 April 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries 
entered into the Amendment Agreement (referred to above under 
“Transactions with Related Parties on page 73). The Amendment 
Agreement became effective on 15 April 2015 (the “Effective 
Date”), after the date of the Company’s financial year end on  
26 March 2015. 
The Amendment Agreement provided that a new revolving facility  
of £260 million (the “Revolving Facility 2”) was incorporated into 
the Senior Facilities Agreement. The existing term and revolving 
facilities were repaid on the Effective Date with the proceeds  
of a drawing under Revolving Facility 2 and cash on balance  
sheet and upon the prepayment such facilities were cancelled. 
Revolving Facility 2 is available for drawing to finance and/or 
refinance (as applicable) the general corporate purposes and/or 
working capital requirements of the Group. The interest rate 
applicable to Revolving Facility 2 is LIBOR (or, for loans in Euro, 
EURIBOR) plus a margin ranging between 2.00% and 0.75%  
per annum depending on the ratio of consolidated EBITDA  
to total net debt. The margin currently applicable to utilisations  
under Revolving Facility 2 is 1.50% per annum. KKR Capital 
Markets Limited (“KCM”), an affiliate of the Principal Shareholder, 
received a fee of £500,000 for arranging Revolving Facility 2.
On 15 April 2015, NWS (Holdings) Limited, a subsidiary of Pets  
at Home Group Plc, acquired 100% of the issued share capital  
of Northwest Surgeons Limited, in exchange for an initial cash 
consideration of £2.6m. Northwest Surgeons Limited is a company 
registered in England and Wales, engaged in the provision of 
specialist veterinary services to veterinary practices in the north 
west of England. The acquisition represents the first specialist 
veterinary referral practice within the Group.
Going concern
On the basis of current financial projections and facilities available,  
the Directors are satisfied that the Group is well placed to manage  
its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,  
the financial statements continue to be prepared on a going 
concern basis.
Branches outside the UK
The Company has no branches outside the UK. 
Auditor
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware. Each 
Director has taken all the steps which they ought to have taken  
as Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information (being information that is needed by the Company’s 
Auditor in connection with preparing its report) and to establish 
that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418(2) of the Companies Act.
At the AGM on 9 September 2014, KPMG LLP was appointed  
as the Company’s Auditor. During the 2015 financial year,  
a competitive tender process of audit services was completed  
in accordance with the requirements of The Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, made by the Competition & Markets 
Authority. Following its success in the tender process, a resolution 
is to be proposed at the 2015 AGM for the reappointment of 
KPMG LLP as the Auditor of the Group.

Directors’ Report continued
7 4
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,  
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare the Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year.  
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group’s financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) (as adopted by the European Union (EU))  
and applicable law and they have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements on the same basis. Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and the parent company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements for each financial 
year, the Directors are required to: 
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy  
at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and  
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
Group website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect  
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair

Corporate governance
Introduction
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. Save as set out in the paragraphs below, the Board 
has complied with and intends to continue to comply with the 
requirements of the Code. 
In September 2014, the Financial Reporting Council published a 
revised 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code (the “2014 Code”), 
which will apply to the Company’s next financial year (FY16). 
Accordingly, the Board will seek to comply with the 2014 Code  
in relation to the Company’s next financial year (save as set  
out below), and will report on such compliance in the Company’s 
2016 Annual Report. 
The Company will also report to its shareholders on its compliance 
with the Code in accordance with the Listing Rules made by the 
United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority under Part VI of the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended from time 
to time) (“LRs”). 
Board balance and independence
The Code recommends that at least half the board of directors  
of a UK-listed company, excluding the chairman, should comprise 
non-executive directors determined by the Board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from relationships or 
circumstances which may affect, or could appear to affect, the 
director’s judgement. The Pets at Home Group Plc Board consists  
of five Independent Non-Executive Directors, one Non-Executive 
Chairman, one non-Independent Non-Executive Director appointed 
by the Principal Shareholder and two Executive Directors. The 
Directors’ biographies are contained on pages 66 and 67. Both 
individually and collectively the Directors have the range of skills, 
knowledge, expertise and dedication necessary to lead the Group 
together with the requisite strategic and commercial experience.
Chairman 
The Code recommends that, on appointment, the chairman of  
a company with a premium listing on the Official List should meet 
the independence criteria set out in the Code. Tony DeNunzio 
joined Pets at Home in 2010 and has been Non-Executive 
Chairman of the Group since March 2010. Notwithstanding that 
the Board did not consider at the time of listing and continue  
to believe that Tony DeNunzio does not meet the independence 
criteria set out in the Code, the Board believes that in order  
to continue to ensure maximum continuity in the Company’s 
transition from a privately owned company to a listed company, 
Tony should remain as Non-Executive Chairman of the Group.  
The Board also believes Tony brings vast retail experience and 
knowledge to the Pets at Home team.
Senior Independent Director
The Code recommends that the board of directors of a company 
with a premium listing should appoint one of the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors as a Senior Independent Director  
to provide a sounding board for the Chairman and to serve  
as an intermediary for the other directors when necessary.  
The role of Senior Independent Director includes being available  
to shareholders if they have concerns, which contact through the 
normal channels of the Chief Executive Officer has failed to 
resolve, or for which such contact is inappropriate. Dennis Millard 
has been appointed Deputy Chairman as well as Senior Independent 
Director and has considerable experience of acting as an 
independent non-executive director on plc boards. 
Appointment of Directors by the Principal Shareholder
Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, the Company has  
agreed with the Principal Shareholder that it may appoint two 
Non-Executive Directors to the Board for so long as the Principal 
Shareholder (and/or any of its associates, when taken together) 
holds 20% or more of the voting rights over the Company’s Shares 
and one Non-Executive Director to the Board for so long as it  
(and/or any of its associates, when taken together) holds 10%  
or more but less than 20% over the voting rights in respect of the 
Company’s Shares. The Principal Shareholder has appointed Brian 
Carroll as a Non-Executive Director of the Board. The Chairman, 
Tony DeNunzio, is a senior advisor to affiliates of the Principal 
Shareholder and therefore is not deemed to be independent of the 
Principal Shareholder. Although he has not been appointed as a 
Director by the Principal Shareholder, the Principal Shareholder has 
agreed that for so long as it has the right to appoint two Directors 
to the Board and Tony is a Director, the Principal Shareholder will 
not exercise its right to appoint a second Director to the Board.  
For further details of the Relationship Agreement and confirmation 
of compliance with the provisions set out in the Relationship 
Agreement, see page 73 of the Directors’ Report.
Board observers
Each of the Senior Executives has been appointed as Board 
observer with rights to receive notice of (including all Board 
papers), attend and speak at, Board meetings. The Principal 
Shareholder also has the right to appoint, and has appointed,  
one Board observer for so long as it holds voting rights over more 
than 10% of the Company’s shares. Such Board observers have 
the right to receive notice of, attend and speak at, Board meetings.  
No Board observer is entitled to vote on any matter requiring  
a resolution of the Board.
Appointment terms and elections of Directors
All Directors have service agreements or letters of appointment 
and the details of their terms are set out in the Remuneration 
Policy on pages 100 and 101. The service agreements and letters  
of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours. 
At each AGM of the Company, all Directors will stand for re-election 
in accordance with the 2014 Code.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 How the Board operates
Pets at Home has established a clear division of responsibilities 
between the respective responsibilities of the Non-Executive 
Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. This 
separation of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer, coupled with the reserved matters described below, 
ensures that no individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.
The matters reserved for the Board include:
•  Agreement of the Group’s strategy;
•  Changes to the structure and capital of the Group;
•  Reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls;
•  Approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, Interim Reports, 
and Interim Management Statements together with any 
announcements;
•  Approving significant expenditure, material transactions  
and contracts;
•  Reviewing and agreeing Group tax and treasury policy;
•  Delegation of authority to the Chief Executive Officer;
•  Board and Senior Management appointments, arrangements 
and succession planning;
•  Communication with shareholders; and
•  Review of the Group’s overall corporate governance matters.
It is important to the Board that Non-Executive Directors have  
the ability to influence and challenge appropriately. New Directors 
receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board, 
including meeting with the Executive Team and other members of 
the Group’s Operating Board and advisors. The induction includes 
visits to the Group’s stores, veterinary surgeries and other 
operational locations.
In this financial year, the Board met formally nine times, plus the 
annual strategy meeting. Ad hoc meetings were arranged to deal 
with matters between scheduled Board meetings as appropriate. 
Board meetings were preceded by Committee meetings with  
the meetings lasting the majority of the day in most cases.
Topics for the Board meetings are determined at the beginning of 
the year and new items are added to this as and when appropriate.
During the year the Board spent its time considering a wide range 
of matters. These included:
•  S t r a te g y ;
•  Performance overall and of individual businesses  
and functions in the Group;
•  Budgets and long-term plans for the Group;
•  Financial statements and announcements;
•  Reviewing reports from its committees, notably on audit 
strategy, remuneration and CSR objectives;
•  P e ns i o ns ;
•  R e p u t a t i o n al r i s ks ;
•  Shareholder feedback and reports from brokers and analysis;
•  Risk management and controls in the Group including 
reputational risks; and
•  D el e g a t e d a u t h o r i t i e s.
All Directors receive papers in advance of Board meetings.  
These include a monthly Board report with updates from each  
of the Executive Team and the Operating Board, which monitors 
the achievements of the Group’s key performance indicators,  
both financial and strategic. The Group’s Operating Board are  
also invited to present at Board meetings so that Non-Executive 
Directors keep abreast of developments in the Group. 
The Chairman meets regularly with the Non-Executive Directors, 
without the Executive Directors present and this practice will 
continue in the future. The Senior Independent Director also 
attended these sessions.
It is important to the Group that all Directors understand external views 
of the Group. Throughout the year, regular reporting was provided to the 
Board by the Company’s Head of Investor Relations, covering broker 
reports and the output of meetings with significant shareholders. 
As stated below, the Board has also delegated certain matters  
to a number of Board Committees.

Considering diversity
The Board understands the importance of having a diverse 
membership and recognises that diversity encompasses not  
only gender but also background and experience. Whilst the  
Board believes that appointments should be made solely on  
merit, we seek to ensure that the Board maintains an appropriate 
balance through a diverse mix of experience, backgrounds,  
skills, knowledge and insight, to further strengthen the diversity  
of gender and experience already on the Board. Notably, two  
of the five Independent Non-Executive Directors, Tessa Green  
and Amy Stirling are female together with the Group Company 
Secretary, Louise Stonier and a Senior Executive, Sally Hopson. 
These appointments were made on merit, and not on the basis  
of gender, the appointees being by far the strongest candidates  
for the positions with their skill sets and overall experience  
fitting the objective role description approved by the Board  
at the outset of the recruitment process.
This policy applies equally to all appointments in the Company  
and so two of the most recent appointments to the Board of the 
Pets at Home Vets Group are female, Sally Hopson and Amanda 
Radford. The Group also has four female colleagues on the 
Operating Board.
Board Committees 
The Board has established three Board Committees: an Audit  
& Risk Committee, a Nomination & Corporate Governance 
Committee, and a Remuneration Committee. In addition, the Board 
has also established the Pets Before Profit Committee and the 
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) Committee which comprise 
both Non-Executive Directors and colleagues and the Investment 
Committee which comprises Executive Directors and colleagues 
(including a Senior Executive). If the need should arise, the Board 
may set up additional committees as appropriate.
Each Committee has written terms of reference which are approved 
by the Board and subject to review each year. These are available 
on request from the Group Company Secretary and are published 
on the Group’s website (http:/ /investors.petsathome.com).
Audit & Risk Committee
The Audit & Risk Committee gives due consideration to laws  
and regulations, the provisions of the Code and the requirements 
of the LRs. Further details are contained in the Audit & Risk 
Committee Report on pages 82 to 84. The Code recommends  
that an audit committee should comprise at least three members 
who are Independent Non-Executive Directors and that at least  
one member should have recent and relevant financial experience.  
The Audit & Risk Committee is chaired by Amy Stirling, and  
its other members are Dennis Millard, Paul Coby and Paul  
Moody, all of whom are Independent Non-Executive Directors.  
As a former chief financial officer of Talk Talk Telecom Group Plc,  
the Directors consider that Amy Stirling has recent and relevant 
financial experience in accordance with the requirements of the 
Code. The Audit & Risk Committee meets not less than three 
times a year.
Only Committee members have the right to attend and vote at  
its meetings but the Principal Shareholder has a right to appoint  
an observer to attend meetings of the Audit & Risk Committee  
for so long as it (and/or any of its associates, when taken  
together) holds 10% or more of the voting rights in respect  
of the Company’s Shares.
The Audit & Risk Committee chair will be available at the 2015 
AGM to respond to questions from shareholders on the activities 
of the Audit & Risk Committee.
The Audit & Risk Committee has taken appropriate steps to ensure 
that the Company’s Auditors are independent of the Company  
and obtained written confirmation from the Company’s Auditors 
that they comply with guidelines on independence issued by the 
relevant accountancy and auditing bodies.
The Audit & Risk Committee has access to sufficient resources  
to carry out its duties, including the services of the Group Legal 
Director and Company Secretary and the Group’s internal audit 
function. Independent external legal and professional advice  
can also be taken by the Audit & Risk Committee if it believes  
it necessary to do so.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee assists the Board in determining  
its responsibilities in relation to Directors’ remuneration. Further 
details are contained in the Remuneration Committee Report on 
pages 86 to 103. 
The Code provides that a remuneration committee should comprise 
at least three members who are Independent Non-Executive Directors 
(other than the chairman). The Remuneration Committee is chaired 
by Dennis Millard, and its other members are Tessa Green, Amy 
Stirling and Paul Moody, all of whom are Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Remuneration Committee meets not less than twice 
a year. Non-Executive Directors’ and the Chairman’s fees are 
determined by the full Board. 
Only Committee members have the right to attend and vote at its 
meetings, but the Principal Shareholder has a right to appoint an 
observer to attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee for so 
long as it (and/or any of its associates, when taken together) holds 
10% or more of the voting rights in respect of the Company’s Shares.
The Remuneration Committee has access to sufficient resources  
to carry out its duties, including the services of the Group Legal 
Director and Company Secretary and the Group’s Customer, 
People and Development Director. Independent external legal  
and professional advice can also be taken by the Remuneration 
Committee if it believes it necessary to do so.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee
The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee assists  
the Board in considering the structure, size and composition of  
the Board whilst advising on succession planning. Further details 
are contained in the Nomination & Corporate Governance 
Committee report on pages 84 and 85.
The Code recommends that a majority of the members of a 
nomination committee should be Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee  
is chaired by Tony DeNunzio, and its other members are Dennis 
Millard, Paul Coby, Tessa Green, Amy Stirling (each of whom  
is an Independent Non-Executive Director), and Brian Carroll.  
The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee meets  
not less than once a year.
The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee has  
access to sufficient resources to carry out its duties, including the 
services of the Group Legal Director and Group Company Secretary. 
Independent external legal and professional advice can also be 
taken by the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee  
if it believes it necessary to do so.
Other Pets at Home Committees
Pets Before Profit Committee and CSR Committee
The Pets Before Profit and the CSR Committee advise the Board 
on the Group’s corporate responsibility objectives and strategy. 
Further details are contained in the CSR Committee Report on 
pages 50 to 61.
The Pets Before Profit Committee and the CSR Committee are 
chaired by Tessa Green, and its other members are Tony 
DeNunzio, Dennis Millard and Paul Coby. A number of the Group’s 
colleagues (including Senior Executives) are also regularly invited 
to attend meetings of the Pets Before Profit and CSR Committees.
The Pets Before Profit Committee and the CSR Committee meet 
formally at least twice a year and otherwise as may be required.
Only Committee members have the right to attend and vote at its 
meetings but the Principal Shareholder has a right to appoint an 
observer to attend meetings of the Pets Before Profits and CSR 
Committees for so long as it (and/or any of its associates, when 
taken together) holds 10% or more of the voting rights in respect  
of the Company’s Shares.
Management committees
Details of our management committees are set out below:
Investment Committee
The Investment Committee assists the Board with the Group’s 
store and veterinary surgery rollout process to ensure the Group’s 
investment process is managed effectively and rigorously 
throughout the Group. The Investment Committee is chaired by 
Nick Wood and its other members are Ian Kellett, Sally Hopson 
and the Director of Property. A number of the Group’s colleagues 
are entitled to attend meetings of the Investment Committee.
The Investment Committee meets formally at least ten times a 
year and otherwise as may be required. Duties of the Investment 
Committee include reviewing and considering all proposals 
presented for new store and stand-alone surgery acquisitions by  
a Group company, approving all material variations to proposed 
new stores and stand-alone surgery acquisitions, periodically 
reviewing proposed changes to the reporting and presentation  
of new store investment criteria; reviewing all proposals presented 
for lease renewals and reviewing alternative strategies for new 
store investment, formats and geographical markets and reporting 
on such strategies to the Board for final approval on the terms of 
any such matter and reviewing all proposals for the dispositions  
of all or part of any of the lease on stores including any sub-letting, 
assignments, surrenders or relocations and approving or rejecting 
any such proposals as appropriate. Each of the matters approved 
by the Investment Committee is subject to the further approval  
of the Board where it falls within the level of expenditure requiring 
full Board approval. The Investment Committee formally updates 
the Board at least once a year in addition to regular updates on 
matters approved within the monthly Board packs.
Senior Executive and Operating Board
In addition to the Board, the Group has both the Executive 
Management Team (“Executive Team”) as detailed in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 68 and 69 and the Operating Board 
(the “Operating Board”) for which respective roles are clearly defined. 
The Operating Board meets frequently to discuss the following:
•  Cur r en t t r a d i n g ;
•  N e w d e ve lo p m e n t s ;
•  O p er a t i o n a l i s s u es ;
•  M a r k e t in g;
•  P e o p le ; an d
• Execution of strategic programmes.
Health and safety
Health and safety is a key priority for the Board and senior 
management and is an item for review and discussion at each 
Board meeting. The Board has established a health and safety 
committee which meets at least on a quarterly basis and going 
forward, will be chaired by the Group Legal Director with the 
agenda led by the Head of Health and Safety. The committee  
is attended by key individuals in the business that are responsible 
for certain areas of health and safety, including the veterinary 
business and Ride-away, and the committee is tasked with 
reviewing the Group’s overall health and safety performance.  
A health and safety policy is in place for the Group which is 
reviewed on a regular basis. 
The distribution centres have their own dedicated health and 
safety manager and a separate health and safety sub-committee 
which also meets on a regular basis. The newly integrated 
veterinary business also has a designated health and safety 
manager and two health and safety assessors. 
Further details of the work of the Health And Safety Committee  
are contained on page 54 of our CSR Report.

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report Governance Report continued
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board delegates to the 
Executive Team the responsibility for designing, operating and 
monitoring these systems. The systems are based on a process  
of identifying, evaluating and managing key risks and include the 
risk management processes set out on pages 40 and 41 and  
page 83 of the Audit & Risk Committee Report.
The systems of internal control were in place throughout the period 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. The systems 
of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
errors, losses, fraud or breaches of law and regulations. A number 
of internal controls operate across the business; the key controls 
the business relied upon during the year are set out below:
• The annual Group wide strategic review of the business 
took place in October and November 2014 culminating in  
the preparation of a detailed three year strategic plan which 
was reviewed and approved by the Board. Following this 
approval, the business carried out its annual budget cycle, 
again culminating in formal review and approval by the Board.
• Management accounts have been reviewed at Board meetings 
by the Board. These reviews covered the comparison of actual 
performance against budget in the period end management 
accounts and consideration of outturn for the year. The period 
end accounts are prepared by the management accounts  
team and reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer and the 
Finance Director.
• All capital investments during the year have been approved  
by the Chief Financial Officer; an authority framework is in 
place which details the approvals required for specific levels  
of capital spend including those capital projects requiring  
full Board approval. In line with delegation by the Board, the 
Investment Committee, chaired by the CEO, has reviewed and 
approved investments in respect of the acquisition and fit-out 
of new stores and new standalone veterinary practices, see 
page 79 for further details.
• There is an Internal Audit department in place that has  
its scope agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee and has 
reported at each Audit & Risk Committee throughout the year. 
All Internal Audit reports are presented to the Audit & Risk 
Committee for review and consideration of any material 
findings.
• A clearly articulated delegated authority framework in respect 
of all purchasing activity is in place across the Group. This  
is complemented by systemic controls that reflect the agreed 
authority framework and clear segregation of duties between 
relevant functions and departments. An Internal Audit review  
of the accounts payable process during the year covered the 
operation of delegated authority and segregation of duties  
with regard to purchases and found no significant issues.
• A schedule of matters reserved for the Board is in place  
for approving significant transactions and strategic and 
organisational change. 
• Board discussion of the key risks and uncertainties facing  
the Group and the risk management system.
Share dealing code
The Company has adopted a share dealing code in relation to  
its shares which is based on, and is at least as rigorous as,  
the Model Code as published in the LRs. The share dealing code 
applies to the Company’s Directors, its other PDMRs and certain 
employees of Group companies and they are responsible for 
procuring the compliance of their respective connected persons 
with the Company’s share dealing code.
Board evaluation and effectiveness
Process
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, during the year,  
the Board engaged Lintstock Limited to undertake an independent 
evaluation of Board and Board committee performance and to 
identify areas where performance and procedures might be further 
improved. Lintstock Limited is a specialist corporate governance 
consultancy and has no commercial dealings or other connection 
with the Group.
The first stage of the evaluation involved Lintstock engaging with 
the Chairman and the Company Secretary to discuss and agree 
the scope of the proposed evaluation and to develop a series  
of comprehensive questionnaires tailored to the specific 
circumstances of the Company. 
All respondents were then requested to complete online 
questionnaires addressing the composition and performance  
of the Board and its Committees, and the performance of  
the Chairman. This included the completion of a confidential 
questionnaire to gain an understanding of our Board’s 
performance and consider its effectiveness. The anonymity  
of all respondents was ensured throughout the process in order  
to promote the open and frank exchange of views.
Lintstock subsequently produced a report which addressed the 
following areas:
• Board composition and expertise including areas where the 
Non-Executive Directors require further understanding of the 
business of the Group;
• the involvement of the Non-Executive Directors in the affairs  
of the Company outside of Board and Committee meetings,  
the dynamics between the Board members and between the 
Board and the Executive Management Team;
• the Board’s time management, together with the Board’s  
annual cycle of work and the information provided to the Board;
• the Board’s oversight of strategy and operations, and the 
Board members’ views over the principal strategic challenges 
and opportunities facing the Company;
• risk management and internal controls including the risk 
appetite of the Board and the Board’s management of the 
principal risks and uncertainties to the Group;
• the succession planning for Executive Directors and the 
Executive Management Team and the Board’s visibility  
of potential successors for key positions from within  
the business; 
• the composition and performance of the Board and its 
Committees and the performance of the Chairman; and
• top priorities for change as identified by the Board.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 At a dedicated Board session, a report of the findings of the 
evaluation and its recommendations were discussed and specific 
actions agreed. 
Outputs of the evaluation
The Board recognises the benefits of a thorough Board  
and Committee evaluation process. Overall, the evaluation 
demonstrated that the composition and performance of the Board 
and its Committees and the performance of the Chairman were 
rated highly as very effective.
As a result of the review, amongst other things, the Board agreed:
• to ensure clarity on the strategic agenda to enable the Board  
to focus on the appropriate strategic topics;
• to continue to develop the Non-Executive’s understanding  
of the business by incorporating into the Board schedule 
periodic store visits and time with the Executive Team whilst 
also ensuring that the Board is exposed to the Operating  
Board and Rising Stars as part of an annual cycle of 
presentations and dinners; 
• to develop an efficient and effective management information 
pack as a foundation for improved debate;
• that further Board time should be devoted to discussions 
concerning talent management and Executive and  
Non-Executive succession planning; and
• that there was a need to further enhance the Board’s 
understanding of the Group’s risk appetite with further time 
being spent debating the most significant risks to the business.
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, it is anticipated that 
externally facilitated Board evaluations will be carried out every 
three years. In years when an external evaluation is not carried out, 
the Board will continue to complete internal performance-based 
questionnaires, with the process managed by the Company 
Secretary. The scope for each subsequent evaluation will be 
designed to build upon learning gained in the previous year to 
ensure that the recommendations agreed in the evaluations are 
implemented and that year-on-year progress is measured and 
reported upon.
Relations with shareholders
The Board believes it is important to explain business 
developments and financial results to the Company’s shareholders 
and to understand any shareholder concerns. We intend to 
communicate with shareholders on a regular basis.
During the year, the Company met regularly with analysts and 
institutional investors and such meetings will continue. The Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have lead responsibility 
for investor relations. They are supported by a dedicated Head  
of Investor Relations who, amongst other matters, organises 
presentations for analysts and institutional investors and ensures 
that procedures are in place to keep the Board regularly informed 
of such investors’ views. 
The formal reporting of our full and half yearly results will be a 
combination of presentations, group calls and one-to-one meetings 
in a variety of locations where we have institutional Shareholders. 
All the Non-Executive Directors and, in particular, the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director, are available to meet with major 
shareholders, if they wish to raise issues separately from the 
arrangements as described above. 
Pets at Home’s investor website is also regularly updated with 
news and information, including this Annual Report and Accounts 
which sets out our strategy and performance together with our 
plans for future growth (http:/ /investors.petsathome.com).
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will be held on Wednesday, 9 September 
2015 at the Hilton, 303 Deansgate, Manchester M3 4LQ. Full 
details of the meeting are set out in the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting sent with this Annual Report and Accounts. The AGM 
provides all shareholders with the opportunity to attend and vote 
on the resolutions put to shareholders and those shareholders 
unable to attend are encouraged to vote using the proxy card 
enclosed with this Annual Report and Accounts or electronically  
by following the instructions set out in the Notice of Meeting 
(whether personally or by proxy). Information relating to votes  
cast will, following the AGM, be available on the Company’s 
website (http:/ /investors.petsathome.com).

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report Audit & Risk Committee Report
“ The Directors recognise the need to maintain  
the financial reporting procedures, review  
them on an ongoing basis and adapt them  
to changing circumstances.”
 Amy Stirling
 Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee
In addition to our regular agenda, we considered in detail, policies 
in place on tax and treasury, the quality and sourcing function  
in the UK and Hong Kong, accounting for supplier rebates, the  
loss prevention strategy and conducted a tender process for the 
external audit.
Financial reporting
As part of our work to ensure the integrity of financial reporting,  
we focused on the following during the year:
• Reviewed the appropriateness of the Annual Report for the 
year ended 26 March 2015, and also the interim financial 
statements for the 28 week period ended 9 October 2014  
with a focus on, amongst other matters, the quality and 
acceptability of accounting policies and procedures, material 
areas where significant judgements have been applied or there 
has been a significant discussion with the Group’s external 
auditors, KPMG, and the clarity of disclosures and compliance 
with financial reporting standards.
• Reviewed and discussed with management the accounting 
treatment and level of judgement required in relation to 
promotional income from suppliers. We are satisfied that this 
income is only recognised when there is reasonable certainty 
that the conditions for recognition have been met by the Group 
and the value of the income can be reliably measured.
• Considered and approved the Group’s tax policy that outlines 
the Group’s attitude to tax and risk, our relationship with 
HMRC, relationships with external tax advisors, a summary  
of processes for assessing and providing for tax exposure.  
We also received and reviewed a report that provided an 
update on each of corporate tax, VAT and employment taxes.
• Considered the Group’s treasury policy that covers those 
transactions involving interaction with banks, other financial 
institutions and the wider capital markets and recommended 
to the Board for approval.
• Discussed the impact of the replacement of UK GAAP and 
noted the impact on the subsidiary accounts for the Group.

The Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive, the Head  
of Internal Audit and an observer appointed by the Principal 
Shareholder attend meetings by invitation along with 
representatives from KPMG. The Company Secretary acts  
as secretary to the Audit & Risk Committee (“Committee”). 
The Committee meets separately with the Head of Internal  
Audit and the Group’s external auditors from time to time  
without management present to review their reports and  
discuss issues in detail. 
Introduction
I am pleased to present the Audit & Risk Committee’s report  
for the year. During the year, the Committee met three times with 
our focus being on financial reporting, internal and external audit 
and internal controls. 
Our primary function is to assist the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities to protect the interest of the Shareholders  
with regard to the integrity of the financial reporting, audit, risk 
management and internal controls. To achieve this, the Committee:
• Agrees the scope of internal audit work for the year and 
monitors the same;
• Monitors, makes judgements and recommendations on the 
financial reporting process and the integrity and clarity of the 
financial statements;
• Considers the appointment of the external auditor and their 
remuneration including reviewing and monitoring of 
independence and objectivity and agreeing and monitoring  
the extent of the non-audit work that may be undertaken; 
• Reviews and monitors the adequacy and effectiveness  
of the internal control and risk management policies and 
systems currently in place; and
• Reports to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Since year-end, based on reviews from internal and external audit, 
and discussions with management, we reported to the Board that 
the Committee considers the Annual Report taken as a whole to 
be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess our strategy, business 
model and performance.
Going concern
We have reviewed the going concern basis on which the Annual 
Report is prepared. 
The Group has considerable financial resourcing and financing 
facilities. Since the year-end, on 14 April 2015, the Company  
and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the amendment 
agreement to its senior finance facility (“Amendment Agreement”). 
The Amendment Agreement became effective on 15 April 2015 
(the “Effective Date”).
The Amendment Agreement provided that a new revolving facility of 
£260 million was incorporated into the senior facilities agreement 
replacing the £325m of drawn facilities. 
Following a consideration of the Amendment Agreement and  
the detailed business plans prepared by the Group together  
with sensitivity analyses which stress test key assumptions,  
the Committee is satisfied that it is appropriate for the Group  
to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and Accounts of the Group.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and the 
system of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness. The 
Committee oversees the risk management process and provides 
oversight of internal controls on the Board’s behalf as detailed on 
pages 40 and 41 and also on page 80 of the Governance Report.
During the year, the risk management process has been developed 
to provide further insight into specific risks including improvements 
to the scoring mechanism and the use of heat maps to illustrate 
gross and net risk and progress made in addressing each risk. The 
Board and the Executive Team have also independently assessed 
their respective risk appetites for the key risk areas of the business 
then compared and discussed the outcome of this assessment.
Following this process review, the Group’s significant risks and 
associated mitigating actions have been considered in detail by 
the Executive Board and an ensuing report has been presented  
to the Board.
In addition, with regard to internal controls, the Committee has 
reviewed and considered the reports of the Head of Internal Audit 
on audits completed and follow-up action plans to address areas 
of control weakness. Further details of specific areas covered are 
set out on pages 42 to 45. 
KPMG also reported on the Group’s internal control environment 
as part of their external audit work programme and the Committee 
noted that no significant weaknesses on internal controls were 
identified.
Internal audit 
Internal audit is a key function within the business focused  
on ensuring the effectiveness of governance, risk management 
and internal controls. During the year, we recruited a new Head  
of Internal Audit & Risk to lead this function and have reviewed  
the resources, reporting and processes managed within this  
area. Internal audit have also led the development of the risk 
management process and worked with the Executive Team and  
the Board to ensure that there is appropriate alignment and 
understanding of the key risks and risk appetite.
The Head of Internal Audit & Risk has attended each Committee 
meeting, updating on progress against the audit plan throughout 
the year, key action points to address control weaknesses 
identified and the process of risk management across the Group.  
I have met regularly with the Head of Internal Audit & Risk during 
the year and he has had separate meetings with KPMG and with 
the Committee without management present.
Specific work performed during the year included reviews of  
the financial processes for treasury, cash and banking, payroll, 
accounts payable and overrider (supplier rebate) payments.  
Within business systems, a technical post-implementation review 
of SAP has been carried out along with audits covering IT project 
management, IT governance and information security. The quality 
and sourcing function in the UK and Hong Kong was also audited 
during the year. 
Recommendations from Internal Audit are prioritised based on 
risk. The audit reports issued for FY15 included a number of 
priority findings for management attention and actions have been 
developed to address these. For example, following the quality and 
sourcing review, improved documentation and sampling controls 
have been introduced and a new workflow management tool is 
being implemented. The reports and related findings and actions 
have been discussed by the Committee and priority actions will be 
tracked to completion.
External audit
Key audit risks
In order to discharge its responsibility to consider accounting 
integrity, the Committee carefully considers key judgements 
applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
that are set out on pages 104 to 154. At the start of the year, 
KPMG presented their audit plan to the Committee, identifying 
what they considered to be the key audit risks for the year ahead 
and the planned scope of work to be performed through the year. 
These risks were considered to be the carrying value of goodwill 
and the carrying value of inventory. 
Carrying value of goodwill
We have reviewed the work performed by management in testing 
for goodwill impairment. We have considered the cashflow models, 
discount rates and a number of sensitivities and we are satisfied 
with the carrying value of goodwill in the consolidated financial 
statements on page 130. 
83
Strategic report Financial statements Governance report Audit & Risk Committee Report  
continued
Carrying value of inventory
The inventory value of £48.5m reflects an increase of £2.4m  
on the previous year, largely reflecting the growth in new stores  
in the year. During the year the Audit & Risk Committee reviewed 
the loss prevention strategy to ensure that controls against  
stock loss across the business are robust. The Committee also  
reviewed the period end financial information which includes 
analysis on stock holding and any specific areas of concern. 
Following a review of the level of provision held at the year end 
against slow moving or out of date stock, we have concluded  
that we are satisfied with the accounting treatment of the  
carrying value of inventory in the consolidated financial  
statements on page 131.
A report was also presented to the Committee by KPMG  
at both the half year and full year that covered both of the  
above risks in detail. They considered them to be appropriately 
addressed and raised no significant concerns in these or  
any other areas of their review. 
Non-audit services and auditor objectivity and independence 
Audit and non-audit fees paid to KPMG total £276,000 for the  
year and an analysis is presented in note 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 125. Audit fees across the Group  
were £156,000, with KPMG also receiving £35,000 for the  
review of the interim financial statements. Other fees paid  
to KPMG, principally in relation to tax compliance and advisory 
services, amounted to £85,000.
We have satisfied ourselves as to KPMG’s independence  
and their internal processes are also rigorous in ensuring  
their independence before commencing any piece of work.  
Ernst & Young LLP have been appointed as tax advisors to  
the Group for FY16.
Audit tender
As set out in the Committee report last year, we considered  
the FRC proposals concerning audit tenders and decided to  
tender the audit during this year as KPMG had been in place  
since 2000 and the audit partner was required to rotate in  
the following year. Four firms were formally invited to tender  
and were given access to management across the Group  
to assist them in understanding our business, our culture  
and our accounting policies. Following submission of tender 
documents, the final shortlist of bidding firms all presented  
to the Committee. After a consideration of the alignment  
of each bid with the Committee’s requirements including 
experience in the sector, cultural fit and technical capability,  
a resolution proposing the reappointment of KPMG as  
external auditors will be put to the shareholders at the  
Company’s Annual General Meeting which will take place  
on 9 September 2015 in Manchester.

Introduction
As Chairman of the Nomination & Corporate Governance 
Committee (the “Committee”), I am pleased to present the  
report of the Committee for the year ended 26 March 2015.
The Committee is a key committee of the Board whose role  
is to keep the composition and structure of the Board and its 
committees under review. The Committee’s role also includes 
enhancing the quality of nominees to the Board and ensuring  
that the recruitment and appointment process is conducted  
with rigour and integrity.
The Committee is also tasked with ensuring that succession 
plans are in place for the Directors, the Executive Team and  
other key members of the Group’s Operating Board, taking  
into consideration the current Board structure, the leadership 
requirements of the Group and the wider commercial and  
market environment within which the Group operates.

discharge their respective duties effectively.”
 Tony DeNunzio
 Chairman of the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee
Board evaluation and effectiveness
The UK Corporate Governance Code published in September 2012 
by the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”) requires that the 
Board undertakes an annual evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its committees and individual Directors and does so 
externally at least every three years. The performance evaluation 
for FY15 involved the use of an external independent facilitator, 
Lintstock Limited (“Lintstock”).
The review process involved completion of online questionnaires 
which focused on Board composition, expertise and dynamics, 
Board support and process, structure, behaviours and other key 
issues such as strategy and succession.
The review also addressed delivery of the Board’s objectives and 
any issues identified during the previous review or which became 
relevant during the year. A report on the performance of the Board 
and each of the principal committees was compiled by Lintstock 
and presented to the Board and each relevant committee as  
a basis for discussing and agreeing appropriate actions for the 
forthcoming year. The Chairman and each committee Chairman 
held discussions with each Director or committee member based 
on the responses. The Senior Independent Director is responsible 
for appraising the Chairman’s performance in discussions with  
the Non-Executive Directors in the absence of the Chairman.  
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors also meet in the 
absence of the Executive Directors.
The Board and individual committees considered the output from 
the review in April 2015 and concluded that the performance of 
the Board, its committees and individual Directors was effective. 
Any areas for improvement are agreed by the Board and are 
detailed on page 81 of the Corporate Governance Report.
Diversity
The Committee takes into account a variety of factors before 
recommending any new appointment to the Board, including 
relevant skills to perform the role, experience, knowledge,  
ethnicity and gender. The most important priority of the 
Committee, however, is ensuring that the best candidate  
is selected to join the Board.
Succession planning
The Committee reviewed the succession plans for both executive 
appointments to the Board and the Executive Team, taking into 
account the strategic objectives of the Group. The process 
included consideration of the anticipated demands of the business 
and the skills required to successfully deliver against these.
As a result of the review, it was recognised that Pets at Home  
has undergone significant expansion in recent years and with 
significant growth opportunities ahead, it is now appropriate  
to implement a divisional management structure to drive 
performance across the business.
In order to support the changes, the Committee recommended to 
the Board that Ian Kellett be appointed as Chief Executive Officer 
of the newly formed Retail Division and Sally Hopson, previously 
Customer and People Director and Chief Executive Officer of the 
Vet Group, be appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the Services 
Division with effect from 4 June 2015.
The Board approved such recommendations and the search for a 
new Group Chief Financial Officer is starting with immediate effect. 
During this process, Ian Kellett will remain as Chief Financial 
Officer and commence the transition to his new Chief Executive 
Officer of Retail role. 
Conflicts of interest
The Board has delegated authority to the Committee to consider, 
and where necessary authorise, any actual or potential conflicts  
of interest arising in respect of the Directors. The Committee 
considered potential conflicts of interest as they arose during  
the course of the year and in respect of the appointments of  
new Directors. 
The Committee also supports the Board in its annual 
consideration of the Conflicts of Interest Register, which is carried 
out prior to the publication of the Annual Report, and considers  
the independence of the Non-Executive Directors, in the context  
of the criteria set out in the Code.

Introduction
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee (“Committee”),  
and on behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 26 March 2015.  
This report is split into two parts.
• Our Annual Report on Remuneration, outlining how our 
Remuneration Policy was implemented in FY15 and how  
we intend to apply it for FY16. This will be subject to an 
advisory vote at our 2015 AGM.
• A recap of our Remuneration Policy, as approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM. No changes have been  
made to our Remuneration Policy this year and as such  
there will be no resolution on our Remuneration Policy  
at the 2015 AGM.
FY15 business performance and remuneration outcomes
This has been another successful year for Pets at Home, as we 
have continued to drive like-for-like growth through multiple levers. 
A summary of some of our financial and operational highlights 
during the year is presented below:
• Like-for-like revenue growth of 4.2% driven by strength in 
Advanced Nutrition, Health & Hygiene, VIP club, Services  
and omni-channel;
• Total revenue growth of 9.6% to £729.1m;
• Our VIP club loyalty scheme continued to perform strongly  
and gained over 270,000 new members during the quarter  
to reach a total of 3.2 million. VIP card swipe rate at store  
tills represented 62% of revenues in the year, compared with 
52% in FY14;
• £40.1m revenues from our flagship Advanced Nutrition brand, 
Wainwright’s; and
• 25 stores opened during the year along with 61 vet practices 
and 50 grooming salons.
For FY15, our annual bonus framework was primarily based on 
achievement of financial EBITDA targets (75%), with the remainder 
based on performance against key strategic objectives (25%). 
These measures reflect the continued transition of the business 
into the listed environment, placing a strong emphasis on financial 
performance, whilst also ensuring focus on delivery of the key 
strategic growth levers that were articulated to shareholders during 
our IPO process.
Our strong financial performance during FY15 resulted in delivery 
of underlying EBITDA of £121.3m. As a result, this portion of the 
annual bonus paid out at 75% of maximum (i.e. 56% of salary).
The Executive Directors’ delivery against the key strategic 
objectives is reflected in the personal objectives element of  
the annual bonus, which paid out between 76–88% of maximum 
(i.e. 19–22% of salary).
As a result, overall bonus out-turns for our Executive Directors 
were 75–78% of maximum/salary. The Committee considers that 
this fairly reflects the results for the year.
86
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 As we highlighted in last year’s report, for this year we have strived 
to be transparent regarding bonus outcomes. Further information can 
be found on pages 88 and 89, where full disclosure of the EBITDA 
performance range is provided. We have also provided additional 
context on the measures under the key strategic objectives 
element, within the bounds of appropriate commercial sensitivity.
 
Remuneration proposals for FY16
Nick Wood received a 3% salary increase, with effect from April 2015. 
This is in line with the colleague increase for FY15.
As we announced on 4 June 2015, to capitalise on the significant 
growth opportunities which are available across the business,  
we have moved to a new divisional management structure. 
Accordingly, Ian Kellett assumed the role of Chief Executive  
Officer of Retail, a critical position heading up our Pets at Home 
Retail business. Ian also retains his CFO duties until a suitable 
replacement can be found. Taking into account the key role which 
Ian will play in driving and growing our operations under this new 
structure, Ian’s salary in the CEO of Retail role has been set at 
£400,000, effective from 4 June 2015.
There will be no change in the pension provision for Executive 
Directors. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the annual bonus 
framework for FY16, with a view to ensuring that it remains 
appropriate for the business at this time. Last year, in the period 
following our IPO, the Committee considered that it was important 
to link the bonus to our key strategic growth levers and we have 
made excellent progress against these objectives. Looking to the 
year ahead, the Committee considers that now is an appropriate 
time to fully focus the bonus framework on delivery of financial 
performance, this being our fundamental driver of shareholder 
value. As a result, for FY16 the annual bonus will be based on 
reported EBITDA (75%) and free cash flow (25%).
As highlighted last year, our intention is that Executive Directors  
will not participate in the PSP until the start of FY17, given that 
they received awards under the Co-Investment Plan on IPO.
Malus and clawback
We always seek to adhere to UK corporate governance best 
practice. The Committee reviewed the recent update to the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, particularly the clause relating  
to malus and clawback provisions being present on all forms  
of variable remuneration. In response, we have introduced 
clawback provisions into both the Executive Directors’ annual 
bonus plan for the FY16 performance year and PSP awards from 
this year onwards.
Along with the malus provisions already contained on the PSP, 
these provisions now provide the Committee with the ability to 
reduce unvested share awards or take back bonus amounts or 
share awards which had already been paid or vested under certain 
circumstances, including misconduct and misstatement of results.
Our colleagues
We have always recognised the importance of widespread  
share ownership and it remains an integral part of our culture.  
This reflects the principle that our colleagues are central to the 
achievement of our strategy and share ownership enhances loyalty 
and engagement.
As such, as well as the grants that were made in connection  
with the Company’s IPO in March 2014 under the Company’s 
discretionary share plans, we also successfully launched our first 
Sharesave plan this year, with 30% of eligible colleagues choosing 
to participate. In addition, as part of the celebration of the IPO  
and in recognition of the contribution made by all colleagues to  
the ongoing success of the Group, each colleague with 12 months’ 
service and who had not been eligible to participate in the Group’s 
pre-IPO equity scheme received a one-off bonus in the year. 
We consider that our commitment to our colleagues and the 
impact that this has on our customers is reflected across  
a number of areas: 
• Colleague engagement was 94%;
• Pets at Home won 15th place in the UK “Great Place to Work” 
survey; and
• We achieved a Net Promoter Score of 86%.
Shareholder engagement
We value all feedback from Shareholders and as a public company 
we intend to engage with our investors on a regular basis. We hope 
you find this report helpful and informative and we hope to receive 
your support for our Annual Report on Remuneration at our AGM 
on 9 September 2015.
I would also like to highlight that I was appointed as chair of the 
Committee during the IPO process with the intention that the 
responsibility would be handed to Paul Moody at the Company’s 
second AGM following its IPO. As such, I will be resigning from the 
position with effect from that date and Paul will take on the role 
going forwards. From a personal perspective, I would like to wish 
him all the best for the future.
Yours sincerely
Dennis Millard

Base salary – corresponds to the amount received during the relevant financial year. In FY14 Nick Wood’s base salary reflected his 
annual salary of £425,000 per annum and Ian Kellett’s base salary reflected his annual salary of £320,000 per annum.
Benefits – corresponds to the taxable value of benefits received during the relevant financial year and principally includes company car 
(or cash equivalent), life assurance and permanent health insurance.
Pension – corresponds to either the amount contributed to personal pension plans or the cash value of the salary supplement received 
during the relevant financial year. Executive Directors receive a Company pension contribution worth 9% of their salary or a cash 
allowance where the Annual Allowance has been reached. 
Annual bonus – corresponds to the amount earned in respect of the relevant financial year. Details of how this was calculated are set out below.
Performance outcomes
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in respect of FY15 was 100% of base salary. 
The financial targets for the Annual Bonus for the financial year ended 26 March 2015, and the extent to which they were achieved,  
are as set out below. For FY15, financial targets comprised 75% of the bonus framework and the achievement of targets is calculated  
on a straight line basis between Minimum and Maximum EBITDA. The Committee considered that the targets were very stretching  
and required Executive Directors to deliver performance which significantly exceeded business expectations to achieve full pay-out.

FY15 key personal objectives comprised 25% of the bonus framework. An EBITDA gateway of £114m applied to the non-financial element 
of the bonus. EBITDA performance below this level would result in no bonus being paid. 
For the CEO, these included the achievement of a number of key KPIs such as new store opening pipeline and vet practices, the 
management of effective succession planning and the engagement of the investor base.
For the CFO/CEO of Retail, these included the refinancing of the Vet Group to support the long term growth plans, the future strategy of 
payroll services and targets around working capital.

d) Scheme interests awarded during the financial year

During the year, the Company launched its Sharesave plan, providing eligible colleagues with an opportunity to receive share options  
at a 20% discount to the market price. The maximum monthly saving was £250 per month. The Executive Directors elected to participate 
in the Sharesave, along with 30% of eligible colleagues.
The Options are, in normal circumstances, not exercisable until completion of a three year savings period, beginning on 1 December 
2014 and will then be exercisable for a period of six months. The exercise period will, therefore, in normal circumstances, be from  
1 December 2017 to 31 May 2018.
The Options were granted in the following amounts:
Executive Director
Number of Shares over which Sharesave 
Option was Granted 
Face Value of Shares over which 
Sharesave Option was Granted (£)
Ian Kellett 6,428 9,000
Nick Wood 6,428 9,000
e) Payments for loss of office
No payments for loss of office were made during the financial year.
f) Payments to past Directors
No payments were made to past Directors during the year.
g) Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Committee believes that colleague share ownership is an important means to support long-term commitment to the Company  
and the alignment of colleague interests with those of shareholders.

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report Remuneration Report continued
The interests of the Executive Directors are closely aligned with those of other shareholders in this regard, through the operation of  
the Co-Investment Plan, which required participants to commit a significant amount of their IPO proceeds. This was a one off award.
Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding requirement of 200% of base salary, which should be built up over a period of five 
years. This policy also applies to the Executive Management Team who are also subject to a shareholding guideline. The Committee 
reviews share ownership levels annually.

In connection with the Company’s IPO on 17 March 2014, Pets at Home Group Plc was inserted as the new parent company of  
the Pets at Home Group. No dividends were paid by the Company between 17 March 2014 and the year end, 27 March 2014. No 
financial information has been presented above for the period from IPO to 27 March 2014 as EBITDA does not accrue evenly over an 
accounting period and cannot be accurately pro-rated. This disclosure will be expanded in subsequent years in line with the regulations.
k) Dilution limits
In accordance with the ABI Guidelines, the Company can satisfy awards under its colleague share plans with new issue shares up to  
a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period and within this 10% limit, the Company can only issue 5%  
of its issued share capital to satisfy awards under discretionary plans. 
l) External appointments
Executive Directors are entitled to accept one external appointment outside the Company with the consent of the Board. Any fees 
received may be retained by the Director.
As at the date of this report, neither of the Executive Directors held an external appointment for which they receive a fee.
m) Non-Executive Directors – letters of appointment
A summary of the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment is contained on page 101 of the Policy contained in the Appendix.
Each of the Non-Executive’s letters of appointment expires on 17 February 2017 apart from Paul Moody whose letter of appointment 
expires on 24 March 2017.
Statement of implementation for 2015/16
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing to implement our Policy in FY16.
Base salary
The table below shows base salaries for 2015/16.
Executive Director Base salary (£)
Nick Wood £437,750
Ian Kellett £400,000
Nick Wood received a 3% salary increase, with effect from April 2015. This is in line with the colleague increase for FY15.
As we announced on 4 June 2015, to capitalise on the significant growth opportunities available across the business, we have moved  
to a new divisional management structure. Accordingly, Ian Kellett assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer of Retail, a critical position 
heading up our Pets at Home Retail business. Ian also retains his CFO duties until a suitable replacement can be found. Taking into 
account the key role which Ian will play in driving and growing our operations under this new structure, Ian’s salary in the CEO of Retail 
role has been set at £400,000 effective from 4 June 2015.

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report Remuneration Report continued
Benefits
The Committee sets benefits in line with the policy set out on page 94 of the Appendix. There are no changes proposed to the benefit 
framework in 2015/16.
Pensions
There is no increase proposed to salary supplement levels for the Executive Directors in 2015/16. The table below shows salary 
supplements for 2015/16.
Executive Director Percentage of salary 
Nick Wood 9%
Ian Kellett 9%
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in respect of 2015/16 will remain at 100% of base salary.
The annual bonus framework will be in line with that presented in the policy table on page 95. As highlighted in the Chairman’s letter, during 
the year the Committee reviewed the annual bonus framework for FY16, with a view to ensuring that it remains appropriate for the business.
The Committee considers that it is appropriate at this time to refocus the bonus framework on delivery of financial performance,  
this being a fundamental driver of shareholder value. As such, we have determined that the annual bonus for FY16 will be based on 
reported EBITDA (75%) and free cash flow (25%).
Although the targets remain commercially sensitive at this time, we will provide shareholders with full disclosure of the EBITDA and free 
cash flow targets in next year’s report. 
For the FY16 performance year onwards, the annual bonus will be subject to clawback provisions. This provides the Committee with the 
ability to take back amounts previously paid out for a period of up to two years under certain circumstances, including misstatement and 
misconduct.
Performance Share Plan
Given that they received awards under the CIP on IPO, there is currently no intention for Executive Directors to participate in the PSP until FY17 . 
Notwithstanding that Executive Directors will not participate in the PSP in FY16, the Committee has implemented clawback provisions  
on PSP awards made to other senior employees this year.
Sharesave
The Company intends to operate the Sharesave scheme again for FY16. The maximum monthly savings will be raised to £500 per month 
from £250 per month, in line with the statutory increase. Executive Directors are eligible to participate.
Non-Executive Director remuneration
The table below shows the Non-Executive Director fee structure for 2015/16:
2015/16
Chairman of the Board (all inclusive fee) £200,000
Basic Non-Executive Director fee £50,000
Board Committee Chairman fee £10,000
Deputy Chairman £20,000
There are no fees paid for membership of Board Committees.
The Remuneration Committee
Shareholder context for the Committee’s activities
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation  
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte during the year and is 
comfortable that it has been objective and independent. Total fees received by Deloitte in relation to the remuneration advice provided  
to the Committee during FY15 amounted to £37,450 (excluding VAT) based on the required time commitment. 
In addition, other practices at Deloitte, separate from the executive remuneration practice, have provided general tax advice to the Group 
during the year together with advice on the Group.
During FY15, the Committee also received support from Travers Smith LLP on the terms of the discretionary and all colleague share plans.

a) Policy Report
The following section pages 94 to 103 sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy, in accordance with section 439A of the Companies 
Act 2006. This Policy was approved by shareholders at our AGM on 9 September 2014 and applies from that date. It is currently 
intended that the Policy will apply for three years.
Overall remuneration is structured and set at levels to enable the recruitment and retention of high calibre executives and encourage 
them to enhance the Company’s performance, in a responsible manner, in line with the business’ strategy and shareholders’ interests.
A significant portion of the package is performance related. Remuneration has been set taking into account practice within the FTSE 250 
and practice at other retail companies. 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measurement Maximum opportunity
Fixed elements – base salary
Core element of remuneration, 
recognising the role and 
responsibilities of the role.
• Paid in cash and are pensionable.
• The Committee takes into consideration a number of factors  
when setting salaries, including (but not limited to):
 – Size and scope of the individual’s responsibilities;
 – The individual’s skills, experience and performance;
 – Typical salary levels for comparable roles within appropriate  
pay comparators including practice for retail companies and  
the broader FTSE 250; and
 – Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
• In FY15, basic salaries will be reviewed at the June Remuneration 
Committee meeting. Subsequent reviews will take place at the  
March Remuneration Committee annually thereafter. Any change  
will usually be effective from the first period of the following  
financial year.
• Whilst there is no maximum salary 
level, any increases will normally  
be broadly in line with the wider 
colleague population within the 
relevant geographic area.
•  Higher increases may be made 
under certain circumstances,  
at the Committee’s discretion.  
For example, this may include:
 – Increase in the scope and/or 
responsibility of the individual’s 
role; and
 – Development of the individual 
within the role.
• Annual base salaries for the 
Executive Directors are set out  
in Part 3(a) of this report.
Fixed elements – benefits
To provide colleagues with  
market competitive benefits.
• The Company provides a range of benefits, which may include :
 – a company car (or cash equivalent)
 – life assurance
 – permanent health insurance
 – private medical insurance.
•  These benefits are not pensionable.
• Other benefits may be considered by the Committee, if considered 
appropriate.
•  The Company may also meet certain mobility costs, such as 
relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary living and 
transportation expenses, in line with the prevailing mobility policy  
and practice for other senior executives.
•  Executive Directors are eligible to participate in any tax-approved all 
colleague share plans operated by the Company on the same basis 
as other eligible colleagues. Whilst it does not currently operate  
such a plan, the Company intends to introduce a Sharesave scheme 
during the term of this Policy.
• The cost to the Company of 
providing other benefits may vary 
depending on, for example, market 
practice and the cost of insuring 
certain benefits.
• The Committee keeps the level  
of benefit provision under regular 
review.
•  Details of current benefit provision 
for the Executive Directors are set 
out in Part 3(a) of this report.
Fixed elements – pensions
To provide colleagues with an 
allowance for retirement planning.
• Pension contributions are made to either the Group Pension Plan,  
to personal pension schemes or cash allowances in lieu of 
contributions are paid.
• The contribution level for an 
individual Executive Director is 
capped at 9% of base salary per 
annum for employer contributions.
• Details of current pension provision 
for the Executive Directors are set 
out in Part 3(a) of this report.
Remuneration Policy

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measurement Maximum opportunity
Short-term elements – annual bonus
To incentivise the delivery of our 
business plan on an annual basis.
To reward performance against  
key performance indicators which  
are critical to the delivery of our 
business strategy.
• Delivery will normally be in cash and is not pensionable.
• Performance measures are set annually and pay-out levels are 
determined by the Committee after the year end, based on 
performance against those targets during the relevant financial year.
• Each year, the Committee determines the measures and weightings 
within the following parameters:
 – At least 75% of the annual bonus will be based on financial 
performance measures; and
 – No more than 25% of the annual bonus will be based on 
performance against non-financial measures, including,  
for example, individual and strategic objectives.
•  The Committee ensures that targets are appropriately stretching  
in the context of the business plan and that there is an appropriate 
balance between incentivising Executive Directors to meet financial 
targets for the year and to deliver specific non-financial goals. This 
balance allows the Committee to effectively reward performance 
against the key elements of our strategy.
• The Company may amend the performance measures or targets  
in exceptional circumstances, where it considers that they are  
no longer appropriate.
• There is no provision for recovery.
• The maximum bonus opportunity  
is 100% of base salary.
• 20% is payable for threshold 
performance.
Long-term incentives – overview
At the time of IPO, the Committee wished to put in place long-term incentive arrangements which would provide for the continued 
alignment of Executive Directors with our shareholders. As such, the Committee approved three long-term incentive plans:  
the Co-Investment Plan (CIP), the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Company Share Option Plan (CSOP).
• CIP – a one-off arrangement, tailored to our post-IPO position. It requires Executive Directors to make a significant personal 
investment in order to be eligible to receive a Company match providing that stretching performance conditions are reached.  
Awards were made on IPO and there is no intention to make any further awards to current Executive Directors under the Plan.
• PSP – intended to be our regular, ongoing long-term incentive plan in future years. Given that Executive Directors were made awards 
under the CIP in 2014, there is no intention for current Executive Directors to receive awards under the PSP until 2016.
• CSOP – for Executive Directors, this plan is used to allow the Company and participant to benefit from HMRC-approved option  
tax treatment in respect of the initial part of a PSP award (currently up to £30,000). As such, in line with the PSP above, it is not 
intended for current Executive Directors to receive awards under the CSOP until 2016.
95
Strategic report Financial statements Governance report Remuneration Report continued
In addition, the Committee intend to introduce a Sharesave plan during the term of this Policy, in which all colleagues will be eligible  
to participate (including Executive Directors).
Although we do not intend to make any further awards under the CIP to current Executive Directors following IPO, we have provided details 
of the Plan in the Policy Table below for clarity. No individual will be eligible to receive two awards under the CIP. The Committee may 
consider granting a new Executive Director a CIP award if it considers it to be appropriate to promote alignment across the Executive Team.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measurement Maximum opportunity
Long-term elements – Co-Investment Plan (CIP)
1
To promote continued  
alignment between Executive 
Directors and shareholders  
in the years following IPO.
Current Executive Directors  
will not receive any further  
awards under the CIP.
• Matching Awards vest after three, four and five years, subject to 
achievement of performance conditions.
• Additional shares (or cash) may be awarded in lieu of dividends on 
any Matching Awards which vest, which would have been paid during 
the vesting period.
• The performance measures under the CIP are:
 – 75% EPS growth – to reflect the financial performance of our 
business and a direct and focused measure of Company success. 
 
10% of the total Marching Award will vest for EPS growth of 10% 
per annum, rising to 75% of the total Matching Award vesting  
for EPS growth of 17.5% per annum. 
 – 25% Relative TSR against the UK General Retail Index –  
a measure of the ultimate delivery of shareholder returns, 
promoting alignment between Executive Director remuneration  
and the shareholder experience. 
 
6.25% of the total Marching Award will vest for median TSR 
performance against the Index, and 25% of the total Matching 
Award will vest for upper quartile TSR performance against  
the Index. 
• The Committee considers that the performance measures  
are fully aligned with our corporate strategy. The Committee  
has set the targets to be appropriately stretching, with regard to  
a number of internal and external reference points, and considers 
that delivery of these targets should create sustainable value 
creation for shareholders.
• The plan rules also stipulate that the Committee may  
amend the performance measures or targets in exceptional  
circumstances, where it considers that they are no longer 
appropriate. If this discretion was used, we would consult  
with our major shareholders and the rationale would be clearly 
explained in the Remuneration Report.
• Unvested and unexercised awards are subject to malus in case  
of misconduct or misstatement.
• Invested shares may also be forfeited in case of fraud, misconduct  
or negligence.
• Under the terms of CIP, the treatment of leavers depends on the 
length of the period between grant and cessation with Invested 
Shares being forfeited in the event of Early Leavers. See pages  
100 to 101 for further details.
• Executive Directors invested 250% 
of base salary in the CIP at IPO 
(Invested Shares).
• Subject to performance, Invested 
Shares may be eligible for up to a 
1:1 Company match on this amount 
(Matching Award).
1  The Committee may in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital, demerger, delisting, or other event which may affect the value of awards, adjust or amend 
the terms of awards in accordance with the rules of the relevant share plan. In the case of the SAYE, any changes may be subject to HMRC approval if required.

To incentivise the delivery of our 
business plan on an annual basis.
To reward performance against  
key performance indicators which  
are critical to the delivery of our  
business strategy.
The intention is that current 
Executive Directors will not receive 
awards under the PSP until 2016.
• Awards vest after three years, subject to achievement of 
performance conditions.
• Additional shares (or cash) may be awarded in lieu of dividends  
on any shares which vest, which would have been paid during the 
vesting period.
• Share awards are normally made in the form of conditional share 
awards, but may be awarded in other forms if appropriate (such  
as nil cost options). The plan rules specify that awards may also  
be satisfied in cash although this is unlikely to apply to Directors. 
• The ultimate goal of the Company’s strategy is to provide long- 
term sustainable returns to shareholders. The Committee strives  
to do this by aligning the performance measures under the PSP  
with the long-term strategy of the Company and considers that  
strong performance under the chosen measures should result  
in sustainable value creation:
 – Financial measure – to reflect the financial performance of our 
business and a direct and focused measure of Company success. 
The Committee sets targets to be appropriately stretching, with 
regard to a number of internal and external reference points.
 – Share price performance measure – a measure of the ultimate 
delivery of shareholder returns. This promotes alignment between 
Executive Director reward and the shareholder experience. Targets 
are set with reference to wider market practice and positioned  
at a level which the Committee considers represent stretching 
performance.
• The Committee sets targets each year, achievement of which it 
considers would represent stretching performance in the context  
of the business plan.
• Normally the weighting would be split equally across these two 
measures, although the Committee may vary this as appropriate  
to reflect strategic priorities.
• For ‘threshold’ levels of performance, 25% of the maximum award 
vests, increasing to 100% of the award for maximum performance.
• The plan rules also stipulate that the Committee may amend the 
performance measures or targets in exceptional circumstances, 
where it considers that they are no longer appropriate. If this 
discretion was used, we would consult with our major shareholders 
and the rationale would be clearly explained in the remuneration 
report.
• Unvested and unexercised awards are subject to malus in case  
of misconduct or misstatement.
• The Committee may at its discretion structure awards as Approved 
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) awards. CSOP awards enable  
the participant and Company to benefit from HMRC approved option 
tax treatment in respect of part of the award, without increasing  
the pre-tax value delivered to participants. CSOP awards may be 
structured either as an approved option for the part of the award  
up to the HMRC limit (currently £30,000) with an unapproved  
option for the balance and a “linked award” to fund the exercise price  
of the approved option, or as an approved option and a PSP award,  
with the vesting of the PSP award scaled back to take account  
of any gain made on exercise of the approved option.
• The maximum award opportunity 
under the PSP is normally 150%  
of base salary (or 200% of salary in 
circumstances which the Committee 
considers to be exceptional).
1  The Committee may in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital demerger, delisting, or other event which may affect the value of awards, adjust or amend  
the terms of awards in accordance with the rules of the relevant share plan. In the case of the SAYE, any changes may be subject to HMRC approval if required.

• SAYE is a HMRC-approved scheme where eligible colleagues  
are granted savings-related share options to subscribe for ordinary 
shares in the Company. It is intended that the plan will be 
implemented during 2014.
• Options are granted to be exercisable in conjunction with either  
a three-year or five-year savings contract with a monthly savings

Overall remuneration
To attract and retain high calibre

• Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee in respect of their  
Board duties.
• Further fees are paid to Non-Executive Directors in respect of Deputy 
Chairman of the Board and/or chairmanship of Board committees.
• The Non-Executive Chairman receives an all-inclusive fee for the role.
• The remuneration of the Non-Executive Chairman is set by the 
Remuneration Committee, whilst the Board as a whole is responsible 
for determining Non-Executive Director fees. These fees are the  
sole element of Non-Executive remuneration and they are not eligible 
for incentive awards, pensions or other benefits.
• Fees are typically reviewed annually.
• Expenses incurred in the performance of Non-Executive duties for 
the Company may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Company, 
as appropriate, including any tax due on the benefits.
• Current fee levels can be found  
on page 92.
• Fees are set at a level which is 
considered appropriate to attract 
and retain the calibre of individual 
required by the Company.
• The Company’s articles of 
association provide that the total 
aggregate remuneration paid to  
the Non-Executive Chairman and 
the NEDs will be within the limits 
set by shareholders.
Legacy matters
The Committee will honour remuneration related commitments to current and former Executive Directors (including the exercise of  
any discretions available to the Committee in relation to such commitments) where the terms were agreed prior to the approval and 
implementation of the Remuneration Policy detailed in this report (provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was  
not in consideration for the individual becoming an Executive Director of the Company).
For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over 
shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Company
The remuneration policy for our Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin 
remuneration for the wider Company.
Remuneration Policy continued
98
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 All our reward arrangements are built around the common objectives and principles outlined below:
• Performance driven – The Company intentionally places significant focus on variable remuneration, ensuring that a meaningful 
proportion of remuneration is based on performance. Performance targets are typically aligned with those of the Executive 
Directors. As a result, individuals are incentivised towards consistent financial and non-financial business goals and objectives,  
in addition to appropriate individual goals.
• Colleagues as shareholders – The Committee intends to put in place a Sharesave plan during the term of this Policy, to allow  
our wider colleague population to build up a shareholding in the Company. In addition, under the terms of our IPO, colleagues  
were permitted to buy shares in our IPO and over 2,700 colleagues took up this opportunity.
c) Recruitment policy
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the 
appointment of an Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component.
Element Policy and operation
Overall • The Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a member  
of the Board from an external party is to take account of the Executive Director’s remuneration package in their  
prior role, the market positioning of the remuneration package, and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate  
the recruitment of the individual.
• Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the business, in addition to considering the matters detailed 
above for external candidates, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured  
in line with the original terms and conditions.
Fixed elements
(Base salary, benefits  
and other benefits)
•  We recognise that salary levels drive other elements of the package and would therefore seek to pay a salary which  
is competitive, but no more than necessary to secure the individual.
•  The Executive Director would be eligible to participate in our benefit and pension plans, including coverage under  
all Executive Director and colleague pension and benefit programmes in accordance with the terms and conditions  
of such plans, as may be amended by the Company from time to time.
•  The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary living  
and transportation expenses in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Short-term incentives •  The individual will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus plan, in accordance with the rules and terms of the 
plan in operation at the time.
• The maximum level of opportunity will be no greater than that set out in the Policy Table above (i.e. 100% of base salary).
Long-term incentives • The individual will be eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan (and the associated Company Share Option 
Plan), in accordance with the rules and terms of the plan in operation at the time. The maximum level of opportunity will 
be no greater than that set out in the Policy Table above (i.e. 200% of base salary).
• Alternatively, whilst not currently envisaged at this time, the Committee may consider the individual eligible to 
participate in the Co-Investment Plan, which would operate under the same terms as for current participants. The 
maximum level of opportunity will be no greater than that set out in the Policy Table above (i.e. a maximum Matching 
Award of 250% of base salary), and would be pro-rated to reflect the length of the performance period which the 
individual was due to serve.
Buy-out awards • The Committee will consider what buy-out awards (if any) are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of  
a new Executive Director in all circumstances. This includes an assessment of the awards which would be forfeited  
on leaving their current employer.
• The Committee will seek to structure any buy-out awards such that overall they are no more generous in terms  
of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
• In determining the quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly 
equivalent value and replicate, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of the awards forfeited.
• Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing long term incentive plans to the extent possible, 
although awards may also be granted outside this plan if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
• In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made in relation to the previous role will be allowed  
to pay out according to their original terms.
• If promotion is part way through the year, an additional top-up award may be made to bring the Executive Director’s 
opportunity to a level that is appropriate in the circumstances.

d) Service contracts and loss of office arrangements
The Committee’s policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. On principle, it is  
the Committee’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. The Committee’s approach when considering payments  
in the event of a loss of office is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for the loss of office, Company  
and individual performance, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
The key employment terms and conditions of the current Executive Directors, as stipulated in their service contracts are set out below:
Area Policy
Notice period • The service contracts for Nick Wood and Ian Kellett provide for a notice period from both the Company and the 
individual of 12 months for Nick Wood, and 6 months for Ian Kellett.
• New Executive Directors will be appointed on service contracts that have a notice period of not more than  
12 months for both the Company and the individual.
• The Committee considers this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services  
of key individuals for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company  
in the event of termination.
Contractual payments • Executive Directors’ service contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination  
by way of payment in lieu of notice (PILON), at the Company’s discretion. Payment in lieu of notice would be made 
where circumstances dictate that the Executive Directors’ services are not required for their full notice period.
• Neither notice nor PILON will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
• Payment in lieu of notice will be limited to base salary and contractual benefits for the relevant notice period.
• There is no contractual entitlement to a payment under the annual bonus in respect of the notice period. 
• Service contracts allow for mitigation if the individual finds alternative employment.
Short-term incentives • The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
• Where an Executive Director leaves office after the end of a performance year but before the payment is made,  
the executive will remain eligible for an annual bonus for that performance year, subject to the normal assessment  
of performance achieved over the period.
• Where an Executive Director leaves office during a performance year, any bonus would be at the Committee’s absolute 
discretion and would take into account performance and the time served during the period.
• No bonus will be paid in the event of gross misconduct.
Long-term incentives The treatment of unvested long term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan.
CIP
Treatment under the CIP is dependent on the period elapsed since the IPO.
a) Within the first 24 months following admission
•  Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns less than 18 months following the date of 
admission, they will forfeit their Invested Shares and their Matching Awards.
b) Between 24 months and 36 months following admission
• Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns between 18 months and 30 months following  
the date of admission (and completes at least two years’ service by working his notice period or being put on  
garden leave, or would have done so but is given PILON), they will retain their Invested Shares and may retain  
a portion of their Matching Award subject to achievement of performance targets measured over the first two years  
of the performance period.
c) On or after 36 months following admission
•  Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns on or after 30 months following the date  
of admission (and completes at least three years’ service by working his notice period or being put on garden leave,  
or would have done so but is given PILON), they will retain their Invested Shares and, if a good leaver (defined as under 
the PSP) also their Matching Award, unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
Any participant who is dismissed for reasons of fraud or negligence will forfeit their Invested Shares and Matching  
Awards in full.
PSP
• Under the PSP, the default position is for unvested awards to lapse upon a loss of office event.
• Where an individual is determined to be a “good” leaver (which include for reasons of death, illness, injury, disability, 
retirement or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee) the Committee may allow unvested awards to subsist 
until the relevant vesting date, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions and pro-rated for time served.
• Alternatively, the Committee may, at its discretion, allow awards to vest at an earlier date, having regard to the 
achievement of performance conditions to that date and the period of time that has passed since the date of grant. 
The Committee may choose to apply no reduction in the amount vesting if it is considered appropriate given the 
particular circumstances.
Remuneration Policy continued
100
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Area Policy
Change in control • The Committee’s policy is that service contracts should not provide for additional compensation on severance  
as a result of a change in control.
• Under the PSP, the Committee will determine whether and to what extent awards shall vest, taking into account all 
relevant factors including Company performance, the period of time elapsed since the date of grant and the interests 
of our shareholders.
• Under the CIP, participants will be eligible to retain their full Invested Shares and all restrictions on them will be lifted. 
The Committee will determine whether and to what extent Matching Awards shall vest, taking into account Company 
performance, and the period of time elapsed since the date of grant.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold an external appointment with the prior consent of the Board. Any fees may be retained  
by the individual.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman of the Board, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and 
responsibilities. They do not have service contracts.
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below:
Provision Policy
Period • Initially appointed for a period of three years, subject to annual review and notice.
• In line with the UK Code, all Directors will seek annual re-appointment by shareholders at the AGM.
Loss of office • Three months’ notice by either the Company or the Non-Executive Director.
• Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board are not entitled to compensation on leaving the Board.
Fees • As set out on page 92.
Expiry of current term • See page 91 for details of the expiry of the current term of Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment.
Availability of documentation
Service contracts and letters of appointment for all Directors are available for inspection by any person at our registered office  
in Handforth, Cheshire. They will also be available for inspection during the 30 minutes prior to the start of our AGM to be held in 
Manchester on 9 September 2015.

d) Illustration of the Remuneration Policy
Our remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of 
stretching short-term and long-term performance targets, aligned with the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The Committee 
considers the level of remuneration that may be received under different performance outcomes to ensure that this is appropriate  
in the context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders.
The charts below provide illustrative values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors under three assumed performance scenarios. 
Scenario Assumptions
Fixed pay
All performance scenarios • Consists of total fixed pay, including base salary, benefits and pension
• Base salary – salary effective as at 17 March 2014
• Benefits – amount estimated to be received by each Executive Director in 2014/15
• Pension – salary supplement effective as at 17 March 2014.
Variable pay
Minimum performance •  No payout under the annual bonus
•  No vesting under the Performance Share Plan
On-target performance •  50% of the maximum pay-out under the annual bonus (i.e. 50% of salary)
• 16% vesting under the Performance Share Plan (i.e. 24% of salary)
Maximum performance • 100% of the maximum pay-out under the annual bonus (i.e. 100% of salary)
•  100% vesting under the Performance Share Plan (i.e. 150% of salary)
Notes
• The Co-Investment Plan has not been included in the scenarios shown, as this plan is not intended to be an ongoing remuneration element under our policy.
• Under the PSP, the normal maximum limit of 150% of salary has been shown, rather than the exceptional limit of 200% of salary.
• All-colleague share plans have been excluded.
• Any legacy awards which Executive Directors hold have been excluded.
These charts are for illustrative purposes only and actual outcomes may differ from those shown.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Chief Executive Chief Financial Officer
Base salary £425,000 £320,000
Benefits £11,500 £11,500
Pension £38,250 £28,800
Total fixed pay £474,750 £360,300
e) Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company
As per the Committee’s terms of reference, we also review the pay and conditions of colleagues at levels below the Executive Directors. 
This includes approving the design of, and determining targets for any performance related pay schemes such as the bonus scheme 
operated by the Company and approving the total annual payments made under such schemes. The Committee is also consulted 
concerning any major changes in colleague benefit structures throughout the Group.
 
The remuneration package for all colleagues (including the Executive Directors) is reviewed on an annual basis and a consistent 
approach is applied at all levels. As part of the annual salary and benefits review, the Company takes into account industry standards, 
future legislative framework (including the national minimum wage) and the financial and economic environment of the Group both 
internally and externally. The annual salary and benefits review is presented to the Committee with recommendations on remuneration 
throughout the colleague base, including a proposed salary increase to be applied to all colleagues’ wages, including the Executive 
Directors. As such, the Committee has regard to this Group-wide annual review process when setting its remuneration policy for 
Executive Directors.
Whilst our colleagues are not directly consulted as part of the process of determining pay, the output from colleague surveys, including  
our internal “We’re All Ears” survey, is considered when carrying out the annual salary and benefits review.
A significant number of our colleagues are also shareholders and so are able to express their views in the same way as other shareholders.
f) Consideration of shareholder views
Although we have only recently become a public listed company, the Committee recognises the importance of building a good relationship 
with our new shareholders. This reflects our commitment to follow the highest standards of practice in relation to remuneration and 
governance at Pets at Home. 
In reviewing the remuneration arrangements which were put in place at the time of our IPO, the Committee evaluated current best practice 
in the listed environment. In particular, the Committee was keen to promote alignment, motivate our Executive Team and retain key talent 
to drive our business strategy. Our aim was to adopt a remuneration framework which would drive achievement of our corporate goals, 
whilst providing shareholders with comfort that it was appropriate, justified and did not encourage unacceptable risk management 
behaviour.
We will continue to monitor shareholder views when evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy, and we commit to consulting 
with shareholders prior to any significant changes to our remuneration policy.
g) Minor amendments
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Pets at Home Group plc for the year ended 26 March 2015 set out on pages 108 to 154.  
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 26 March 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and  
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards  
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect  
on our audit were as follows:
Carrying value of goodwill (£952.0m)
Refer to page 83 (Audit & Risk Committee Report), page 119 (accounting policy) and page 130 (financial disclosures). 
• The risk: Goodwill is a significant item within the Group’s balance sheet. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting  
and discounting future cash flows, which are the basis of the assessment of recoverability, goodwill is one of the key judgemental 
areas within our audit. Market capitalisation is considered to be a key indicator of potential impairment. The year ended 27 March 
2014 came shortly after the Company’s IPO, at which point there was significant headroom between market capitalisation and  
net assets including goodwill. During the year ended 26 March 2015 there has been some share volatility and although market 
capitalisation at the time of our audit has recovered, this volatility has increased our focus on the carrying amount of goodwill  
in the current year audit.
• Our response: Our audit procedures included testing of the Group’s budgeting procedures upon which the forecasts are based  
and the principles and integrity of the Group’s discounted cash flow model. We used our own valuation specialist to assist us in 
evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group and compared the Group’s assumptions to externally derived 
data as well as our own assessments of key inputs such as projected economic growth, cost inflation and discount rates. We 
performed break-even analysis to understand the sensitivity of the conclusions reached to changes in assumptions and compared 
the sum of projected discounted cash flows to the Group’s market capitalisation to assess the reasonableness of those cash flows. 
We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes 
in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Carrying value of inventory (£48.5m)
Refer to page 84 (Audit & Risk Committee Report), page 119 (accounting policy) and page 131 (financial disclosures).
• The risk: The Group has significant levels of inventory and a number of estimates are involved in arriving at valuation in respect  
of slow moving and obsolete inventories, some of which have a limited shelf life. Furthermore there is uncertainty over changes  
in consumer preferences and spending patterns, which are primarily driven by wider trends in the pet product industry as well as 
seasonality. There is a recoverability risk associated with new product launches and the judgement required in forecasting demand, 
including the possible change in demand between the time the inventory order is placed with the supplier and the date of sale. 
These factors all contribute to the risk that the carrying value of inventory exceeds its net realisable value. Given the level of 
judgement and estimation involved this is considered to be a key audit risk.
105
Strategic report Financial statements Governance report • Our response: Our audit procedures included assessing the principles and appropriateness of the Group’s inventory provisioning 
policies based on our understanding of the business and the accuracy of previous provisioning estimates. In assessing provisions 
against inventories our audit procedures included testing the Group’s controls designed to identify slow moving and obsolete 
inventories and comparison, by product, of inventory levels to sales data to assess whether slow moving and obsolete inventories 
had been appropriately identified by the Group, and provided for based on expected recoveries. We considered realisations  
of slow moving inventories during the year and post year end and compared these to the Group’s expected recoveries for slow 
moving inventories at the year-end date. In assessing the accuracy of historic provisioning estimates our audit procedures included 
the review of amounts subsequently written off inventory during the year in comparison to the provided amounts at the prior year 
end. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of amounts recognised as provision against inventory during  
the period.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £3.0m, determined with reference to a benchmark  
of Group profit before taxation of £87.0m, of which it represents 3.4%.
We report to the Audit & Risk Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.15m, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 5 reporting components, we subjected 4 to audit for Group reporting purposes and 1 to specified risk-focused audit 
procedures. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes, but did  
present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s results: 
Number of 
components
Group  
revenue (%)
Group profit 
before tax (%)
Group total 
assets (%)
Audits for Group reporting purposes 4 95.3 79.1 94.9
Specified risk-focused audit procedures 1 4.7 20.9 5.1
Total 5 100 100 100
For the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were  
no significant risks of material misstatement within these. 
The audits undertaken for Group purposes were all performed to materiality levels set individually for each component and ranged  
from £2.4m to £0.1m, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on all components 
was performed by the Group audit team.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• information given in the Corporate Governance Report set out on pages 76 to 81 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements.

(i)  As contemplated in the Pets at Home Group Plc IPO Prospectus dated 28 February 2014 and pursuant to a shareholder resolution passed on  
27 February 2014, Pets at Home Group Plc completed a reduction of capital, whereby £1,080,477,000 standing to the credit of the Company’s 
share premium account was cancelled, creating distributable reserves of an equivalent amount. The cancellation was formally approved by the  
High Court, and the court order was registered by the Registrar of Companies and became effective on 30 July 2014. The cancellation has no effect 
on the overall net asset position of the Company and/or its Group.

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report 1. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated  
financial statements.
Summary of impact of Group restructuring and Initial Public Offering
On 17 March 2014, the entire issued share capital of the Company was admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List maintained by the 
United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc’s main market for listed securities (“Listing” or “IPO”).  
In preparation for the Company’s IPO the Group was restructured.
For the consolidated financial statements of the Group, prepared under IFRS, the principles of reverse acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 ”Business 
Combinations” have been applied for the comparative period ended 27 March 2014. The steps to restructure the Group had the effect of Pets at Home 
Group Plc being inserted as the new holding company of the Group above Pets at Home Lux S.a.r.l (“PAH Lux”). Holders of shares and Preferred Equity 
Certificates (PECs) in PAH Lux exchanged their PAH Lux shares and a portion of their PECs, for shares in Plc. PAH Lux was transferred out of the Group 
following Listing.
By applying the principles of reverse acquisition accounting, the Group is presented as if the Company has always owned PAH Lux and the Group’s 
subsidiaries. The comparative consolidated reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share premium and merger reserve 
of Plc as if it had always existed, adjusted for movements in the underlying PAH Lux share capital and reserves until the exchange of PAH Lux share 
capital and PECs for Plc shares. 
Full details of the reverse acquisition accounting applied were described in the financial statements for the 52 week period ended 27 March 2014.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under 
section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value, 
and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European Union. New 
standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) becoming effective during the year have not had a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
1.2 Measurement convention
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair 
value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale. Non-current assets 
held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
1.3 Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report. The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officer’s 
review. In addition, note 21 to the financial statements include the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources and financing facilities and prepares detailed business plans that model headroom on financial 
covenants. 
The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
1.4 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into 
consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.  
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date  
that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing  
so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Notes (forming part of the financial statements)
116
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Investment in veterinary practices
The Group has a number of non-participatory shareholdings in veterinary practice companies, which are accounted for as joint venture arrangements.  
The veterinary practices were established under terms that require mutual agreement between the Group and the joint venture partner, and that do not 
give the Group power over decision making to affect its exposure to, or the extent of, the returns from its involvement with the practices and therefore  
are not consolidated in these financial statements. Further, the Group is not entitled to profit, losses, or any surplus on winding up or disposal of the 
veterinary practices, and as such no participatory interest is recognised. 
1.5 Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the  
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional 
currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, 
except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation that is 
effective, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling  
at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s 
presentational currency, sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange 
differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation 
reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be. 
Functional currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Company’s functional currency and have been rounded to the nearest 
thousand.
1.6 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following  
two conditions: 
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company (or Group); and 
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation  
to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed 
amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the  
legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital exclude amounts in relation  
to those shares. 
1.7 Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents,  
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities
Other investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant 
gain or loss being recognised directly in equity (in the fair value reserve), except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt 
securities, foreign exchange gains and losses. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in 
equity is recognised in profit or loss. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised 
in profit or loss.
117
Strategic report Financial statements Governance report 1. Significant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the 
Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
1.8 Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit  
or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being 
hedged (see below).
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable 
forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any 
ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses 
that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability 
assumed affects profit or loss, i.e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity 
and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged 
forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above 
policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised  
in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
1.9 Intra-Group financial instruments
Financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of companies within the Group are considered to be insurance arrangements and 
accounted for as such. In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that  
a payment will be required under the guarantee.
1.10  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant  
and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant  
and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold property 50 years 
Motor vehicles 3 years
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3–10 years
Leasehold improvements the term of the lease
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 1.11  Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. 
Acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010
For acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is  
not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are 
recognised in profit or loss.
On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests and are 
entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate interest in the 
recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair 
value at the acquisition date. 
Acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010 (date of adoption of IFRSs)
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs for first time adopters. In respect of acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010, 
goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost.
1.12  Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their 
capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on  
a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-controlling 
interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
1.13  Intangible assets and goodwill 
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested 
annually for impairment. 
Other intangible assets
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are 
indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other 
intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Computer Software  3–7 years
1.14  Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred  
in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition, less rebates  
and discounts.

1.15  Impairment excluding inventories, and deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence  
that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset,  
and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues  
to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease  
in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, 
and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each period at the  
same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value  
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are 
grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows  
of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, 
is allocated to cash-generating units, or (“CGU”). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs  
to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit  
from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed  
at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change  
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does  
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.16  Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no 
legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense 
in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability  
is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share based payments
A number of employees of the Company’s subsidiaries (including Directors) receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payments, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
Share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined  
by the share price at the date of grant. The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based  
on a binomial model. In valuing share based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price  
of the shares of Pets at Home Group Plc (‘market conditions’).
Notes (forming part of the financial statements)
continued
120
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 The cost of share based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based 
on the Company’s estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of a share based payment award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.  
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of the 
modification.
Where a share based payment award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the 
award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date 
that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
1.17  Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can  
be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.18  Revenue and cost of sales
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods and services, net of discounts and excluding value added tax, sold in the ordinary course  
of business, and arises from activities in the United Kingdom. 
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, there is reasonable certainty over recovery  
of the consideration and the amount of revenue, associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably. Revenue is recognised when 
transactions are completed in store or online.
Sale of goods in store and online
Retail revenue from the sale of goods is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers. Sale of goods represents food  
and accessories sold in store and online, with revenue recognised at the point of sale. 
Provision of services
Revenue from the provision of services is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers. Provision of services represents 
veterinary group income, grooming revenue, and insurance commissions, with revenue recognised upon provision of the service.
(i) Veterinary group income
Veterinary group income represents revenue from the provision of veterinary services, and income from the provision of veterinary administrative support 
services. Revenue received for the provision of veterinary services is recognised at the point of provision of the service and is recognised net of value 
added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers. Fee income received from the joint venture veterinary practice companies for administrative 
support services is recognised in the period the services relate to and recorded net of value added tax. 
(ii) VIP loyalty scheme
Under the VIP loyalty scheme, points are earned by customers upon the purchase of goods and services. These points can be converted by nominated 
charities into gift cards for redemption against goods and services in store and online. The sales value of the points earned under the VIP scheme are 
treated as deferred income; the sales are only recognised once the points have been redeemed by the charities. 
(iii) Grooming revenue
Grooming revenue is recognised net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers, at the point of provision of the service.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes costs of goods sold and other directly attributable costs and promotional income received from suppliers, including costs  
to deliver business services to joint venture veterinary practices and costs to deliver grooming services.
Exceptional items
Income or costs that are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the consolidated financial 
statements, are referred to as exceptional items. These are included and separately identified within their relevant income statement category.

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report 1. Significant accounting policies continued
Supplier income
A number of different types of supplier income are negotiated with suppliers via the joint business planning process, in connection with the purchase  
of goods for resale. The supplier income arrangements typically are not co-terminus with the Group’s financial period, instead running alongside  
the calendar year. Such income is only recognised when there is reasonable certainty that the conditions for recognition have been met by the Group,  
and the income can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract. This income is recognised as a credit within gross margin and, to the 
extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of inventory. Supplier income comprises three main elements:
1.  Fixed percentage based income: These relate largely to volumetric rebates based on the joint business plan agreements with suppliers. The  
income accrued is based on the Group’s latest forecast volumes and the latest contract agreed with the supplier. Income is not recognised until  
the Group has reasonable certainty that the joint business agreement will be fulfilled, with the amount of income accrued regularly re-assessed  
and re-measured throughout the contractual period, based on actual performance against the joint business plan. 
2.  Fixed lump sum income: These are typically guaranteed lump sum payments made by the supplier and are not based on volume. Fixed lump sum 
income is usually predicated on confirmation of a supplier contract and typically includes performance conditions upon the Group, such as marketing 
and promotional campaigns. These amounts are recognised periodically based on the most recent assessment of contractual performance. 
3.  Growth income: These are tiered volumetric rebates relating to growth targets agreed with the supplier in the joint business planning process.  
These are retrospective rebates based on sales volumes or purchased volumes. Income is recognised to the extent that it is reasonably certain  
that the conditions will be achieved, with such certainty increasing in the latter part of the calendar year.
Supplier income is recognised on an accruals basis, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each 
relevant supplier contract. The accrued incentives, rebates and discounts receivable at year end are included within trade and other receivables. 
1.19  Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense. 
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable under the effective interest rate method, incorporating amortisation of loan arrangement fees, finance 
charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount 
on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement (see foreign currency accounting policy). Borrowing  
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use,  
are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign 
exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in 
the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Other payables
Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent free periods.
Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as a liability in the balance sheet at the point the recognition criteria in the 
lease is met, and credited to selling and distribution expenses in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease 
commencing from access date. Cash contributions are not discounted.
Rent free periods received from landlords are initially recognised as a liability on the balance sheet, which is then credited to the selling and distribution 
expenses in the consolidated income statement over the life of the lease. The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling and distribution expenses  
on a straight-line basis from property access date to the end of the lease. Rent-free periods are not discounted.
1.20  Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted  
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition  
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments  
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised. 
1.21  Adopted IFRS not yet applied 
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. Their adoption is not expected  
to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (European Union effective date 1 January 2018). 
• IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts (European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contract with Customers (European Union effective date 1 January 2017). 
• Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions – Amendments to IAS 19 (European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
• Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations – Amendments to IFRS 11  
(European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
• Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38  
(European Union effective date 1 January 2016).
• Agriculture: Bearer Plants – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 (European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
• Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements – Amendments to IAS 27 (European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
• Sale or Contribution of Assets between and Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture – Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28  
(European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
1.22  Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
concerning the future that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These 
judgements are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge at the time and the actual results may ultimately differ from these 
estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are  
discussed below.
Carrying value of inventories
The managers review the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure inventory is recorded in the financial statements 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Any provision for impairment is recorded against the carrying value of inventories. The managers use their 
knowledge of market conditions to assess future demand for the Group’s products and achievable selling prices.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which  
goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from  
the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of CGUs as well as further information about the 
assumptions made are disclosed in note 10.
Assumptions relating to tax
The Group recognises expected assets for tax based on an estimation of the likely taxes receivable, which requires significant judgement as to the 
ultimate tax determination of certain items. Where the actual asset arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences will have  
an impact on income tax and deferred tax assets in the period when such determination is made.
123
Strategic report Financial statements Governance report 1. Significant accounting policies continued
Provisions
Provisions have been made for dilapidations and for closed stores. Information about provisions and contingencies, which are considered to have a risk 
of material adjustment in the next financial period due to the assumptions and estimations used, are disclosed in note 19. The provisions are based on 
historical experience and management’s best knowledge at the time and are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The actual costs and timing of future 
cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when 
such determination is made.
1.23  Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders such 
that the Company is obliged to pay the dividend. Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
2. Segmental reporting
The Directors consider there to be one operating and reportable segment, being that of the sale of pet products and services through retail outlets  
and the Group’s websites. 
The Group’s Board receives monthly financial information at this level and uses this information to monitor the performance of the store portfolio, allocate 
resources and make operational decisions. The internal reporting received focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify individual segments.  
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segment.

The UK corporation tax standard rate for the 52 week period ended 26 March 2015 was 21% (52 week period ended 27 March 2014: 23%).  
The effective tax rate before exceptional items for the 52 weeks to 26 March 2015 was 22%. The principal reason for the difference in rate relates  
to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on some capital expenditure.
The exceptional tax credit of £4.3m included within the non-recurring exceptional items represents the release of a provision following agreement  
with HMRC in respect of interest on debt associated with the pre IPO structure. As part of the IPO process this debt was repaid. Overall this results  
in a total effective tax rate for the period of 17%.

Amortisation and impairment charge
The amortisation charge is recognised in total in operating expenses within the income statement.
Impairment testing
Cash Generating Units (‘CGU’) within the Group are considered to be the body of stores including vet practices, and the Group’s websites as disclosed  
in note 2. The Group is deemed to have one overall group of CGUs as follows:
Goodwill
At 26 March 
2015
£000
At 27 March 
2014
£000
Pets at Home Group 952,032 952,032
The recoverable amount of the CGU group has been calculated with reference to its value in use. The key assumptions of this calculation are shown below:
At 26 March 
2015
At 27 March 
2014
Period on which management approved forecasts are based (years) 3 3
Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 3% 3%
Discount rate (pre-tax) 9% 8%
The goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and the recoverable amount is determined based on “value-in-use” calculations. 
These calculations use a pre-tax cash flow projection based on a 3 year plan approved by the Board.
The key assumptions in this business plan are like for like sales growth, gross and operating profit margins. The forecast assumptions reflect continual 
innovation, our deep understanding of our customers and a detailed analysis of geographic opportunities that allow us to continue to grow. The 
projections are based on all available information and growth rates do not exceed growth rates achieved in prior periods. A different set of assumptions 
may be more appropriate in future years depending on changes in the macro-economic environment.
The discount rate was estimated based on past experience and industry average weighted average cost of capital. The Directors have assumed  
a growth rate projection beyond the 3 year period based on inflationary increases.
The total recoverable amount in respect of goodwill for the CGU group as assessed by the managers using the above assumptions is greater than  
the carrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been booked in each period. The Directors consider that it is not reasonably possible  
for the assumptions to change so significantly as to eliminate the excess.

Face value represents the principal value of the Senior Finance Bank Loans. 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being the principal value of the loan, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at a carrying value, which represents the amortised cost of the loans using the effective interest 
method, less any impairment losses.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 At 26 March 2015, the Group had an undrawn revolving credit facility of £29.6m (period to 27 March 2014: £27.0m) which was due to expire  
on 17 March 2019.
All bank borrowings are secured via fixed charges over the head office freehold property, the distribution centre leasehold property, and any plant  
and machinery owned by the Group, and also via a floating charge over the other assets of the Group. The senior bank loans bear interest at LIBOR  
plus a margin, which during the period varied between 2.00% and 2.25%, with the margin decreasing as the Group’s leverage (defined as total net debt  
to consolidated EBITDA) decreases. The senior bank loans were due for repayment at various dates up to 17 March 2020.
Subsequent to the period end, on 15 April 2015, the Group undertook a refinancing transaction. The details of this transaction are included in note 27.
The Pets at Home Group has entered into fixed rate interest rate swap agreements over a total of £239.8m of the senior facility borrowings at a fixed 
rate of 0.74% and a further fixed rate interest rate swap over a total of £77.1m at a fixed rate of 0.655% (at 27 March 2014: £291.8m of the senior 
facility borrowings at a fixed rate of 0.74% and £25.1m at a fixed rate of 0.655%). Both swaps expire on 30 March 2016. The hedges are structured  
to hedge at least 70% of the outstanding debt.

The closed stores provision relates to the rent and rates payable on sub-let or vacant stores. A provision is made where the rent receivable on the 
properties is less than the rent payable, or where management consider there to be a risk on the sublet. The timing of the utilisation of the above 
provisions is variable dependent upon the lease expiry dates of the properties concerned, which vary between 10 to 15 years. Market conditions  
have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
The Company did not hold any provisions at 26 March 2015 or 27 March 2014.

21. Financial instruments
Financial risk management
The Pets at Home Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and cash flow 
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management framework
Risk management in respect of financial risk is carried out by the Pets at Home Group Treasury department under policies approved by the Board of 
Directors. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board 
provides written principals, through its Group Treasury Policy, for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such  
as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment  
of excess liquidity. 
The main objectives of the Pets at Home Group Treasury department are:
• To ensure shareholder and management expectations are managed on cash flow and earnings volatility resulting from financial market movements
• To protect the expected cash flow and earnings from interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations to within parameters acceptable to the Board 
and shareholders
• To control banking costs and service levels
Market risk
(i) Foreign currency risk
The Pets at Home Group sources a significant level of purchases in foreign currency, in excess of $50 million US dollars each financial year, and monitors 
its foreign currency requirements through short, medium and long term cash forecasting. The value of purchases in US dollars has increased significantly 
over the last three years and the risk management policy has changed in line with this increased risk. 
At 26 March 2015, the Pets at Home Group’s policy is to hedge between 75% and 90% of the forecasted foreign exchange transactions on a rolling  
10 to 12 month basis, using foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts. The transactions are deemed to be ‘highly probable’ 
and are based on historical knowledge and forecasted purchase and sales projections.

Sensitivity analysis
A 5% percent weakening of the following currencies against the pound sterling at the period end date in both years would have increased/(decreased) 
profit or loss or equity by the amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied 
to risk exposures existing at that date. 
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant.

A 5% percent strengthening of the above currencies against the pound sterling in any period would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above 
currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
(ii) Interest rate risk
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Pets at Home Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. As at 26 March 2015 the Group had a drawn down senior facility  
with a face value totalling £325.0m and an undrawn revolving credit facility of £29.6m, which expires on 17 March 2019. The Pets at Home Group’s 
borrowings as at 26 March 2015 incur interest at varying rates between 2.00% and 2.25% plus LIBOR, which exposes the Group to cash flow interest 
rate risk. The analysis of loan repayments is detailed in note 17.
The Pets at Home Group’s policy, with regard to interest rate risk, is to hedge the appropriate level of borrowings by entering into fixed rate agreements. 
The Pets at Home Group has entered into fixed rate interest rate swap agreements over a total of £239.8m of the senior facility borrowings at the 
balance sheet date at a fixed rate of 0.74%, and a further fixed rate interest rate swap was taken out over a total of £77.1m at the balance sheet date  
at a fixed rate of 0.655%. Both swaps expire on 30 March 2016. The hedges are structured to hedge at least 70% of the outstanding debt.

Total financial liabilities 320,674 319,855 320,674 319,855
All loans bear a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR. Pets at Home Group policy is to hedge at least 70% of the loan to ensure a fixed rate. Therefore, 
designated above is the portion of the loan hedged by a fixed rate interest rate swap and the remaining un-hedged portion is designated as variable rate.
Sensitivity analysis 
A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the period end date would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown 
below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments  
with variable interest rates, financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate element 
of interest rate swaps. The analysis is performed on the same basis for comparative period.

Credit risk
Financial risk management 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations,  
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group 
ensures that the banks used for the financing of the loan facilities and interest rate swap agreements held an acceptable risk rating by independent parties. 
The Group has in place certain guarantees over the bank loans taken out by a number of veterinary practice companies in which it holds an investment. 
Further details of these guarantees are disclosed in note 25. The performance of the veterinary practice companies is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Exposure to credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk being the carrying amount of financial assets is summarised in the table within the fair values  
section below.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
Management prepares and monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash balances based on expected cash flows to ensure, as far as possible, that it 
will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without risking damage to the Group’s reputation. 
Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there is no risk or breach which would lead to an ‘Event of Default’ and compliance certificates  
are issued as required to the syndicate agent.

Fair values of financial instruments
Investments
The fair value of investments are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed as not material 
and the investment is non-participatory.
Trade and other payables and receivables
The fair value of these items are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed as not material.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand. Where it is not repayable  
on demand (such as term deposits), then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest  
at the balance sheet date.
Long-term and short-term borrowings 
The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates its carrying value as it has an interest rate based on LIBOR.
Short-term deposits
The fair value of short term deposits is considered to be the carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the interest rate  
is reset to market rates.
Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts and forward exchange contracts are calculated by management based on external valuations received  
from the Group’s bankers and is based on forward exchange rates and anticipated future interest yield respectively.

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital, which is deemed to be total equity plus total debt, are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance, 
and to maintain a strong credit rating and headroom on financial covenants. The Group manages its capital structure and makes appropriate decisions  
in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development  
of the business. 
During the period the Group de-levered as part of the Initial Public Offering process, which brought the Group’s leverage into a position commensurate 
with the public market.
The funding requirements of the Group are met by the utilisation of external borrowings together with available cash, as detailed in note 17.
A key objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the senior loan agreement and to maintain 
comfortable headroom over and above these requirements. 
Management have continued to measure and monitor covenant compliance throughout the period and the Group has complied with the  
requirements set.
22. Share based payments
At 26 March 2015, the Group has four share award plans, all of which are equity settled schemes.
1. The Co-Invest Plan (CIP)
On 25 February 2014 the Company adopted the Co-Invest Plan (CIP). Matching awards under the CIP (as described in section 1(b) below) were made  
on 17 March 2014 to Executive Directors and the Senior Executives by reference to corresponding investment pledges by those colleagues. 
These matching awards will vest over a period of three years subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and once vested as to performance, 
will become exercisable in equal one-third tranches in years three, four and five subject to continued employment with the Group. These awards were 
granted at nil cost.
(a) Eligibility
Only the Executive Directors, the Senior Executives and certain other senior colleagues have been selected to participate in the CIP. 
(b) Type of awards
Colleagues are invited to participate in the CIP by making an ‘investment’ or ‘pledge’ of their own Shares (the “Co-Invest Shares”), which can include 
existing, locked-in Shares or new Shares acquired with cash, in return for a nil cost-matching award over Shares (the “Matching Award”). 
Matching Awards will be granted by reference to a ratio not exceeding one matched Share for every Co-Invest Share ‘pledged’. Matching Awards under 
the CIP will not form part of a participant’s pensionable earnings and are not transferable other than on death.
(c) Individual limits
The Executive Directors and the Senior Executives will pledge Co-Invest Shares with a market value equal to 2.5 times their annual salary. Other senior 
colleagues who elect to participate in the CIP will pledge Co-Invest Shares with a market value equal to a limit specified by the Remuneration Committee, 
but not exceeding one times their annual salary.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 (d) Performance, vesting and performance adjustment
The Matching Awards granted on 17 March 2014 vest subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions outlined below. To the extent that any 
future awards are granted, different conditions may apply (in the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee).
The performance conditions are as follows: 
• 75% of the Matching Award will be subject to the CAGR in the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) over three financial years, namely FY15,  
FY16 and FY17 (together the “Performance Period”) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, ends on 31 March 2017). If the CAGR in the Company’s  
EPS is 10%, then 10% of the total Matching Award will vest. If the CAGR in the Company’s EPS is 17.5% or more, then 75% of the total Matching 
Award will vest. Vesting will be on a straight line basis between these two points. For the avoidance of doubt, if the CAGR in EPS is less than  
10% over the Performance Period then the amount of the Matching Award which will vest under this EPS performance condition will be nil.
• 25% of the total Matching Award will be subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) as compared to the UK General Retail Index  
over the Performance Period. Vesting of 6.25% of the total Matching Award will occur for median performance. Vesting of the maximum 25% of  
the total Matching Award will occur for upper quartile performance or above. Vesting will occur on a straight line basis between these two points.  
If the Company’s TSR performance over the Performance Period is below median, then the amount of the Matching Award which will vest under  
this TSR performance condition will be nil.
• To the extent vested as to performance, Matching Awards will become exercisable in three equal amounts on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary 
of 17 March 2014, but subject to continued employment with the Group.
2. CSOP
On 25 February 2014 the Company adopted the CSOP. Part I of the CSOP will be tax approved under Schedule 4 to the Income Tax (Earnings  
and Pensions) Act 2003 and provides for the grant of tax approved options. Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options. 
The tax approved options under Part I of the CSOP were granted on 9 April 2014. These options will be exercisable between the third and tenth 
anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment with the Group. These awards will be granted with an exercise price equal to the 
market value of the Shares at the grant date (as agreed with HMRC).
(a) Eligibility
All colleagues, including the Executive Directors and Senior Executives, are eligible to participate in the CSOP, at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee.
(b) Grant of options
No options may be granted more than ten years after the adoption of the CSOP. Options under the CSOP will not form part of a colleague’s pensionable 
earnings.
(c) Vesting and performance
Colleagues who receive options under the CSOP and under the PSP in connection with Admission will be subject to the same performance conditions 
described in Section 1 (d) above in respect of both grants. Colleagues who only receive options under the CSOP in connection with Admission will not  
be subject to performance conditions.
(d) Exercise price
The price at which an option holder may acquire Shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than the 
greater of market value of a Share at the time of grant and its nominal value.
(e) Individual limits
No option may be granted to an eligible colleague under Part I of the CSOP which would result in the aggregate exercise prices of Shares comprised  
in all outstanding options granted to him/her under Part I, when aggregated with outstanding options held under any other tax approved executive share 
option scheme established by the Company, exceeding the tax approved limit (currently £30,000).
In addition, (both under Part I and II of the CSOP) the aggregate exercise price of Shares comprised in options granted to a colleague under the CSOP 
and the PSP in any financial year shall not exceed 150% of his/her annual salary for that year. 
For the purposes of these limits market value will be calculated by reference to the market value of the Shares on or prior to the relevant date of grant  
as determined by the Board (following consultation with the Remuneration Committee) and subject to HMRC approval if applicable.
(l) Part II
Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options. This enables Options to be granted under the same terms as Part I of the CSOP but 
without complying with the particular requirements of the legislation applicable to tax approved CSOP Schemes. The provisions of the CSOP that do not 
apply under Part II include the £30,000 limit and the need to seek HMRC approval for the scheme and subsequent amendments (as applicable).

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report 22. Share based payments continued
3. PSP
On 25 February 2014 the Company adopted the PSP. Awards under the PSP were made on 17 March 2014 and will be exercisable between the third  
and tenth anniversary of this date, subject to continued employment with the Group and the satisfaction of performance conditions. These awards were 
granted at nil cost.
(a) Eligibility
Only the Executive Directors, the Senior Executives and certain other senior colleagues have been selected to participate in the PSP.
(b) Grant of awards
Awards under the PSP will not form part of a colleague’s pensionable earnings. Awards are not transferable (other than on death) without the consent  
of the Remuneration Committee.
(c) Exercise price
The price at which a colleague may acquire Shares on the exercise or vesting of an award under the PSP shall be determined by the Remuneration 
Committee on the date of grant, and may, if the Remuneration Committee determines be nil or nominal value only.
(d) Scheme limits
The number of newly issued Shares over which (or in respect of which) awards may be granted under the PSP on any date shall be limited so that: (i) the 
total number of Shares issued and issuable in respect of options or awards granted in any ten year period under the PSP and any other discretionary 
share option scheme of the Company (including the CIP and the CSOP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) is restricted to 5% of the 
Company’s issued Shares calculated at the relevant time; and (ii) the total number of Shares issued and issuable pursuant to options or awards granted 
in any ten year period under the PSP and any other employee share scheme operated by the Company (including the CIP, CSOP, SAYE and SIP but other 
than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) is restricted to 10% of the Company’s issued Shares calculated at the relevant time.
For the purposes of these limits no account will be taken of options or awards granted before, on or in connection with Admission and no account will  
be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting. Shares held in treasury will  
be treated as newly issued Shares for the purposes of these limits (as long as this is required by institutional investor guidelines), but (for the avoidance 
of doubt) Shares acquired in the market will not.
(e) Individual limits
The aggregate market value of Shares comprised in awards granted to a colleague under the PSP and the CSOP in any financial year shall not exceed 
150% of their annual salary for that year. 
For the purposes of awards granted on (or before) Admission, market value for these purposes will be calculated by reference to the Offer Price. For the 
purposes of awards granted following Admission, market value for these purposes will be calculated by reference to the market value of the Shares on 
the relevant date of grant as determined by the Board (following consultation with the Remuneration Committee) in its absolute discretion.
(f) Performance
For awards granted on, or in connection with, Admission, the performance conditions will be the same as for the CIP outlined in Section 1(d) above.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 4. SAYE
On 25 February 2014, the Company adopted the SAYE (which was registered with and self-certified with HMRC on 4 April 2015. The rules of the SAYE 
were adopted pursuant to Schedule 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and provide for the grant of tax approved options. On the  
9 September, the Company issued invitations under the rules of the SAYE which provides eligible colleagues with an opportunity to receive share options 
at a 20% discount to the market price. The maximum monthly savings was £250 per month. The Executive Directors elected to participate in the 
Sharesave, along with 30% of eligible colleagues.
The Options were granted on 8 October 2014 and they are, in normal circumstances, not exercisable until completion of a 3 years savings period, 
beginning on 1 December 2014 and will then be exercisable for a period of 6 months. The exercise period will, therefore, in normal circumstances,  
be from 1 December 2017 to 31 May 2018.
(a) Eligibility
All colleagues and full-time Directors of the Group, who have been in continuous service for such period of time (not exceeding five years) as may  
be determined by the Board prior to the relevant date of grant of an option and who are liable to UK income tax, are eligible to participate in the SAYE.
Participation may also be offered, at the discretion of the Board (taking account of the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee), to other 
Directors or employees who otherwise do not satisfy all of the above criteria, although non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the SAYE.
(b) Issue of invitations
Invitations to participate in the SAYE may be made during each 42 day period from (and including) (i) the date on which any amendment to the SAYE  
is approved or adopted by the Company’s shareholders (ii) the announcement of the Company’s final or interim results for any financial period, (iii) the 
occurrence of an event which the Remuneration Committee considers to be an exceptional event concerning the Group or (iv) changes to the legislation 
affecting tax approved SAYE option schemes coming into effect. If any of the above periods is a ‘close period’ as a result of the application of the  
Model Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed Companies (or as a result of the Company’s equivalent internal share dealing rules)  
and the Company is prohibited from issuing invitations and/or granting options as a result then invitations may be made within 42 days of the end  
of the close period.
Invitations may be issued by the trustee of an employee benefit trust. No invitations may be issued or options granted more than ten years after the 
adoption of the SAYE.
(c) Exercise price
The price at which an option holder may acquire Shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than the 
greater of 80% of the market value of a Share at the time of grant and its nominal value.
(d) Savings contract
Options may be granted by the Board or the trustee of an employee benefit trust. Upon applying for an option, the colleague will be required to enter  
into an approved savings contract with a savings institution nominated by the Company which lasts for either three or five years. The maximum amount 
which an employee is permitted to contribute under SAYE contracts is £250 per month (increasing to £500 per month from 6 April 2014). The Board  
may set lower savings limits than this for different colleagues by reference to objective criteria such as levels of salary or length of service. The minimum 
contribution is £5 per month (or such greater amount as the Board may specify, not to exceed £10). The total exercise price of the Shares over which  
the option is granted may not exceed the aggregate of the monthly contributions and bonus payable at the end of the colleague’s related SAYE contract.
(e) Scheme limits
The number of newly issued Shares over which (or in respect of which) options may be granted under the SAYE on any date of grant shall be limited so 
that the total number of Shares issued or capable of being issued in any ten year period under all the Company’s employee share schemes (including the 
CIP, CSOP, PSP and SIP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) is restricted to 10% of the Company’s issued Shares calculated at the 
relevant time. Any options or rights to acquire shares granted before, on or in connection with Admission will be excluded from this limit, and no account 
will be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting.
(f) Exercisability
Options will normally be exercisable during a period of six months following the allocation of a bonus under the related SAYE contract and will normally 
lapse upon cessation of employment. Earlier exercise is, however, permitted if the colleague dies or leaves employment through injury, disability, 
redundancy or retirement or where a colleague leaves employment of the Group by reason of his employing company ceasing to be a member  
of the Group, or if the undertaking in which he is employed is sold outside the Group. Early exercise will also be permitted in the event of a takeover, 
reconstructions or voluntary winding up of the Company.

Strategic report Financial statements Governance report 22. Share based payments continued
Fair value of share awards
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over a relevant period prior to award on 17 March 2014. The 
expected life is the average expected period to exercise, which has been taken as 3 years. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon  
UK government bonds with a life equal to this expected life.
Options were valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model for the non-market based (EPS element) performance conditions and a Monte-Carlo 
simulation for the market-based (TSR element) performance conditions.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company which employs the option 
holder ceases to be part of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
The key assumptions used in the fair value of the awards were as follows:
At grant date CIP PSP CSOP SAYE
Share price £2.45 £2.45 £2.31 £1.75
Exercise price £0.00 £0.00 £1.75 £1.45
Expected volatility 30% 30% 37% 30%
Option life (years) 3 10 10 3
Expected dividend yield 2.00% 2.00% 2.00% 2.00%
Risk free interest rate 1.07% 1.07% 2.25% 1.07%
Weighted average fair value of options granted £2.06 £2.06 £0.75 £0.47
As both the CIP and PSP awards have a nil exercise price the risk free rate of return does not have any effect on the estimated fair value.

27. Subsequent events
Refinance
On 14 April 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the amendment agreement to the Senior Facilities Agreement. The 
Amendment Agreement became effective on 15 April 2015 (the “Effective Date”), after the date of the Company’s financial year end on 26 March 2015.
 
The Amendment Agreement provided that a new revolving facility of £260 million (the “Revolving Facility 2”) was incorporated into the Senior Facilities 
Agreement. The existing term and revolving facilities were repaid on the Effective Date with the proceeds of a drawing under Revolving Facility 2 and  
cash on balance sheet and upon the prepayment such facilities were cancelled. Revolving Facility 2 is available for drawing to finance and/or refinance 
(as applicable) the general corporate purposes and/or working capital requirements of the Group. The interest rate applicable to Revolving Facility 2  
is LIBOR (or, for loans in Euro, EURIBOR) plus a margin ranging between 2.00% and 0.75% per annum depending on the ratio of consolidated EBITDA  
to total net debt. The margin currently applicable to utilisations under Revolving Facility 2 is 1.50% per annum. KKR Capital Markets Limited (“KCM”),  
an affiliate of the Principal Shareholder, KKR My Best Friend Limited, received a fee of £500,000 for arranging Revolving Facility 2.
Acquisition of North West Surgeons

capital of Northwest Surgeons Limited, in exchange for an initial cash consideration of £2.6m. Northwest Surgeons Limited is a company registered  
in England and Wales, engaged in the provision of specialist veterinary services to veterinary practices in the north west of England. The acquisition 
represents the first specialist veterinary referral practice within the Group. 
The practice makes no contribution to these financial statements, due to the transaction closing subsequent to the period end. 
It is anticipated that the financial statements of Pets at Home Group Plc for the 53 week period to 31 March 2016 will include full disclosure in 
accordance with IFRS 3 of consideration paid or payable, the fair value of net assets acquired, goodwill recognised, and acquisition related costs,  
at such time as the initial accounting for the business combination is complete.

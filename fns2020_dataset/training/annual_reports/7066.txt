The goal of Hardy’s India focused exploration activity is to discover 
commercial quantities of hydrocarbons (oil and gas). The Company 
creates value for its shareholders by undertaking activities that 
reduce the overall risk of the exploration cycle.
This is accomplished by conducting extensive geological and 
geophysical studies, acquiring seismic and other data, and the 
implementation of robust, modern technology and scientific analysis 
to identify prospects and select optimal drilling locations.

Our Vision
To be a profitable independent 
exploration and production

deliver step change growth in 
shareholder value through  
the discovery and  
production of  
hydrocarbons. 05
Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Our Strategy
01. Geographical Focus
Hardy was founded on the premise that India offers a unique 
investment case for oil and gas exploration and production companies. 
Large areas of under explored basins are available for exploration. 
India’s New Exploration Licensing Policy (‘NELP’) offers globally 
competitive fiscal terms and stability. As one of the world’s fastest 
growing economies with a huge demand for energy, the market for 
monetisation of future hydrocarbon discoveries is easily accessible. 
02. Knowledge and Relationships
With over 12 years of experience as an operator in India, Hardy has  
an experienced technical team with in-depth knowledge of India’s 
prospective sedimentary basins. The Company has acquired key 
strategic relationships with national oil companies, local service 
providers, and industry peers to maintain a sustainable competitive 
advantage. Of note is the Company’s long standing relationship with 
Reliance Industries Limited in which the companies jointly hold 
interests in four of Hardy’s five exploration blocks. Reliance is the 
largest listed company in India and has had significant exploration 
success to date, particularly in the Krishna Godavari Basin off the east 
coast of India.
03. Growth Through Exploration
The Company has interests in exploration blocks that offer substantial 
Prospective Resources potential. Hardy focuses principally on organic 
growth mainly in India. This is derived by de-risking its existing 
portfolio, maximising recovery of its producing asset and adding new 
exploration assets selectively (by bidding under NELP rounds and other 
new ventures).
04. Risk Mitigation 
The Company endeavours to mitigate its capital exposure by 
maintaining lower participating interest in higher risk exploration and 
appraisal activities and maintaining investment in low risk production 
and development blocks. The Company funds its exploration and 
appraisal activities through equity financing, free cash flow and 
farmouts. The Company presently has no long-term debt. The Company 
will consider debt financing for low risk development and production 
projects in the future.

OVERVIEW 06
Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
“ Our India focused strategy has 
produced five gas discoveries 
from nine exploration wells over 
the past three years.”
 Paul Mortimer, Chairman
Corporate Overview
2009 was an important year for Hardy as we continued 
our exploration programme on the Company’s  
portfolio in the Krishna Godavari Basin. As a result  
of our activity, we were delighted to announce the  
third consecutive gas discovery in the D3 block.  
We also began our four well exploration drilling 
campaign in the D9 block. 
The first well was plugged and 
abandoned and the data is currently 
being integrated into the D9 
geological model to optimise selection 
of future drilling locations. Despite 
challenging market conditions, the 
Company was successful in raising 
$15 million in equity through a placing 
in 2009. The placing is testimony to 
the significant growth potential our 
asset portfolio offers and highlights 
the continued support of our core 
shareholder base.
India remains a rapid growth story  
and the demand for energy continues 
to be robust, mirroring the country’s 
significant economic growth. Hardy 
has a clear objective of creating 
significant shareholder value through 
an India focused exploration and 
development strategy.
Our India focused strategy has 
produced five gas discoveries from 
nine exploration wells over the past 
three years. We expect to drill a further 
five exploration wells by the end of the 
first half of 2011 and we continue to 
believe that our existing exploration 
portfolio in the Krishna Godavari  
Basin and other basins in India offer 
significant organic growth potential  
for the Company.
Key Results
As a result of the reduction in global 
oil prices and an extended shut-in of 
our PY-3 field, the Company recorded 
a 56 per cent reduction in gross 
revenue and as a result Hardy 
recorded a net loss of $6.5 million 
compared to net income of $7.5 
million in 2008. Net income for 2008 
included an after tax gain on the sale 
of investment of $8.9 million. The 
Company’s fully diluted loss per share 
was $0.10 compared to fully diluted 
earnings per share of $0.11 in 2008.
The Company’s capital expenditures 
amounted to $13.6 million which was 
principally on the drilling of one 
development well, two exploration 
wells, the acquisition of seismic data 
and the pre-drilling of a well on D3. 
The Company ended 2009 with $30.5 
million in cash and short-term 
investments and no long-term debt.
Management Change
Effective 31 March 2010, Sastry Karra 
relinquished his position as Chief 
Executive and now maintains an 
ongoing involvement with the 
Company as a Non-Executive Director. 
Yogeshwar Sharma, former Chief 
Operating Officer, has succeeded 
Sastry Karra as Chief Executive Officer.
We would like to thank Sastry for his 
tireless work over the past 12 years  
as Chief Executive. It was Sastry’s 
vision that has placed Hardy in the 
prospective position it is today. The 
management is determined to fulfil the 
potential of that vision.
Corporate Governance
Following an appraisal of the Board  
and its members in 2009, the Board 
considers that its current structure, 
competencies and remuneration policies 
are appropriate for a publicly listed, early 
stage, oil and gas exploration company. 
As such we did not undertake any 
material changes in 2009. 
Your Board is aware that there are 
areas where the make-up of the Board 
does not meet the full requirements of 
the combined code. The Chairman 
and the Chairman of the remuneration 
committee have held discussions with 
shareholders and with organisations 
providing services to shareholders on 
these issues.
One issue concerns stock options 
held by Dr Bell, and Messrs Mortimer 
and Shah. These are legacy options 
that were granted at the time the 
Company was listed on the AIM 
market and were considered 
appropriate. A new remuneration 
policy for Directors has since been 
adopted and no new options will be 
granted to Non-Executive Directors.
Another issue of concern is that 
Messrs Shah and Mortimer have been 
Directors for more than nine years. 
Both are considered by the Board to 
be fiercely independent and both are 
vigorous contributors to Hardy’s 
direction. The Indian relationships, the 
knowledge of India and the knowledge 
Chairman’s Statement 07
Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
of the Oil and Gas Industry in India 
that Mr Shah brings to the Board 
would be difficult to replace. We 
would like to have him continue as a 
Director during this critical phase of 
the Company’s development.
It is the Board’s judgement that, at this 
time, when a small company is 
marshalling its resources to support 
an exciting and company building 
exploration programme, it is not the 
time to use resources on a major 
restructuring of the Board. We are 
aware of our lack of compliance with 
the combined code in this area and 
intend to move toward addressing 
them at a pace appropriate to the 
development of the Company’s  
available resources.
Risk Management
Risk management will continue to be a 
key focus of the Board in 2010. Given 
the Company’s objective of creating 
significant shareholder value, we  
have chosen an exploration focused 
strategy. Exploration is intrinsically  
very uncertain and whilst substantial 
improvements in predictive/
interpretation technology have 
reduced this uncertainty, it cannot  
be eliminated.
Despite the global downturn, demand 
for upstream oil and gas equipment 
has remained robust and we continue 
to operate in a relatively high-cost 
environment which magnifies the 
financial impact of operational delays 
during drilling and other operations.
A number of our exploration licences 
are being held under appraisal and  
our continued interest in such blocks  
are contingent on establishing 
commerciality. A decision on the 
commerciality of Dhirubhai 33 gas 
discovery (GS-01) is anticipated  
this year.
With respect to Hardy’s Ganesha 
(CY-OS/2) non-associated natural gas 
discovery, the Company has presented 
a case to the Directorate General of 
Hydrocarbons for a licence extension. 
In the absence of a resolution in our 
favour in the near future, we intend to 
refer the dispute for sole expert or 
conciliation and arbitration.
Auditor’s Report
The auditors have provided an 
emphasis of matter comment in their 
audit report with reference to the 
uncertainty concerning the Group’s 
request for an extension of its 
exploration licence in block CY-OS/2 
as disclosed in notes 2 and 17 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Outlook
We continue to strive to create 
significant shareholder value by 
focusing on high impact exploration  
in India. The year 2010 should prove  
to be crucial in the realisation of our 
vision for Hardy. We expect to drill five 
further exploration wells in the Krishna 
Godavari Basin by the end of the first 
half of 2011, which will complete the 
phase one minimum work programmes 
for the D3 and D9 exploration blocks. 
Corporate
Having regard to the Company’s 
existing working capital position and 
its ability to raise potential financing, 
the Directors are of the opinion that 
the Group has adequate resources to 
enable it to undertake its planned work 
programme of exploration, appraisal 
and development activities over the 
next 12 months.
The Board remains committed to its 
India focused strategy. In the near 
term, Hardy’s Krishna Godavari Basin 
assets remain the primary focus of our 
exploration programme. The recent D3 
Dhirubhai 44 gas discovery in the 
Miocene has proven a substantial 
geological fairway. We view D3 with 
considerable optimism and believe 
that 2010 will be an important year  
in Hardy’s development. We remain 
optimistic about the potential of D9 
and look forward to re-commencing 
the exploration drilling programme. 
The Company is well positioned to  
see itself through its key exploration 
activities in 2010.

OVERVIEW 08
Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
“ In 2010, Hardy will focus on 
maintaining key relationships and 
enhancing its regional technical and 
operational expertise.”
 Yogeshwar Sharma, Chief Executive Officer
With an active exploration drilling programme and 
adequate cash reserves, the year 2010 should provide 
the Company with an enhanced understanding of the 
geology of the Krishna Godavari Basin and clarity on 
the future resource potential of Hardy’s promising D3 
and D9 exploration blocks. 
Execution of Strategy
The Company remains committed  
to its India focused strategy with  
a mandate of creating significant 
long-term shareholder value through 
the exploration and appraisal of its 
existing exploration portfolio. With the 
unprecedented volatility of the global 
economic landscape and mixed results 
from the exploration and development 
drilling, 2009 proved to be a 
challenging year on several fronts.
Given India’s robust economic growth 
and attractive upstream fiscal and 
regulatory regime, the Company 
continues to view India as an excellent 
investment opportunity for upstream 
oil and gas activity. In 2010, Hardy will 
focus on maintaining key relationships 
and enhancing its regional technical 
and operational expertise.
Exploration Highlights
The highlight of Hardy’s 2009 
exploration programme was the  
drilling of two deep water wells on the 
Company’s Krishna Godavari Basin 
blocks. The third successive discovery 
on the D3 block has re-enforced our 
expectations for this block and the 
Company anticipates the completion 
of the phase one exploration drilling 
programme, and the advancement of  
a comprehensive appraisal programme 
for the existing discoveries Dhirubhai 
39, 41 and 44, in 2010.
The first well on the Company’s D9 
block (KG-D9-A1) did not provide  
the anticipated results. In conjunction 
with the operator, Hardy is currently 
incorporating the data from this well  
to refine the next three exploration well 
locations on this block. We expect  
to provide an updated geological 
assessment of this block prior to the 
re-commencement of the 
drilling programme.
In 2009, Hardy completed two seismic 
acquisition programmes: 1,150 km
2
 of 
3D seismic data was acquired over the 
east portion of the D3 block and 390 
line km of 2D seismic data was 
acquired over the onshore Assam 
block. With the acquisition on  
D3, the Company now has 3D  
seismic coverage over the entire  
D3 concession.
The Company continued to work with 
the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural 
Gas and Directorate General of 
Hydrocarbons (‘DGH’) to confirm an 
extension of the CY-OS/2 block prior 
to commencement of the appraisal 
programme for Hardy’s Ganesha 
non-associated natural gas discovery.
In the absence of a resolution in our 
favour in the near future, Hardy intends 
to refer the dispute for sole expert or 
conciliation and arbitration.
Appraisal of the Dhirubhai 33 discovery 
(GS-01) continued in 2010 with further 
geological and geophysical studies.
Resource Potential
The Company has received third party 
reports by Gaffney Cline & Associates 
Ltd and RPS Energy, evaluating the 
reserves and resources of the Group’s 
assets. The general findings of these 
reports are summarised on pages 76 to 
80 of this report.
The full reports can be found on the 
Company’s website www.hardyoil.com.
Development and Production
During 2009, the Company’s oil 
production was 0.56 MMstb 
compared with 0.93 MMstb for 2008. 
The reduction was a result of a six 
month, unplanned, shut-in of the  
PY-3 field. The field re-commenced 
production in January 2010 at an initial 
gross rate of 3,336 stbd. For 2010, 
the PY-3 field is forecast to produce  
at an average rate of 3,000 stbd.
The drilling of an additional lateral  
well, via the re-entry of the producing 
PY-3-PD4 well was completed in 
February 2009. With the assistance  
of a nitrogen lift, the well flowed at 700 
stbd of oil with 30 per cent water-cut. 
However, the well could not be 
reactivated as a self flowing well.  
The well has been completed and 
suspended with a gas lift valve to allow 
for future oil production when gas lift 
compression facilities are installed on 
the floating-point unit (‘FPU’).
In 2009, the joint venture negotiated  
a one year contract extension to the 
PY-3 production facilities effective 
24 January 2010, at a 40 per cent 
reduction in day rate.
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement 09
Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
PY-3 joint venture partner approval  
to drill two more production wells is 
expected in the first half of 2010 with 
drilling to take place in the first half 
of 2011.
Financial Highlights
Revenue was down from $17.3 million 
in 2008 to $7.7 million in 2009 
principally due to an unplanned 
extended shut-in of the PY-3 field. 
Administrative expenses were down  
by 9 per cent compared to 2008, 
resulting in an operating loss of 
$8.1 million in 2009 compared with an 
operating loss of $1.7 million in 2008.
The Company started 2009 with cash 
reserves of $30.0 million. Net cash used 
in operating activities was $1.0 million. 
Cash used for investing activities 
amounted to $13.5 million in 2010  
for the drilling of PY3-PD4-RL, KGV- 
D3-S1, KGV-D3-G1, KG-D9-A1 wells 
and additional seismic on the D3 and 
Assam exploration blocks. An equity 
issue in April 2009 resulted in net 
proceeds of $15.4 million augmenting 
our working capital. As a result, the 
Company’s cash reserves at the end  
of 2009 were $30.5 million. The 
Company remains in a positive financial 
position and has no long-term debt.
Key Partnerships
Hardy continued to work closely  
with strategic partners in India. The 
Company interacts on a regular basis 
with its partners at multiple levels, to 
ensure that our goals and objectives 
are addressed and to facilitate 
planning of upcoming work 
programme schedules. Maintaining 
open and substantive relationships 
with existing partners and other key 
stakeholders in the India upstream  
oil and gas sector are critical to the 
execution of the Company’s strategy.
2010 Programme
As mentioned earlier, the third 
successive discovery on our D3 block 
has enhanced expectations as we 
anticipate the completion of the phase 
one exploration drilling programme 
through the drilling of three further 
exploration wells. As announced on 6 
April 2010 the Company has 
commenced drilling of the fifth 
exploration well on the D3 Block. The 
KGV-D3-W1 is targeting several high 
amplitude anomalies in the Pliocene 
and Miocene geological horizons. The 
well is approximately 20 km south east 
of the Dhirubhai 39 and 41 discoveries.
The timing of re-commencement  
of the D9 three well exploration drilling 
programme will be subject to the 
completion of ongoing data analysis 
and updating of the geological model. 
We anticipate drilling to re-commence 
in the second half of 2010 and 
continue into 2011. 
Hardy is enthusiastic about the balance 
of 2010, as it continues its efforts to 
de-risk the exploration portfolio in  
the Krishna Godavari Basin in India 
through further exploration drilling.  
Our disciplined capital allocation 
strategy will deliver activities that have 
the potential to result in a significant 
increase in shareholder value. Beyond 
the Company’s existing portfolio, the 
Company will continue to evaluate and 
assess potential acquisitions in India 
via its New Exploration Licence Policy 
(‘NELP’) bidding rounds and other 
conventional means that offer material 
value creation opportunities that will 
complement our existing assets and 
organisational competencies.
Staff
2009 was a challenging year for the 
Company and we would not have  
been able to see it through without  
the dedication of our staff in India, 
Nigeria and the United Kingdom.  
Our India team continues to drive  
the core of our business and we  
will look to continue to retain and 
enhance our technical, operational  
and management expertise in this 
region. In 2010 we look to our staff to 
perform at a high level in the execution 
of our 2010 work plan and beyond.  
I would like to take this opportunity  
to acknowledge their important 
contributions in the past year.

Review of Operations
The Company’s operations 
in India are conducted 
through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary Hardy 
Exploration & Production 
(India) Inc. (‘HEPI’). The 
Company’s operations in 
Nigeria are conducted 
through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary Hardy Oil 
Nigeria Limited (‘HON’).
2009 Performance
The highlight of 2009 was the 
KGV-D3-R1 gas discovery (Dhirubhai 
44) which is the third consecutive 
discovery on the Company’s D3 block. 
Overall 2009 was a challenging year 
for Hardy with drilling results in PY-3 
and D9 coming below expectations. 
The Company is now working hard to 
incorporate the well data to optimise 
selection of future exploration and 
development drilling locations on  
all of the Company’s blocks in India.
At the beginning of 2009 the 
Company planned to drill two 
exploration wells, one to two appraisal 
wells, one development well and 
acquire 1,150 km
2
 of 3D and 450 line 
km of 2D seismic data in India.
Through 2009, the Company has 
participated in the drilling of two 
exploration wells (KG-D9-A1 and KGV-
D3-R1), pre-drilled exploration well 
KGV-D3-G1, drilled the PY3-PD4-RL 
development well and acquired 1,150 
km
2
 of 3D seismic data on D3 and 390 
line km of 2D data on the Assam 
exploration block.
In Nigeria, the Company had planned to commence the tie-in of the Oza field and 
potentially re-enter and test the Atala-1 well. The Company now plans to initiate 
the installation of the pipeline for the Oza field in the second half of 2010. The 
timing of commencement of the Atala-1 re-entry will be subject to securing the 
appropriate drilling equipment, which remains a challenge for a number of 
marginal field operators in the Niger Delta.
The table below provides a brief comparison of our stated operational objectives 
for 2009 and our subsequent accomplishments through the year:

(Hardy 10 per cent interest)
2009 Operations
For the second year in a row the Company’s D3 block 
provided the highlight of Hardy’s exploration programme 
with the discovery of gas on the Company’s D3 block 
(Dhirubhai 44). The primary results of operations 
undertaken on this block in 2009 are listed below:
KGV-D3-R1: On 22 December 2009, the Company 
announced a third discovery on the D3 block (Dhirubhai 
44). The well KGV-D3-R1, was drilled in a water depth of 
1,982 m to a total measured depth of 4,113 m. Three 
reservoir zones were encountered at Miocene Level having 
gross thicknesses of 4, 23 and 16 m. The potential of these 
zones were evaluated through a wire-line based technology 
called Reservoir Characterisation Instrument (‘RCI’). The 
evaluation and incorporation of the data obtained from the 
D3 discoveries is ongoing.
KGV-D3-G1: Hardy commenced the drilling of a fourth 
exploration well KGV-D3-G1. Drilling was subsequently 
suspended after setting of 20" casing at 1,625 m total 
vertical depth (‘TVD’). The joint venture intends to re-enter 
the well at a later date to drill to 2,510 m sub-sea (‘ss’) and 
test prospective geological horizons.
The Company acquired a further 1,150 km
2
 of 3D seismic 
data in 2009. With the completion of this programme, the 
joint venture now has 3D seismic data coverage over the 
entire block. Additional interpretation and processing was 
completed on previously acquired data, including PSTM, 
PSDM and AVO/inversion studies.
In April 2010 the Company published a report by GCA 
assessing the reserves and resources of the Company’s 
India assets. With regard to the D3 block, GCA undertook 
to verify the identified leads and prospects on the block. 
The findings of this report are summarised on page 78 of 
this report. The full report can be downloaded from the 
Company’s website www.hardyoil.com.
Further to their report, dated May 2009, GCA noted 
‘Placing leads in a play context will facilitate ranking in terms 
in GCOS. GCA endorses this approach and postulates that 
additional leads to those currently identified by Hardy may 
be generated. This work is already in progress in Block D3 
and over the past year has resulted in the successful test of 
a Miocene play. In summary, the overall resource potential in 
Block D3 has therefore improved relative to GCA’s 
evaluation of 2009’.
2010 Outlook
Exploration: The joint venture is planning for the drilling of 
three further exploration wells by the end of 2010. The 
drilling of these exploration wells will meet the phase one 
minimum work programme commitments for the block.
Appraisal of Dhirubhai 39 and 41: In 2009, the D3 joint 
venture Operating Committee reviewed and approved an 
appraisal programme for the evaluation of the Dhirubhai 39 
and 41 gas discoveries. The proposed appraisal area 
comprises 750 km
2
 covering a large portion of the north 
west corner of the block. The appraisal programme 
provides for the initial undertaking of various geological, 
geophysical and development concept studies, following 
which two appraisal wells could be drilled by February 
2011. The joint venture is planning to complete an 
electromagnetic (‘EM’) survey prior to the drilling of  
appraisal wells.
Background
The D3 block encompasses an area of 3,288 km
2
 and is 
situated in the emerging world class Krishna Godavari 
Basin in India. It is in water depths ranging from 400 m  
to 2,200 m and is located approximately 45 km offshore. 
The block is operated by Reliance. 
The minimum work programme for phase one of the licence 
requires the drilling of six exploration wells. To date, three 
exploration wells have been drilled, one well has been 
pre-drilled and one is currently being drilled. In its technical 
evaluation report, GCA noted that the presence of an 
unconventional biogenic gas petroleum system in 
deepwater offshore India has been proven in the D3 block.

Block KG-DWN-2001/1 (D9): Exploration 
(Hardy 10 per cent interest)
2009 Operations
2009 marked the commencement of the drilling phase of 
the block’s exploration programme. There are three play 
types postulated to be present in the block: structural 
(anticlines – northern, central and southern); strati-
structural; and stratigraphic. The D9 joint venture has 
initially focused exploration efforts in the north west corner 
of the block covering an area of approximately 3,640 km
2
.
The first exploratory well in the D9 block, KG-D9-A1, was to 
evaluate the prospectivity of the Middle and Lower Miocene 
sands deposited in the lower slope regime in a distal toe 
thrust structural play in the central anticline.
Observations from A1 Well Data
In the interval 3,235–3,242 m from rotary table (‘RT’) ´ ●
from the Early Pliocene section, observed resistivity up  
to 30 ohms in the pilot hole where no samples could  
be collected.
In the interval of 3,500–3,650 m RT of Upper Miocene ´ ●
age, several thin sandstone and siltstone units having 
thickness of 1–3 m were encountered with a total gas > 
2 per cent with mostly C1 component. The maximum 
resistivity of up to 3 ohms was observed in the interval 
3,510–3,515 m RT with total gas of 1 per cent.
The first target in the Middle Miocene level encountered ´ ●
siltstone in the interval 4,160–4,185 m RT and 4,370–
4,500 m RT with low resistivities and insignificant 
gas shows.
The deeper target in the Lower Miocene section ´ ●
encountered limestone in the interval 4,695–4,710 m  
RT contrary to the expected (prognosed) coarse clastic. 
No significant gas shows were observed in this interval.
Inference from A1 Well Results
In the Upper Miocene, the KG-D9-A1 well encountered ´ ●
several thin sandstone units with good gas shows (C1 
dominant) suggesting the possibility of a biogenic 
source. Studies are being conducted to identify the likely  
thick reservoir prone areas based on the detailed 
sedimentological studies of KG-D9-A1 well cores  
and cuttings, and D6 block subsurface data. These 
reservoirs are likely to be on the flanks of anticlines  
in the mini-basin set up.
In the Middle Miocene, the KG-D9-A1 well encountered ´ ●
siltstone with low resistivity and insignificant gas shows. 
This zone needs to be thoroughly re-evaluated to identify 
the probable reservoir entry directions.
Tight limestone was encountered in the Lower Miocene ´ ●
level in the well. The data suggests this limestone 
package was transported from the shelf area to the north 
through a slope channel system. This will be confirmed 
by side wall core and cutting sample analysis data.
The remaining prospectivity of all the anticlinal closures ´ ●
(north and central) cannot be ruled out because 
presence of effective reservoirs and biogenic source will 
make them viable targets.
The KG-D9-A1 well drilled into the Lower Miocene ´ ●
section did not penetrate the Cretaceous and 
Palaeocene sections thus their prospectivity  
remains unchanged.
2010 Outlook
The data obtained from the KG-D9-A1 well is currently 
being integrated with the existing geological model to 
enhance the understanding of the geology and petroleum 
systems within the block before drilling subsequent wells. 
Some specific activities planned for 2010 are listed below:
complete sedimentological and palaeontological studies ´ ●
of the side wall cores and drill cuttings to understand the 
presence of limestone in the block;
carry out inversion studies of the 3D seismic based on ´ ●
the new data from the A1 well and nearby D6 block data 
to identify the reservoirs; and
refine the geochemical model for understanding the ´ ●
source rock potential.
The D9 block’s exploration drilling programme is expected 
to re-commence in the second half of 2010.
Background
The licence encompasses 11,605 km
2
 in the Bay of Bengal 
where water depths vary from 2,300 m to 3,100 m. The joint 
venture has acquired over 4,188 km
2
 of 3D seismic data.
Regarding the status of the D9 block, the operator 
submitted a proposal requesting the grant of a drilling 
moratorium for three years from January 2008 to December 
2010 on the basis that the operator has not been able to 
complete the minimum work obligations of exploratory 
drilling in view of non-availability of suitable deep water rigs 
in the international market. Similar proposals were also 
submitted by other operators including the national oil 
company ONGC and AOGO. The proposal is under active 
consideration by the GOI. Should the Drilling Moratorium 
not be granted, there are provisions for availing extension of 
the phase one period based on statutory delays and the 
other allowable extensions as per a DGH extension policy.

2009 Operations
The GS-01 joint venture continued various geological  
and geophysical studies in relation to the appraisal of the 
GS01-B1 gas and condensate discovery (Dhirubhai 33). 
The licence is currently active under an adopted appraisal 
programme. The appraisal area comprises 5,890 km
2
 with  
a term through to May 2010.
2010 Outlook
The GS-01 joint venture will take a decision on the 
commerciability of the Dhirubhai 33 gas discovery prior to 
the end of the first half of 2010.
Background
The GS-01 exploration licence is located in the Gujarat-
Saurashtra offshore basin off the west coast of India, north 
west of the prolific Bombay High Oil Field. The original 
licence encompassed 8,841 km
2
 (5,890 km
2
 post 
relinquishment) and water depths vary between 80 m  
and 150 m. 
The joint venture has previously acquired 2,216 km
2
 of 3D 
seismic data. As announced on 15 May 2007, the Dhirubhai 
33 discovery (GS01-B1) flow-tested at a rate of 18.6 
MMscfd gas with 415 stbd of condensate through a 56/64" 
choke at flowing tubing head pressure of 1,346 psi. Upon 
completion of phase one of the exploration programme the 
joint venture elected not to proceed to the second phase  
of exploration.
Block AS-ONN-2000/1 (Assam): Exploration 
(Hardy 10 per cent interest)
2009 Operations
In 2009 the Company acquired 390 line km of 2D data.  
The majority of the exploration block’s phase one minimum 
work programme has now been completed. GCA’s 
technical evaluation report noted that they consider ‘the 
Assam opportunity as a challenging, potentially attractive 
play extension and possible new play(s) opportunity with 
neighbouring oil discoveries in the sub-regional context’.
2010 Outlook
Further field operations will be based on the results and 
interpretation of the 2D data and other ongoing geological 
studies. Drilling will be planned with the commencement of 
phase two in 2011.
Background
The AS-ONN-2000/1 exploration licence is located in  
the north eastern state of Assam, India and north of the 
Brahmaputra River. The exploration licence covers an area 
of 5,754 km
2
 and falls within the districts of Darrang and 
Sonitpur. The block is in phase one of a three phase 
exploration licence. Phase one (three years) will expire in 
January 2011.
The topography of the area is primarily a plain of low  
relief and there is a reasonably established road network 
across the block. A national highway runs parallel to the 
Brahmaputra River and passes through the block. Different 
play types expected are structural (anticlinal and fault 
closures), stratigraphic (pinchout/wedgeout) within 
Palaeocene-Eocene and Gondwana packages and 
unconventional fractured/weathered basement.

2009 Production
Gross average daily field production for the year ended 31 
December 2009 was 1,535 stbd (2008: 2,550 stbd). The 
production facilities’ uptime performance was 51 per cent 
(2008: 88.2 per cent). The decrease in production was the 
result of an extended shut-in to repair the field’s offshore 
mooring facility. Adverse marine conditions compounded 
the time taken to finish the repairs. The field recommenced 
production on 24 January 2010 at a rate of 3,336 stbd.
In 2009 the joint venture extended the contract of the PY-3 
field’s production facility for one year up to 24 January 2011. 
The new contract provides for a 40 per cent reduction from 
the previously contracted rate.
Gross average daily production for February 2010 was 
3,450 stbd. Currently the field is producing at a gross rate 
of 3,400 stbd. We anticipate that the PY-3 field will average 
gross daily production of 3,000 stbd for 2010.
2009 Operations
In February 2009, the Company completed the re-entry and 
drilling of an extended lateral section in the PY3-PD4-RL 
well. With the assistance of nitrogen lift, the well flowed at 
700 stbd of oil with 30 per cent water-cut. However, the 
well was unable to be re-activated as a self flowing well. The 
well has been completed as a producer with a gas lift valve 
to allow for future production when gas lift compression 
facilities are installed on the FPU.
Hardy has subsequently revised its geological and reservoir 
simulation models to incorporate new data gathered from 
the PY3-PD4-RL well. The revised model will be used to 
plan future in-fill drilling and production facility requirements.
2010 Outlook
The Company expects gross daily production of the PY-3 
field to average 3,000 stbd in 2010. The PY-3 field joint 
venture’s Technical Committee has recommended the 
drilling of two additional lateral wells and various facility 
upgrades including gas compression for gas lift and sales 
gas. Drilling of these wells is expected to commence by the 
first quarter of 2011 and additional production from the 
wells is expected to commence in the second half of 2011.
Background
The PY-3 field is located off the east coast of India 80 km 
south of Pondicherry in water depths of between 40 m  
and 450 m. The Cauvery Basin was developed in the late 
Jurassic/early Cretaceous period and straddles the 
present-day east coast of India. The licence, which covers 
81 km
2
, produces high quality light crude oil (49° API).
The field was developed using floating production facilities 
and subsea wellheads, a first for an offshore field in India. 
The facility at PY-3 consists of the floating production unit, 
‘Tahara’, and a 65,000 DWT tanker, ‘Endeavor’, which acts as 
a floating storage and offloading unit. There are four sub-sea 
wells tied back to Tahara. Tahara has a three-stage crude oil 
separation system, with the first two stages being three-
phase separators and the third stage a two-phase separator.
Liquid processing capacity on Tahara is 20,000 stbd with 
17 MMscfd of gas handling capacity. The field currently 
produces associated gas in the range of 3.5 MMscfd. This 
produced gas is used as fuel gas with excess gas being 
flared. The stabilised crude oil is pumped from Tahara to 
Endeavor for storage and offloading to shuttle tankers. 
Crude oil from the PY-3 field is sold to CPCL at its refinery in 
Nagapattinam, approximately 70 km south of the PY-3 field.
Block CY-OS/2: Exploration 
(Hardy 75 per cent interest – Operator)
2009 Operations
In 2009 the joint venture applied to the Ministry of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas of the GOI to establish 
commerciality of the Ganesha gas discovery during  
an appraisal period ending January 2012 as provided  
for in the production sharing contract (‘PSC’).
On 20 February 2009 HEPI received a communication from 
DGH to establish commerciality within 15 days or relinquish 
the block. We believe that this action was taken by DGH  
on the assumption that the Ganesha discovery was an oil 
discovery. As Ganesha is a non-associated gas discovery, 
the CY-OS/2 PSC provides for an appraisal programme  
to establish commerciality by January 2012. Hardy has 
subsequently presented a case to the DGH that supports 
its claim that the CY-OS/2 joint venture is entitled to a 
licence extension as the result of a non-associated gas 
discovery. In the absence of a resolution in our favour in the 
near future, the Group intends to refer the dispute for sole 
expert or conciliation and arbitration.

2010 Outlook
Should the joint venture receive confirmation of the extension 
period in a timely manner, Hardy will undertake the activities 
necessary to fully appraise the Ganesha discovery. It is 
unlikely that an appraisal well will be drilled in 2010.
Background
Licence block CY-OS/2 is located in the northern part of 
the Cauvery Basin immediately offshore from Pondicherry 
and covers approximately 859 km
2
. The CY-OS/2 licence 
comprises two retained areas. The northern area includes 
the Fan A-1 discovery and the southern area lies 
immediately adjacent to the HEPI operated PY-3 field. The 
PY-1 gas field, a separate ring-fenced licence, lies within the 
southern part of the acreage and commenced production in 
the third quarter of 2009.
Ganesha: On 8 January 2007 the Company announced 
that the Fan A-1 exploration well had discovered hydrocarbons. 
In August 2007 the Company announced that it would proceed 
to the appraisal phase of the Ganesha non-associated gas 
discovery to establish the potential commerciality.
Block Oza (Within OML 11): Development 
(Hardy 20 per cent interest)
2009 Operations
The Oza joint venture has made some progress in 2009. 
The joint venture received delivery of over 34 km length of 
pipe for the tie-in of the Oza field to the SPDC operated 
Isimiri flow station. The operator is in advanced stages of 
completing the final FEED study and other regulatory and 
community approvals. Field operations are expected to 
commence in the first half of 2010.
Background
The Oza Field is located onshore in the north western  
part of OML 11, near Port Harcourt and covers an area of 
20 km
2
. The Oza field is subject to a farm-out agreement 
between NNPC, SPDC, Elf Petroleum Nigeria Limited and 
AGIP as farmor and Millenium as farmee. The terms of this 
agreement are for an initial five-year period subject to an 
extension of the Oza farm-out agreement approved by the 
Nigerian Department of Petroleum Resources (‘DPR’). 
The Oza field has cumulatively produced approximately 
1.0 MMstb from four open zones in three wells targeting 
three reservoirs, M5.0, M1.0 and M2.2, with the principal 
reservoir being M5.0. At present, Oza has three suspended 
wells in the field. In 2007 the Oza joint venture successfully 
executed a flow test of the Oza 4 well. The flow rates 
averaged approximately 600 stbd of oil with a gas to  
oil ration (‘GOR’) of 5,466 scf/stb.
Block Atala (Within OML 46): Development 
(Hardy 20 per cent interest)
2009 Operations
In 2009, the Atala joint venture continued to struggle to 
secure the appropriate equipment to undertake the planned 
re-entry programme for the Atala-1 well.
The original marginal field award was subject to review  
in November 2009. Extension of the Atala licence is 
contingent on the Nigerian authorities believing that 
sufficient progress has been made over the initial term  
to merit an extension. As such, the Operator, along with a 
consortium of other Niger Delta marginal field operators, 
has requested an extension due to equipment constraints 
and various other circumstances that have frustrated 
efficient progress of work programmes over the initial term.
Background
Atala is located within OML 46 which is situated within a 
mangrove swamp on the Dodo River, a coastal area of north 
west Bayelsa State. The concession area is 34 km
2
. The 
Atala field was discovered in 1982 with the drilling of the 
Atala-1 well to a total depth of 4,058 m. Hydrocarbons were 
encountered and the well was cased but not tested or 
completed. The Atala field is subject to a farm-out agreement 
between NNPC, SPDC, Elf Petroleum Nigeria Limited and

Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
“ The Company’s cash and short-term 
investments remained essentially 
unchanged at $30.5 million at the  
end of 2009.”
 Dinesh Dattani, Finance Director
During 2009, the Company had an unplanned extended 
shut-in of the PY-3 field which had a significant impact 
on its financial performance. The absence of 
production in the second half of 2009 and lower oil 
prices resulted in a substantial reduction in revenue. 
As a result, the Company has recorded a loss for 2009. 
In April 2009, the Company successfully placed 
6,208,997 Ordinary Shares for net proceeds of $15.2 
million. Hardy completed the year with cash and short-
term investments of approximately $30.5 million and 
no long-term debt.

Financial Review
Production, Sales and Revenue
The Company operates the PY-3 field 
in the Cauvery Basin with an 18 per 
cent participating interest. Gross 
average daily field production for the 
year ended 31 December 2009 
amounted to 1,535 stbd compared 
with 2,542 stbd for 2008. The 
decrease in production is due to an 
unplanned six month shut-in of the 
field to undertake repair of the offshore 
facilities. Hardy profit oil liability to the 
Government of India (‘GOI’) was nil in 
2009 compared to $2.3 million in 
2008. The Company does not 
anticipate the payment of profit oil to 
the GOI in 2010 due to substantial 
unrecovered costs.
Revenue from oil sales (after profit oil) 
decreased from $16.4 million in 2008 
to $7.7 million in 2009. The average 
price realised per barrel decreased 
significantly from $104.44 during 
2008 to $52.96 in 2009. Average 
daily sales amounted to 398 stbd 
compared with 491 stbd reflecting 
lower production volumes from the 
extended shut-in and partially offset by 
the sale of inventory during the year.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for 2009 decreased 
from $9.2 million in 2008 to $5.7 
million in 2009. This reflects the fact 
that lease charges for the production 
and storage facilities were not incurred 
during the PY-3 field shut-in period. 
The contract for the floating 
processing and storage systems has 
been re-negotiated effective January 
2010 for a period of one year at a 
substantially reduced day rate.  Cash and Short-term Investments ($ million)

Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased from 
$8.1 million in 2008 to $0.8 million in 
2009. The decrease arises principally 
from lower revenues as a result of a 
significant reduction in oil sales and 
significantly lower average crude oil 
price in 2009. 
Administrative Expenses
Administrative expenses decreased 
from $9.8 million in 2008 to $9.0 
million in 2009. The decrease 
principally results from exchange gains 
of $0.7 million in 2009 compared with 
an exchange loss of $1.3 million 
recorded in 2008, offset by additional 
costs associated with the drilling of 
PY3-PD4-RL well in early 2009 of 
$1.0 million.
Operating Loss
The Company is reporting an 
operating loss of $8.1 million in 2009 
compared with $1.7 million in 2008. 
The increase in loss principally results 
from the shut-down of the PY-3 field in 
the last half of 2009 coupled with 
lower oil prices.
Interest and Investment Income
Investment and other income in 2009 
amounted to $0.3 million compared 
with $1.3 million in 2008. The decline 
is primarily attributable to significantly 
lower interest rates obtained on cash 
and short-term investments in 2009 
compared to 2008. The lower realised 
interest rates are systematic with 
unprecedented reductions in UK and 
US central bank rates.
Finance Costs
Finance costs principally include the 
cost of providing bank guarantees to 
the GOI required by the provisions of 
production sharing contracts and are 
based on the agreed annual work 
programme on blocks in India.
Loss Before Taxation
The Company recorded a loss before 
taxation of $7.9 million compared to a 
profit before taxation of $12.4 million 
in 2008. During 2008, the Company 
recorded a realised pre-tax gain on 
investment of $12.9 million arising  
on the liquidation of its holding in 
Hindustan Oil Exploration Company 
Limited (‘HOEC’).
Taxation
During 2009, the Company did  
not incur any current tax liability as a 
result of losses. During 2008, the 
Company’s current tax liability was 
$1.6 million comprising of $0.8 million 
in connection with minimum alternate 
tax in India and tax on short-term 
capital gains of $0.8 million on sale  
of investments in India. 
Tax relief, as a percentage of pre-tax 
loss amounted to 17.9 per cent in 
2009 compared to a tax charge of 
39.9 per cent in 2008. The lower rate 
for tax relief results from no tax relief 
reflected for Nigeria losses, and the 
impact of the non-deductibility of  
a substantial part of share-based 
payments. The higher rate reflected in 
2008 resulted from the above factors 
as well as current tax on short-term 
capital gains of $0.8 million on 
investment gain.
Net Profit
Net profit declined from $7.5 million  
in 2008 to a net loss of $6.5 million  
in 2009.
Cash Flow from  
Operating Activities
The Company’s cash flow used in 
operating activities, before changes in 
non-cash working capital, amounted to 
$4.1 million in 2009. This compares 
with cash flow from operations of 
$1.6 million for 2008. The decline 
principally results from reduced oil 
sales volumes and related prices in 
2009 compared to 2008.
After non-cash working capital 
changes, cash used in operating 
activities amounted to $1.0 million in 
2009, compared to cash generated 
from operations of $2.1 million.
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure amounted to 
$13.6 million during 2009, compared 
to $31.7 million incurred during 2008. 
Capital expenditure amounting to $2.9 
million was incurred on the PY-3 block 
with the drilling of PY3-PD4-RL. 
Approximately $5.2 million was 
incurred in the drilling of two 
exploration wells, pre-drilling of one 
well, and a 3D seismic programme on 
the D3 block in the Krishna Godavari 
Basin. Approximately $3.6 million of 
expenditures are attributable to the 
drilling of one well on the D9 block.  
As part of the Dhirubhai 31 (GS-01) 
appraisal programme, the Company 
incurred $0.4 million on the GS-01 
block, on a number of geological  
and geophysical studies including 
reprocessing of the 3D seismic  
data covering the block. In addition, 
$1.2 million was spent on the 
acquisition of 2D seismic on the 
Company’s onshore Assam block.

Site Restoration Deposit
This represents the deposit for site 
restoration for future site restoration 
expenses for the PY-3 field. In 2009, 
the Company increased the site 
restoration deposit by $0.4 million  
to $3.4 million.
Financing Activities
During April 2009, the Company 
completed a placing of 6,208,997 
Ordinary Shares at a price of £1.74  
per share resulting in net proceeds 
from the equity issue of $15.2 million 
that was added to the Company’s 
cash resources.
Cash and Short-term Investments
The Company’s cash and short-term 
investments remained essentially 
unchanged at $30.5 million at the  
end of 2009. The Company’s capital 
expenditures were principally funded 
by proceeds from a placing during 
2009. At the end of 2009, the 
Company had $19.9 million and $0.6 
million in US dollar and UK Sterling 
liquidity funds at HSBC with average 
underlying maturity of 43 days and  
34 days respectively. The Company 
does not have any long-term debt.
Summary Balance Sheet
Hardy’s non-current assets have 
increased from $135.8 million at the 
end of 2008 to $148.4 million at the 
end of 2009. This resulted largely from 
the exploration and development 
capital expenditure programme, 
principally the drilling of wells and 
seismic acquisition on PY-3, D3, D9, 
GS-01 and Assam blocks. Current 
assets represent the Group’s cash 
and short-term investments, trade and 
other receivables and inventory. At the 
end of 2009, of the $36.8 million of 
current assets, $30.5 million are 
represented by cash and short-term 
investments.
Current liabilities are principally trade 
and other accounts payable. The level 
of current liabilities is $15.4 million at 
the end of 2009 compared with $13.8 
million in 2008, reflecting the impact 
of the drilling operations on the 
KGV-D3-R1 well on the D3 block that 
finished in the last weeks of 2009.
During 2009, the Company issued 
$15.2 million of equity and 
consequently, the Company’s net 
assets increased to $155.5 million at 
the end of 2009 from $144.2 million  
at the end of 2008.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has successfully raised 
financing in the past to provide funding 
for its ongoing exploration and 
development programmes and to 
augment its working capital. Having 
regard to Hardy’s existing working 
capital position and its ability to raise 
potential financing the directors are  
of the opinion that the Company  
has adequate resources to enable  
it to undertake its planned work 
programme of exploration, appraisal 
and development activities over the 
next 12 months.
Dividends
The Company has limited internally 
generated cash flows and has a 
planned capital expenditure 
programme. In the circumstances, the 
directors have chosen to reinvest cash 
flows and do not recommend the 
payment of a dividend in the 
foreseeable future. 
Risk Factors
Hardy is in the international upstream 
oil and gas business which faces a 
variety of strategic, operational, 
financial and external risks. Under 
these distinct classes, the Company 
has identified certain risks pertinent  
to its business including: exploration 
and reserve risks; loss of key human 
resources; drilling and operating risks; 
security risk in area of operations, 
costs and availability of materials and 
services; economic and sovereign 
risks, market risk, foreign currency risk, 
loss of or changes to production 
sharing or concession agreements, 
joint venture or related agreements; 
and volatility of future oil and gas prices.
Effective risk management is critical to 
achieving our strategic objectives and 
protecting our assets, personnel and 
reputation. Hardy manages its risks 
through compliance with the terms  
of its agreements and application of 
appropriate policies and procedures, 
and through the recruitment and 
retention of skilled individuals 
throughout the organisation. Further, 
the Company has focused its activities 
mainly in known hydrocarbon basins  
in jurisdictions that have previously 
established long-term oil and gas 
ventures with foreign oil and gas 
companies, existing infrastructure of 
services and oil and gas transportation 
facilities, and reasonable proximity 
to markets.

Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
A summary of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Company and 
the way in which these risks are 
mitigated is provided under: ‘Risks and 
Uncertainties’ section of this report.
Key Financial Risks
In addition to the global financial risks 
described above, the Company is 
subject to the following specific 
financial risks.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The proceeds of the Group’s domestic 
oil and gas sales in India are received 
in US dollars. The majority of the 
Group’s expenditure requirements are 
in US dollars. The Group has general 
and administrative expenditure with 
respect to offices in India, United 
Kingdom, and Nigeria; therefore the 
Group is exposed to foreign exchange 
risk against Indian rupees, UK sterling 
and Nigerian naira.
The Company has raised equity capital 
in the past and has received proceeds 
in UK sterling. The Company generally 
keeps funds in sterling to meet 
ongoing requirements for the 
foreseeable future. Any surplus 
sterling funds are converted into US 
dollars. Funds are converted into other 
currencies as and when required.
Liquidity Risk
The Group’s cash requirements and 
cash reserves are projected for the 
Group as a whole and for each 
country in which operations are 
conducted. Whereas the Group 
currently has no debt, going forward 
the Group expects to meet these 
requirements through an appropriate 
mix of available cash, equity funds and 
debt financing. The Group further 
mitigates liquidity risk by seeking 
funds well in advance of requirements 
and by maintaining an insurance 
programme to minimise exposure to 
insurable losses. 
Commodity Price Risk
Historically, oil prices have fluctuated 
widely and are affected by numerous 
factors over which the Group has no 
control, including world production 
levels, international economic  
trends, exchange rate fluctuations, 
expectations for inflation, speculative 
activity, consumption patterns and 
global or regional political events. The 
aggregate effect of these factors is 
impossible to predict. The production 
estimates for PY-3 and the oil prices 
will vary depending upon market 
conditions, which are not within the 
control of the Group. The Group’s 
production in India sold to CPCL is 
based on the 30 day average (14 day 
prior and 15 day after crude delivery) 
of Brent Crude less $0.35. The Board 
has no immediate intention to enter 
into fixed price, long-term marketing 
contracts. Pricing for production from 
future development assets in Nigeria 
has not been arranged. Although oil 
prices may fluctuate widely, it is the 
Group’s present policy not to hedge 
crude oil sales.
Status of CY-OS/2 Discovery 
Block
The auditors have provided an 
emphasis of matter comment in their 
audit report with reference to the 
uncertainty concerning the Group’s 
request for an extension of its 
exploration licence in block CY-OS/2 
as disclosed in notes 2 and 17 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s Chairman’s 
Statement, Chief Executive Officer’s 
Statement, Review of Operations, 
Financial Review, and Risks and 
Uncertainties have been prepared  
to substantially comply with the 
Accounting Standards Board

Risks and Uncertainties
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
As an oil and gas exploration and production company with 
operations concentrated in India, Hardy is subject to a 
variety of business risks. Outlined below is a description  
of the principal risk factors that may affect the Group’s 
business. Such risk factors are not presented in any 
assumed order of priority.
Any of the risks, as well as the other risks and uncertainties 
discussed in this document, could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group business. In addition, the risks set  
out below may not be exhaustive and additional risks  
and uncertainties, not presently known to the Company,  
or which the Company currently deems immaterial, may 
arise or become material in the future. In particular, the 
Company’s performance might be affected by changes in 
market and/or economic conditions and in legal, regulatory 
and tax requirements.
General Exploration, Development and Production Risks
The Group’s strategy is predominantly driven by the 
exploration, exploitation, appraisal, development and 
production of its existing assets. There are risks inherent  
in the exploration, exploitation, appraisal, development and 
production of oil and gas reserves and resources. Whilst 
the rewards can be substantial, there is no guarantee that 
exploration will lead to commercial discoveries. Risks such 
as cost overruns in drilling, delays in execution, technical 
difficulties, lack of access to key infrastructure, adverse 
weather conditions, environmental hazards, industrial 
accidents, occupational and health hazards, technical 
failures, labour disputes, unusual or unexpected geological 
formations, explosions and other acts of God are inherent  
to the business. Although in some cases these represent 
insurable risks, the Group may also become subject to other 
hazards (including pollution and oil seepage liability) against 
which it is not insured or is under-insured. The occurrence 
of any of these incidents can result in the Group’s current or 
future project target dates for drilling or production being 
delayed or interrupted, increased capital expenditure and 
production costs and liability to the contractor or operator 
of the field.
Key Risks for 2010
Several of the Group’s blocks have been retained via 
appraisal and are no longer in the exploration phase. In the 
event that the joint venture concludes that a discovery is 
sub-commercial then the corresponding block may be 
relinquished. Upon relinquishment the Group will no longer 
retain a commercial interest in the block. Relinquishment 
may result in the Group values on the balance sheet being 
revised downward.
With respect to the Group’s Ganesha (CY-OS/2) non-
associated natural gas discovery, HEPI has presented a 
case to the DGH that supports its claim of entitlement to a 
licence extension. In the absence of a resolution in Hardy’s 
favour, in the near future, Hardy intends to refer the dispute 
for sole expert determination, conciliation or arbitration.
The Group’s exploration plans comprise activities primarily 
on non-operated blocks. Subsequently the timing of 
execution of activities may not commence as currently 
forecasted. The exploration focus of the Group’s 2009  
work programme may result in the failure to discover 
hydrocarbons in commercial quantities.
The status of several of the Group’s licences are either 
approaching or have exceeded the contracted term. These 
licences can be extended through various government 
approvals but there is no certainty that these extensions will 
be granted. Should an extension not be received then the 
Group will no longer have a commercial interest in the 
blocks and may be subject to non-performance penalties.
The Group holds a 75 per cent participating interest  
in the block CY-OS/2 which is offshore on the south east 
coast of India. Intangible assets include an amount of  
$83,469,418 with respect to exploration expenditures  
on the block wherein a gas discovery was announced  
on 8 January 2007. The exploration period for the block 
ended on 23 March 2007 and the GOI has been requested 
to extend the block for appraisal and declaration of 
commerciality for its gas discovery until 7 January 2012.
Provisions of the PSC provide for an appraisal period of 60 
months from the date of discovery. For an oil discovery, this 
period is limited to 24 months. DGH has informed HEPI that 
in their opinion the discovery is classified as an oil discovery 
and not a NANG discovery.
The Company has obtained third party legal and technical 
opinions that support the Company’s view that the 
discovery is NANG. The Group continues to be in an 
ongoing dialogue with the GOI and believes that it  
will be successful in obtaining the extension of its licence  
in block CY-OS/2 until 7 January 2012. In the absence of a 
resolution in its favour in the near future, Hardy intends to 
refer the dispute for sole expert determination, conciliation 
or arbitration.
In the event that HEPI’s application for an extension of the 
CY-OS/2 licence was to be unsuccessful, the capitalised 
expenditure will be subject to impairment testing.
The Group’s India licences have been granted under various 
rounds in the NELP programme, which includes various 
fiscal and contractual terms including an income tax  
holiday for seven years from commencement of commercial 
production of mineral oil. The Group believes the definition 
of ‘mineral oil’ includes natural gas entitling the Group  
to a seven year tax holiday on profits from natural gas 
operations. However, the Income Tax Department has 
interpreted the definition of ‘mineral oil’ narrowly and  
has taken the position of excluding natural gas from the 
definition. Other operators with natural gas operations have 
disputed the position and the matter is before the courts in 
India. If the courts ultimately rule in favour of the Income Tax 
Department, the Group may not be able to claim a seven 
year holiday on natural gas operations in the future. The 
Group does not currently sell any natural gas. Hardy Oil and Gas plc

Clear Risk Identification
The table below sets out the general long-term risks facing 
Hardy, their potential impact and mitigation strategies 
developed. Risks are grouped into four main categories: 
strategic; financial; operational; and external. Effective risk 
management is critical to achieving our strategic objectives 
and protecting our people and reputation. Hardy manages  
 
and mitigates its risks by maintaining a balanced portfolio, 
through compliance with the terms of its licences and 
application of policies and procedures appropriate for an 
international oil and gas company of its size and scale and 
through the recruitment and retention of skilled personnel 
throughout its business.
Risk category Mitigation
Strategic risk Ineffective or poorly executed strategy fails to create shareholder value
Ineffective mix of oil and  
gas interests
Geographical focus on single region (India) with interests in several autonomous 
sedimentary basins comprising interests in different geographical regions.
Organic and acquisition-led  
growth
Regular review of capital investment programmes and limiting allocation to high 
impact exploration. Board approval required for all annual exploration programmes, 
acquisitions and divestitures.
Inefficient capital allocation Comprehensive annual budgeting process covering all material expenditures.  
Annual budgets approved by the Board.
Ineffective management processes Policies and procedures appropriate for an exploration and production company of 
Hardy’s scale and size.
Loss of key staff/succession  
planning
Remuneration policies to attract and retain staff (employee stock options, annual 
review, etc), and specific development and training policies implemented.
 
Financial risk Assets performance and excessive leverage results in the Group unable to 
meet its financial obligations
Industry cost inflation Asset joint operating agreement mandates rigorous contracting procedures  
with competitive tendering. Inflationary pressures will persist in high commodity  
price environment.
Capital structure Conservative approach to debt/equity financing of development projects. Exploration 
and appraisal activities strictly equity financed.
Uninsured events Comprehensive insurance programme.
Under performing assets Conservative forecasting in the budgeting process. Development of the additional 
field’s (Oza) to reduce dependence on PY-3.
Cost overrun Main capital expenditures incurred via drilling offshore exploration wells. Lower 
working interest and maintaining strong working capital position mitigates against 
operations exceeding budgeted number of drilling days.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Hardy is committed to applying the high ethical standards 
necessary to maintain our reputation as an employer and 
operator of choice. To deliver this goal, our investment and 
operational decisions take appropriate account of the 
social, health, safety and environmental impacts that may 
arise during our activities.
Based on mutual respect and understanding, the Group 
strives to build and maintain enduring relationships with the 
GOI, local authorities, partners, suppliers and business 
associates. Respecting the rich cultural diversity of the 
regions in which we engage in business, the Group strives 
to minimise our impact on the environment, taking into 
consideration the unique requirements of the region and 
local working practices to achieve optimum performance 
and timely delivery of projects. 
Corporate social responsibility is a fundamental part of 
implementing the Group’s corporate strategy and has both 
practical and ethical dimensions. It includes managing 
business concerns, such as risk; enhancing reputation in 
conjunction with investing in the community, and creating  
a place where people feel good about working. 
The Group contributes to community and social 
development by carrying out its business activities in such a 
manner that provide energy and infrastructure, employment, 
skills development and trade to the areas in which the 
Group operates. The Group will consider monetary and 
human resource contributions to local social programmes 
which the Company deems contribute or improve the overall 
well being of the communities in which we operate.
In 2009 the Company made cash donations to several 
charities in India and Nigeria. Hardy has consistently 
supported a Rotary International (District 3150) programme 
focused on increasing access to fresh water for agriculture 
and consumption in underdeveloped areas of southern India.
Health, Safety and Environment Activities
The Board has tailored the Group’s health, safety and 
environment (‘HSE’) policy and management system taking 
reference from world class operations to suit Indian 
conditions. Safety, security and emergency procedures 
have been incorporated into the weave of the Group’s 
operations. The central HSE Committee and Environment 
Management Committees meet on a monthly basis to 
assess and monitor compliance. The Group regularly 
undertakes internal and external HSE audits, including 
pre-mobilisation HSE audit of rigs and vessels. The Group 
undertakes periodical environmental marine monitoring 
around production facilities and around the drilling 
locations. Prompt compliance with applicable regulations  
by the Group has been recognised by concerned agencies.
All statutory requirements and certification for the operating 
facilities at PY-3 field were maintained. Compliance to 
ministerial and regulatory bodies such as DGH, MOEF, 
DGMS, ODAG, Coast Guard, Navy and others are maintained 
by forwarding necessary reports as required. Hardy 
participates in several meetings convened by these agencies. 
Senior officials from these agencies also visited our offshore 
facilities and appreciate our HSE management system.
The CHSE Committee, the Company’s apex body on HSE 
activities, meets every month and reviews the HSE plans, 
activities, accidents/incidents pertaining to the month. 
Representatives from contractors are also invited for these 
meetings. Regular HSE audits, drills and emergency 
exercises are carried out in all facilities offshore.
2009 HSE Performance
There were no lost time accidents (‘LTA’) during the year. 
The PY-3 floating production unit, Tahara, has operated for 
almost two years without an LTA. During the year the 
offshore drilling rig ‘Actinia’ from Transocean was at PY-3 
field and performed safe operations during the re-entry  
of the PY3-PD4-RL well and drilled a lateral well. The 
Company is pleased to report that there was no LTA during 
the operation. There were no field operations undertaken in 
Nigeria thorough 2009.

Environmental Impact Policy and Performance
Offshore petroleum operations interact with marine 
environment which can lead to short-term and long-term 
physical, chemical and biological changes to the area.
Marine
As a part of the commitment for environmental protection 
and towards compliance to the conditions imposed by 
Ministry of Environment and Forests, Hardy has been 
regularly carrying out an environmental marine monitoring 
programme to assess the quality of the marine environment 
since 1998. A marine environmental survey was carried out 
in 2008 by Onshore & Offshore Environmental Consultants 
in collaboration with the Advanced Centre for Marine 
Biology, Annamalai University during the month of July 
2008. This has been accomplished through implementation 
of adequate preventive and control measures.
Based on the detailed study and factors highlighted above, 
it clearly reveals that the marine environment in and around 
PY-3 oil field has not been altered or affected by the 
ongoing production activities. Numeration of phyto and 
zooplanktons shows that the populations and diversity of 
the region is maintained and the environment is healthy with 
good productivity. Infaunal analysis reveals that the 
sediments are rich in invertebrate fauna with diverse groups 
of marine organisms. Toxicological studies on fish and 
Routine discharges Control measures
Produced water Produced water recovered during crude oil or condensate gas treatment is generally warm and charged 
with salts and solids. The quantity of water produced given by the Water Oil Ratio (‘WOR’) can increase 
considerably with the age of the oil field. Currently, the PY-3 field produces less than 10 stbd and is 
treated by gravity separation. Treated water is discharged overboard after confirming no oil content 
within allowable limits.
Drilling fluids Drilling fluids are used in exploration and production drilling to maintain hydrostatic pressure control in 
the well and to lubricate the drill bits. Water-based drilling fluids are currently discharged directly to the 
ocean after ensuring that there is no oil contamination.
Drill cuttings The drill cuttings removed from the well are rock debris and mineral particles generated by drilling into 
underground formations. The discharge of rock cuttings and mud may have adverse environmental 
effects especially by changing the sediment particle size distribution and also by the possible 
suffocation of benthic fauna. Except at sensitive areas such as corals and mangroves, water-based 
cuttings are allowed to be discharged directly into sea after clear separation from the drilling fluids and 
through washings.
Deck drainage Deck drainage is either collected and treated separately for oil removal by gravity separation or is 
handled by the Oil Water Sewage (‘OWS’) system before discharge. Typically, OWS systems are 
provided with online analysers and if the oil content is above the preset value, it will not allow the water 
to be discharged.
Domestic wastes Domestic waste originates from kitchen, laundries and galleys located on drilling and production 
facilities. It typically comprises metal cans, glass or plastic bottles, papers, boxes and biodegradable 
wastes. This waste is segregated, stored and dispersed as per the waste management plans of the 
individual facilities concerned.
Sanitary wastes Sanitary waste generated from toilets and lavatories need to be treated before discharge. Our facilities 
are required to maintain a residual chlorine concentration in sanitary waste discharge as close to 1 mg/l 
as possible for disinfection purposes.
Oil spill 
contingency plan
An oil spill contingency plan has been prepared in line with IMO guidelines and the National Oil Spill 
Disaster Contingency Plan. It has been approved by Indian Coast Guard and Oil Industry Safety 
Directorate (under Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, GOI). As per the plan, resources required for 
an oil spill will be mobilised based on a tiered approach as follows: Tier 1 within local capability; Tier 2 
over and above local capability, resources available with neighbour operations and national agencies 
(Viz. Indian Coast Guard) will also be mobilised; Tier 3 in addition to Tier 2 resources, resources from 
specialised agencies such as Oil Spill Response Ltd (‘OSRL’), and EARL will also be mobilised.
crustaceans indicate that the bio-accumulation is within 
permissible limits. The values obtained during the present 
study are in accordance with the other marine environments 
in this region.
Environmental Management System
Hardy’s Environmental Management System is intended to 
mitigate the risks of marine pollution due to routine and 
accidental discharges of wastes and consequent adverse 
impacts on the marine environment. 
Offshore oil platforms generally generate the following wastes:
major produced water, drilling fluids and drill cuttings; ´ ●
and 
minor deck drainage, sanitary waste and domestic waste. ´ ●
The various conventions held and agreements reached for 
setting limits for discharge from offshore oil/gas exploration 
and production activities provide necessary guidelines  
for monitoring required standards before discharging 
different wastes. 
Set out below is a table outlining the major policies and 
measures that the Company undertakes as operator of

Flared gas (MMscfd)
Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Air Quality
On evaluation of environment impacts regular ambient air 
quality studies have confirmed that the air quality is not 
affected by offshore operations and the main focus of 
monitoring is of the impact on the immediate marine 
ecological system. 
Flaring
Gas produced from the PY-3 field is associated gas  
which is separated from the crude oil through conventional 
processing at the Tahara. Currently the field produces 
approximately 3.9 MMscfd. The current method of disposal 
is via power generation (for use on the Tahara) and flaring 
offshore. The flaring practice will continue until some viable 
alternative emerges. Close to PY-3 field, PY-1 gas field 
commence production in 2009 and the PY-3 joint venture  
is evaluating possibility of routing a pipeline to shore along 
with PY-1 gas. The Nigerian Government has mandated an 
end to the pervasive flaring practice in the Niger Delta. The 
development plans for the Oza and Atala fields provide for 
the monetisation or reinjection of produced gas.
Employment Practices
Our policy is to ensure equal opportunities in career 
development, promotion, training and reward for all of our 
employees. We continually monitor the skills required to 
manage our activities and ensure there is a balance of 
skilled, experienced expatriate and local employees in our 
overseas offices. We seek to avoid discrimination in the 
workplace. In support of our aim to attract, develop and 
retain talented and committed people to deliver our 
business goals and objectives.
2009 was a challenging year for the Company and we 
would not have seen ourselves through it without the 
continued dedication of the Company’s staff in India, 
Nigeria and the United Kingdom. Our India team continues 
to drive the core of our business and we will look to 
continue to retain and enhance our technical, operational 
and management competencies in this region. In 2010 we 
will continue to need to receive excellence from our staff  
to effectively execute our 2010 work plan and beyond. 
Management recognises the importance of our team and 
acknowledges their efforts in the past year.
Outlook
The Board believes that prevention of accidents, ill health 
and protection of the environment are essential to the 
efficient operation of its business. The Board is committed to 
high standards of HSE protection. These aspects command 
equal prominence with other business considerations  
in the decision making process. HSE protection are 
responsibilities shared by everyone working for the Company 
and the full support of all the Company’s staff, corporate 
partners, and contractors is vital to the successful 
implementation of this policy. The Board ensures that 
personnel are aware of their delegated HSE responsibilities 
and are properly trained to undertake them diligently. The 
Board aims to ensure that the necessary resources are 
provided to support this policy fully and to seek continuous 
improvement in performance. 
High corporate social responsibility standards and constant 
grass roots level interaction give the Group the awareness 
of local communities’ sensibilities and needs. With an 
awareness driving the commitment, the Group provides its 
expertise and resources, wherever required, to be a 
responsible Company.

Introduction
Hardy Oil and Gas plc is incorporated in the Isle of Man. 
The Company is not subject to any corporate governance 
regime in its place of incorporation. The Company 
substantially complies with the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance and supports high standards of 
corporate governance. 
Although Hardy is a publicly listed company and has been 
listed on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for 
listed securities since February 2008, the Company 
continues to be an early stage exploration company  
with limited cash flows and a modest employee base  
of approximately 50 people. The Company has a clear 
mandate to optimise the allocation of limited resources  
to support its exciting exploration programme. As such,  
the Company strives to maintain a balance between 
conservation of limited resources and maintaining robust 
corporate governance practices. As the Company evolves 
the Board is committed to address specific Combined 
Code deficiencies and enhance the Company’s corporate 
governance policies and practices deemed appropriate for 
the size and maturity of the organisation.
Set out below are Hardy’s corporate governance practices 
for the year ended 31 December 2009. Disclosures below 
include matters where Hardy has not fully complied during 
2009 and its plans for compliance during 2010.
Board of Directors
Composition
The Company’s Board presently has seven directors, 
comprised of two Executive Directors and five Non-
Executive Directors. 
Each of the existing executive directors has extensive 
knowledge of the oil and gas industry with combined 
experience of approximately 60 years. The Non-Executive 
Directors have either held senior appointments in oil and 
gas companies, companies with interests in the energy 
sector or have significant corporate and financial experience 
and bring a broad range of business and commercial 
experience to the Board. The Board believes it is an 
effective board that is collectively responsible for the 
success of the Company and that its composition is 
suitable, providing a balance of skill sets to run an effective 
publicly traded international junior oil and gas company.
Role and Operations of the Board
The Board is accountable to the shareholders for the 
creation of long-term shareholder value and delivery of 
strong, sustainable operating and financial performance.  
In order to accomplish its objectives, the Board directs  
and monitors the Group’s affairs on an ongoing basis.  
It provides the Company with its overall strategic direction, 
ensures that the Company has the necessary financial and 
human resources in place, monitors performance of the 
Company and its management and adheres to strong 
corporate governance practices.

The Board is pleased with the high level of attendance and 
participation by both Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
at Board and committee meetings.
In addition to the formal meetings of the Board, the 
executive directors maintain frequent verbal and written 
contact with the Non-Executive Directors to discuss various 
issues affecting the Company and its business. In addition, 
the Board executes a number of resolutions in writing to 
conduct Company business.
During the second half of 2009, the Non-Executive 
Chairman introduced a process whereby all of the Non-
Executive Directors, including the Chairman, meet without 
the executive directors present, generally at the end of every 
Board meeting. Matters arising out of such discussions are 
communicated to the executive directors as appropriate.
Information Flow
The Chairman establishes the agenda for each Board 
meeting. Business set out on Board agendas is discussed 
at each meeting with sufficient information provided to all 
the directors. Board meeting agendas and supporting 
information are circulated to each director prior to each 
meeting. Directors are provided sufficient information on the 
basis of which to discuss relevant matters in order to allow 
directors to be appropriately informed and able to make 
informed decisions.
At most Board meetings, the Board reviews future cash 
flows and historical financial information with respect to  
the business and affairs of the Company. In addition,  
the directors are provided a status report on each of its 
exploration, development and production assets and a 
meaningful dialogue takes place. The Board receives  
reports of its various committees – Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination – and takes appropriate action. Matters requiring 
resolutions are voted upon and approved if appropriate. 
Matters reserved specifically for Board approval are 
discussed and evaluated prior to approval. Decisions 
requiring Board approval in between scheduled Board 
meetings are made by circulating supporting information  
and approved unanimously in writing by the directors.

Independent Professional Advice
All of the directors are aware that independent professional 
advice is available to each director in order to properly 
discharge his or her duties as a director. In addition, each 
director and committee has access to the advice of the 
Company Secretary.
Matters Specifically Reserved by the Board
A formal schedule of matters is reserved for consideration 
by the Board. The matters reserved include management 
structure including appointments and remuneration, 
consideration of strategic policies and corporate direction, 
approval of annual and interim results, acquisitions and 
disposals, material contracts, major capital expenditure 
projects and budgets, approval of capital structure, debt 
and equity financing, dividends, and other matters. Subject 
to those reserved matters, the Board delegates authority for 
the management of the business primarily to the executive 
directors and certain other matters are delegated to the 
Board committees, namely the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees.
Performance Evaluation
Hardy has a policy of appraising Board performance 
annually. Having reviewed various approaches to Board 
appraisal, Hardy has concluded that for a company of its 
current scale an internal process, in which all Board 
members submit answers to a questionnaire that considers 
the functionality of the Board and its committees, is most 
appropriate at this stage. This questionnaire also contains a 
series of questions to evaluate the performance of individual 
Board members and that of the Chairman. The Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director is responsible for 
reporting on this matter to the Remuneration Committee 
and to the Board, including reviewing the performance of 
the Chairman, with the exception of reviewing her own 
performance (which is carried out by the Chairman). The 
process of completing the performance evaluation of the 
Board as a whole, its Chairman, and individual executive 
and Non-Executive Directors, was completed in November 
and December 2009.
Each director’s position is subject to satisfactory 
performance of their responsibilities and is subject to 
reappointment by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting. The Board of Directors is pleased with the 
attendance of all directors at Board and committee 
meetings, despite significant travel and time requirements. 
The Board of Directors is also satisfied with the 
participation by all the directors in formulating corporate 
strategies and for their engagement in meaningful dialogue 
and discussions at Board and committee meetings. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
There is a clear division of duties and responsibilities 
between the Non-Executive Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company. The Chairman provides 
leadership to the Board and ensures its effectiveness  
of its role and setting the agenda. The Chairman is also 
responsible in ensuring that the Board is provided with 
accurate, timely, and clear information in relation to the 
Group and its business. He is in regular communication 
with each of the executive and Non-Executive Directors  
on an ongoing basis. The Chief Executive Officer is 
responsible for the running of the organisation and  
the execution of the Company’s strategies, goals and 
objectives. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer are exercised by different individuals.
Mr Paul Mortimer is the Non-Executive Chairman of the 
Company. In addition to Hardy, he is also a director  
of Gemini Oil & Gas Limited and Gemini Oil & Gas 
Management Limited.
Non-Executive Directors
The Board has determined that Mr Paul Mortimer 
(Chairman), Mr Pradip Shah, Dr Carol Bell and  
Mr Ian Bruce are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board considers that independence is a matter of 
judgement and therefore it believes that the Non-Executive 
Directors should be free from any business or other 
relationships that could materially interfere in the exercise  
of their independent judgement. It is the Board’s policy to 
provide its Non-Executive Directors fair remuneration for  
the contribution they make with respect to the business  
and affairs of the Company and the responsibilities they 
undertake in performing their duties as Non-Executive 
Directors. Each of Messrs Mortimer and Shah was granted 
260,333 options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the 
Company on the admission of Ordinary Shares of the 
Company on AIM in June 2005. Dr Bell was granted a 
similar award on her appointment as a Non-Executive 
Director in December 2005. Mr Karra was Chief Executive 
until 31 March 2010 and has 1,180,700 options that were 
granted in his executive capacity. The Board has dispensed 
with the grant of stock options to the Non-Executive 
Directors since 2006.
Each of Messrs Mortimer and Shah has served as a 
Non-Executive Director for a period of more than nine years. 
All of the Non-Executive Directors continue to provide 
invaluable services to the Board, its committees and to  
the Company.
The Board acknowledges that Messrs Mortimer, Karra, 
Shah and Bruce have shareholdings in the Company thus 
expressing their confidence in the Company and its future.
Notwithstanding Non-Executive Directors’ interest in 
Ordinary Shares or options of the Company, or their long 
standing service as directors of the Company, the Board 
considers that their independence (other than Mr Karra) is 
not prejudiced or compromised as a result of such positions.
Board Committees
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees, each of which has terms of 
reference (approved by the Board) setting out its authority 
and duties. The terms of reference for Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees can be found on the 
Company’s website.
The Board considered various issues that would normally 
fall within the terms of reference of the various committees. 
All members of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee are Non-Executive Directors. Both executive and 
Non-Executive Directors are members of the Nomination

independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee 
meet as and when required, but at least once a year. The 
Audit Committee meets at least three times a year to review, 
among other things, financial reporting with respect to 
interim and annual results and for audit planning purposes. 
The Company’s auditors attend at least two of these 
meetings to discuss any audit related issues and to review 
formally with committee members reports issued to the 
Company by the auditors. The Audit Committee ensures 
that any non-audit services conform to the ethical standards 
for auditors issued by the Auditing Practices Board of the 
UK Financial Reporting Council.
Nomination Committee
The Company’s Nomination Committee comprises three 
Non-Executive Directors – Mr Paul Mortimer (Chairman), 
Mr Pradip Shah and Mr Sastry Karra. The Nomination 
Committee considers the structure, size and composition of 
the Board, retirements, replacements and appointments of 
additional directors, reviews succession plans for the 
directors and makes recommendations to the Board on 
membership of the Board, its committees and other matters 
within its remit.
There was one meeting of the Nomination Committee  
held during 2009 with 100 per cent attendance by the 
committee members. Any new appointments to the Board 
are considered by the Nomination Committee and made 
after Board approval. Following appointment, a new director 
is given a detailed presentation of the activities of the 
Company. If an appointment is made without using an 
external search agency or open advertisement, the entire 
Board selects a new director.

The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises of 
three Non-Executive Directors, Mr Pradip Shah (Chairman), 
Mr Paul Mortimer, and Dr Carol Bell. Hardy’s Remuneration 
Committee operates within the terms of reference approved 
by the Board. There were two meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee held during 2009 with 100 per cent attendance.
The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration 
policy, employment terms and remuneration of the executive 
directors and also reviews the remuneration of senior 
management. The Remuneration Committee’s role is 
advisory in nature and makes recommendations to the 
Board on the overall remuneration packages for executive 
directors in order to attract, retain and motivate high quality 
executives capable of achieving the Group’s objectives.  
The Remuneration Committee also reviews proposals for 
the share option plans and other incentive plans, makes 
recommendations for the grant of awards under such plans 
as well as approving the terms of any performance related 
pay schemes.
None of the directors participates in any discussion or  
votes on any proposal relating to his or her own 
remuneration. The Board’s policy is to remunerate the 
Group’s senior executives fairly and in such a manner as  
to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of 
suitably qualified personnel. The Remuneration Committee, 
while considering remuneration packages of Hardy 
executives, has reviewed the policies of comparable groups 
in the industry. The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive 
directors outside the framework of the Remuneration 
Committee.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Dr Carol Bell and its 
other members are Mr Pradip Shah and Mr Ian Bruce.  
All of the committee members are independent Non-
Executive Directors. Dr Carol Bell, Mr Pradip Shah and  
Mr Ian Bruce have extensive corporate, financing and 
banking experience. The Board is satisfied that the Audit 
Committee has recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for a wide range of 
financial matters and met three times during 2009 with 
100 per cent attendance by committee members and 
external auditors. It monitors the controls that are in place  
to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported 
to shareholders. In addition, it oversees an effective system 
of risk management within the Company.
The Audit Committee also oversees the relationship with  
the external auditors, reviews the scope and results of 
audits and provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s 
auditors. The Company has a policy in place for the award 
of non audit services provided by external auditors, which 
requires approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee ensures that the independence and objectivity 
of the external auditors is safeguarded when securing 
non-audit services from the auditors. The Audit Committee 
also focuses on compliance with legal requirements, 
accounting standards and the Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules and ensures that an 
effective system of internal control and risk management 
systems are maintained. The ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts 
and the half yearly reports remains with the Board. Some or 
all executive directors attend meetings of the Audit 
Committee by invitation.
Shareholder Relations
Communication with shareholders is given high priority and 
there is regular dialogue with institutional investors, as well 
as general presentations made at the time of the release of 
the annual and interim results. All directors are kept aware 
of changes in major shareholders in the Company and  
are available to meet with shareholders who have specific 
interests or concerns. The Company issues its results 
promptly to individual shareholders and also publishes them 
on the Company’s website – www.hardyoil.com. Regular 
updates to record news in relation to the Company and the 
status of its exploration and development programmes are 
included on the Company’s website. Shareholders and 
other interested parties can subscribe to receive these 
news updates by email by registering on line on the website 
free of charge.
The Chairman and all executive directors are available to 
meet with institutional shareholders to discuss any issues 
and gain an understanding of the Company’s business, its 
strategies and governance. At the 2009 Annual General 
Corporate Governance Statement continued Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Meeting of shareholders, all of the directors were present. 
Dr Carol Bell serves in the capacity as the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company and is 
available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not 
been resolved through the normal channels of Chairman or 
executive directors.
Internal Controls
The Board of Directors reviews the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of internal controls in line with the 
requirement of the Combined Code. The internal control 
system is designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve 
its business objectives. This covers internal financial and 
operational controls, compliances and risk management. 
The Company has necessary procedures in place for the 
year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. The directors acknowledge 
their responsibility for the Company’s system of internal 
controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board 
confirms the need for an ongoing process for identification, 
evaluation and management of significant risks faced by the 
Company. A risk assessment for each project is carried out 
by a team consisting of the executive directors and senior 
management before making any commitments. This team 
meets as and when required. Internal and external risks, 
including exploration and development risks, regulatory and 
compliance obligations under various production sharing 
contracts, economics including oil price, interest rate and 
currency exposure, as well as natural catastrophes are 
continuously assessed.
During 2009, the Audit Committee reviewed and reported 
to the Board the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control through detailed consideration of the financial 
control procedures in place. Given the size of the Company, 
the relative simplicity of the systems and the close 
involvement of senior management, the Board considers 
that there is no current requirement for an internal audit 
function. The procedures that have been established to 
provide internal financial control are considered appropriate 
for a company of its size and include controls over 
expenditure, regular reconciliations and management 
accounts. Most of the assets are owned jointly with others, 
budgets and expenditures are rigorously reviewed and 
approvals as well as project audits take place with respect 
to capital and operating expenditures on a regular basis.
The directors are responsible for taking such steps  
as are reasonably available to them to safeguard the  
assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud  
and other irregularities.
Going Concern
The Company’s business activities, together with factors 
likely to affect its future operations, financial position, and 
liquidity position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement, 
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement, Review of Operations, 
Financial Review, and the Risks and Uncertainties section  
of the Annual Report. In addition, note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements discloses the Company’s financial risk 
management practices with respect to its capital structure, 
foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, 
commodity price risk, credit risk, and other related matters. 
The directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of 
the opinion that the Company has adequate working capital 
to execute its operations and has the ability to access 
additional financing, if required, over the next 12 months. 
The directors, therefore, have made an informed judgement, 
at the time of approving financial statements, that there  
is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. As a result, the directors have continued 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the annual financial statements in accordance with Going 
Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK 
Companies 2009.
Share Options
The directors believe that equity incentives are and will 
continue to be an important means of retaining, attracting 
and motivating directors, senior management and key 
employees. Accordingly, in June 2005, the Board adopted 
the share option scheme entitling the Company to award 
options to directors and employees. The Company’s share 
option scheme has been considered and approved by the 
shareholders in 2006. Options are not granted at a discount 
to the market value. Under the scheme, options are 
exercisable between the first and 10th anniversaries of the 
date of grant. Options granted in June 2005 were subject to 
performance conditions whereby the share price of Hardy 
would need to rise by 20 per cent, 45 per cent and 70 per 
cent of the price at which the Hardy IPO was undertaken. In 
first year of performance period, one third of the options will 
become exercisable at or after 12 months following the date 
of grant. One third of the options will become exercisable  
at or after 24 months following the date of grant. The 
remaining one third of the options will become exercisable 
at or after 36 months following the date of grant. All of such 
performance conditions have been met. No options were 
granted to any directors during 2009 or 2008. No options 
were granted to Non-Executive Directors since 2005.
In future, it is intended to grant options under the share 
option scheme, which will generally vest after three years 
from date of grant. Future option awards will be subject  
to a performance condition of 5 per cent per annum 
compounded growth in share price from the date of grant 
for a period of three years. This performance condition  
has been chosen to fully align the interest of the executive 
directors with those of shareholders. No options will be 
granted to Non-Executive Directors.

Non Compliance with Combined Code
The Company did not comply with the Combined Code with the following matters during 2009.
Code Provision Subject Matter Discussion
A3.1 Non-Executive Directors meeting 
independence requirements
Paul Mortimer and Pradip Shah have served for more than 
nine years. As a result, both directors are subject to annual 
re-election.
Paul Mortimer, Pradip Shah and Carol Bell were granted 
share options in 2005 when the Company’s Ordinary 
Shares were listed on AIM.
The Board has confirmed, notwithstanding the above,  
that all of the Non-Executive Directors are independent.
B1.3 Remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors should not include  
share options
Share options were granted in 2005 to Non-Executive 
Directors when the Company was listed on AIM and not 
subject to the Combined Code.
The Company has changed its policies whereby no share 
options are granted to Non-Executive Directors since 2005.
 
The Board believes that its composition is suitable having regard to its international stature with a focus on India. 
Notwithstanding the long tenure of some of the Directors, the Board believes all of them are independent and provide 
valuable advice and counsel in furthering the business objectives of the Company.
Although Hardy is a publicly listed company and has been listed on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed 
securities since February 2008, the Company continues to be an early stage exploration company with limited cash flows 
and a modest employee base of approximately 50 people. The Company has a clear mandate to optimise the allocation of 
limited resources to support it exciting exploration programme. As such, the Company strives to maintain a balance 
between conservation of limited resources and maintaining robust corporate governance practices. As the Company 
evolves the Board is committed to address specific Combined Code deficiencies and enhance the Company’s corporate 
governance policies and practices deemed appropriate for the size and maturity of the organisation.

Consideration by the Directors of Matters Relating  
to Directors’ Remuneration
The Company has a Remuneration Committee comprised  
of Mr Pradip Shah (Non-Executive Director) as Chairman,  
Mr Paul Mortimer (Non-Executive Chairman of the Company), 
and Dr Carol Bell (Senior Non-Executive Director).
In addition, the Remuneration Committee had engaged 
Simon Patterson of Patterson Associates as a Remuneration 
Consultant to assist the committee in setting the 
remuneration of executive directors and Non-Executive 
Directors for the future.
Statement of Hardy’s Policy on  
Directors’ Remuneration
The Company has established levels of remuneration that 
are appropriate to attract, retain and motivate executive 
directors of the quality required to run its business 
successfully. A significant proportion of executive directors’ 
remuneration is structured so as to link rewards to 
corporate and individual performance, align their interests 
with those of shareholders and to incentivise them to 
perform at the highest levels. The Remuneration Committee 
considers remuneration policy and the employment  
terms and remuneration of the executive directors. The 
Remuneration Committee’s role is advisory in nature and 
makes recommendations to the Board of Directors on the 
overall remuneration packages for executive directors in 
order to attract, retain and motivate high quality executives 
capable of achieving Hardy’s objectives.
The main goals of the Hardy’s remuneration policy are to 
reward past performance, incentivise future performance, 
encourage teamwork, retain Company talent and assure 
alignment with shareholders. These goals are achieved  
by maintaining appropriate base salaries, annual cash 
bonuses and providing a systematic annual grant of  
options. All incentive compensation levels are subject  
to recommendations of the Remuneration Committee  
and approved by the Board. 
Base salaries of executive directors are reviewed on an 
annual basis. No changes to base salaries have been made 
since 1 July 2007. Although the Company has the policy  
of awarding cash bonuses, no such awards have been 
made to executive directors to date. In the future, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider recommending 
annual bonuses having regard to the cash requirement and 
overall performance of the Group. The size of the bonus will 
correspond to the salary of the executive director based 
upon performance targets, including corporate, team and 
individual performance measures. Any cash bonus shall be 
targeted at 20 per cent of base salary and shall not exceed 
40 per cent of base salary. The Remuneration Committee 
reviews proposals for share option plans, makes 
recommendations for the grant of awards under such plans 
as well as approve the terms of any performance related pay 
schemes. The Company has adopted a policy of granting 
stock option awards on an annual basis although stock 
option awards cannot be made during close periods. None 
of the directors participate in any discussion or votes on any 
proposal relating to his or her own remuneration. The policy 
of the Board of Directors is to remunerate Hardy’s executive 
directors fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the 
recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified 
personnel. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors 
is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors 
outside the framework of the Remuneration Committee and 
approved by the Board of Directors.
The directors (other than Ian Bruce) have been granted 
options to purchase Ordinary Shares of Hardy in the past. 
No options have been granted to any of the executive 
directors since 2 July 2007. No options have been granted 
to Non-Executive Directors since 2005.
In future, any new options granted will generally vest three 
years from the date of grant for the entire award thereby 
facilitating a longer period of retention. Previously, options 
were subject to vesting over a three-year period from date of 
grant. All of the options granted are at market prices based 
on the five-day average closing price prior to the date of 
grant. Future option awards will be subject to a performance 
condition of 5 per cent per annum compounded growth  
in share price from the date of grant for a period of 
three years. 
Options will be forfeited if a director resigns before the 
options vest. In other circumstances, the vesting of options 
will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and 
Board approval. In the event of a change of control, all of the 
unvested options will vest.
Options granted following the initial public offering in 
June 2005 were subject to performance conditions based 
upon appreciation in the price of Ordinary Shares of the 
Company. All of the performance conditions have been met. 
Subsequent options granted have been subject to vesting 
provisions over a three-year period, commencing from the 
anniversary of the date of grant. 
All of the service contracts with directors are on an 
evergreen basis, subject to termination provisions. The 
Company may in lieu of notice terminate an executive’s 
employment with immediate effect by making a payment 
which does not exceed a lump sum equal to basic salary  
at the rate prevailing at the date of termination for a period 
which does not exceed 12 months; and a bonus to the 
extent earned and awarded by the Company at the date  
of termination in lieu of the notice period. As a matter of 
Company policy, no bonuses shall accrue as a result of 
lapse of time in the event of termination. With respect to  
Mr Dattani, in the event of a change of control, the Company 
may be entitled to terminate the executive’s employment on 
payment of 12 months’ salary together with all benefits and 
bonuses. The appointments of executive directors are 
subject to termination of 12 months or less by either party. 
The appointments of Non-Executive Directors are subject 
to termination upon at least three months’ notice.
The main goals of the Company’s remuneration policy for 
the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are to assure 
alignment with shareholders through independence, 
recognise time commitments devoted to corporate affairs 
and attract and retain outstanding candidates.
Effective 1 January 2009, restricted shares will be issued  
to the Chairman and each Non-Executive Director on an

annual basis. The number of restricted shares to be issued will be equivalent to 25 per cent of their annual fee based on the 
market value of Hardy shares on the last trading day prior to the date of issue. These shares will remain restricted for three 
years from the date of issue. The shares will become unrestricted and are delivered to the individual three years after the 
date of issue. The share award will be in addition to the annual cash fee. In the event of a close period, such shares will not 
be issued until after the close period is over.
In the event of change of control of Hardy and the participant is no longer a director going forward, all of the restricted 
shares will vest. In the event of death of a director, all shares will become fully vested. In all other circumstances, shares that 
will remain restricted are forfeited if the participant is no longer a director of Hardy. In addition, the Board has discretion to 
accelerate vesting on a date determined by it.
A one-time restricted share award may be made to a new Non-Executive Director on joining the Board. Such an award was 
made to Mr Ian Bruce upon his appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 24 October 2008. Such shares are held in trust 
and will be released to Mr Bruce after three years from the date of issue (subject to earlier release in certain circumstances) 
provided he remains a director of the Company provided for that period.
Ordinary Shares of the Company were listed on the AIM exchange from 10 June 2005, and on the Official List of the 
London Stock Exchange’s market for listed securities (‘Main Market’) from 20 February 2008. In the circumstances, and 
since the Company’s principal business is upstream oil and gas exploration, development and production, the Company has 
chosen to compare its performance with the FTSE All Share Index and FTSE 350 Oil and Producers Index.

granted by the Company. Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Options granted on 7 June 2005 are subject to performance 
criteria based upon appreciation in the market value of 
Ordinary Shares of the Company. All of such performance 
conditions have been met. All subsequent options granted to 
the end of 2009 are subject to vesting provisions whereby 
one third of the options granted vest on each of the three 
anniversaries from the date of grant. There are no additional 
performance criteria with respect to options granted 
subsequent to 7 June 2005. It is intended that future grant of 
options will be subject to vesting at the end of a three-year 
period for the entire award. Future option awards will be 
subject to a performance condition of 5 per cent per annum 
compounded growth in share price from the date of grant for 
a period of three years. This performance condition has been 
chosen to fully align the interest of the executive directors 
with those of shareholders.
No share options were exercised by any of the directors of 
the Company during 2009.
On 31 December 2009, the market price of an Ordinary 
Share of Hardy was £2.525 per share. The highest and 
lowest market price of an Ordinary Share of Hardy during 
2009 was £5.65 and £1.505 respectively.
Restricted Shares
As mentioned above, the Board of Directors have adopted 
a policy whereby restricted shares will be issued to the 
Chairman and each Non-Executive Director on an annual 
basis. The number of restricted shares to be issued will  
be equivalent to 25 per cent of their annual cash fee based 
on the market value of Hardy shares on the last trading  
day prior to the date of issue. These shares will remain 
restricted for three years. The share award will be in 
addition to the annual cash fee. In the event of change of 
control of Hardy and the participant is no longer a director 
going forward, all of the restricted shares will vest. In the 
event of death of a director, all shares will become fully 
vested. In all other circumstances, shares that are still 
restricted are forfeited if the participant is no longer a 
director of Hardy. In the event of a close period, the 
restricted shares will, subject to Board approval, be issued 
after the close period is over.
Other Matters
Mr Sharma and Mr Dattani are directors of other companies, 
all of which are private. They are entitled to retain earnings 
from such directorships; however, no directors’ fees were 
paid to them during 2009 or 2008. Mr Dattani has stock 
options from a private company.
The Company does not have any long-term incentive 
schemes in place for any of the directors.
The Company does not have any pension plans for any  
of the directors.
The Company has not paid out any excess retirement 
benefits to any directors or past directors.
The Company has not paid any compensation to past directors.
The Company has not paid any sums to third parties with 
respect to any services of directors.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the Shareholders of Hardy Oil and Gas plc
We have audited the Group and parent company financial 
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Hardy Oil and Gas 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated and 
Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash 
Flows, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of 
Changes in Equity, and the related notes. These financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the parent company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with section 15 of the 
Isle of Man Companies Act 1982. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union are set out in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements  
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Isle of Man Companies 
Acts 1931 to 2004 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We read the Directors’ Report and consider the implication 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or inconsistencies within it. The information 
in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information 
presented in the Review of Operations and Financial Review 
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of 
the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is 
not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the 2008 Combined Code specified for our review by the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and  
we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all 
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk 
and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
financial statements. This other information comprises only 
the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Statement, Review of Operations, the unaudited part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, Financial Review, the 
Corporate Governance Statement, Statement of Corporate 
Social Responsibilities and Statement of Risks and 
Uncertainties. We consider the implications for our report if 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It 
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates 
and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain 
all the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence  
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming  
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of 
the presentation of information in the financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, ● ●
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union, of the

Emphasis of Matter – Request for an Extension  
of an Exploration Licence
In forming our opinion on the financial statements,  
which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy  
of the disclosures made in notes 2 and 17 to the financial 
statements concerning the Group’s request for an extension 
of its exploration licence in block CY-OS/2. The Group has 
presented a case to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons 
that supports its claim that it is entitled to a licence extension 
following a non-associated natural gas discovery. In the 
absence of a resolution in its favour in the near future, the 
Group intends to refer the dispute for sole expert, or 
conciliation and arbitration.
In the event that the Group’s request for an extension of this 
licence was to be unsuccessful, the exploration expenditure 
capitalised in respect of this block would be subject to 
impairment testing. No adjustment has been made to the 
carrying value of this capitalised expenditure.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2009
1. Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been applied in preparation of consolidated financial statements of Hardy Oil and 
Gas plc (‘Hardy’ or the ‘Group’). 
a) Basis of Measurement
Hardy prepares its financial statements on a historical cost basis except as otherwise stated. 
b) Going Concern
The Group has successfully raised financing in the past to provide funding for its ongoing exploration and development 
programmes and to augment its working capital. Having regard to the Group’s existing working capital position and its 
ability to raise potential financing, if required, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to 
enable it to undertake its planned work programme of exploration, appraisal and development activities over the next 
12 months.
c) Basis of Preparation
Hardy prepares its financial statements in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union.
As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not 
yet effective:
IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (revised 2008)
IFRS 3 Consolidated financial statements (revised 2008)
IFRS 9 Financial instruments (replacement of IAS 39)*
Amendments to IFRS 1 Additional Exemptions for First-time Adopters*
IFRS 1 Amendment – Limited exemption from IFRS 7 Disclosures for first time adopters*
IFRS 2 Amendment – Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions*
IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
Amendment to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues
IAS 24 (Revised) Related Party Disclosures*
IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement (Amendment) – eligible hedged items
IFRIC 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to owners
IFRIC 18 Transfer of assets from customers
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments*
IFRIC 14 (Amendment) Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement*
Pronouncements marked ‘*’ have not yet been adopted by the European Union.
In addition, there are certain requirements of Improvements to IFRSs which are not yet effective.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future reporting periods will have 
a material impact on the Group’s results.
d) Functional and Presentation Currency
These financial statements are presented in US dollars which is the Group’s functional currency. All financial information 
presented is rounded to the nearest US dollar.
 
e) Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Hardy Oil and Gas plc and its subsidiaries’ undertakings. The 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows include the results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings up to the date of disposal. 
The Group conducts the majority of its exploration, development and production through unincorporated joint arrangements 
with other companies.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the Group’s share of production revenues and costs attributable to its 
participating interests under the proportional consolidation method.
f) Revenue and Other Income
Revenue represents the sale value of the Group’s share of oil which excludes the profit oil sold and paid to the Government 
as a part of profit sharing in the year, tariff, and income from technical services to third parties if any. Revenues are 
recognised when crude oil has been lifted and title has been passed to the buyer or when services are rendered.

g) Oil and Gas Assets
i) Exploration and Evaluation Assets
Hardy follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas assets. Under this method, all expenditures incurred in 
connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration and appraisal having regard to the requirements of 
IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’ are accumulated and capitalised in two geographical cost 
pools, which are not larger than a segment: India and Nigeria.
The capitalised exploration and evaluation costs are classified as intangible assets – exploration which includes the licence 
acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs relating either to unevaluated properties or properties awaiting further evaluation 
but do not include costs incurred prior to having obtained legal right to explore an area, which costs are expensed directly 
to the income statement as they are incurred.
Intangible exploration and evaluation cost relating to each licence or block remain capitalised pending a determination of 
whether or not commercial reserves exists. Commercial reserves are defined as proven and probable on a net 
entitlement basis. 
When a decision to develop these properties is taken or there is evidence of impairment, the costs are transferred to the 
cost pools within development/producing assets when the commercial reserves attributable to the underlying asset have 
been established.
ii) Oil and Gas Development and Producing Assets
Development and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. These comprise of the cost of developing 
commercial reserves discovered to put them on production and the exploration and evaluation costs transferred from 
intangible exploration and evaluation assets, as stated in policy above. In addition, interest payable and exchange 
differences incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects, if any, and assets in the production phase, 
as well as cost of recognising provision for future restoration and decommissioning, are capitalised.
iii) Decommissioning
At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning facilities, plugging and 
abandoning wells. Future decommissioning costs are estimated and stated at an amount representing the costs which 
would be incurred should decommissioning occur at the balance sheet date and the estimates are reassessed each year. 
The provision is assessed at prices prevailing at the balance sheet date and, accordingly, it is not appropriate to discount 
this provision. The decommissioning asset is included within the property, plant and equipment with the cost of the related 
assets installed and is adjusted for any revision to the decommissioning costs and the provision thereof. The amortisation of 
the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is shown as ‘Decommissioning 
charge’ in the income statement.
iv) Disposal of Assets
Proceeds from any disposal of assets are credited against the specific capitalised costs included in the relevant cost pool 
and any loss or gain on disposal is recognised in the income statement. Gain or loss arising on disposal of a subsidiary is 
recorded in the income statement.
h) Depletion and Impairment 
i) Depletion
The net book values of the producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method, 
based on proved and probable reserves taking into consideration future development expenditures necessary to bring the 
reserves into production. Hardy periodically obtains an independent third party assessment of reserves, which is used as a 
basis for computing depletion. 
ii) Impairment
Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indications of impairment, if any, where circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value might not be recoverable. In such circumstances, if the exploration asset has a corresponding development/
producing cost pool, then the exploration costs are transferred to the cost pool and depleted on unit of production. In cases 
where no such development/producing cost pool exists, the impairment of exploration costs is recognised in the income 
statement. Impairment reviews on development/producing oil and gas assets for each field are carried out each year by 
comparing the net book value of the cost pool with the associated discounted future cash flows. If there is any impairment  
in a field representing a material component of the cost pool, an impairment test is carried out for the cost pool as a whole. 
If the net book value of the cost pool is higher, the difference is recognised in the income statement as impairment.

i) Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected 
useful economic lives as follows:
Annual rate (%) Depreciation method 
Leasehold improvements over lease period Straight-line
Furniture and fixtures 20 Straight-line
Information technology and computers 33 Straight-line
Other equipment 20 Straight-line
j) Intangible Assets
Intangible assets other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful economic 
lives as follows:
Annual rate (%) Depreciation method
Computer software 33 Straight-line
k) Investments 
Investments in publicly traded securities are treated as available for sale and are recognised at fair values based upon the 
quoted market prices on the balance sheet date in other reserves. On disposal of an investment, the cumulative realised 
gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Investments by the parent company in its subsidiaries are stated at cost. 
l) Short-term Investments
Short-term investments are regarded as ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ and are carried at fair value.  
In practice, the nature of these investments is such that the fair value equates to the value of initial outlay and therefore in 
normal circumstances no fair value gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
m)  Inventory
Inventory of crude oil is valued at the lower of average cost and market value. Average cost is determined based on actual 
production cost for the year. Inventories of drilling stores are recorded at cost including taxes duties and freight. Provision is 
made for obsolete or defective items where appropriate based on technical evaluation.
n) Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at fair value in the Group’s balance sheet based on the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables are not interest bearing and their fair value is deemed to be their nominal value as reduced by necessary 
provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and their fair value is deemed to be their nominal value.
o) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Hardy and the Group are recorded at net proceeds after direct issue costs.
p) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit of the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement as it excludes certain items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in years other than the current 
year, and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The current tax liability is calculated using the tax 
rates that have been enacted or subsequently enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised  
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary 
differences associated with investment in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is possible that the temporary differences will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date, where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay 
less or to receive more tax.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply  
in the periods in which temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted  
at the balance sheet date.
q) Foreign Currencies
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the year 
end, all foreign currency monetary assets and monetary liabilities are restated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising out of actual payments/realisations and from the year end restatement are reflected in the 
income statement.
Rates of exchanges are as follows:
31 December 2009 31 December 2008
£ to US$ 1.6154 1.4626
US$ to Indian rupee 46.67 48.52
r) Leasing Commitments
Rental charges or charter hire charges payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement as part of 
production cost over the lease term. 
s) Share-based Payments
Hardy issues share options to Directors and employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
of the equity-settled options determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based 
on the actual number of shares vested in the accounting period. In performing the valuation of these options, only conditions 
other than the market conditions are taken into account. Fair value is derived by use of the binomial model. The expected life 
used in the model is based on management estimates and considers non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
2. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates may differ from the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
(i) Intangible Assets – Exploration 
The Group holds a 75% participating interest in the block CY-OS/2 offshore the south east coast of India. Intangible assets 
include an amount of US$83,469,418 with respect to exploration expenditures on the block wherein a gas discovery was 
announced on 8 January 2007. The exploration period for the block ended on 23 March 2007 and the Government of India 
(‘GOI’) has been requested to extend the block for appraisal and declaration of commerciality for its gas discovery until 
7 January 2012.
Provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) provide for an appraisal period of 60 months from the date of 
discovery. For an oil discovery, this period is limited to 24 months. Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (‘DGH’) has 
informed the Company that in their opinion the discovery is classified as an oil discovery and not a non-associated natural 
gas (‘NANG’) discovery.
The Company has obtained third party legal and technical opinions that support the Company’s view that the discovery is 
NANG. The Group continues to be in an ongoing dialogue with the GOI and believes that it will be successful in obtaining 
the extension of its licence in block CY-OS/2 until 7 January 2012. In the absence of a resolution in its favour in the near 
future, Hardy intends to refer the dispute for sole expert or conciliation and arbitration.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
53
The Group believes that it will be successful in obtaining the extension of its licence in block CY-OS/2 until 7 January 2012. 
Therefore, the intangible assets arising from expenditure on this block continues to be recognised in full and the Directors 
do not believe that any impairment of these costs has arisen as at the balance sheet date. In the event that the Group’s 
application for an extension was to be unsuccessful, the capitalised expenditure will be subject to impairment testing.
(ii) Decommissioning
The liability for decommissioning is based on estimates of the costs of decommissioning that will arise in the future. 
Significant changes in costs as a result of technical advancements and other factors can result in material change to 
this provision.
(iii) Depletion
Depletion calculations are based on best estimates of commercial reserves existing as at the balance sheet date. The 
determination of commercial reserves is based on assumptions which include those relating to the future prices of crude oil 
and natural gas, capital expenditure plans, cost of production and other factors. Any changes in these assumptions could 
result in a material change in the depletion charge or the carrying value of associated assets.
3. Segment Analysis
The Group is organised into three business units: India, Nigeria and the United Kingdom. India business unit is operated by 
its subsidiary undertaking Hardy Exploration & Production (India) Inc. Nigeria business unit is operated by Hardy Oil Nigeria 
Limited. Hardy Oil and Gas plc operates in the United Kingdom. 
India business unit focuses on exploration and production of oil and gas assets in India. Nigeria business unit focuses on 
exploration and production of oil and gas assets in Nigeria. Management monitors these business units separately for 
resource allocation, decision making and performance assessment.

Indian operations of the Group are subject to a tax rate of 42.23% which is higher than UK and US corporation tax rates.  
To the extent that the Indian profits are taxable in the US and/or the UK, then those territories should provide relief for Indian 
taxes paid, principally under the provisions of double taxation agreements. Based on the current expenditure plans, the 
Group anticipates that the tax allowances will continue to exceed the depletion charge of each year, though the timing of 
related tax relief is uncertain.

(Loss) earnings per share are calculated on a loss of US$6,517,176 for the year 2009 (profit for 2008: US$7,472,356)  
on a weighted average of 66,506,242 Ordinary Shares for the year 2009 (2008: 62,287,526). 
The diluted (loss) earnings per share are calculated on a loss of US$6,517,176 for the year 2009 (profit for 2008:  
US$7,472,356) on a weighted average of 71,258,343 Ordinary Shares for the year 2009 (2008: 66,994,627). For the year 
2008 the weighted average shares are calculated after giving impact to dilutive potential Ordinary Shares of 4,302,101 
relating to share options after excluding 405,000 options wherein the strike price exceeds the average market price of the 
shares of the Company. As there is a loss in 2009, no dilutive potential is considered for computing the loss per share.

The Group holds a 75% participating interest in the block CY-OS/2 located offshore in the east coast of India. Intangible 
assets include an amount of US$83,469,418 with respect to exploration expenditures on the block wherein a gas discovery 
was announced on 8 January 2007. The exploration period for the block ended on 23 March 2007 and the GOI has been 
requested to extend the block for appraisal and declaration of commerciality for its gas discovery until 7 January 2012.
Provisions of the PSC provide for an appraisal period of 60 months from the date of discovery. For an oil discovery, this 
period is limited to 24 months. DGH has informed the Company that in their opinion the discovery is classified as an oil 
discovery and not a NANG discovery.
The Company has obtained third party legal and technical opinions that support the Company’s view that the discovery is 
NANG. The Group continues to be in an ongoing dialogue with the GOI and believes that it will be successful in obtaining 
the extension of its licence in block CY-OS/2 until 7 January 2012. In the absence of a resolution in its favour in the near 
future, Hardy intends to refer the dispute for sole expert or conciliation and arbitration.
In the event that Hardy’s application for an extension of the CY-OS/2 licence was to be unsuccessful, the capitalised 
expenditure will be subject to impairment testing.

27. Financial Risk Management
Hardy finances its operations through a mixture of equity and retained earnings. Finance requirements are reviewed by the 
Board when funds are required for acquisition, exploration and development of projects.
Hardy’s policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet so as to maintain the confidence of stakeholders and to sustain the 
future development of the business. There were no changes to the Group’s capital management approach during the year.
Hardy treasury functions are responsible for managing fund requirements and investments which includes banking and cash 
flow management. Interest and foreign exchange exposure are key functions of treasury management to ensure adequate 
liquidity at all times to meet cash requirements. 
Hardy’s principal financial instruments are cash, deposits and short-term investments and these instruments are utilised to 
invest cash surplus to necessary to meet its requirements for operations. 
Hardy’s main risks arising from financial instruments are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, commodity price risk and credit 
risks. Set out below are policies that are used to manage such risks.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group reports in US dollars and the majority of its business is conducted in US dollars. All revenues from oil sales  
are received in US dollars and all costs except a portion of overhead expenses are incurred in US dollars. For currency 
exposure other than US dollars, a portion of the cash is kept in deposit in other currencies to meet its payments as required. 
No forward exchange contracts were entered into during the year.
Liquidity Risk
The Group currently has surplus cash, which has been placed in deposits and short-term investments which can be 
converted into cash at short notice ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet the Group’s expenditure requirements. Hardy has no 
outstanding loan obligations at balance sheet dates.
Interest Rate Risk
Surplus funds are placed in deposits and short-term investments at fixed or floating rates. Hardy’s policy is to place deposits 
with well established banks or financial institutions that offer competitive interest rates at the time of issue. 
Commodity Price Risks
The Group’s share of production of crude oil from PY-3 field is sold to GOI nominee Chennai Petroleum Corporation 
Limited. The price is arrived at based on an average price for the 30-day period commencing 15 days before and ending 
15 days after the delivery of crude oil. No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into by the Group.
Credit Risk
All Hardy’s sales are to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited, a state oil company in India. As it is GOI nominee for the 
purchase of crude oil, the credit risk is negligible.
In case of deposits and other money market instruments, as a general rule, the banks and financial institutions wherein the 
deposits are placed have credit ratings of not less than AA or equivalent, which are verified before placing the deposits. 
Cash surpluses are also invested in short-term investments represented by certain liquid funds. These funds are primarily 
invested in term deposits and graded commercial papers of not less than AA.

Notes: 
1. The Geologic Chance of Success (GCOS) reported here represents an indicative estimate of the probability that the drilling of this prospect would 
result in a discovery which would warrant the re-categorisation of that volume as a Contingent Resource. The GCOS value for Contingent Resource 
is 100%. These GCoS percentage values have not been arithmetically applied within this assessment.
2. It is inappropriate to report summed-up prospective Resource volumes or to otherwise focus upon those other than the ‘Best Estimate’.
3. A ‘Prospect’ is defined as ‘A project associated with a potential accumulation that is sufficiently well defined to represent a viable drilling target’.
4. A ‘Lead’ is defined as a ‘Project associated with a potential accumulation that is currently poorly defined and requires more data acquisition and/or evaluation in 
order to be classified as a Prospect’. As such it must be appreciated that a Lead carries a higher risk than a Prospect.
5. In the event of a commercial development of a discovery, ONGC has the option to back-into the CY-OS/2 licence at an interest of 30%.

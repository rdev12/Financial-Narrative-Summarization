WHO WE ARE
Nostrum Oil & Gas is a multi-field 
E&P partnership operating in 
north-west Kazakhstan. Our main 
producing asset is the Chinarevskoye 
field located in the northern part  
of the oil-rich pre-Caspian Basin. 
Other assets currently include the 
Rostoshinskoye, Darzhinskoye and 
Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye fields, 
which are all located in the vicinity  
of the Chinarevskoye field and  
its gas treatment facility (GTF). 
Nostrum has 582 million of 2P 
reserves and has produced over  
16 million barrels of oil equivalent 
during 2013. 
WHAt WE d O
Nostrum Oil & Gas focuses on creating long-term 
shareholder value through the development and discovery 
of oil and gas reserves, as well as the production and sale  
of crude oil, stabilised condensate, LPG and dry gas. We 
have invested over US$1.5 billion in our licence area since 
2004. We have a highly skilled management team, which 
has delivered on numerous infrastructure projects as well  
as significant expansion of the reserve base over the last  
nine years. This expansion is the result of our own appraisal 
work, as well as successful M&A.
Our commercial products
Nostrum’s range of products includes crude oil,  
stabilised liquid condensate, LPG and dry gas. Currently  
all production comes from the Chinarevskoye licence.  
We have invested in developing our own infrastructure to 
control the transportation of our products until they reach 
the final off-taker. This transport serves a wide network of 
destinations and off-takers ensuring we always obtain the 
best possible prices. 
The change of name to Nostrum Oil & Gas during  
2013 reflects the development of the Partnership into  
a multi-asset operation. In addition, it is part of our  
strategy to continue to expand our portfolio of assets 
beyond our current four fields.

RESERv ES
An update of Nostrum’s reserves report was completed  
by Ryder Scott in December 2013. This report includes  
the reserves at Chinarevskoye and the three additional 
licence areas acquired in 2013. An overview of the  
reserves is provided below.
1P: The Proven reserve base grew from 195 mboe as  
of 31 December 2012 to 199 mboe. Taking into account 
approximately 16 mboe of production during 2013, 
Nostrum enjoyed a reserve replacement ratio of 102%.
2P: Total 2P (Proven and Probable) reserves increased by 
75 mboe to 582 mboe from 31 December 2012. The new 
licence areas account for 98 mboe of the total 2P reserves. 
The total Chinarevskoye 2P reserves were 483 mboe.
3P: Total 3P reserves were 691 mboe, of which 76 mboe  
are located in the Chinarevskoye field and 34 mboe in  
the new licence areas. This represents a decrease from  
the previous 3P estimate carried out in 2009, due to a 
combination of reserves moving into higher categories, 
cumulative production over the period and the additional 
information built over the last four years. This allows for 
more accurate 2P reserves to be calculated and removes 
the possible reserves which are now considered unlikely  
to be suitable for commercial production.
For a detailed breakdown of the reserve report please 
access: Ryder Scott reserves report.
Please see our website for more detail on the Ryder Scott reports.
Market positioning
Nostrum Oil & Gas is in a unique position on the market. 
The Company’s front-loaded investment programme has 
meant it is now a leader in terms of infrastructure in the 
region, with the ability to process significant volumes of raw 
gas via its gas treatment plant. In addition, its advantageous 
location in north-west Kazakhstan places it closer to its final 
off-take destinations.

Our investment case
Over half a billion  
of 2P reserves
Nostrum has developed a world-class portfolio of assets 
in north-west Kazakhstan. Our front-loaded investment 
programme has been at the root of our current highly 
favourable operational and financial position. With  
582 million of 2P reserves and production of more than 
16 million barrels of oil equivalent per year, Nostrum 
provides a unique combination of significant production 
and reserve upside and strong operational cash flow. 
Record 
levels of 
production
2013 saw an average 
daily production record 
of 46,178 boepd, 
compared to 36,940 in 
2012. This growth was 
driven by the further 
ramp-up of the GTF. We 
now expect a period of 
sustained production at 
levels above 45,000 
boepd for the next two 
years, before more than 
doubling production  
by the end of 2016. 
On 1 March 2013 Nostrum acquired 100% of the subsoil use 
rights related to three oil and gas fields (Rostoshinskoye,  
Darzhinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye) through  
its operating subsidiary Zhaikmunai LLP . The fields  
are located in the pre-Caspian Basin to the north-west  
of Uralsk, approximately 60-120 kilometres from the 
Chinarevskoye field, our current main producing  
asset. The total consideration paid for these fields  
was US$16 million.
World-class 
portfolio  
of assets
Excellent financial 
performance
Excellent production levels 
and a stable oil price in 
2013 resulted in our best 
financial performance to 
date. Nostrum produced 
record revenue (US$895 
million), EBITDA (US$550 
million) and net income 
(US$220 million) for a truly 
outstanding overall result.

Crude oil
Nostrum transports 100% of its crude 
oil through its own liquids pipeline 
from the field site. We then export  
85% of our crude oil through our  
rail terminal to various destinations 
ranging from Finland, to the Black Sea 
ports and the Ukraine. We are always 
looking to expand the number of 
destinations we sell to, in order to 
achieve the best possible netbacks. 
Condensate
Nostrum transports 100% of its 
condensate through its own liquids 
pipeline from the field site. We then 
export 100% or our condensate  
by rail to various destinations. The 
majority of our condensate is sold  
at the Black Sea ports; however, we  
are continually seeking to expand  
the possible destinations in order  
to achieve the best possible  
netbacks for the Company.

terminal. The LPG is then loaded on  
to special LPG trains, which transport  
it to the off-taker. The majority of our 
LPG is sold at Black Sea ports and

Nostrum transports dry gas for sale 
along its own 17-kilometre pipeline, 
which connects to the Central Asia

connection point.
Further production from our  
three new fields will all flow  
through the production facilities  
at the Chinarevskoye field and then 
follow the same transport routes,  
all of which have the capacity to 
accommodate the increased volumes.

Key milestones

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013 
Record production 
levels
•	 Average 2013 production  
was 46,178 boepd, above the 
45,000 boepd full year target.
•	 Q4 production was more than 
48,000 boepd, with the plant 
running at close to full capacity 
throughout the quarter.
•	 More than 50% of the 2013 
production came from liquids 
(crude, condensate, LPG).
Continued reserve 
growth
•	 1P: The Proven reserve base  
grew from 195 mboe as of  
31 December 2012 to 199 mboe  
as of 31 August 2013. Taking into 
account approximately 17 mboe  
of production during 2013, 
Nostrum enjoyed a reserve 
replacement ratio of 102%.
•	 2P: Total 2P reserves increased  
by 75 mboe from 31 December 
2012 to 582 mboe. The new licence 
areas account for 98 mboe of the 
total 2P reserves. 
•	 3P: Total 3P reserves reached  
691 mboe, of which 76 mboe  
are located in the Chinarevskoye 
Field and 34 mboe in the new 
licence areas. 
Transition to a 
multi-field model
•	 In 2013, Nostrum acquired 100%  
of the subsoil use rights related  
to three new oil and gas fields 
(Rostoshinskoye, Darzhinskoye  
and Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye)  
for a total purchase price of  
US$16 million. The fields are 
located in the pre-Caspian Basin  
to the north-west of Uralsk, 
approximately 60-120km from  
the Chinarevskoye field. This was 
the first step in our M&A strategy, 
marking the beginning of a wider 
strategic plan to consider further 
M&A opportunities in Kazakhstan.
Name change to 
Nostrum Oil & Gas
•	 Nostrum Oil & Gas has replaced 
Zhaikmunai as the name of the 
listed holding partnership. The 
name change reflects our strategy 
to further expand the Company’s 
assets in the region. Separating  
the names of the operating 
company and holding company 
allows us to easily communicate 
the acquisition of any additional 
operating companies.
Pursuit of an 
alternative listing
•	 Nostrum anticipates concluding  
the previously announced 
preparatory legal and regulatory 
work for a possible alternative 
listing during H1 2014. As part of 
this process, in December 2013 
Nostrum acquired Probel Capital 
Management NV, which was 
previously the Partnership’s 
principal external provider of oil 
and gas and management services. 
In conjunction with a possible 
alternative listing, we requested  
a waiver of the State pre-emptive 
right and consent from the Ministry 
of Oil & Gas in Kazakhstan for 
certain corporate restructurings 
contemplated for such a listing.  
On 30 December 2013 we received 
such waiver and consent from  
the Ministry of Oil & Gas of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. We 
currently intend to implement  
this corporate reorganisation in  
the first half of 2014, with the 
approval of our limited partners. FINANCIAL MILESt ONES OPERAtIONAL MILES t ONES

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013 
Strategic report
Record financial results
•	 Record revenue of US$895 million, 
EBITDA of US$551 million and Net 
profit of US$220 million ensured 
that all financial targets were 
exceeded in 2013.
•	 The Company ended the year  
with US$245 million of cash on its 
balance sheet, further reducing 
the net debt to EBITDA ratio 
below 1x, whilst also distributing 
34 cents per GDR and spending 
more than US$20 million on a 
share buyback programme.
Further increase in 
earnings per share
•	 An increase in net income  
from 2012 of US$57,510  
resulted in EPS growth of 37%, 
ensuring significant value 
continued to be delivered to 
shareholders during 2013.
Increase in level  
of distributions 
•	 Nostrum distributed 34 cents  
per common unit to its Limited 
Partners through its 2013 annual 
cash distribution. This was a 5%  
increase on the 2012 distribution. 
The annual distribution was  
a policy implemented by the  
Board in 2012, and the increase  
has reinforced the Company’s 
commitment to ensure that  
excess cash is reinvested in future 
growth, as well as considered  
for return to Limited Partners.
Introduction of a GDR 
buyback programme
•	 The Company bought back 
approximately 1.8 million GDRs 
during 2013. The programme  
was implemented to both fund  
the employee share option plan, 
and take advantage of the fact that 
the Company believed its shares 
were significantly undervalued.  
A total cash consideration of 
approximately US$20 million was 
used for this purpose during 2013. 
that existing production is 
maintained and that 100,000 
boepd can be achieved by  
the end of 2016.
GTU3 construction 
remains on track
•	 Certain key milestones in the 
construction of the third train  
of the GTF were achieved during 
2013. We have appointed 
Ferrostaal Industrie Anlagen 
GmbH (Germany) and 
Rheinmetall International 
Engineering (a 50% subsidiary  
of Ferrostaal) as the project 
manager in charge of managing 
the engineering, procurement, 
construction and commissioning 
of the entire third train project 
on behalf of our operating 
subsidiary Zhaikmunai LLP .  
The front-end engineering  
and design (FEED) study, 
prepared by Lexington Group 
International (USA), has been  
the basis from which Ferrostaal’s 
engineering team has been 
developing the project since 
late 2012. We intend to 
complete the procurement 
process of long-lead items 
during 2013, as well as start on 
construction works on the GTU3.
Record production 
volumes
•	 Nostrum exceeded its internal 
production target of 45,000 
boepd during 2013. We 
successfully increased the output 
from our gas plant during early 
2013, resulting in record levels  
for the year and also exceeding 
nameplate capacity during Q4 
2013. We expect production to 
now remain stable at 45,000 
boepd for the next 24 months.
Continued success 
shown in drilling results
•	 Nostrum resumed its focus  
on appraisal drilling in 2013. 
Successful results in the appraisal 
programme allowed for more than 
100% replacement of the Proven 
reserves. In addition, production 
drilling continued to plan. We 
currently have 29 producing wells, 
and we intend to drill 11-12 wells 
per year at the Chinarevskoye field 
over the next three years to ensure

Chairman’s statement
“ We made phenomenal progress during 
2013. We delivered record production 
and financial results, as well as taking 
our first steps in M&A.”
Delivering  
continued growth
With strong cash flows, low leverage 
and operational control, we are in  
an excellent position to achieve  
our targets. I am delighted with  
the performance of the management 
team in 2013 and look forward to 
achieving further success in 2014.
Strong financial performance
From a financial perspective, our 
performance was beyond all our 
internal expectations. The record 
levels of revenue and EBITDA in  
2013 were the result of many years  
of front-loaded investment and 
geological work. With EBITDA of more 
than US$550 million and margins still 
above 60%, I am delighted with the 
strong financial position we are in. We 
have continuously reduced leverage 
since our inaugural bond transaction  
in 2010, and are now able to enjoy 
access to the debt capital markets  
at far lower rates than before. 
We continue to manage our cash 
position prudently, whilst also  
looking to maintain a balance  
between shareholder distributions  
and investment in growth. I believe  
in the current oil price environment  
we can sustain these financial results 
over the coming years and provide  
an excellent platform from which to 
deliver our vision. 
Our vision 
Our vision is to become the leading 
independent oil and gas company  
in the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  
We have all the necessary skills to 
create a high-quality and complementary 
portfolio of assets in the FSU, and our 
strategy is built on extracting as much 
value as possible from the front-loaded 
infrastructure investments. I believe 
the management team has all the 
knowledge, experience and skill 
needed to deliver this vision over  
the coming years.
A clear strategy 
We are working to realise our vision 
through a clearly defined strategy, 
balancing organic development with 
opportunistic expansion through 
acquisitions. Our main priority 
remains, as always, to continue to 
deliver growth and shareholder value  
in a responsible and efficient way. 
A very successful year
We made phenomenal progress 
during 2013. We delivered record 
production and financial results as well 
as taking our first steps in M&A. We 
now have a portfolio of assets that  
will further prolong the lifespan of  
our infrastructure at full capacity.

during 2013
14
Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  A solid operational basis
Our financial performance was built  
on another record year of operational 
results. Production of 46,178 boepd 
was above the targeted 45,000 boepd. 
We are now entering a period of 
sustained production at levels above 
45,000 boepd. This steady production 
and associated cash flow will allow us 
to invest in further infrastructure and 
drilling to reach production of 100,000 
boepd by the end of 2016. During 
2013 we have refocused on the 
Chinarevskoye field appraisal, with a 
programme aiming to convert more 
Probable and Possible reserves into 
the Proven reserves (1P) category  
over the next three years. In addition 
to this organic growth, the cash flows 
we are generating allow us to grow 
reserves and extend production 
through our recently established  
M&A strategy. 
Our M&A strategy
We took our first steps in M&A during 
2013 by acquiring three additional 
licences in close proximity to our gas 
treatment facility (GTF). This was the 
first step in broadening our strategy  
to combine organic growth from  
the continued development of the 
Chinarevskoye field with growth 
achieved through M&A. Our M&A 
strategy has two clear elements.  
Firstly, we remain focused on the  
area around our GTF, where we can 
enjoy economies of scale by feeding 
our infrastructure with additional 
reserves to prolong the period of  
peak production. Secondly, we are 
looking further afield to other areas  
of Kazakhstan where we can build  
on our first-class track record of 
appraising and developing Kazakh  
oil and gas assets. I am delighted  
that we were able to add 98 million 
boe 2P reserves through the new 
fields, increasing our total 2P  
reserves to 582 million boe. I look 
forward to developing this aspect  
of our strategy in 2014 and beyond. 
t he highest corporate  
governance standards
At Nostrum, we are committed to 
implementing exemplary standards  
of corporate governance, which we 
recognise as key to our business.  
As such, we have voluntarily adopted  
a Group-wide corporate governance 
code based on the best practice of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
In addition, we have introduced 
internal control provisions in line  
with the Code, ensuring that we are 
fully compliant with our ongoing 
obligations under the UK Listing  
Rules and the UK Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules. As Chairman,  
I recognise that it is my role to  
provide the leadership to the board  
to ensure that it delivers on its 
responsibilities. The board takes  
its role very seriously in ensuring 
Group values are promoted. We have  
a zero tolerance approach to corrupt 
practices and we have a commitment  
at board level to maintaining a culture 
focused on our core principles of 
respect, honesty and transparency. 
This is based on our belief that  
good governance is fundamental  
to protecting value on behalf of  
our shareholders. The board sets  
the standard for the rest of the 
Company and works with 
management to embed these  
values throughout the organisation.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  Rewarding exceptional performance
We have continued to witness a 
tightening recruitment market as well  
as increased demand and competition 
for skilled and experienced employees. 
Our growth and success revolve around 
the quality and commitment of our 
people. We maintain a competitive 
remuneration policy by industry 
standards, to ensure that we can 
attract and retain the best people. 
It rewards exceptional performance 
with a balance between short- and 
long-term rewards and a 
comprehensive benefits scheme. 
We continue to grow our local content; 
more than 98% of our employees were 
Kazakh nationals as of the end of 2013. 
We will continue to develop our 
employment practices and policies  
to ensure we can attract and retain  
the best talent. 
Conclusion
2013 saw record operational and 
financial performance across our 
business. We benefited from a  
strong oil price environment,  
which helped the momentum of  
our financial growth and sustained  
our track record of shareholder 
distribution, which increased by 5% 
over 2012. Strategically, we made 
excellent progress in expanding our 
portfolio of assets within north-west 
Kazakhstan. In 2014, I expect our  
focus to shift towards ensuring the 
timely completion of our next GTF  
and building the feedstock in order  
to double production by the end of 
2016. We enter this next investment 
phase with a very strong cash position, 
low leverage and healthy margins.  
We have the platform to execute all 
our strategic initiatives, and this gives  
me great hope for Nostrum in 2014 
and beyond.

Chief Executive’s review
“ Reaching full processing capacity  
at the GTF alongside increasing our 
2P reserves to 582 mboe has been  
a tremendous achievement.”
201 3 was an  
outstanding year
2013 was an outstanding year. 
Reaching full processing capacity  
at the GTF alongside increasing our  
2P reserves to 582 mboe has been a 
tremendous achievement. We are now 
working on our second development 
phase, which will entail the construction 
and the commissioning of a new gas 
plant, as well as a sizeable drilling 
programme spanning the next  
4-5 years. The next GTF is a particularly 
critical part of our strategy, enabling  
us to double production before the 
end of 2016.
Excellent reserve growth
We enjoyed excellent reserve  
growth from the acquisition  
of three neighbouring fields, 
Rostoshinskoye, Darzhinskoye and 
Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye, allowing  
us to increase our 2P reserves to  
582 mboe. We now look forward  
to the appraisal programme at these 
fields, as well as further appraisal  
at Chinarevskoye, to ensure we  
can maintain peak production for  
as long as possible. 
The Chinarevskoye field continues  
to demonstrate its strong geological 
potential, as we were able to once 
again replace more than 100% of  
our Proven reserves in 2013. I am  
very excited about the future of our 
current asset base as well as the 
potential for further expansion  
over the coming years. 
Strong operational performance
The Chinarevskoye field is performing 
excellently. With the oil treatment 
facility (OTF) and the gas treatment 
facility (GTF) operating at nameplate 
capacities, we forecast a daily total 
production average of approximately 
45,000 boepd for 2014 and 2015. 
intensive drilling programme 
Thirteen wells were drilled as part  
of our 2013 programme. We now  
look forward to an intensive drilling 
programme of more than 50 wells  
over the next five years. We anticipate 
drilling 4-5 production wells each  
year, to ensure existing production is 
maintained, with the remainder of the 
wells targeting future feedstock for our 
next GTF and appraisal wells focused 
on shifting Probable and Possible 
reserves into the Proven category. 
t hird Gt F on track
During 2013, we took significant steps 
towards the construction of our next 
gas plant, which will allow faster 
monetisation of reserves, by increasing 
treatment capacity by an additional  
2.5 bcm of raw gas per year, to a total 
of 4.2 bcm per annum. Investments 
have already been made in the initial 
design of this third train and in the 
early-stage procurement of long-lead 
items. Construction and commissioning 
of this state-of-the-art infrastructure is 
forecast to be completed by mid- 2016, 
with production reaching 100,000 
boepd by the end of that year.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  implementing our M&A strategy 
In addition to proving up reserves at 
Chinarevskoye, our development plan 
also focuses on sustaining long-term 
production beyond Chinarevskoye 
alone. This is the basis of our M&A 
strategy, as reflected in the recent 
acquisition of the subsoil use rights 
related to three adjacent oil and gas 
fields, Rostoshinskoye, Darzhinskoye 
and Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye, in the 
close vicinity of the Chinarevskoye 
field. Based on Ryder Scott’s analysis, 
these fields have added 98 million of 
2P reserves, and we look forward to 
the results of further appraisal in the 
next 18 months.
By virtue of our size, development 
stage and production track record,  
we have acquired high visibility both 
locally and internationally and, as a 
result, are kept informed of further 
M&A opportunities. Our approach is  
to remain both pragmatic and prudent 
as we consider these options. Our 
main focus remains on north-west 
Kazakhstan, where we know the 
landscape and are already operating 
successfully. In addition, we would also 
consider opportunities outside of this 
region where we see the potential to 
create further shareholder value.

1
 Ensure construction of the next gas plant remains

appraisal of Chinarevskoye and our three new fields.
3

to ensure we can quickly and accurately evaluate  
the opportunities in the region.
4
 Ensure that the financial position of the Company 
remains stable.
Enhancing shareholder value
I believe that these objectives,  
if successfully achieved, will provide 
the platform to significantly enhance 
shareholder value. We have 
demonstrated in the past that we  
can deliver on our strategy and I am 
therefore confident as we enter 2014  
 
that we are well positioned to continue 
to achieve our goals. I look forward  
to successfully executing the next 
infrastructure project, whilst also 
ensuring the reserve base is not  
only maintained, but increased  
over the coming years.

Our aim is to double our production 
levels by the end of 2016. To do this, 
we are building an additional third 
train to our GTF, next to the existing 
two trains, which can currently treat  
a total of 1.7 bcm of raw gas per year. 
The capacity of this third train will  
be 2.5 bcm of raw gas, bringing the 
total GTF capacity to 4.2 bcm of  
raw gas annually with all three  
trains in operation.
The significant investment in 
infrastructure will be fully funded  
from operational cash flow. All  
other existing Nostrum-owned  
and -operated infrastructure, such  
as pipelines and rail terminals, have 
ample capacity to accommodate  
at least a doubling of the current 
production levels.

The Chinarevskoye field currently  
has well over half a billion boe of 
reserves. Ryder Scott, in its August 
2013 report, confirmed Proven 
reserves of 199 million boe, leading  
to a replacement ratio of more than 
100%. Our appraisal programme will 
focus on the Chinarevskoye field’s 
Probable reserves and Possible 
reserves. Over the next few years our 
target is to build our Proven reserve 
base towards 700 million boe. This will 
ensure that we can produce 100,000 
boepd until the end of our current 
licence in 2033. In addition, we also 
intend to start appraising the three 
recently acquired adjacent fields 
(Rostoshinskoye, Darzhinskoye and 
Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye), with a 
view to extending our reserve base. 
Over the last four years, drilling has 
focused mainly on production wells in 
order to secure feedstock for the GTF. 
With the feedstock in place, the focus 
will shift to a renewed appraisal drilling 
programme in order to transfer more 
of our Possible and Probable reserves 
into the Proven category. In the 
existing oil price environment, the 
current plan foresees approximately 
50 wells being drilled over the next  
4-5 years. Approximately 12 wells are 
planned for 2014 alone, more than  
half of which will be appraisal wells.
Taken together, these growth 
programmes will lay the foundations  
for more than doubling total 
production by the end of 2016,  
and extending production at this  
level well beyond 2020.
Exploration

We are also pursuing a strategy  
of growth through value-accretive 
acquisitions, in line with our goal  
to leverage existing infrastructure to 
further add reserves at low finding 
costs. The recent US$16 million 
acquisition of the Rostoshinskoye, 
Darzhinskoye and Yuzhno- 
Gremyachenskoye fields, all of  
which are located between 60 and  
120 kilometres from the existing GTF, 
marked a first step in this direction. 
Following completion of appraisal 
work on these three fields by the end 
of 2015, a development plan will be 
submitted to the Kazakh state. 
Opportunities for acquisitive growth  
in Kazakhstan are being evaluated on  
a continuous basis. We are building  
on our enviable development and 
operational track record in Kazakhstan 
by continuing to look for compelling 
acquisitions, which will further improve 
shareholder value. 25

Our long presence in Kazakhstan  
has led to a natural, gradual and 
ambitious involvement in sustainable 
development. Over the years, we have 
built a comprehensive corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) roadmap focused 
on employee security and welfare, 
investment in community building, 
and environmental protection and 
reporting. Each of these priorities  
is now part of the overall yearly 
management plan and is monitored 
against specific voluntary as well as 
compliance objectives. 
As such, we continue to strive  
to improve and implement new 
policies each year, in order to further 
bring sustainability to the core of all  
of our operations. 
We see CSR as an important indicator 
of non-financial risk and are constantly 
developing internal best practices  
to improve our standards. This is an 
important standalone part of our 
strategy, as well as complementary  
to all our other strategic initiatives. 
Sustainable development will remain  
a priority in 2014 and beyond.
Focusing  
on delivering 
shareholder value
5
Our strategy is centred on a  
balanced approach to investment  
in growth. This entails both a  
prudent cash management policy  
and returns to shareholders. 
We are in a strong financial position, 
with both revenue and EBITDA at 
record levels. For the next five years,  
our capital expenditure (CAPEX) 
programme can be fully funded  
from our operational cash flow. In 
addition, we intend to hedge all our 
non-scalable CAPEX components 
against oil price fluctuations. Finally, 
we aim to keep our net debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 1.5x, in addition to a healthy 
cash position, in order to offset the 
impact of any volatility in the oil price.
Our distribution policy was adopted  
in 2012, and distributions increased by 
5% during 2013. This will be pursued 
over the coming years, assuming it 
does not impact our cash balance or 
growth strategy in a fluctuating oil 
price environment. We also started 
implementing a GDR buyback 
programme in 2013. Finally, we 
continue to take significant steps 
towards achieving our goal of an 
alternative listing in 2014.

The oil and gas  
market in Kazakhstan
(1)
Strategic report
Market overview
Kazakhstan is a vast country, the size of western Europe. 
Its substantial reserves of natural resources ensure its 
enormous economic potential. 
Kazakhstan is both geographically  
and ethnically diverse, with a 
population of 15.7 million. Kazakh  
and Russian are the main spoken 
languages and Islam and Christianity 
the dominant religions. Landscapes 
vary wildly from mountainous regions 
to low-lying fertile plains and arid 
steppes. Its new capital, Astana, is  
an exercise in modernity.
Foreign investment in the Caspian  
oil sector has brought an economic 
boom, with GDP per capita having 
increased more than tenfold since  
the mid-90s. Inequality is less 
pronounced compared to its Central 
Asian neighbours, and unemployment 
low. Politically stable and with good 
infrastructure, Kazakhstan is a reliable 
operational environment.
Kazakhstan’s landlocked position 
means it is reliant on pipelines, as  
well as on its extensive rail network,  
for transporting oil. Kazakhstan’s 
dependence on Russia for export 
capacity is set to be further reduced 
with the proposed Kazakhstan  
Caspian Transportation System (KCTS).

Ov ERv IEW – tHE WId ER CASPIAN REGION
The Caspian region includes those 
parts of countries (including Russia  
and Iran) adjacent to the Caspian  
Sea. A part of Uzbekistan is also 
considered to be part of the Caspian 
region due to its proximity to the 
Caspian Sea. To date, the two 
significant crude oil-producing 
countries in the Caspian region have 
been Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. 
It is expected that these countries  
will continue to lead the region in 
crude oil production in the near  
future, driven by production  
growth from existing fields and the 
development of recently discovered 
fields. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan 
are the predominant gas producers  
in the Caspian region but do not 
produce significant crude oil volumes 
relative to Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. 
In addition, the areas of Russia  
and Iran near the Caspian Sea are  
not a source of substantial crude oil 
production for these countries. Russia, 
however, plays an important role in the 
region by providing a transportation 
corridor between the Caspian Sea and 
the Black Sea.
ECONOMIC GROWtH  
IN tHE REGION
Since 2000, Kazakhstan has 
experienced significant economic 
growth. Two of the main catalysts for 
this have been economic reform and 
foreign investment, much of which  
has been concentrated in the energy 
sector. Exports of crude oil have grown 
significantly since 2000, and most of 
the oil from Kazakhstan is currently 
delivered to international markets 
using pipelines which run through 
Russia to shipping points on the  
Black Sea. The opening of the  
Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) 
pipeline in 2001 substantially 
increased Kazakhstan’s crude oil 
export capacity.
INv ESt MENt IN K Az AKHSt AN’S OIL ANd GAS IN d USt Ry 
International investment into the 
Kazakh oil and gas sector has largely 
taken the form of join ventures, 
including co-operation with the  
state-owned oil and gas company  
JSC National Company KazMunayiGas 
(“NC KMG”), as well as production- 
sharing agreements and direct 
grants of exploration/production 
rights to subsoil users. Major projects 
in Kazakhstan include the Tengiz, 
Karachaganak and Kashagan fields.
In May 2003, President Nazarbayev 
approved a Caspian Sea development 
programme (currently not in effect) 
through 2015, to create new offshore 
blocks (potential oil fields) that were 
auctioned by the Competent Authority 
between 2003 and 2010. NC KMG  
has a mandatory share of at least  
50% in all projects related to the  
new offshore blocks.
OIL SUPPLy ANd d EMANd
According to BP’s Statistical Review  
of World Energy 2012, Kazakhstan 
ranked 1 1th in the world by oil reserves 
and 21st by gas reserves. Kazakhstan  
is the second largest oil producer 
(after Russia) among the former  
Soviet republics and has the Caspian 
region’s largest recoverable oil 
reserves. Kazakhstan’s Proven oil  
and gas reserves were 4.2 billion 
tonnes and 2.4 trillion cubic metres  
as at 31 December 2013.
The Kazakh government has  
stated that it expects oil and gas 
production to increase, respectively,  
to 150 million tonnes per year and  
79.4 billion cubic metres per year  
in 2015. Most of this growth is 
expected to come form the Tengiz, 
Karachaganak and Kashagan fields.
There are three major refineries in 
Kazakhstan supplying the northern 
region (at Pavlodar), the western 
region (at Atyrau) and the southern 
region (at Shymkent). All three major 
refineries are either in the control or 
joint control of NC KMG. Crude oil  
is also processed at mini refineries 
(private small refineries).
The refinery at Pavlodar is supplied 
mainly by crude oil from western 
Siberia; the Atyrau refinery runs  
solely on domestic crude from the 
western region of Kazakhstan, and  
the Shymkent refinery generally  
uses oil from the southern region  
of Kazakhstan. The Atyrau refinery  
is undergoing modernisation to  
provide some additional capacity  
and to allow the refinery to meet 
current European fuel standards. •

CRUd E OIL
Historically, the lack of pipeline 
capacity providing access to 
international markets has limited 
Kazakhstan’s ability to exploit its  
oil reserves. Currently, more than  
7,920 kilometres of Kazakhstan’s 
20,238 kilometres of pipeline are used  
in oil transportation. The three main 
pipelines are the Uzen-Atyrau-Samara 
(“UAS”) pipeline, the CPC pipeline, 
and the Kazakhstan-China pipeline. 
The UAS pipeline transports oil from 
fields in the Atyrau and Mangistau 
regions to Russia. The pipeline system 
runs for approximately 1,500 kilometres, 
from Uzen in south-west Kazakhstan to 
Atyrau, before crossing into Russia and 
linking with Russia’s Transneft system 
at Samara. The CPC pipeline is a  
major export route, extending over 
1,150 kilometres, originating in the 
Tengiz field, running through Russia 
and terminating a the CPC marine 
terminal on the Black Sea near the 
Russian port of Novorossiysk. The 
Kazakhstan-China pipeline comprises 
two existing Soviet-era pipeline 
sections and three major new pipeline 
sections with a total length of around 
2,800 kilometres from Atyrau in 
western Kazakhstan to Alashankou  
on the Kazakhstan-China border.  
In addition, the 1,768-kilometre 
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline delivers 
crude oil from Baku in Azerbaijan  
to a new marine terminal in the  
Turkish port of Ceyhan, and is the first 
direct pipeline link between the Caspian 
Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. 
Other pipeline routes from Kazakhstan 
are being considered, such as routes 
through the Caucasus region to Turkey 
and routes through Iran and Afghanistan. 
Rail transportation was the primary 
export route for Kazakhstan crude 
production before the development  
of the UAS and CPC pipelines,  
and it remains an alternative  
transportation option.
NAt URAL GAS
Most of the gas pipelines in western 
Kazakhstan, with the exception  
of Makat-Atyrau-Astrakhan, are  
designed to provide gas to CAC.  
The pipeline has two branches that 
meet in the south-western Kazakh  
city of Beyneu, before crossing into 
Russia and connecting with the 
Russian pipeline system.
In December 2010, Kazakhstan  
started the construction of the 
Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas  
pipeline, designed to transport  
gas from west Kazakhstan for  
use in the southern regions of the 
country and for export to China.
The Bukhara Urals gas pipeline 
originates in Uzbekistan and was 
initially built to supply gas from 
Uzbekistan to north-east Kazakhstan 
and Russia’s south-east Urals region. 
Bukhara-Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty is  
a transit pipeline that provides gas 
from Uzbekistan to Kazakhstan’s  
main southern population centre.
tRANSPOR t AtION
An important aspect of increasing 
hydrocarbon production in  
Kazakhstan has been the  
development of transportation 
infrastructure, as this in turn has  
raised Kazakhstan’s export capacity.
GAS SUPPLy ANd d EMANd
Increases in Kazakhstan’s gas 
production are expected to come 
primarily from associated gas at the 
Tengiz, Karachaganak and Kashagan 
fields. Most of Kazakhstan’s gas 
reserves are located in the west of  
the country near the Caspian Sea,  
with more than half of those reserves 
located in the Karachaganak field. 
Another important gas field, Amangeldy, 
is situated in the south of the country 
and is being developed by KazTransGas, 
a subsidiary of NC KMG.
Gas production has increased 
significantly since 2004, when the 
Parliament passed a law prohibiting 
the industrial production of oil and  
gas deposits without the utilisation  
of natural and associated gas.
According to the projections of the 
Competent Authority, Kazakhstan 
expects to increase its gas production 
to 79.4 billion cubic metres per year  
by 2015. t CO j OINt v ENt URE
The TCO joint venture was created  
in 1993 with the aim of developing  
the Tengiz and Korolev fields. The 
participants in the joint venture  
are Chevron Overseas Company, 
ExxonMobil Corporation, NC KMG 
and LukArco. The Tengiz field is 
located in the south-eastern part  
of the pre-Caspian Basin on the 
north-eastern edge of the Caspian 
Sea. It was discovered in 1979.
The Tengiz and Korolev fields have 
estimated recoverable reserves  
of between 750 million tonnes  
(5.5 billion barrels) and 1,100 million 
tonnes (8.1 billion barrels) of oil. The 
Future Growth Project is the next 
major oil production expansion in 
Tengiz, aiming to increase production 
to approximately 36 million tonnes 
(720,000 bopd) from 13.7 million 
tonnes in 2004.

GEOLOGy, RESERv ES & d RILLING
Geology
The Chinarevskoye field is a multi-layer 
structure with ten reservoirs and  
44 segments spread over three areas:  
The western area contains 16 segments 
the northern area has 24 segments  
and the southern area four segments. 
Hydrocarbons have been found in the 
lower Permian, Tournaisian, Givetian, 
Mulinski, Biski-Afoninski, Ardatovski, 
Famennian and Vorobyovski reservoirs.
Reserves
Based on the 2013 Ryder Scott report, as 
at 31 August 2013, the estimated gross 
Proven plus Probable hydrocarbon 
reserves at the Chinarevskoye field  
were 483.3 million boe, of which  
193.2 million bbl was crude oil and 
condensate, 72.4 million bbl was LPG 
and 216.8 million boe was sales gas. 
According to the 2013 Ryder Scott 
report, the Chinarevskoye field also 
contains approximately 76.2 million boe 
of gross Possible hydrocarbon reserves.
d rilling
Hydrocarbons were first discovered  
in the Chinarevskoye reservoirs  
during the drilling of nine wells in  
the Soviet era. 2004-2013 saw more 
than 50 wells drilled under the PSA.
2013 saw us meet our drilling target  
of 12-14 wells at Chinarevskoye,  
with a further 12 planned for 2014.  
The 2014 drilling programme includes 
4-5 production wells to maintain 
existing production, and 6-7 appraisal 
wells targeting moving Probable 
reserves into the Proven category  
and building feedstock for the next 
GTF. One exploration well will be 
drilled in the exploration area.

Exploration and production licences
Zhaikmunai LLP was granted 
exploration and production licences 
for the Chinarevskoye field in May 
1997. A production licence extension 
was received in December 2008, 
which is valid until 2033 for all oil and 
gas- bearing reservoirs and horizons 
covering 185 square kilometres  
of the licence area, except the north-
eastern Tournaisian reservoir, which 
is valid until 2031. The production 
licence covers all Proven, Probable 
and Possible reserves, as reported 
by Ryder Scott as at 31 August 2013. 
An exploration permit extension 
was granted in 2013 until 2015.
Production-sharing agreement 
(PSA)
In October 1997 , Zhaikmunai LLP 
entered into a PSA with the government 
of Kazakhstan. The agreement sets  
the parameters for the exploration  
and development of the Chinarevskoye 
field and the respective royalties,  
profit share and tax liabilities payable  
to the government. 
Outlook
The licence and the PSA are currently 
valid until 2031-33, depending on the 
geographical and geological area. 
Nostrum must comply with the terms of 
the exploration permit, the production 
permit and the development plans 
during this period. To date, Nostrum 
has met all of its capital investment 
obligations under the PSA.

Location
All our facilities are close to the main 
international railway lines, as well as 
several major oil and gas pipelines. 
This advantageous location provides 
access to flexible transportation links 
for the off-takers of the products. 
The facilities on-site have grown 
substantially, with two major capital 
investment phases of approximately 
US$1.2 billion each, one completed  
in 2011 and one currently underway.
Crude oil facilities
Our oil infrastructure consists of  
an oil treatment and gathering  
facility (OTF), capable of processing 
400,000 tonnes of crude oil per year, 
as well as a 120-kilometre oil pipeline, 
multiple oil gathering and transportation 
lines within the licence area, an 
oil-loading facility at the rail terminal, 
facilities with 30,000 cubic metres of 
oil storage space and railway cars for 
the associated crude oil and stabilised 
liquid condensate.
Oil and stabilised condensate 
pipeline and railway loading terminal
Our 120-kilometre oil pipeline  
and railway loading terminal were 
successfully completed in 2008. Since 
2009, the crude oil has been transported 
via the pipeline from the Chinarevskoye 
field site to the railway-loading terminal  
at a rail connection at Rostoshi,  
near Uralsk. Here it is stored and 
subsequently transported by railcar  
to final off-takers. 
Stabilised liquid condensate is also 
transported in the same pipeline, 
using a “PIG” system which separates 
the crude oil from the stabilised liquid 
condensate, protecting the product’s 
quality, which would otherwise be 
reduced in a multi-purpose pipeline. 
This ensures the products command 
higher export prices.
The oil pipeline has a maximum 
throughput of three million tonnes  
per year. The rail-loading terminal, 
which receives the crude oil and 
stabilised liquid condensate, has a 
capacity of 3-4 million tonnes per year. 
Infrastructure also includes crude oil 
storage tanks on site and at the rail 
terminal, condensate tanks on site and 
at the terminal and a loading facility  
at the railway terminal. The loading 
terminal allows for 32 railcars to be 
loaded simultaneously. The facility is 
also equipped with a vapour recovery 
unit, the first in Kazakhstan’s history. 
The entire infrastructure has the 
capacity to handle the planned 
increase in throughput, in line with  
our strategy to more than double 
production by the end of 2016.

Subsoil rights  
acquisition completed
In 2013 Nostrum signed an asset 
purchase agreement to acquire  
100% of the subsoil use rights  
related to three oil and gas fields  
in the pre-Caspian basin to the 
north-west of Uralsk. The signing  
of the supplementary agreements  
by the Ministry of Oil & Gas became 
effective from 1 March 2013, officially 
transferring subsoil use rights for the 
three fields to Nostrum.
Geology
Exploration activities during the  
last decades have successfully  
proven that the three fields contain 
hydrocarbons which are suitable for 
commercial production in several 
reservoirs of Permo-Carboniferous 
age. More specifically, the bulk of  
the hydrocarbons are located in the  
Visean and Bashkirian stages of the 
Carboniferous. Significant appraisal  
of the existing accumulations and 
exploration of deeper intervals is  
still required prior to development.
For more detail on the geology of  
the fields, please refer to our website.
Appraisal programme
The cost of appraisal activities in the 
three fields over the next 2-3 years  
is expected to be approximately  
US$85 million. These activities will 
include the acquisition of new 3D 
seismic data, as well as appraisal 
drilling in order to validate and  
expand the existing reserves reports, 
the results of which will determine  
the development programme and 
ensure the highest possible accuracy  
in hydrocarbon targeting.
Dedicated appraisal drilling during  
the period will provide greater  
detail on reservoir size and fluid 
composition, which cannot be 
resolved with the existing data.
The targets are the Permo-Carboniferous 
carbonate reservoirs, which are similar to 
those in the Chinarevskoye field. These 
were deposited under sub-tropical 
conditions in a bay formation.
t otal combined reserves
Nostrum has an outstanding track 
record of converting reserves. An 
updated reserve report of 31 August 
2013, carried out by external auditor 
Ryder Scott, has shown significant 
increases in estimations for Proven  
and Probable reserves compared  
with the December 2012 report and, 
for the first time, takes into account  
the three adjacent fields.
1P reserves were more than 100% 
replaced, growing to 199 mboe.  
2P reserves increased by 75 mboe  
to 582 mboe.
This shows that, in line with our strategy, 
Nostrum is continuing to grow its 
reserve base and is successfully 
moving towards its goal of 100,000 
boepd production by the end of 2016.

SALES ANd PRICING POLICy
The production, marketing and 
transportation of our liquid products  
are closely monitored and controlled  
by Nostrum, and make up the largest 
share of our revenues. The commercial 
production of dry gas adds significant 
benefits through the easy off-take of 
dry gas volumes using straightforward 
pipeline logistics, the generation of 
our own power supply and the partially 
sponsored supply of dry gas to 
neighbouring communities.
Liquids
Crude oil – shipped through our  
own 120-kilometre pipeline from the 
Chinarevskoye field to our own rail 
terminal in Uralsk, from where it is 
shipped in railcars to off-takers at 
various destinations. The benchmark 
price for our crude oil is Brent. In 
accordance with the PSA, we export 
85% of our crude oil production.
Stabilised liquid condensate 
– shipped through the same 120km 
pipeline to the rail terminal in Uralsk, 
from where it is shipped in railcars  
to off-takers at various destinations. 
The benchmark price for our stabilised 
liquid condensate is also Brent and 
100% of production is exported.
LPG – shipped in special LPG trucks 
from the Chinarevskoye field to rail 
terminals in Uralsk. From here it is 
shipped in railcars to end consumers 
and traders. The benchmark price  
for our LPG is the International 
Mediterranean LPG price Sonatrach 
for Black Sea deliveries, or the Brest 
quotation for Eastern European 
deliveries. More than 90% of our  
LPG is exported.
Liquids are transported and sold to 
countries such as Finland, the Ukraine 
and Turkey, or sold on an FOB Black 
Sea basis.
d ry gas – shipped through our  
own 17-kilometre pipeline from the

from where it is distributed by the  
off-taker. Prices for gas products  
are negotiated annually with the 
off-takers in a long-term framework 
agreement. All the gas is sold 
domestically at this connection point.
We are able to achieve a relatively high 
netback for our export production due 
to transportation of our products 
through our own infrastructure and  
the resulting quality guarantees.

Gas treatment facility (Gt F) and 
related infrastructure
The GTF was designed to treat raw  
gas from gas condensate reservoirs,  
as well as the associated gas coming 
from the OTF, into a mix of stabilised 
liquid condensate, LPG and dry gas, 
using a gas utilisation concept, to add 
to the crude oil production. The GTF 
associated infrastructure includes a 
power generation station, an LPG 
storage tank farm, an LPG loading 
facility at the rail terminal, LPG railcars 
and a 17-kilometre dry gas pipeline.
Gt F 1 (t rains 1&2/Gtu 1&2)
GTF 1 included the construction  
of two gas treatment units (GTUs). 
Each has the capacity to treat 
approximately 850 million cubic 
metres of raw gas. Both units are 
equipped with sweetening and 
dehydration units, and a sulphur 
recovery unit. 
GTF 1 is now producing at capacity, 
with an average annual production  
of 46,178 boepd in 2013. 
Gt F 2 (t rain 3/Gtu 3)
GTF 2 will add 2.5 billion cubic metres, 
bringing the total GTU capacity to  
4.2 billion cubic metres, more than 
doubling production by the end of 2016. 
Until this time, average production is 
expected to remain constant.
Power generation plant
The GTF also includes a gas-fired 
power generation plant with an output 
of 15 megawatts. This provides the 
field site with its required electricity.
Gas pipeline
Nostrum completed its own 
17-kilometre gas pipeline in 2011, 
linking to the Orenburg-Novopskov 
gas pipeline. The maximum annual 
throughput of this gas pipeline is 
several billion cubic metres. 
New field camp facilities
A new employee field camp was 
completed in 2012, with more than 
460 beds and modern facilities. The 
dormitories, canteen, recreational 
areas and a health clinic provide 
comfortable indoor living conditions 
throughout the year. 
Marketing
Our sales and marketing department 
employs experienced traders. The 
team is constantly working towards 
negotiating new off-take contracts  
and identifying efficient transportation 
options for these new products.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013 
Strategic report Our approach
Quality, health, safety and environment (QHSE) at Nostrum 
focuses on improving the management of health, safety 
and the environment, controlling risks and preventing  
any injury or ill health to employees and contractors, by 
providing a set of rules and guidelines based on a series  
of well-defined strategic objectives. 
Centralised function
The QHSE role was thoroughly revisited and restructured  
in 2012. This effort led to the creation of a centralised 
function with a flexible organisational structure. A new 
position of Head of QHSE was created and filled in 2013.
Please see our website for further details.
QHSE priorities for 2014 
In line with QHSE developments in 2013, the focus for 2014 
will be to expand the QHSE policy to include initiatives  
that go beyond our day-to-day activities. In particular, the 
following five elements have been identified as specific 
areas of focus where dedicated objectives and actions  
will be developed: 
•	 HSE leadership and supervision;
•	 Contractor HSE management;
•	 Hazard awareness and risk control;
•	 Driving and transportation safety; and
•	 Environmental reporting.
Health and safety
In 2014, further rules and guidelines will be developed 
according to our QHSE strategic objectives, resulting in 
specific indicators which will be monitored over time.  
These aim to improve the management of health, safety 
and the environment, as well as controlling risk and 
preventing injury or ill health to employees and contractors.
Key safety and labour safety indicators
New indicators will be added to the current number of 
man-hours without loss of working time (2013: 1.83 million), 
such as the total recordable incident frequency (TRIF), lost 
time injury, and lost time injury frequency (LTIFR).
Other KPis
Other KPIs will include employment and training indicators, 
and community involvement indicators.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting
Nostrum has been monitoring and reporting its greenhouse 
gas emissions over the last few years in accordance with 
Kazakh regulatory requirements. Starting in 2013, the 
Company, with the assistance of AMEC Earth & Environment 
UK Ltd, has also developed its GHG reporting in line with 
new regulations, which amend existing company law 
requirements in the UK. The data is reported on all emission 
sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These 
sources fall within the Company’s consolidated financial 
statements. No responsibility is taken for any emission 
sources that are not included in the consolidated financial 
statements. The results of the GHG emissions inventory are 
presented in the format recommended by the GHG Protocol.
d irect GHG emissions (Scope 1)
The following direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) sources  
have been identified: flares, heaters, incinerators, boilers, 
gas turbine plants, electric power stations, compressors 
and fugitive emissions. Table 1 presents Scope 1 emissions 
for 2013 and the previous three years. All six GHGs are 
presented separately and expressed in metric tonnes of 
CO

e). 2010 was chosen as the base  
year as per the National Plan for GHG Quota Distribution 
for 2013 pursuant to the Republic of Kazakhstan government 
resolution 1588 dated 13 December 2012.
Historically, the major part of stationary combustion 
emissions was attributed to flaring of associated gas  
at the oil treatment unit (OTU) and the gas treatment  
facility (GTF). The situation changed considerably after  
the GTF was completed.

indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2)
Nostrum does not use purchased steam, heating or 
cooling. The only purchased power related to indirect  
GHG emissions is electrical power, which is supplied to 
Nostrum facilities via the Zelenovskaya distribution  
network (ZapKazREK JSC) through its subsidiary Batys 
Energoresursy LLC. The regional emission factor  
(0.27086 tCO
2
/MWh) was calculated using Methodical 
Guidelines for the Calculation of GHG Emissions from 
Electrical Power Stations and Boiler Houses (Astana, 2010) 
and regional net thermal efficiency of Urals Natural Gas 
Fired Power Plants (73.3%).
Total direct and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 
Scope 2) and total GHG emissions are summarised in

GHG emissions were considerably reduced after the  
GTF came into operation in 2012. Further reductions in 
2013 were related to decreased volumes of fuel gas 
consumed, despite putting into operation additional 
energy facilities. A justification of the GHG emission  
factor for gas combustion was introduced in 2013  
using JSC Zhasyl Damu spreadsheet software.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  developing a GHG reduction capacity
According to its GHG emissions reduction strategy, 
Nostrum will determine its potential for GHG emissions 
reduction with the subsequent introduction of energy-  
and resource-saving measures. To establish this reduction 
potential we will:
•	 create a conceptual framework for our greenhouse gas 
emissions enterprise management system (GHG EMS);
•	 create a consistent information system for GHG  
emissions monitoring;
•	 perform an energy audit at the Company’s  
production facilities;
•	 develop an action plan to improve energy efficiency  
at industrial sites;
•	 develop the concept of transition to low-carbon 
development;
•	 consider the participation of the Company in  
carbon finance activities; and
•	 demonstrate the efficiency of the Company’s  
GHG emissions reduction measures.
To meet these ambitious targets, Nostrum plans to 
strengthen its QHSE department, conduct training  
for managers, and identify contractors able to provide 
effective assistance in improving energy efficiency and 
reducing GHG emissions. 
External audits
AMEC Earth & Environment UK Ltd carried out its first 
environmental study for Nostrum in 2007. From 2012, this 
has become an annual exercise, and the now yearly audit 
also includes an extensive health and safety assessment, 
over and above the standard environmental assessment.
AMEC Report (2013)
The AMEC Report 2013 can be summarised as follows:
•	 LLC Nostrum demonstrated a significant number of 
positive developments in environmental and industrial 
safety and integrity of approach to the development  
and improvement of its relevant management system;
•	 the audit of the Company’s production entities did not 
reveal significant noncompliance with state laws and 
regulations and international standards;
•	 AMEC notes that production activities of the Company 
comply with high standards of industrial and 
environmental safety; and
•	 the Company generally complies with the requirements 
established by state laws and regulations and international 
standards related to onshore oil and gas development.

Results for the year
The Group realised a net income of US$219.5 million in  
2013, an increase of US$57.5 million on the net income  
of US$162.0 million in 2012. This higher profitability was  
driven by increased revenue from increased production  
of hydrocarbons.
Revenue increased by US$157.9 million, or 21.4%, to 
US$895.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2013,  
up from US$737.1 million in the year ended 31 December 
2012, primarily due to the increase in output from the GTF.
Cost of sales increased by US$48.0 million, or 20.2%, to 
US$286.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2013,  
up from US$238.2 million in the year ended 31 December 
2012, primarily due to an increase in depreciation, depletion 
and amortisation, royalties, government profit share, 
materials and supply expenses and changes in stock, 
partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related taxes, 
well workover costs and repair and maintenance expenses. 
The increase of 20% in the cost of sales is in line with the 
increase in revenue in 2013 of 21% compared to 2012. On  
a boe basis, cost of sales decreased marginally by US$0.5, 
or 2.86%, to US$16.98 in the year ended 31 December 2013 
down from US$17.48, and cost of sales net of depreciation 
per boe decreased by US$0.12, or 1.20%, to US$9.92 in the 
year ended 31 December 2013, down from US$10.04 in the 
year ended 31 December 2012.
depreciation, depletion and amortisation increased by 
17.4%, or US$17.6 million, in the year ended 31 December 
2013 to US$119.0 million up from US$101.4 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2012. The increase is due to an 
increase in production without a similar increase in Proven 
developed reserves during the period.
Royalty costs are calculated on the basis of production 
and market prices for the different products. Royalties rose 
15.2% to US$39.4 million in the year ended 31 December 
2013, up from US$34.2 million, whereas production was  
up 25% to an average production of 46,178 boepd in 2013, 
from 36,940 boepd in 2012. The average Brent price for the 
year was down 0.6% to US$108.41 per bbl, from US$109.03 
per bbl in 2012.
Costs for government profit share increased by  
US$22.8 million, or 288.6%, to US$30.7 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013, up from US$7 .9 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2012, mainly due to the fact that the cost 
oil balance which had been carried forward from previous 
years was depleted in August 2013, causing the government 
share to substantially rise in the second half of 2013.
Materials and supply expenses together with repair, 
maintenance and other services and well work-over costs, 
decreased 1.5% to US$67.4 million in 2013, down from  
US$68.4 million in 2012. The increase of 132% in materials 
and supplies from US$5.3 million in 2012 to US$12.3 million 
in 2013 is the result of repair and maintenance works in 
2013 being focused on the facilities, specifically the GTF, 
and to a lesser extent on wells.
General and administrative expenses decreased by  
US$4.4 million, or 6.8%, to US$60.4 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013, from US$64.9 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2012, due primarily to a decrease in 
social programme expenditures of US$21.5 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2013, from US$21.8 million in the 
year 31 December 2012. This decrease was related to the 
completion in 2012 of the construction of a 37-kilometre 
asphalt road accessing the field site, with no similar  
expense incurred in 2013. The decrease in social costs  
was primarily offset by increased management fees and 
professional services.

Selling and transportation expenses increased by 
US$18.1 million, or 17.5%, to US$121.7 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013, up from US$103.6 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2012. This was driven primarily by 
an increase of US$15.4 million in loading and storage costs 
to US$37.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2013, up 
from US$21.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2012. 
This increase was primarily driven by the rise in output of 
LPG and condensate volumes.
Finance costs decreased by US$3.2 million to  
US$43.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2013, 
down from US$46.8 million in the year ended 31 December 
2012. The decrease in costs was primarily driven by the 
raising of a new bond in November 2012 with a significantly 
lower interest rate, with which an earlier bond was repaid.
Foreign exchange loss amounted to US$636,000 in the  
year ended 31 December 2013, compared to a gain of 
US$776,000 in the year ended 31 December 2012.
Other expenses increased to US$25.6 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013, up from US$6.6 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2012. The increase in other 
expenses was due to the increase in export duties paid by 
the Group. The export duties represent custom duties for  
the export of crude oil and customs fees for services such  
as processing of declarations, temporary warehousing etc. 
The Kazakh custom authorities, based on their interpretation 
of CIS free-trade legislation, have imposed custom duties 
on oil exports from Kazakhstan to Ukraine starting from 
December 2012. 
Profit before income tax amounted to a profit of 
US$362.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2013, 
compared to a profit of US$282.4 million in the year ended  
31 December 2012. The higher profitability was driven 
primarily by the increased revenue due to the increase  
in output of the GTF.
income tax expense increased to US$142.5 million  
in the year ended 31 December 2013, compared to 
US$120.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2012,  
an 18.4% increase. The increase in income tax expense was 
primarily due to the increase in profit before income tax.

General 
During the period under review, Nostrum Oil & Gas’s 
principal sources of funds were cash from operations and 
amounts raised under the 2010 Notes and the 2012 Notes. 
Its liquidity requirements primarily relate to meeting 
ongoing debt service obligations (under the 2010 Notes 
and the 2012 Notes) and to funding capital expenditures 
and working capital requirements.
Net cash flows from operating activities
Net cash flows from operating activities were  
US$358.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2013,  
as compared to US$291.8 million for the year ended  
31 December 2012 and were primarily attributable to:
•	 profit before income tax for the year of US$362.0 million, 
adjusted by a non-cash charge for depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation of US$120.4 million, and 
finance costs of US$43.6 million
•	 a US$14.5 million increase in working capital primarily 
attributable to:
 (i)  an increase in receivables of US$12.6 million, 
 (ii)  an increase in prepayments and other current assets 
of US$6.8 million and 
 (iii)  an increase other current liabilities of US$8.8 million; 
and
•	 income tax paid of US$154.5 million.
Net cash used in investing activities
The substantial portion of cash used in investing activities  
is related to the drilling programme and the construction  
of GTUs 1, 2 and 3. During the period from 1 January 2010 
through 31 December 2013, cash used in the drilling 
programme represented between 43% and 70% of total 
cash flow from investment activities.
Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities was US$132.4 million  
for the year ended 31 December 2013, primarily attributable 
to the payment of US$63.2 million in distributions and the 
interest paid on the Group’s 2010 Notes and 2012 Notes.
Cost minimisation policy
The Group’s cost control system allows it to closely  
monitor both capital expenditure and operational 
expenditure. The Group’s policy is to minimise costs on  
a unit of production basis. With the completion of major 
pieces of infrastructure, and the ramping up of production 
capacity, costs per boe produced have come down 
considerable over the past five years.

description  
of risk
Risk management Result 2013 and exposure 2014
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter 
difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments 
associated with its financial liabilities.
Liquidity requirements are monitored on a monthly 
basis and management ensures that sufficient funds 
are available to meet any commitments as they arise. 
The treasury policy requires the Group to maintain a 
minimum level of cash of US$100 million.
Commodity 
price risk
Commodity price risk is the risk that the Group’s 
current or future earnings will be adversely 
impacted by changes in the market price of crude 
oil. Commodity price risk is extremely significant  
to results of the Group’s operations, given that all 
sales of crude oil are based on the commodity 
price. Crude oil prices are influenced by factors 
such as OPEC actions, political events and supply 
and demand fundamentals.
The Group’s hedging policy is that, upon entering  
into longer term non-scalable capital expenditure 
commitments, it will hedge up to a maximum of 70%  
of its liquids production. The instrument the Group  
has employed in the past is a zero-cost-capped-collar. 
Such a contract fixes the floor price at a certain 
predetermined level while limiting the upside risk. The 
Group intends to maintain the same hedging policy 
going forward.
Foreign 
currency 
exchange  
rate risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk 
associated with transactions entered into, and assets 
and liabilities denominated, in currencies other than 
the functional currency of its operating entities, 
being the US dollar since 1 January 2009. This 
exposure is primarily associated with transactions, 
contracts and borrowings denominated in KZT 
(Kazakh tenge). Most of the Group’s cash inflows as 
well as its accounts receivable are denominated in 
US dollars, and most of the Group’s expenses are 
primarily denominated in US dollars.
The Group does not hedge its exposure to foreign 
exchange rate risk. Foreign exchange rate risk is 
limited, as the vast majority of its income is 
denominated in US dollars and expenditures are 
largely indirectly linked to US dollars as well. Even  
if procurement contracts are legally required to be 
stated in KZT, most material contracts have clauses 
that stipulate a certain exchange rate of the KZT to 
the US dollars.
interest  
rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk principally relates to 
interest receivable and payable on its cash deposits 
and borrowings.
The Group does not hedge interest rate risk, nor 
does it swap a fixed interest rate for a variable interest 
rate or vice versa. The Notes bear interest at a fixed 
coupon. The interest on the remaining portion of the 
2010-2015 bond is 10.5%. The interest on the main 
2012-2019 bond is 7.125%.
Credit risk Nostrum Oil & Gas sells all of its crude oil pursuant 
to contracts with one or more oil trader(s) who 
purchase(s) its production.
Nostrum Oil & Gas’s policy is to mitigate payment risk 
by requiring all purchases to be prepaid or secured 
by a letter of credit from an international bank.

near the Chinarevskoye field and will consider 
further acquisitions of oil and gas fields.
development 
projects
The Group’s planned development projects, in 
particular GTF phase 2, are subject to customary 
risks related to delay, non-completion and cost 
overruns, which could impact future production. 
The Group has engaged Ferrostaal, an 
experienced international project management 
firm, to manage its development of GTF phase 2 
and is contracting with reputable international 
equipment suppliers employing proven 
technologies for the project.
Commodity 
prices
The Group’s current or future earnings could  
be adversely impacted by changes in the market 
price of crude oil. Commodity price risk is 
extremely significant to the Group’s results given 
that all sales of crude oil are based on the 
commodity price. Crude oil prices are influenced 
by factors such as OPEC actions, political events 
and supply and demand fundamentals.
The Group’s current hedging policy is that, upon 
entering into longer term non-scalable capital 
expenditure commitments, it will hedge up to  
a maximum of 70% of its liquids production. The 
instrument the Group has employed in the past is  
a zero-cost-capped-collar. Such a contract fixes the 
floor price at a certain predetermined level while 
limiting the upside risk. 
interest rates This risk principally relates to interest receivable 
and payable on the Group’s cash deposits  
and borrowings.
The Group does not hedge interest rate risk nor 
does it swap a fixed interest rate for a variable 
interest rate or vice versa. The Group’s Notes bear 
interest at a fixed coupon. 
Subsoil use 
agreements
The Group may have disagreements with the 
Kazakh government regarding its subsoil 
operations or compliance with the terms of  
its subsoil use agreements.
The Group believes that it is in full compliance 
with the terms of its subsoil use agreements and 
maintains an open dialogue with Kazakh 
governmental authorities in this regard. 
Environmental 
compliance
The legal framework for environmental protection 
and operational safety is not yet fully developed 
in Kazakhstan and, given the changing nature of 
environmental regulations, there is a risk that the 
Group will not be in full compliance with all such 
regulations at all times. 
The Group has strengthened its HSE department 
over the past 18 months and regularly 
commissions independent environmental audits 
to monitor its compliance and best practice in  
this area.
t ax law 
uncertainty
The uncertainty of application, including retroactive 
application, of tax laws and the evolution of tax laws 
in Kazakhstan create a risk of additional payments 
of tax from assessments which the Group believes 
it is not subject to. 
The Group regularly challenges, either with the 
Kazakh tax authorities or through the Kazakh 
courts, tax assessments that it believes are 
inapplicable to it, either pursuant to the terms  
of its subsoil use agreements or applicable law.
Gas sale price The Group could be compelled by governmental 
authorities, purportedly acting based on Kazakh 
legislation, to sell its gas domestically at prices 
determined by the Kazakh government, which 
could be significantly lower than prices which the  
Group could otherwise achieve.
Based on the terms of its PSA and applicable  
law the Group does not believe that such 
legislation is applicable in its subsoil use of the 
Chinarevskoye field and has conveyed such  
a view to the Kazakh government.
The risks listed above do not comprise all those associated with the Group’s business and are not set out in any order of 
priority. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, 
may also have an adverse effect on the Group’s business. The risks listed above are constantly monitored by the 
management team and assessed when making business decisions.
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties in connection with its activities – the principal ones being listed  
in the table above. The respective management team actively seeks to identify, assess and mitigate such risks and uncertainties.
Further information on the financial risks faced by the Group and how they are managed is provided in the notes to the 
financial statements attached to this annual report.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  Nostrum Oil & Gas is committed to implementing good 
corporate governance practices, in the interest of all of our 
stakeholders. Adopting and implementing good corporate 
governance is a core principle of the Group in how we 
conduct our relations with investors, employees, customers, 
suppliers and business partners.
I am pleased that the Group has made significant progress 
towards achieving best practice in many areas of corporate 
governance since the partnership’s GDRs were first listed 
on the London Stock Exchange. The interim financial 
statements and operational updates that we now make 
available to the market are examples of our movement 
toward best practice in this area.
Our board committees have also become significantly 
more active over the past 12 months in carrying out their 
roles establishing processes, procedures and controls and 
informing and advising the board as a whole of the issues 
relevant to their terms of reference. In addition, the board 
itself carries out regular self-evaluations of its activity and 
effectiveness, and I believe that this process will make the 
board a more valuable asset and will guide the business 
going forward.
The board continuously takes into account corporate 
governance considerations when making plans and  
setting out the Group’s strategy and priorities. 
The board is committed to imbuing the Group’s declared  
principles and values throughout our business, as we firmly  
believe that this will further contribute to the Group’s  
long- term success as we grow.
As a limited partnership with GDRs admitted to the  
official list of the FCA, the partnership is not required  
to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. There are no statutory corporate 
governance recommendations applicable to limited 
partnerships formed in the Isle of Man. However, the board 
has established a corporate governance code for the Group 
and, in developing such a code, the general partner has given 
consideration to the best practice provisions on corporate 
governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
A copy of the partnership’s corporate governance code is 
available on the partnership’s website.
The general partner, in consultation with the partnership’s 
independent accountants and legal advisers, has also put in 
place procedures to comply with the internal control aspects 
of its corporate governance code. The board believes that it 
has put in place sufficient controls to allow it to ensure that the 
Group is able to comply with its ongoing obligations under 
the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, and under the rules applicable in Kazakhstan and the 
other exchanges on which its securities are traded.
The board considers that the partnership has complied 
throughout the 2013 annual accounting period with all 
relevant provisions set out in its corporate governance code.
Our directors possess diverse sector experience, ages, 
geographic and ethnic backgrounds. We believe that the 
directors have the appropriate mix of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge to enable them to discharge 
their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. The 
Group is also committed to achieving gender diversity at 
board level, and whilst there are currently no women on  
our board we will actively seek to add women to the board.  
We will continue to add directors based on objective 
criteria, to avoid tokenism and ensure the most qualified 
individuals are appointed to this role. 
We pride ourselves on taking a practical rather than 
formalistic approach to corporate governance, as we 
endeavour to act in the interests of all our stakeholders.  
I am pleased with the great strides the Group has made  
in this area as our governance framework has grown 
alongside the business as a whole.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013 
Corporate governance Corporate structure
The Group’s listed entity, Nostrum Oil & Gas LP , is a limited 
partnership which is organised under the laws of the Isle of 
Man, but which has its head office in Amsterdam and which 
is tax-resident in the Netherlands. The management of the 
Group is exercised by the board of directors of Nostrum Oil 
& Gas Group Limited, the general partner of the limited 
partnership. The board sets the strategy, policies and 
values applicable to all Group companies. 
The management of the Group’s principal operating 
subsidiary, Zhaikmunai LLP , a limited liability partnership 
organised under the laws of Kazakhstan, is exercised by its 
General Director on the basis of its articles of association 
(or charter) and decisions taken by the general meeting  
of its participants, which in each case are subject to the 
matters reserved for decision by the board of the general 
partner of the partnership.
This section of the annual report describes how the  
board of directors of the general partner has applied  
the main principles set out in the Group’s corporate 
governance code.
t he board of directors of the general partner
The board of directors of the general partner of the 
partnership considers all important management and 
policy matters in relation to the partnership and the Group. 
This includes setting the partnership’s strategic aims, 
ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources 
are in place for the partnership to meet its objectives, and 
reviewing Group management performance. The board  
also sets the Group’s values and standards and ensures  
that its obligations to all stakeholders are understood  
and met. A number of key matters are reserved for the 
board’s decision and are not delegated to management. 
A schedule of matters reserved for the board’s decision, 
along with the terms of reference of the board’s 
committees, can be found on the Group’s website.
The board currently has eight members, two executive 
directors and six non-executive directors, of whom  
three are considered by the board to be independent 
non-executive directors. There is a wide mix of  
nationalities represented on the Board, namely  
Belgian, English, German, Russian and Indian.
Board roles and responsibilities
Within the board, the roles of the chairman and chief 
executive officer are separate, with each having distinct  
and clearly defined responsibilities. The chairman, Frank 
Monstrey, is responsible for leadership of the board and  
for ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role.  
The chairman sets the agenda for board meetings in 
consultation with the chief executive officer and the Group 
general counsel. The chairman is also responsible for 
ensuring that the directors receive accurate, timely and 
clear information, and that there is effective communication 
with the limited partners. The chief executive officer, 
Kai-Uwe Kessel, provides leadership to the Group which 
enables the successful planning and execution of the 
objectives and strategies agreed by the board. He is also 
responsible for care of the Group’s assets and, jointly with 
the chairman, representation of the Group to third parties.
Eike von der Linden is the senior independent non-executive 
director on the board. He provides a sounding board for  
the chairman and serves as an intermediary for the other 
directors when necessary. He is available should the need 
arise to convey concerns to the board, other than through 
the chairman or the chief executive officer.
The other five non-executive members of the board  
are Piet Everaert, Atul Gupta (independent director)  
Mikhail Ivanov, Pankaj Jain and Steve McGowan 
(independent director).The board held five meetings  
in 2013, four of which were regular scheduled meetings. 
Messrs Monstrey, Kessel, McGowan, Everaert, von der 
Linden, Gupta and Ivanov attended five board meetings 
and Mr Jain attended four board meetings in 2013. Four 
board meetings are currently scheduled for 2014.
Board members also held a special meeting in Berlin on 
17 February 2014 with geologists, reservoir engineers  
and drilling experts from the Group to review the geology 
of the Chinarevskoye field, reserves and field development 
plans. Various presentations were made to the directors 
and discussion sessions were held on the Group’s strategy 
and activities in these areas. 
The board remains firmly focused on identifying and 
understanding the risks, whether they be operational, 
financial, legal or reputational, faced by the Group,  
and developing our internal controls and approach  
to managing such risks, to put the Group in the best 
position to achieve its strategic objectives.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  Board self-evaluation
The board conducts an annual self-evaluation of its 
performance and effectiveness and, in connection with that 
process, considers the independence of its non-executive 
directors. Following the 2013 review, the board considers 
that each of Messrs von der Linden, Gupta and McGowan 
continue to demonstrate their independence as directors 
of the general partner of the partnership.
In 2013 a detailed questionnaire was prepared by the 
Group general counsel and distributed to each board 
member for their feedback regarding the board’s 
performance and effectiveness. The directors were asked 
to provide their views on a range of subjects, including 
multiple questions in four principal areas: leadership, 
effectiveness, accountability and engagement.
The responses to the questionnaires were then collected, 
reviewed by the chairman and discussed with the other 
directors. Key findings and action items coming out of the 
self-evaluation include:
•	 It was suggested that there should be additional 
information provided to the independent directors in 
relation to recruitment of personnel and human resources 
strategy. The executive directors have adopted an action 
item to provide additional information in this area to the 
board in 2014.
•	 It was suggested that more time should be devoted  
to strategic discussion, as opposed to operational  
and financial reporting. The executive directors have 
adopted an action item which seeks to shift the balance 
of information presented to the board, to focus more  
on strategic matters, and less on simple reporting of 
operational and financial developments.
•	 It was noted that materials for consideration by the board  
in board meetings are not being distributed to board 
members sufficiently in advance of meetings, and the 
general partner has adopted an action item to make 
significant improvement in this area in 2014.
•	 It was suggested that there should be more information 
provided to the board regarding the decision-making  
of the remuneration committee. This has been adopted 
as an action item for 2014.
d irector induction
Each individual joining the board receives a full, formal 
induction package with materials on the Group’s business, 
and operational, financial and legal matters. They also 
participate in discussions with members of the board and 
representatives of major shareholders in order to obtain a 
good understanding of the challenges and opportunities 
faced by the Group.
Board committees
The board can delegate any of its powers, authorities  
and discretions (with power to sub-delegate) for such time, 
on such terms, and subject to such conditions as it thinks  
fit to any committee consisting of one or more directors. 
The board has established an audit committee and a 
remuneration committee, and will utilise other committees  
as necessary to ensure effective governance.
Audit committee
The board has established an audit committee that 
operates pursuant to written terms of reference. The  
audit committee is required to consist of at least two 
independent directors and at least one member who  
has recent and relevant financial experience. The audit 
committee consists of Mr McGowan, Mr von der Linden 
and Mr Gupta, each of whom is considered to be an 
independent director, and Mr von der Linden serves as 
chairman. The board considers each member of the audit 
committee to have appropriate financial experience. Please 
see page 76 for more detail on the audit committee.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee assists the board in 
determining its responsibilities in relation to remuneration, 
including making recommendations to the board on  
its policy on executive remuneration, determining the 
individual remuneration and benefits package of each  
of the executive directors and recommending and 
monitoring the remuneration of senior management  
below the level of the board. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter 
for the board as a whole.  The remuneration committee 
is currently comprised of Mr Monstrey (as chairman), 
Mr McGowan, Mr von der Linden, and Mr Ivanov, and 
schedules meetings not less than twice per year. At  
least one member of the remuneration committee  
must be an independent director.
As noted above, the remuneration committee has adopted  
an action plan to increase information provided to the 
board as a whole regarding its decision-making in 2014.
Communication with shareholders
Nostrum is in regular contact with its shareholders.  
We regularly issue press releases, we attend investor 
conferences globally, and our quarterly, half-yearly and 
annual results are always followed by an investor call. We 
are available for shareholder meetings with management 
and welcome enquiries. We are continually reacting to 
feedback to ensure our communications are in line with 
requests. Extensive information is available on our website, 
where shareholders or those with an interest in the  
Group can log their details to receive email updates.  
All shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM  
to discuss the progress of the Group.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013 
Corporate governance Management team
The board delegates to the management team the 
responsibility for overseeing the implementation by  
the partnership and its subsidiaries of the policies and 
strategy that it sets, and for facilitating the prerequisites  
for successful ongoing operations. The chief executive 
officer, Kai-Uwe Kessel, who has extensive experience in  
the oil and gas industry, leads the management team.  
All of the other members of the management team have 
significant experience in the oil and gas sector in general,  
and in Kazakhstan in particular. The members of the 
management team include the Group chief financial officer, 
the Group deputy chief executive officer, the Group general 
counsel, and the Zhaikmunai LLP general director, chief 
financial officer, chief operating officer, director of geology, 
commercial director and drilling director.
Annual general meeting (‘AGM’)
The annual general meeting of limited partners of the 
partnership was held on 28 June 2013, and members  
of the board and senior management were available to 
speak to limited partners and answer questions before  
and at the meeting. During the meeting itself, all 
resolutions presented were passed with votes ranging  
from 98.18% to 99.98% of the votes cast.
The 2014 AGM will be held in Amsterdam on a date to  
be specified in the Notice of Meeting to be published later 
this year, together with the resolutions to be proposed at 
the meeting. Details of the Notice will be published on the 
Group’s website. Shareholders unable to attend the AGM 
are encouraged to vote in advance of the meeting by using 
the proxy form sent with the Notice of Meeting.
Group Code of Conduct
The board has adopted a Code of Conduct for the Group 
that requires all Group personnel to act ethically and with 
integrity, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations 
and to act appropriately in the areas of personal conduct 
and equal opportunities. The Code of Conduct addresses 
conduct in the areas of health, safety and the environment, 
antitrust and competition, insider trading, maintaining 
records, controls and audits, conflicts of interest, prohibited 
payments, gifts and favours, interests in other businesses, 
activities in other businesses, use of Group assets, 
confidentiality, communication with outside parties, 
electronic security, personal data, personal conduct, equal 
opportunity, and controlled substances. The Code of 
Conduct can be found on the partnership’s website.
dealing Code
In addition, the board has adopted a Dealing Code for  
the members of the board, any persons discharging 
managerial responsibilities within the group and any 
relevant Group employees who may become aware of 
price-sensitive information, which is based upon the  
Model Code set out in the UK Listing Rules. The Dealing 
Code is designed to ensure that such persons do not deal 
in any of the Group’s securities when they or the Group  
is in possession of inside information or during close 
periods in accordance the UK Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules. The general partner is committed to taking all 
reasonable steps to ensure compliance with this Code by 
members of the board, all persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities, and any relevant employees of the Group.
t akeover Code
As a matter of law the UK Takeover Code does not apply to 
the partnership. As a result, a takeover offer for the limited 
partnership will not be regulated by the UK takeover 
authorities. However the partnership’s limited partnership 
agreement does include a number of takeover protections 
similar to those found in the UK Takeover Code, although 
these do not provide the full protections afforded by the 
Takeover Code.
No failures of corporate governance were identified  
in 2013.

Corporate governance Audit committee report
Corporate governance
continued
introduction
The audit committee oversees the relationship with the 
external auditors. Ernst & Young has provided audit 
services to the company prior and subsequent to its listing 
in 2008 on the secondary GDR market. In May 2013,  
prior to the company’s AGM of shareholders, the audit 
committee considered and recommended to the board  
the reappointment of Ernst & Young. This review took into 
account the results of the auditor assessment process, 
including the quality of the work and communication 
undertaken by the external auditor and the level of audit 
fees. The audit committee discusses the requirements  
for partner rotation with the external auditor to ensure 
appropriate independence and objectivity are maintained.
As part of its review of the financial statements prepared by 
the company, the audit committee reviewed the findings of 
the external auditor in respect of the financial statements.
The members of the audit committee at 31 December 2013 
were Mr Eike von der Linden (Chairman of the Committee), 
Mr Steve McGowan and Mr Atul Gupta. All members of the 
Committee are considered to have recent and relevant 
financial experience.
Compliance with corporate governance standards
Nostrum’s approach to corporate governance is primarily 
based on the UK Corporate Governance Code published 
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. 
As of 31 December 2013, Nostrum complied with all the 
principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (2010 version), in relation to the audit committee.
Role of the audit committee
The audit committee has responsibility for monitoring  
the integrity of Nostrum plc’s Group financial statements.  
It oversees the Group’s relationship with the external 
auditors and reviews the effectiveness of the external  
audit process. The audit committee also monitors the 
activity of the Internal Audit Department and reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and business 
risk management systems. The terms of reference of the 
audit committee are available on the Company’s website 
www.nostrumoilandgas.com, and its duties are categorised 
under the following headings: 
•	 the accounting and financial reporting processes  
of Nostrum Oil & Gas LP;
•	 the integrity and audits of the financial statements  
of Nostrum Oil & Gas LP;
•	 the Issuer’s compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements; and
•	 the qualifications, performance and independence of  
the independent auditor of Nostrum Oil & Gas LP .
The audit committee met five times in 2013 and once 
between the beginning of 2014 and the publication date  
of this annual report. Committee members were present  
in person at two of the meetings, while three meetings  
were conducted by conference call. The external auditor 
was present at the two meetings where the Group’s annual 
financial statements were discussed. Such presence 
provided the auditors with the opportunity to gain direct 
information relevant to the external audit process, as well  
as assist the audit committee with guidance on technical 
issues and factors relevant to the auditors when exercising 
their professional judgement.
The following sections summarise how the audit committee 
has fulfilled its duties in 2013, including the committee’s 
review of the 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  Financial reporting
At its meeting in March 2013, the audit committee  
reviewed the 2012 management letter from the auditors 
along with the Group’s 2012 audited financial statements.
At its May 2013 meetings, the audit committee reviewed  
the 2013 first quarter interim unaudited condensed 
consolidated financial statements. Following the review,  
the audit committee recommended the interim unaudited 
condensed consolidated financial statements for approval 
by the directors.
At its August 2013 meeting, the audit committee reviewed

Whistleblowing arrangements
Nostrum has established a whistleblowing policy and has 
also appointed two multi-lingual points of contact: one 
contact in Uralsk, easily accessible for employees working 
in Kazakhstan, and one contact in Brussels, easily accessible 
for employees working in western Europe.
internal audit
The audit committee receives quarterly reports and monthly 
updates from the Group’s CFO throughout the year. The 
monthly report summarises current business performance 
and issues. The quarterly reports encompass the results of 
audits and any consequential agreed management action 
with regard to significant audit findings.
The Group is in the process of establishing an internal  
audit function. The annual audit programme, across all 
operations, will be structured to complete annual audits  
of the key financial and operational cycles. The key  
business cycles include processes and activities in 
production, operational and capital expenditure, inventory 
management, marketing and sales, finance and reporting, 
treasury, fixed assets, human resources, HSE and IT.
internal controls and risk management
As part of the Group’s intended change to a primary  
listing, a comprehensive financial procedures report is 
being prepared detailing the Group’s internal controls and 
risk management systems and activity. The Audit 
Committee requested that, following this report, a Group 
internal control manual be created. The Group has in place 
internal controls and risk management systems in relation 
to the processes for both financial reporting and the 
preparation of consolidated statements. These systems 
include policies and procedures to ensure that adequate 
accounting records are maintained and transactions are 
recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation  
of financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems 
of internal control, which includes risk management, and for 
reviewing the effectiveness of these systems. The system  
of internal control is designed to identify, evaluate and 
manage significant risks associated with the achievement of 
the Group’s objectives. Because of the limitations inherent 
in any system of internal control, the Company’s system is 
designed to meet its particular needs and address the risks 
to which it is exposed. It is designed to manage risk rather 
than to eliminate risk altogether. Consequently, it can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Evaluation
In March 2014, the audit committee conducted its annual 
self-assessment of performance. This assessment included 
a review of the committee’s membership, procedures  
and resources, its roles and responsibilities and its 
relationship with the board. Concern was raised as to the 
appropriateness of the induction material. The company 
secretary has therefore been requested to provide suitable 
and detailed material for future new members of the  
audit committee. Aside from this observation, the audit 
committee concluded that its mandate and oversight 
performance were appropriate.
condensed consolidated financial statements for approval 
by the directors.
At its November meeting the audit committee reviewed  
the 2013 third quarter interim unaudited condensed 
consolidated financial statements. Following the review,  
the audit committee recommended the interim unaudited 
condensed consolidated financial statements for approval 
by the directors.
The following table sets out the attendance of each  
director at scheduled Nostrum board and board 
committee meetings. Board meetings and committees

Nominees Limited 188,182,948 99.99%

Appointment and retirement of directors
The structure, practices and committees of the board, 
including matters relating to the size, independence and 
composition of the board, the election and removal of 
directors, requirements relating to board action, the powers 
delegated to board committees and the appointment of 
executive officers, are governed by the general partner’s 
articles of association, the limited partnership agreement  
of the partnership, and the terms of the partnership’s 
relationship agreement and subscription agreement with 
the Claremont Group. The following summarises certain 
provisions of those documents.
Size, independence and composition of the board 
The board may consist of such number of directors as  
may be determined from time to time by a resolution of the 
general partner’s shareholders. Under the general partner’s 
articles of association, at least one of the directors holding 
office must be independent of the partnership, the general 
partner, its shareholder and its affiliates, as determined by 
the full board. Upon the death, resignation or removal of an 
independent director, the vacancy must be filled promptly. 
The current sole shareholder of the general partner is 
Thyler Holdings B.V., a member of the Claremont Group, 
which is controlled by Frank Monstrey and his spouse. 
In connection with Claremont’s 2009 subscription  
for limited partnership interests, the partnership and  
the general partner agreed to appoint one director 
nominated by Claremont (such person in turn being 
nominated by Baring Vostok Capital Partners pursuant  
to the investment agreement between Claremont and 
BVCP), together with an additional independent director  
to be nominated by BVCP and Claremont (subject to 
approval by the independent limited partners). Mr Ivanov 
was nominated by BVCP to the board and Mr Gupta is  
the relevant independent director.
In addition, Claremont has agreed in connection with its  
2010 sale of 50 million GDRs to KazStroyService Global B.V. 
that it would take reasonable steps, including voting as a 
limited partner in any general meeting of the limited partners, 
to procure that an individual nominated by KSS Global is 
appointed to the Board of the General Partner. Mr Jain  
was subsequently nominated as a director by KSS Global. 
Election and removal of directors
At every annual general meeting, one-third of the directors 
who are subject to retirement by rotation or, if their number 
is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to 
but not exceeding one-third retire from office by rotation 
provided that if there is only one director who is subject to 
retirement by rotation, he shall retire. Vacancies on the 
board may be filled and additional directors may be added 
by a resolution of shareholders of the general partner or  
a vote of the directors then in office, provided that any new 
directors satisfy certain eligibility requirements. Those 
eligibility requirements generally provide, among other 
things, that:
•	 a person may not be appointed to the office of independent 
director unless he or she has been approved by a majority 
of the limited partners independent of Thyler and its 
affiliates; and a person may not be appointed to the  
office of director unless he or she has been approved  
by a majority of the limited partners. 
A director, other than an independent director, may be 
removed from office for specified reasons, including for  
any reason by a written resolution requesting resignation 
signed by all other directors then holding office or by  
a resolution duly passed by the general partner’s 
shareholder following the proposal by the general  
partner and subsequent approval of a majority of limited 
partners. An independent director may only be removed  
by a resolution duly passed by the general partner’s 
shareholders following the proposal by the general partner 
and subsequent approval of a majority of limited partners 
independent of Thyler and its affiliates. 
Claremont has undertaken pursuant to the relationship 
agreement, among other things, not to vote on any 
resolution to appoint or remove an independent director 
unless the term of appointment of such independent 
director has expired and such independent director is 
seeking re-election at a general meeting of limited partners 
or the board has determined (acting reasonably) that the 
independent director is no longer independent.
Alternate directors
A director may, by written notice to the general partner, 
appoint any person, including another director, who has 
been approved by the board and who meets any minimum 
standards that are required by applicable law, to serve as  
an alternate director who may attend and vote in such 
director’s place at any meeting of the board at which the 
director is not personally present and to otherwise perform 
any duties and functions and exercise any rights that the 
director could perform or exercise personally. Michael 
Calvey has been approved, and has served, as an alternate 
director in the absence of Mikhail Ivanov.

in which a quorum is present or by a written resolution 
signed by all directors then holding office. When action  
is to be taken at a meeting of the board, subject to any 
requirements relating to the approval by independent 
directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors 
then holding office is required for any action to be  
taken other than with respect to the enforcement of  
any contractual or other rights under the partnership 
agreement and the relationship agreement. Matters 
relating to the enforcement of any such rights, if  
considered at a meeting of the board, may be decided  
by the vote of a majority of directors then holding office  
that are independent of Thyler and its affiliates.
Actions requiring approval by independent directors
In addition to requiring approval by the board, the 
following matters require the additional approval of a 
majority of the independent directors in order for any 
action to be taken with respect thereto: 
•	 dissolution; 
•	 any amendment of the partnership agreement that is  
not ministerial in nature or that has not been consented  
to by the limited partners; 
•	 the enforcement of any contractual or other rights that  
the general partner or the partnership may have against 
Thyler or any of its affiliates pursuant to any contract, 
arrangement or transaction entered into with Thyler or 
any of its affiliates, including the partnership agreement  
or the relationship agreement; 
•	 any amendment of the relationship agreement with  
Thyler and Claremont; and 
•	 any transaction with any related party not controlled  
by the general partner or the partnership.
Transactions in which a director has an interest
A director who directly or indirectly has an interest in a 
contract, transaction or arrangement with the general 
partner, the partnership or any member of the group is 
required to disclose the nature of his or her interest to  
the full board. With certain limited exceptions specified  
in the general partner’s articles, a director may not vote  
on or be counted in the quorum in relation to any resolution  
of the board or of a committee of the board concerning  
any contract, arrangement, transaction or any proposal 
whatsoever to which the general partner or any of its 
subsidiaries is or is to be a party and in which he has 
(directly or indirectly) an interest which is material (other 
than by virtue of his interests in shares or debentures or 
other securities of, or otherwise in or through the general 
partner or the partnership). 
A director may not vote or be counted in the quorum on 
any resolution of the board or committee of the board 
concerning his or her own appointment as the holder of  
any office or place of profit with the general partner, the 
partnership or any company in which the partnership is 
interested. Where proposals are under consideration 
concerning the appointment (including fixing or varying  
the terms of appointment or termination) of two or more 
directors to offices with the general partner, the partnership  
or any company in which the partnership is interested,  
such proposals may be divided and a separate resolution 
considered in relation to each director. In such case each  
of the directors concerned shall be entitled to vote (and  
be counted in the quorum) in respect of each resolution 
except that concerning his own appointment.
Appointment of a new general partner
The partnership agreement generally provides that the 
general partner may not transfer its general partner  
interest in the partnership to any person other than Thyler 
or an affiliate of Thyler, unless (i) the holders of a majority 
representing not less than 75% of the holders of the 
common units attending and voting at the relevant meeting 
consent to the transfer or (ii) there is a transfer of common 
units or GDRs representing not less than 50% of the total 
number of common units in issue from a limited partner 
and its affiliates to a third party in accordance with Clause 
18 of the partnership agreement. Upon such a transfer, the 
general partner may assign all or any of its general partner 
interests to such third party or, upon transfer of the entire 
share capital of the general partner to such third party, 
withdraw as the general partner of the partnership without  
the approval of the holders of common units from the 
partnership with effect from the date on which the 
replacement general partner assumes the rights and 
undertakes the obligations of the general partner under  
the partnership agreement.
In addition, following a proposal by the general partner,  
the prior approval of holders of 75% of the common units 
voting at a meeting of limited partners is required to permit 
the general partner to withdraw from the partnership upon 
appointment of a replacement general partner.  For as long 
as the relationship agreement with the Claremont Group  
is effective control over the general partner may only be 
transferred to a third party other than Thyler or its affiliates 
with the consent of limited partners representing not less 
than 75% of the common units attending and voting at the 
relevant meeting, which has the same substantive effect as 
if the general partner withdrew or transferred its interest in 
the partnership directly, unless the transfer is done in 
accordance with the paragraph above.
82
Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  Conflicts of interest and fiduciary duties
The partnership’s organisational, ownership and investment 
structure involves a number of relationships that could give 
rise to conflicts of interest between the partnership, on the 
one hand, and affiliates of its general partner or limited 
partners and holders of GDRs, on the other hand. In 
particular, conflicts of interest could arise, among other 
reasons, because: 
•	  the group’s arrangements with Thyler and its affiliates were 
negotiated in the context of an affiliated relationship, which 
may have resulted in those arrangements containing terms 
that are less favourable than those which otherwise might 
have been obtained from unrelated parties; and 
•	 conflicts of interest may arise between the partnership 
and the KazStroyService Group, which constructed the 
gas treatment facility for the partnership’s Kazakh 
operating subsidiary Zhaikmunai LLP , because Pankaj 
Jain, chief executive officer of the KazStroyService Group, 
is a director of the general partner.
Pursuant to the relationship agreement, Thyler has 
undertaken to ensure that the partnership is capable at all 
times of carrying on its business independently of Thyler 
and its affiliates (other than the partnership and any of its 
subsidiaries) and that all of the partnership’s transactions 
and relationships with Thyler and its affiliates (other than  
the partnership and any of its subsidiaries) are at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms.  
Indemnification and limitations on liability
The Partnership Agreement
Under the partnership agreement, Nostrum Oil & Gas LP  
is required to indemnify to the fullest extent permitted  
by law the general partner and any of its affiliates (and  
their respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders, 
partners, members and employees), in each case, against 
all losses, claims or other amounts arising from any and all 
claims incurred by an indemnified person in connection 
with the group’s business or by reason of their holding  
such positions, except to the extent that the same are 
determined to have resulted from the indemnified  
person’s bad faith, fraud or wilful misconduct, or in the  
case of a criminal matter, action that the indemnified 
person knew to have been unlawful.
In addition, under the partnership agreement, (i) the  
liability of such persons has been limited to the fullest 
extent permitted by law, except to the extent that their 
conduct involves bad faith, fraud or wilful misconduct, or  
in the case of a criminal matter, action that the indemnified 
person knew to have been unlawful and (ii) any matter that  
is approved by a majority of the independent directors  
will not constitute a breach of any duties stated or implied  
by law or equity, including fiduciary duties. 
The General Partner’s Articles of Association
Under the general partner’s articles of association, the 
general partner is required to indemnify, to the fullest 
extent permitted by law, its affiliates, directors, officers, 
shareholders and employees against any and all losses, 
claims or other amounts arising from any and all claims 
incurred by an indemnified person in connection with  
the group’s business or in respect of or arising from their 
holding such positions, except to the extent that the same 
are determined to have resulted from the indemnified 
person’s bad faith, fraud or wilful misconduct, or in the case  
of a criminal matter, action that the indemnified person 
knew to have been unlawful. In addition, under the general 
partner’s articles of association, (i) the liability of such 
persons has been limited to the fullest extent permitted  
by law, except to the extent that their conduct involves bad 
faith, fraud or wilful misconduct, or in the case of a criminal 
matter, action that the indemnified person knew to have 
been unlawful and (ii) any matter that is approved by a 
majority of the independent directors will not constitute  
a breach of any duties stated or implied by law or equity, 
including fiduciary duties, or adversely affect the right of 
any indemnified person to an indemnity thereunder. 
Insurance
The partnership and the general partner have obtained 
insurance under which the directors and officers of the 
general partner will be insured, subject to the limits of the 
policy, against certain losses arising from claims made 
against such directors and officers by reason of any acts  
or omissions covered under the policy in their respective 
capacities as directors or officers of the general partner, 
including certain liabilities under securities laws.
Related parties and related party transactions
Significant limited partners
As at the date of this report, the partnership has received 
notice that companies controlled by Frank Monstrey,  
the chairman of the general partner, beneficially own 
approximately 27.20% of the common units of the 
partnership (including those held through GDRs). In 
addition, companies indirectly controlled by Mr. Monstrey 
own 100% of the issued shares of the general partner.
The partnership understands that KazStroyService  
Global B.V., an entity which the partnership understands  
is indirectly controlled by Timur Kulibayev, Arvind Tiku, 
Lakshmi Mittal and Goldman Sachs, beneficially owns 
26.6% of the partnership’s common units (including those 
held through GDRs).
The partnership understands that Dehus Dolmen 
Nominees Limited, an entity which the partnership 
understands is affiliated with and controlled by Baring 
Vostok Capital Partners, holds a 15.4% interest in the voting 
rights of the partnership’s common units (including those  
held through GDRs).

Relationship agreement 
The partnership is party to a relationship agreement with 
Thyler Holdings B.V. (“Thyler”), the general partner and 
Claremont Holdings Limited (“Claremont”) dated 28 March 
2008 that regulates (in part) the degree of control that  
Thyler and Claremont and their affiliates (other than the 
general partner, the partnership and any subsidiary of the 
partnership) may exercise over the management of the 
partnership. The principal purposes of the relationship 
agreement are to ensure that the partnership is capable at all 
times of carrying on its business independently of Thyler and 
Claremont and their affiliates and that all of the partnership’s 
transactions and relationships with Thyler and its affiliates  
are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms.
Pursuant to the relationship agreement, each of Thyler  
and Claremont undertake to allow the partnership to  
be operated in the best interests of the limited partners and 
holders of the GDRs as a whole; to allow the partnership and 
its affiliates at all times to carry on business independently of 
Claremont and Thyler and its affiliates; and to allow for the 
partnership’s transactions and relationships with Thyler, 
Claremont and their affiliates to be at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms.
In addition, (a) Thyler undertakes to comply with the terms 
of the partnership agreement (as though it were a party 
thereto), not to amend the articles of association of the 
general partner in respect of certain specified actions  
and not to pass a shareholder resolution in respect of 
Claremont that would violate the terms of the relationship 
agreement; (b) the partnership undertakes to treat all 
holders of GDRs that are in the same position equally  
in respect of the rights attaching to such GDRs;  
(c) Claremont undertakes that any voting rights it holds in 
respect of common units shall not be exercised in respect 
of any resolution relating to a transaction, arrangement, 
agreement or dispute between the partnership, on the one 
hand, and Claremont and its affiliates, on the other hand, or 
to make any variations to the partnership agreement that 
would be contrary to the maintenance of the partnership’s 
ability to carry on its business independently of Claremont 
and its affiliates; and (d) each of Thyler and Claremont 
undertake not to vote on any resolution of the limited 
partners or the board of directors to appoint or remove  
any independent director unless the term of appointment  
of such independent director has expired and such 
independent director is seeking re-election or the board  
of directors has determined that the independent director  
is no longer independent.
Each of Thyler and Claremont has also undertaken that if 
Claremont (and/or its affiliates) agrees to sell, transfer or 
dispose of common units or GDRs representing not less 
than 50% of the total number of common units in issue to  
a third party in circumstances where the takeover provisions  
in the partnership agreement apply, they shall use their 
reasonable endeavours to procure that the acquiror (or  
its affiliates) shall also agree to purchase the entire issued 
share capital of the general partner (and Thyler has 
undertaken that, if required, it shall sell such shares in  
the general partner in such circumstances or otherwise 
permit the withdrawal of the general partner as the  
general partner of the partnership).
The relationship agreement will continue in full force  
and effect until the occurrence of the earliest of (i) the 
partnership’s securities ceasing to be admitted to the official 
list of the FSA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange; 
or (ii) Thyler (and its affiliates) ceasing to own 25% or more  
of the outstanding common units of the partnership. 
The directors believe that the terms of the relationship 
agreement enable the partnership to ensure that Thyler 
and its affiliates are not able to abuse their position as a 
holder of common units of the partnership and a 
shareholder in the general partner.
Gas treatment facility agreement
The partnership’s operating subsidiary Zhaikmunai LLP 
entered into an agreement with JSC OGCC KazStroyService, 
an affiliate of KazStroyService Global B.V., on 10 August 2007 
to engineer, design and construct Zhaikmunai LLP’s first gas 
treatment facility. The total cost of the construction of such 
first gas treatment facility, which was completed in 201 1, was 
approximately US$260 million.
Services Agreements
Certain senior managers provide their services to the 
partnership’s principal operating subsidiary Zhaikmunai 
LLP during the past year pursuant to a service agreement 
dated 27 March 2007 between Probel Capital Management 
N.V. and Zhaikmunai (the “Probel Services Agreement”). 
Probel was controlled by Mr Monstrey, the chairman of the 
general partner. Under the Probel Services Agreement, 
Zhaikmunai paid a fee to Probel calculated by multiplying 
the relevant executive’s or manager’s number of working 
days per month by the executive’s or manager’s daily rate 
as stipulated in the Probel Services Agreement. The 
aggregate compensation paid by Zhaikmunai to Probel 
under the Probel Services Agreement was US$17.5 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 (US$13.65 million for 
the year ended December 2012).
Certain personnel provide their services to Zhaikmunai 
pursuant to a service agreement dated 1 January 2009 
between Amersham Oil Limited (“Amersham”) and 
Zhaikmunai (the “Personnel Agreement”). Amersham is 
indirectly controlled by Mr Monstrey. Under the Personnel 
Agreement, Zhaikmunai pays a monthly fee to Amersham  
in return for Amersham’s provision of personnel and 
consultancy services for management and related activities. 
84
Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  The fee is determined each month the Personnel Agreement 
remains in force. The aggregate compensation paid by 
Zhaikmunai to Amersham under the Personnel Agreement 
was US$1.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 
(US$1.42 million for the year ended 31 December 2012).
Frank Monstrey, Kai-Uwe Kessel, Jan-Ru Muller and Thomas 
Hartnett provide their services to the partnership pursuant to 
a consultancy agreement between the general partner and 
Zhaikmunai Netherlands B.V. dated 1 September 2008 and  
as amended and restated on 17 September 2009, with  
effect from 20 December 2007 (the “Executive Services 
Agreement”). Zhaikmunai Netherlands B.V., formerly an 
affiliate of Probel, was subsequently transferred to the 
partnership on 1 January 2009. Under the terms of the 
Executive Services Agreement, Zhaikmunai Netherlands 
B.V. agrees to provide the consultancy services of these 
individuals to the general partner and its subsidiaries as 
consultants, rather than as employees of the general 
partner or any of its subsidiaries. Zhaikmunai Netherlands 
B.V. entered into a back-to-back services agreement with 
Probel dated 1 September 2008 and as amended and 
restated on 17 September 2009 (the “Probel Executive 
Services Agreement”), sub-contracting Zhaikmunai 
Netherlands B.V.’s responsibilities and obligations under 
the Executive Services Agreement to Probel, with effect 
from 20 December 2007, on materially the same terms as 
set out in the Executive Services Agreement.
On 28 February 2009, Zhaikmunai entered into a service 
agreement with Prolag, an affiliate of Probel, pursuant to 
which Prolag has agreed to provide certain commercial, 
marketing and other services to Zhaikmunai, including, but 
not limited to, consultations on Zhaikmunai’s sales strategy 
and effective marketing policy, structuring its pricing policy 
and providing regular consultations and assistance on 
financial matters such as budgeting, credit policy and finance 
control. Fees are agreed per project on an ad hoc basis, or 
otherwise an agreed fee is paid, calculated for the specified 
period of the services with reference to an agreed schedule 
set out in the agreement. The aggregate compensation  
paid by Zhaikmunai to Prolag under the agreement was 
US$1.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 
(US$2.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2012).
Other
Piet Everaert, a non-executive director, is a partner in

related parties as disclosed in the notes to the audited 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2013.

petroleum Hydrocarbons, whether solid, liquid or gaseous. The proportion of different compounds 
in a petroleum find varies from discovery to discovery. If a reservoir primarily contains  
light hydrocarbons, it is described as a gas field. If heavier hydrocarbons predominate,  
it is called an oil field. An oil field may feature free gas above the oil and contain a  
quantity of light hydrocarbons, also called associated gas.

related to three oil and gas fields – Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye – all located in the 
Western Kazakhstan region. On March 1, 2013 Zhaikmunai LLP has acquired the subsoil use rights related to these 
three oil and gas fields in Kazakhstan following the signing of the respective supplementary agreements related thereto 
by the Ministry of Oil and Gas of the Republic of Kazakhstan (“MOG”). 
On December 30, 2013 Nostrum Oil & Gas Coöperatief U.A. signed a purchase agreement to acquire 100% of Probel 
Capital Management N.V., located in Brussels, Belgium.  
Subsoil use rights terms 
The term of the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights originally included a 5-year exploration period and a 25-year 
production period. The exploration period was initially extended for additional 4 years and then for further 2 years 
according to the supplements to the Contract dated January 12, 2004 and June 23, 2005, respectively. In accordance 
with the supplement dated June 5, 2008, Tournaisian North reservoir entered into production period as at January 1, 
2007. Following additional commercial discoveries during 2008, the exploration period under the Chinarevskoye 
subsoil use rights, other than for the Tournaisian horizons, was extended for an additional 3-year period, which expired 
on May 26, 2011. A further extension to May 26, 2014 was made under the supplement dated October 28, 2013. The 
extensions to the exploration periods have not changed the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights term, which expires in 
2031. 
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Rostoshinskoye field dated February 8, 2008 
originally included a 3-year exploration period and a 12-year production period. On April 27, 2009 the exploration 
period was extended so as to have a total duration of 6 years. In January 2012 the MOG made the decision to extend the 
exploration period until February 8, 2015 and the corresponding supplementary agreement between MOG and 
Zhaikmunai LLP was signed on August 9, 2013. 
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Darjinskoye field dated July 28, 2006 originally 
included a 6-year exploration period and a 19-year production period. On October 21, 2008 the exploration period was 
extended for 6 months so as to expire on January 28, 2013. On April 27, 2009 the exploration period was extended until 
January 28, 2015. Upon receipt of the ownership rights Zhaikmunai LLP started the process of application for further 
extension of the exploration period.

The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye field dated July 28, 2006 
originally included a 5-year exploration period and a 20-year production period. On April 27, 2009 the exploration 
period was extended until July 28, 2012. On July 8, 2011 the exploration period was further extended until July 28, 
2014. Upon receipt of the ownership rights the Partnership started the process of application for further extension of the 
exploration period. 
Royalty Payments 
Zhaikmunai LLP is required to make monthly royalty payments throughout the entire production period, at the rates 
specified in the Contract.  
Royalty rates depend on hydrocarbon recovery levels and the phase of production and can vary from 3% to 7% of 
produced crude oil and from 4% to 9% of produced natural gas. Royalty is accounted on gross basis. 
Government “profit share” 
Zhaikmunai LLP makes payments to the Government of its “profit share” as determined in the Contract. The “profit 
share” depends on hydrocarbon production levels and varies from 10% to 40% of production after deducting royalties 
and reimbursable expenditures. Reimbursable expenditures include operating expenses, costs of additional exploration 
and development costs. Government “profit share” is expensed as incurred and paid in cash. Government profit share is 
accounted on gross basis. 
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION 
Basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared based on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are carried 
at fair value as stated in the accounting policies (Note 0). The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
US Dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousands, except when otherwise indicated. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical 
accounting estimates. It also requires from management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the 
Partnership's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 0. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Partnership and its subsidiaries as at 
December 31, 2013. A subsidiary and a structured entity are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on 
which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial 
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent 
accounting policies for all Group entities. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting 
from intra-group transactions and profit distributions are eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and the effect of potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another 
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases.  
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are included on the basis of the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured 
based on the consideration transferred at fair value, the fair value of identifiable assets distributed and the fair value of 
liabilities incurred or assumed at the acquisition date (i.e. the date at which control is obtained). The excess of the costs 
of an acquired subsidiary over the net of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities incurred or 
assumed, is capitalized as goodwill. Acquisition related costs are expensed when incurred in the period they arise or the 
service is received.

3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES 
Reclassification of comparative information 
The Group reconsidered the classification of Employee share option plan liabilities. In the consolidated financial 
statements as at December 31, 2012 Employee share option plan liabilities were classified as non-current. The Group 
reclassified Employee share option liabilities to current liabilities as at December 31, 2012 in accordance with the 
expected timing of settlement of these liabilities.

In addition, the Group reclassified the amount of withholding tax for the year ended December 31, 2012 from finance 
costs to general and administrative expenses in order to comply with the presentation in the consolidated financial 
statements as at December 31, 2013 and for the year then ended. Reclassifications do not affect the financial indicators 
of the Group.

New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof, adopted by the Group 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following 
amendments to IFRS effective as of January 1, 2013: 
 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – 
Amendments to IFRS 7; 
 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements; 
 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures; 
 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities; 
 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement;  
 IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011)  Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements

Improvements to IFRSs – 2009-2011 Cycle: 
 IFRS 1 – Repeat application of IFRS 1; 
 IFRS 1 – Borrowing costs; 
 IAS 1 – Clarification of the requirement for comparative information; 
 IAS 16 – Classification of servicing equipment; 
 IAS 32 – Tax effects of distributions to holders of equity instruments; 
 IAS 34 – Interim financial reporting and segment information for total assets and liabilities. 
The nature and the impact of each new standard and/or amendment are described below: 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to 
IFRS 7 
The amendment requires an entity to disclose information about rights to set-off financial instruments and related 
arrangements (e.g., collateral agreements). The disclosures would provide users with information that is useful in 
evaluating the effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. The new disclosures are required for all 
recognised financial instruments that are set off in accordance with IAS 32. The disclosures also apply to recognised 
financial instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of 
whether the financial instruments are set off in accordance with IAS 32. As the Group is not setting off financial 
instruments in accordance with IAS 32 and does not have relevant offsetting arrangements, the amendment does not 
have an impact on the Group. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including structured entities. IFRS 10 replaces the 
parts of previously existing IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that dealt with consolidated 
financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Structured Entities. IFRS 10 changes the definition of control such that 
an investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. To meet the definition of control 
in IFRS 10, all three criteria must be met, including: (a) an investor has power over an investee; (b) the investor has 
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (c) the investor has the ability to use 
its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. IFRS 10 had no impact on the consolidation of 
investments held by the Group. 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities – Non-monetary 
Contributions by Venturers. IFRS 11 removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities (“JCEs”) using 
proportionate consolidation. Instead, JCEs that meet the definition of a joint venture under IFRS 11 must be accounted 
for using the equity method. As the Group does not have JCEs, IFRS 11 had no impact on the Group. 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, 
associates and structured entities. None of these disclosure requirements are applicable for consolidated financial 
statements of the Group. 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change 
when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS. 
IFRS 13 defines fair value as an exit price. As a result of the guidance in IFRS 13, the Group re-assessed its policies for 
measuring fair values, in particular, its valuation inputs such as non-performance risk for fair value measurement of 
liabilities. IFRS 13 also requires additional disclosures. 
 
Financial statements Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
9 
Application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements of the Group. Additional disclosures 
where required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were 
determined. 
In addition to the above-mentioned amendments and new standards, IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards was amended with effect for reporting periods starting on or after January 1, 2013. The 
Group is not a first-time adopter of IFRS, therefore, this amendment is not relevant to the Group. 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011) 
IAS 19 (Revised 2011) includes a number of amendments to the accounting for defined benefit plans, including 
actuarial gains and losses that are now recognised in other comprehensive income and permanently excluded from 
profit and loss; expected returns on plan assets that are no longer recognised in profit or loss; instead, there is a 
requirement to recognise interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) in profit or loss, calculated using the 
discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation, and; unvested past service costs are now recognised in 
profit or loss at the earlier of when the amendment occurs or when the related restructuring or termination costs are 
recognised. Other amendments include new disclosures, such as, quantitative sensitivity disclosures. The amendment 
had no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. 
IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income – Amendments to IAS 1 
The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income. Items that could be 
reclassified (or recycled) to profit or loss at a future point in time (e.g., net gain on hedge of net investment, exchange 
differences on translation of foreign operations, net movement on cash flow hedges and net loss or gain on available-
for-sale financial assets) now have to be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified (e.g., actuarial 
gains and losses on defined benefit plans and revaluation of land and buildings). The amendment had no impact on the 
Group’s financial position or performance. 
IAS 1 Clarification of the requirement for comparative information (Amendment) 
The amendment to IAS 1 clarifies the difference between voluntary additional comparative information and the 
minimum required comparative information. An entity must include comparative information in the related notes to the 
financial statements when it voluntarily provides comparative information beyond the minimum required comparative 
period. The additional voluntarily comparative information does not need to be presented in a complete set of financial 
statements. 
The opening statement of financial position (known as the ‘third balance sheet’) must be presented when an entity 
applies an accounting policy retrospectively, makes retrospective restatements, or reclassifies items in its financial 
statements, provided any of those changes has a material effect on the statement of financial position at the beginning of 
the preceding period. The amendment clarifies that a third balance sheet does not have to be accompanied by 
comparative information in the related notes. The amendment did not have an impact on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group. 
IAS 32 Tax effects of distributions to holders of equity instruments (Amendment) 
The amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation removes existing income tax requirements from IAS 32 
and requires entities to apply the requirements in IAS 12 to any income tax arising from distributions to equity holders. 
The amendment did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
IAS 34 Interim financial reporting and segment information for total assets and liabilities (Amendment) 
The amendment clarifies the requirements in IAS 34 relating to segment information for total assets and liabilities for 
each reportable segment to enhance consistency with the requirements in IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Total assets and 
liabilities for a reportable segment need to be disclosed only when the amounts are regularly provided to the chief 
operating decision maker and there has been a material change in the total amount disclosed in the entity’s previous 
annual consolidated financial statements for that reportable segment. The Group provides this disclosure as total 
segment assets were reported to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The amendment did not have an impact 
on the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for the Group.

Standards issued but not yet effective 
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when 
they become effective. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 9, as issued, reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification 
and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard was initially effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, but Amendments to IFRS 9 Mandatory Effective Date of IFRS 
9 and Transition Disclosures, issued in December 2011, moved the mandatory effective date to January 1, 2015. In 
subsequent phases, the IASB is addressing hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The adoption of the 
first phase of IFRS 9 will not have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets and 
financial liabilities. The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when the final standard 
including all phases is issued. 
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities. 
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and provide an exception to 
the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment entity under IFRS 10. The exception 
to consolidation requires investment entities to account for subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss. It is not 
expected that this amendment would be relevant to the Group, since none of the entities in the Group would qualify to 
be an investment entity under IFRS 10. 
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32 
These amendments clarify the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off” and the criteria for non-
simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting. These are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2014. These amendments are not expected to be relevant to the Group. 
IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies (IFRIC 21) 
IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by 
the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation 
clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum threshold is reached. IFRIC 21 is effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The Group does not expect that IFRIC 21 will have material 
financial impact on its future consolidated financial statements. 
Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 
These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a 
hedging instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2014. The Group has not novated its derivatives during the current period. However, these amendments 
would be considered for future novations if any. 
4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial 
position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material change to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
are discussed below: 
Oil and gas reserves 
Oil and gas reserves are a material factor in the Group’s computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization 
(the ”DD&A”). The Group estimates its reserves of oil and gas in accordance with the methodology of the Society of 
Petroleum Engineers (the “SPE”). In estimating its reserves under SPE methodology, the Group uses long-term 
planning prices which are also used by management to make investment decisions about development of a field. Using 
planning prices for estimating proved reserves removes the impact of the volatility inherent in using year-end spot 
prices. Management believes that long-term planning price assumptions are more consistent with the long-term nature 
of the upstream business and provide the most appropriate basis for estimating oil and gas reserves. All reserve 
estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and 
engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data.  
Financial statements Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
11 
The relative degree of uncertainty can be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either 
proved or unproved. Proved reserves are more certain to be recovered than unproved reserves and may be further sub-
classified as developed and undeveloped to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. 
Estimates are reviewed and revised annually.  
Revisions occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geological, reservoir or production data; 
availability of new data; or changes to underlying price assumptions. Reserve estimates may also be revised due to 
improved recovery projects, changes in production capacity or changes in development strategy. Proved developed 
reserves are used to calculate the unit of production rates for DD&A.  
Fair value of financial instruments 
Where the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be 
derived from active markets, they are determined using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flows model. 
The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of 
judgment is required in establishing fair values. The judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, 
credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial 
instruments. 
Abandonment and site restoration provision 
The Group estimates future dismantlement and site restoration costs for oil and gas properties with reference to the 
estimates provided from either internal or external engineers after taking into consideration the anticipated method of 
dismantlement and the extent of site restoration required in accordance with current legislation and industry practice. 
The amount of the provision is the present value of the estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the 
obligation adjusted for expected inflation and discounted at applicable rate. The Group reviews site restoration 
provisions at each date of financial position and adjusts it to reflect the current best estimate in accordance with IFRIC 1 
Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities. Estimating the future closure costs involves 
significant estimates and judgments by management. Significant judgments in making such estimates include estimate 
of discount rate and timing of cash flow. The management made its estimate based on the assumption that cash flow 
will take place at the expected end of the subsoil use rights.  
Management of the Group believes that the interest rates on its debt financing shall provide best estimates of applicable 
discount rate. The discount rate shall be applied to the nominal amounts the managements expect to spend on site 
restoration in the future. The Group estimates future well abandonment cost using current year prices and the average 
long-term inflation rate. 
The long term inflation and discount rates used to determine the balance sheet obligation at December 31, 2013 and 
2012 were 7% and 10%, respectively. Movements in the provision for decommissioning liability are disclosed in 
Note 16. 
Taxation 
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount 
and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term 
nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the 
assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax bases of income 
and expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible 
consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective counties in which it operates. The amount of such 
provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax 
regulations by the Group and the responsible tax authority. Such differences in interpretation may arise for a wide 
variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies. 
Foreign currency translation 
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the consolidated financial 
statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The functional currency of the Partnership and 
each of its subsidiaries is the United States dollar (the “US Dollar” or “US$”), except for Condensate functional 
currency of which is Kazakhstani Tenge (the “Tenge”). 
  Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
12 
Transactions and balances denominated in foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group at their respective functional currency rates 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the 
profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interest (“NCI”) in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure NCI 
in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition related 
costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. Those acquired 
petroleum reserves and resources that can be reliably measured are recognised separately in the assessment of fair 
values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably measured, 
are not recognised separately, but instead are subsumed in goodwill.  
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition 
date fair value, and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income. It is then considered in the determination of goodwill. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or 
liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement is measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised either in the statement of profit or loss or 
as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is 
measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-
measured, and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for NCI over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of 
the identifiable net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred (bargain purchase), before 
recognising a gain, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the 
liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If 
the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of 
the acquiree are assigned to those units.  
Where goodwill forms part of a Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) and part of the operation in that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining 
the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the 
disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained. 
Exploration expenditure 
Geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged to profit or loss as incurred. Costs directly associated with 
exploration wells are capitalized within exploration and evaluation assets until the drilling of the well is complete and 
the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration and materials and fuel used, rig costs and 
payments made to contractors and asset retirement obligation fees. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further 
appraisal activity (e.g., the drilling of additional wells), it is probable that they can be commercially developed, the costs 
continue to be carried as an asset while sufficient/continued progress is made in assessing the commerciality of the 
hydrocarbons. 
All such carried costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm the 
continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery. When this is no longer the case, the costs are 
written off. The exploration expenditure expensed to profit or loss during 2013 amounted to US$ 3,810 thousand (2012: 
Nil).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Subsoil use rights and acquisition costs are initially capitalised in exploration and evaluation assets. Subsoil use rights 
acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or firmly 
planned, or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine that the discovery is economically viable 
based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and sufficient progress is being made on establishing 
development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned or the subsoil use rights have been relinquished or has 
expired, the carrying value of the subsoil use rights acquisition costs is written off through profit or loss. Upon 
recognition of proved reserves and internal approval for development, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil and 
gas properties. 
Oil and gas properties 
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as treatment facilities, 
pipelines and the drilling of development wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment as oil and gas 
properties. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to 
bringing the asset into operation and the initial estimate of decommissioning obligation, if any. The purchase price or 
construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
When a development project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain construction/development 
costs ceases and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for 
capitalisation relating to oil and gas property asset additions, improvements or new developments. 
All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated 
proved developed reserves of the field, except the Group depreciates its oil pipeline and oil loading terminal on a 
straight line basis over the life of the subsoil use rights. In the case of assets that have a useful life shorter than the 
lifetime of the field the straight line method is applied. 
Oil and gas reserves 
Proved oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities of commercially viable hydrocarbons which existing geological, 
geophysical and engineering data show to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs. 
The Group uses the reserve estimates provided by an independent appraiser on an annual basis to assess the oil and gas 
reserves of its oil and gas fields. These reserve quantities are used for calculating the unit of production depreciation 
rate as it reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits by the Group. 
Other properties 
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. 
Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are 
included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit or loss during the year in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight–line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 
 Years 
   
Buildings and constructions 7-15 
Vehicles 8 
Machinery and equipment 3-13 
Other 3-10 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment 
purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows of 
other groups of assets. If any such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset group 
is required, the Group makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. An asset group’s recoverable amount is the higher 
of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset group is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group and are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.   Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
14 
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is 
estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior 
years. Such reversal is recognized in the profit or loss.  
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognised in profit or loss in 
those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. 
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying 
amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at December 31 and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group 
of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. 
Borrowing costs 
The Group capitalizes borrowing costs on qualifying assets. Assets qualifying for borrowing costs capitalization include 
all assets under construction that are not being depreciated, depleted, or amortized, provided that work is in progress at 
that time. Qualifying assets mostly include wells and other operations field infrastructure under construction. 
Capitalized borrowing costs are calculated by applying the capitalization rate to the expenditures on qualifying assets. 
The capitalization rate is the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the Group’s borrowings that are 
outstanding during the period.  
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“NRV”). Cost of oil, gas condensate and liquefied 
petroleum gas (“LPG”) is determined on the weighted-average method based on the production cost including the 
relevant expenses on depreciation, depletion and impairment and overhead costs based on production volume. Net 
realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. 
Abandonment and site restoration (decommissioning) 
Provision for decommissioning is recognized in full, on a discounted cash flow basis, when the Group has an obligation 
to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a 
reasonable estimate of that provision can be made. The amount of the obligation is the present value of the estimated 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation adjusted for expected inflation and discounted using 
average long-term interest rates for emerging market debt adjusted for risks specific to the Kazakhstan market. The 
unwinding of the discount related to the obligation is recorded in finance costs. A corresponding amount equivalent to 
the provision is also recognized as part of the cost of the related oil and gas properties. This asset is subsequently 
depreciated as part of the capital costs of the oil and gas properties on a unit-of-production basis.

Changes in the measurement of an existing decommissioning liability that result from changes in the estimated timing 
or amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation, or changes to the 
discount rate: 
a) are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period. If deducted from the cost of the 
asset the amount deducted shall not exceed its carrying amount. If a decrease in the provision exceeds the 
carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognized immediately in the profit or loss; and 
b) if the adjustment results in an addition to the cost of an asset, the Group considers whether this is an indication 
that the new carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. If it is such an indication, the Group tests 
the asset for impairment by estimating its recoverable amount, and accounts for any impairment loss in 
accordance with IAS 36. 
Financial assets 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans 
and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as 
hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets 
at initial recognition. 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit 
or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.  
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method (EIR), less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. The losses arising from 
impairment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in finance costs.  
Accounts receivable 
Accounts receivables are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible 
amounts. An estimate for uncollectible amounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. These 
estimates are reviewed periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported as expense (credit) in the 
period in which they become known. 
Derecognition 
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognized when: 
 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; 
 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement;; and either 
(a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the 
asset. 
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred 
control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset. 
In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are 
measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.  Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
16 
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the 
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to 
repay. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the 
financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.  
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant 
financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter 
bankruptcy or other financial reorganization and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in 
the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 
Financial assets carried at amortized cost 
For financial assets carried at amortized cost the Group first assesses individually whether objective evidence of 
impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets 
that are not individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an 
individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with 
similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for 
impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognized are not included in a collective 
assessment of impairment. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected 
credit losses that have not yet been incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the 
financial assets original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any 
impairment loss is the current effective interest rate. 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is 
recognized in the profit or loss. Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued 
using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. The 
interest income is recorded as part of finance income in the profit or loss. Loans together with the associated allowance 
are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realized or has been 
transferred to the Group. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases 
because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is 
increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited 
to finance costs in the profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The 
Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognized 
initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables and borrowings. 
Subsequent measurement 
After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest rate method (“EIR”). Gains and losses are recognized in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized 
as well as through the EIR amortization process. 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance cost in the profit or loss.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
17 
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When 
an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognized in the profit or loss. 
Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if, 
and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference 
to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations (bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions), 
without any deduction for transaction costs. 
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation 
techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions;; reference to the current fair 
value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. 
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in 
Note 30. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
The Group uses a hedging contract for oil export sales to cover part of its risks associated with oil price fluctuations. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is 
positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are taken directly to profit or loss. 
The fair value of financial instruments contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. As 
at December 31, 2013 and 2012 the Group had no open hedging contracts. 
Cash and short-term deposits 
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and at hand and short term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, but exclude any restricted cash which is not available for use 
by the Group and therefore is not considered highly liquid – for example, cash set aside to cover decommissioning 
obligations. 
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Taxation 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred 
income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.  
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.  
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements

Revenue recognition  
The Group sells crude oil, gas condensate and LPG under agreements priced by reference to Platt’s and/or Argus’ index 
quotations and adjusted for freight, insurance and quality differentials where applicable. The Group sells gas under 
agreements at fixed prices. 
Revenue from the sale of crude oil, gas condensate, gas and LPG is recognized when delivery has taken place and risks 
and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer. 
Revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the 
Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. 
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain 
or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. 
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in additional paid-in 
capital. Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and no distributions are accepted in relation 
to them. Share options exercised during the reporting period are satisfied with treasury shares. 
Share-based payments 
The Group measures the cost of cash-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires 
determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. 
This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected 
life of the share option, volatility and distribution yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and 
models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 27. 
5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
On December 30, 2013 the Group has acquired 100% of the share capital of Probel Capital Management N.V. 
(“Probel”), a company providing management and consulting services to the Group, from Group’s related parties, in 
exchange for a cash consideration consisting of initial purchase price of US$ 28,836 thousand subject to a price 
adjustment based on accounts of Probel at December 30, 2013. The amount of the price adjustment has not yet been 
agreed or paid as at the date of the authorization of the financial statements for issue, but it is estimated that the amount 
will not exceed US$ 4,598 thousand. Respective liability for this amount has been recognized within other current 
liabilities (Note 19) as at December 31, 2013, part of which was offset against receivables of Probel from previous 
owners.  
Historically, certain senior managers of the Group have provided their services to the Group pursuant to a service 
agreement between Probel and the Group. The Probel acquisition was completed in connection with a proposed 
alternative listing of the Group’s listed entity, so as to comply with certain exchange requirements that listed companies 
be managed by persons employed by entities within the listed company’s group. The goodwill arising on acquisition 
represents the savings of the Group on management fees.

6. EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS 
During the year ended December 31, 2013 the Group had additions of exploration and evaluation assets of 
US$ 20,434 thousand (year ended December 31, 2012: US$ nil). The additions are mainly represented by the 
consideration related to acquisition of subsoil use rights of three oil and gas fields – Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and 
Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye in the amount of US$ 15,835 thousand, including capitalized contingent consideration under 
acquisition agreement of those oil and gas fields in the amount of US$ 5,300 thousand respective liabilities for which 
were recognized as other current liabilities (Note 19). Also additions to exploration and evaluation assets include 
expenditures on geological and geophysical studies in the amount of US$ 4,599 thousand.

14. PARTNERSHIP CAPITAL 
The ownership interests in the Partnership consist of (a) Common Units, which represent a fractional entitlement in 
respect of all of the limited partner interests in the Partnership and (b) the interest of the General Partner. At any general 
meeting every holder of Common Units shall have one vote for each Common Unit of which he or she is the holder. 
Under the Partnership Agreement, distributions to limited partners will be made either as determined by the General 
Partner in its sole discretion or following the approval of a majority of limited partners provided such amount does not 
exceed the amount recommended by the General Partner. Any distributions to the Partnership’s limited partners will be 
made on a pro rata basis according to their respective partnership interests in the Partnership and will be paid only to the 
recorded holders of Common Units.  
The following table summarizes the number of Common Units authorized and fully paid and do not have a par value, all 
but 10 of which are represented by Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”):

On June 28, 2013 the limited partners of the Partnership duly passed all proposed resolutions at the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”) of limited partners. Such resolutions included approval by the limited partners at the AGM of the 
distribution to the Partnership’s limited partners of US$ 0.34 per common unit, payable by the Partnership on July 26, 
2013 to common unit holders on the register of partners and interests at the close of the business on July 19, 2013. 
In September 2012, the Board of Directors of the General Partner approved the payment of the Partnership’s inaugural 
distribution of US$ 0.32 per Common Unit to the holders of the Partnership’s Common Units, representing a cash 
distribution of US$ 60,219 thousand (equal to approximately 20% of retained earnings at June 30, 2012). The 
distribution (in the amount of US$ 59,498 thousand, since the ESOP Trustee referenced in the following paragraph 
declined the distribution) was paid on October 2, 2012 to Common Unit holders on the register of partners and interests 
at the close of business on October 1, 2012. 
1,421,076 new Common Units (represented by GDRs) were issued in 2012 to support its obligations to employees 
under the Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP). The issued GDRs are held by Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited 
(“the Trustee”), which upon request from employees to exercise options, sells GDRs on the market and settles 
respective obligations under the ESOP. This trust constitutes a special purpose entity under IFRS and therefore, these 
newly issued GDRs are recorded as treasury capital of the Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2013 no 
new Common Units were issued and 285,375 share options were exercised by employees (year ended December 31, 
2012: 735,894 share options). The aggregate number of GDRs in respect of which share options may be outstanding 
under the ESOP must not exceed 5,000,000. There are no common units held by Partnership’s subsidiaries, except for 
the treasury shares held to support the ESOP. 
Additional paid-in capital includes excess of the sale price of treasury shares at the transaction date over their original 
cost, deducted by transaction costs incurred for issuance of treasury shares. 
Retained earnings and reserves include foreign currency translation reserve accumulated before 2009, when the 
functional currency of the Group was Tenge. 
Earnings per share (“EPS”) 
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the period by the weighted average number of Common 
Units outstanding during the period. 
The basic and diluted EPS are the same as there are no instruments that have a dilutive effect on earnings.

Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium (as defined below) as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the 
applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due

other senior indebtedness. The 2010 Notes and the 2010 Guarantees have the benefit of first priority pledges over the 
shares of Zhaikmunai Finance B.V. and Zhaikmunai Netherlands B.V.

any and all of the 2010 Notes. US$ 347,604 thousand aggregate principal amount of the 2010 Notes had been tendered 
into the Tender Offer, representing approximately 77% of the outstanding 2010 Notes, by the time the Tender Offer for 
2010 Notes expired on November 19, 2012. The holders of US$ 200,732 thousand 2010 Notes that accepted the Tender 
Offer have subscribed to the 2012 Notes of the same amount.

27. EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTION PLAN 
Employees (including senior executives and executive directors) of members of the Group receive remuneration in the 
form of equity-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for share appreciation 
rights, which can only be settled in cash (“cash-settled transactions”). 
The cost of cash-settled equity-based employee compensation is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using a 
trinomial lattice valuation model. This fair value is expensed over the period until vesting with the recognition of a 
corresponding liability. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with 
changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

The equity-based payment plan is described below. 
During 2008-2013, 3,182,958 equity appreciation rights (SARs) were granted to senior employees and executive 
directors of members of the Group, which can only be settled in cash. These generally vest over a five year period from 
the date of grant, so that one fifth of granted SARs vests on each of the five anniversaries from the date of grant. The 
contractual life of the SARs is ten years. The fair value of the SARs is measured at the grant date using a trinomial 
lattice valuation option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were 
granted. SARs are exercisable at any time after vesting till the end of the contractual life and give its holder a right to a 
difference between the market value of the Group’s GDRs at the date of exercise and a stated base value. The services 
received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. 
Until the liability is settled it is remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss 
as part of the employee benefit expenses arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions.  
The carrying value of the liability relating to 2,912,348 of SARs at December 31, 2013 is US$ 12,016 thousand 
(December 31, 2012: 2,131,723 SARs with carrying value of US$ 9,788 thousand). During the year ended 
December 31, 2013 728,487 SARs were fully vested (year ended December 31, 2012: 426,345). 
The following table illustrates the number (“No.”) and exercise prices (“EP”) of, and movements in, SARs during the 
year:  
 2013 2012

Total exercisable at the end of the year 1,808,348 – 1,311,170 – 
The weighted average fair value of SARs granted during the year ended December 31, 2013 amounted to US$ 6.22 per 
SAR and the weighted average price at the date of exercise for SARs exercised during the year amounted to 
US$ 8.22 per SAR (2012: US$ 5.96 per SAR). The Hull-White trinomial lattice valuation model was used to value the 
share options. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the plan for the years ended December 31, 2013 
and 2012: 
 2013 2012 
 
GDR price at the reporting date (US$) 13.0 10.7 
Distribution yield (%) 3.0% 1.5% 
Expected volatility (%) 85.0% 86.0% 
Risk-free interest rate (%) 2.0% 2.0% 
Expected life (years) 10.0 3.5 
Option turnover (%) 10.0% 10.0% 
Price trigger 2.0 2.0 
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may 
occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which 
may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Option turnover rate represents the rate of employees expected to leave 
the Group during the vesting period, which is based on historical data and may not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The model considers that when share price reaches the level of exercise price multiplied by the price trigger the 
employees are expected to exercise their options.

29. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS 
Taxation 
Kazakhstan’s tax legislation and regulations are subject to ongoing changes and varying interpretations. Instances of 
inconsistent opinions between local, regional and national tax authorities are not unusual. The current regime of 
penalties and interest related to reported and discovered violations of Kazakhstan’s tax laws are severe. Penalties are 
generally 50% of the taxes additionally assessed and interest is assessed at the refinancing rate established by the 
National Bank of Kazakhstan multiplied by 2.5. As a result, penalties and interest can amount to multiples of any 
assessed taxes. Fiscal periods remain open to review by tax authorities for five calendar years preceding the year of 
review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. Because of the uncertainties associated with 
Kazakhstan’s tax system, the ultimate amount of taxes, penalties and interest, if any, may be in excess of the amount 
expensed to date and accrued at December 31, 2013. As at December 31, 2013 management believes that its 
interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that it is probable that the Group’s tax position will be 
sustained. 
Abandonment and site restoration (decommissioning) 
As Kazakh laws and regulations concerning site restoration and cleanup evolve, the Group may incur future costs, the 
amount of which is currently indeterminable. Such costs, when known, will be provided for as new information, 
legislation and estimates evolve.  
   Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
30 
Environmental obligations 
The Group may also be subject to loss contingencies relating to regional environmental claims that may arise from the 
past operations of the related fields in which it operates. As Kazakh laws and regulations evolve concerning 
environmental assessments and site restoration, the Group may incur future costs, the amount of which is currently 
indeterminable due to such factors as the ultimate determination of responsible parties associated with these costs and 
the Government’s assessment of respective parties’ ability to pay for the costs related to environmental reclamation. 
However, depending on any unfavorable claims or penalties assessed by the Kazakh regulatory agencies, it is possible 
that the Group’s future results of operations or cash flow could be materially affected in a particular period. 
Capital commitments 
As at December 31, 2013 the Group had contractual capital commitments in the amount of US$ 26,842 thousand 
(December 31, 2012: US$ 23,088 thousand) mainly in respect to the Group’s oil field development activities. 
Operating lease  
In 2010 Zhaikmunai LLP entered into several agreements on lease of 650 railway tank wagons for transportation of 
hydrocarbon products for a period of up to 7 years for KZT 6,989 (equivalent of US$ 47) per day per one wagon. The 
lease agreements may be early terminated either upon mutual agreement of the parties, or unilaterally by one of the 
parties if the other party does not fulfil its obligations under the contract. 
The total of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases were represented as follows: 
In thousands of US Dollars 2013 2012 
    
No later than 1 year 12,501 12,586 
Later than 1 year and no later than five years 23,846 17,112 
Later than five years – – 
Lease expenses of railway tank wagons for the year ended December 31, 2013 amounted to US$ 12,628 thousand (the 
year ended December 31, 2012: US$ 10,705 thousand). 
Social and education commitments 
As required by the Contract (as amended by, inter alia, Supplement #9), Zhaikmunai LLP is obliged to: 
 spend US$ 300 thousand per annum to finance social infrastructure; 
 perform repair and reconstruction of state automobile roads for the amount of US$ 12,000 thousand in 2012; 
 make an accrual of one percent per annum of the financial obligations for the Chinarevskoye field for the 
purposes of educating Kazakh citizens; and 
 adhere to a spending schedule on education which lasts until (and including) 2020. 
The contracts for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-
Gremyachinskoye fields require fulfillment of several social and other obligations. However, these obligations were 
amended in the year ended December 31, 2013 (in the case of Rostoshinskoye) or were (as at December 31, 2013) in 
the process of being amended (in the case of Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye).  
The current contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Rostoshinskoye field (as amended on 
August 9, 2013) requires the subsurface user to: 
 spend at least US$ 206 thousand of investments for education of personnel engaged to work under the contract 
during the exploration stage; 
 spend US$ 600 thousand to finance social infrastructure of the region during the exploration stage; 
 invest at least US$ 20,750 thousand for exploration of the field during the exploration period;  
 create a liquidation fund (special deposit account with local bank) equal to US$ 206 thousand.

Domestic oil sales 
In accordance with Supplement # 7 to the Contract, Zhaikmunai LLP is required to deliver at least 15% of produced oil 
to the domestic market on a monthly basis for which prices are materially lower than export prices. 
30. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, payables to Government of Kazakhstan, trade payables 
and other current liabilities. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the development of the 
Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field and its operations as well as exploration of the three new oil and gas fields – 
Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye. The Group's financial assets consist of trade and other 
receivables, non-current investments, current investments and cash and cash equivalents. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk 
and credit risk. The Group’s management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are 
summarized below.  
Commodity Price Risk 
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in price of crude oil, which is quoted in US Dollar on the 
international markets. The Group prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in 
respect of various levels of crude oil prices in the future. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is not exposed to interest rate risk in 2013 and 2012 as the Group had no floating-rate borrowings as at 
December 31, 2013 and 2012. 
   Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements

Foreign currency risk 
As a significant portion of the Group’s operation is the Tenge denominated, the Group’s statement of financial position 
can be affected significantly by movements in the US Dollar / Tenge exchange rates. The Group mitigates the effect of 
its structural currency exposure by borrowing in US Dollars and denominating sales in US Dollars.  
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US Dollars exchange rate, with 
all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets 
and liabilities).

Other current liabilities (10,436) – – – 
 (37,890) (10) 269 (846) 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with 
its financial liabilities. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its fair 
value. 
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool. The tool allows selecting severe stress 
test scenarios. To ensure an adequate level of liquidity a minimum cash balance has been defined as a cushion of liquid 
assets. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of 
notes, loans, hedges, export financing and financial leases.  
The Group’s policy is that, while it has an investment program on-going: a) not more than 25% of borrowings should 
mature in the next twelve-month period and b) a minimum balance of US$ 50 million is retained on the balance sheet 
post repayment or refinancing of any debt due in the next twelve-month period. 
The Group's total outstanding debt consists of two notes: US$ 92.5 million issued in 2010 and maturing in 2015 and 
US$ 560 million issued in 2012 and maturing in 2019. The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to 
refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.  
Access to sources of funding is sufficiently available and if there would be debt maturing within twelve months it could 
be rolled over with existing lenders.

Credit risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Group to credit risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable and 
cash in banks. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset. The 
Group considers that its maximum exposure is reflected by the amount of trade accounts receivable and cash and cash 
equivalents. 
The Group places its Tenge denominated cash with SB Sberbank JSC, which has a credit rating of Ba2 (stable) from 
Moody's rating agency and its US Dollar denominated cash with BNP Paribas with a credit rating of A2 (stable) and 
ING with a credit rating of A2 (negative) from Moody's rating agency at December 31, 2013. The Group does not 
guarantee obligations of other parties. 
The Group sells its products and makes advance payments only to recognized, creditworthy third parties. In addition, 
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts and 
recoverability of prepayments made is not significant and thus risk of credit default is low. 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating 
scorecard. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.  
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. The Group does not 
hold collateral as security. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its 
customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets. 
Fair values of financial instruments 
Set out below, is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Group’s financial instruments, 
other than those with carrying amounts reasonably approximating their fair values: 
 Carrying amount Fair value 
In thousands of US Dollars 2013 2012 2013 2012

Total 628,423 622,894 686,795 692,828 
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities represents the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value of the quoted notes is 
based on price quotations at the reporting date and respectively categorised as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  Nostrum Oil & Gas LP Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
34 
The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and 
other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
Capital management 
For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, additional paid-in capital and all 
other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group’s capital 
management is to maximise the shareholder value. 
In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it 
meets financial covenants attached to the notes that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the 
financial covenants would permit the borrowers to immediately call borrowings. There have been no breaches in the 
financial covenants of the notes in the current period nor the prior period. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the 
requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the 
distribution payment to participants, return capital to participants or increase partnership capital. The Group monitors 
capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group’s policy is to keep the 
gearing ratio between 20% and 40%. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less 
cash, short-term deposits and long-term deposits, excluding discontinued operations.

The remaining contingent consideration (312,168,910 Tenge for Darjinskoye and 487,375,905 Tenge for Yuzhno-
Gremyachenskoye) was paid to the sellers in January 2014. 
On February 11, 2014 the Tenge was devalued against the US Dollar and other major currencies. The exchange rates 
before and after devaluation were 155 Tenge/US Dollar and 185 Tenge/US Dollar respectively. 
On February 14, 2014, Nostrum Oil & Gas Finance B.V., a subsidiary of Zhaikmunai Netherlands B.V. (established on 
January 15, 2014), issued USD 400 million notes at a coupon of 6.325% maturing 2019. The Notes are jointly and 
severally guaranteed on a senior basis by Nostrum Oil & Gas LP and all of its subsidiaries other than Nostrum Oil & 
Gas Finance B.V. On February 28, 2014, Zhaikmunai LLP entered into a deed of sale and transfer with Zhaikmunai 
Netherlands B.V. for the acquisition of the share capital of Nostrum Oil & Gas Finance B.V.. 
On March 3, 2014, in accordance with its hedging policy, Zhaikmunai LLP entered, at nil upfront cost, into a new 
hedging contract covering oil sales of 7,500 bbls/day, or a total of 5,482,500 bbls running through February 29, 2016. 
The counterparty to the hedging agreement was Citibank. Based on the hedging contract Zhaikmunai LLP bought a put 
at $85/bbl, which protected it against any fall in the price of oil below $85/bbl. As part of this contract Zhaikmunai LLP 
also sold a call at $111.5/bbl and bought a call at $117.5/bbl which further allowed Zhaikmunai LLP to benefit from oil 
prices up to $111.5/bbl and above $117.5/bbl.

The Group has had to confront unprecedented internal difficulties in
the USA against a background of the worst trading conditions in at least a
decade.  With the aid of our advisers, the Group’s management has in the
space of four months drawn a line under the accounting issue, committed
significant additional resources to strengthening the Group’s finance
function, conducted a full commercial review of the business and of its
balance sheet and negotiated renewed bank facilities with revised
covenants reflecting the current trading environment.
The Group is a half billion pound turnover business with leading positions in
each of its markets.  It is once again ready to take advantage of its
significant operating leverage as and when economic conditions improve.
The Board regrets that the past year has been a difficult one for all the
Company’s stakeholders but looks forward to making progress along the
road to recovery in the current year.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 Results
The year to 30 April 2003 has been the most difficult since the
inception of the Group in 1984.  The effect of slowing economies
in the USA and the UK, coupled with more difficult conditions in
the oil and gas sector, made for challenging trading conditions
particularly against the background of uncertainty about war in
Iraq.  Nevertheless all of this was manageable and was being
managed.  What had not been anticipated was the admission in
early March by the financial controller of our US subsidiary
Sunbelt Rentals, that he had been failing properly to reconcile a
number of balance sheet accounts.  The effects of this admission
were immediate.  On the following day the Group had been due to
make representations and warranties as part of a normal rollover
of part of its debt facility.  In the circumstances it was clearly
unable to do so and as a result was put in default of its banking
agreements.
It was gratifying therefore to be able to announce on 2 June the
conclusion of the forensic examination and the renewal of our
banking arrangements until January 2005.  As we noted in our
June statement “the Group will
generate a significant amount of 
cash over the next two years and
the Board expects to refinance 
the senior debt facilities well before
January 2005.” 
The knock on effects of the events of March were significant in
both the USA and the UK but particularly the latter, given the
Group’s status as a UK public company.  They are reflected in the
outcome for the year of a loss of £1.8m before exceptional items,
goodwill amortisation and tax, and in the scale of exceptional
charges incurred and a loss before tax of £42.2m.  The prior year
impact of the US accounting issue was £9.4m.  A-Plant has also
provided for the cost of the rationalisation of a number of its
businesses and for the centralisation of all of its UK accounting
and head office functions at Warrington, the total sum being
£7.4m.  In addition, the Group has taken the opportunity to
review the method by which it estimates the likely cost of
incurred insurance claims in the USA by moving from a case by
case analysis carried out by appointed independent claims
handling agents to a more conservative actuarial estimate of the
likely total cost of the self-insured risk.  This has given rise to an
additional current year expense of £2.7m and to an exceptional
£7.4m charge relating to the brought forward balance.  
Total exceptional costs therefore amounted to £31.4m in the year
of which £16.8m relates to the year to 30 April 2002 and prior and
£7.5m to the cost of advisory and commitment fees in respect of
the successful renegotiation of the Group’s debt facilities.

Chairman’s Report
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
The Group is a half billion pound turnover business with leading positions in each of its
markets. It is once again ready to take advantage of its significant operating leverage as
and when economic conditions improve. The Board regrets that the past year has been a
difficult one for all the Company’s stakeholders but looks forward to making progress
along the road to recovery in the current year. of approximately £1m in total have been charged to the profit and 
loss account over the last two years and no credit has been
taken in this year’s accounts for the anticipated recovery of these
or in respect of the US$15m of damages awarded to the
Company by the North Carolina business court as announced on
6 May 2003.
Dividend
It was with regret that the Board in late March withdrew the
previously declared interim dividend but it was clearly essential
at that time to conserve resources.  As announced in early June
resumption of dividends in future is dependent upon completion
of the refinancing anticipated before expiry of the existing
facilities in January 2005.  An announcement on future dividend
policy will be made once that refinancing has been completed.
Staff
The Group’s staff across the world have faced unprecedented
challenges in recent months in light of the uncertainty caused by 
the unexpected default under the bank facility.  They have
responded magnificently and our thanks go to all of them.
The Board
Finally, our congratulations to Philip Lovegrove on being
awarded the OBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List.

ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .3.
● While it is impossible to determine precisely the trading effects
of the US accounting irregularities they undoubtedly had an
impact on the Group’s performance in the last quarter.  On a
constant currency basis, total revenues for the year declined 2%
and EBITDA by 18%.  However, the effect of the weak US dollar
increased these reductions to 8% and 23% respectively at
actual exchange rates and operating profit before exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation declined by 49% at actual rates
with similar percentage declines in each division.  Actions taken
to reduce the cost base included a reduction of 23 in the
number of UK branches and a reduction of 7.1% in Group staff
numbers.
Sunbelt
Sunbelt continued to take market share in the USA although
trading conditions were the most challenging for over a decade.
These were exacerbated in the second half by the wettest
weather conditions on parts of the East Coast since records
began.  The maintenance of dollar revenues at last year’s levels
reflected maintained utilisation levels and the benefit of the
twenty-three branches opened in the previous year and four in 
the first half of the current year.  These benefits were offset by
increased pressure on rental rates.  The 0.2% decline in
Sunbelt’s dollar revenues compared with the collective decline of
6% in revenues reported by the top ten US equipment rental
companies in calendar year 2002.  Although cost reduction
measures were put in place, the drag effect of the additional 27
branches reduced Sunbelt’s profitability with its EBITDA margin
Chief Executive’s Review
Having addressed a number of significant coinciding issues the Board looks forward to
making progress on the road to recovery in the coming year. The Board is confident
that all three divisions will continue to be cash generative and that significant net free
cash flow will be generated in the coming year and beyond, with an attendant reduction
in debt levels.

(16.4%).
During the last quarter of the year Sunbelt implemented the
leading IT operating system in the US rental market.  This will
facilitate improved efficiencies in customer service and cost
control through a supplier rationalisation programme in the
coming year.  Capital expenditure will also be kept under tight
control being concentrated on higher margin products as part of
a reconfiguration of the rental fleet.
In recent months there has been a better balance between
supply and demand as major equipment disposal programmes
by our competitors appear to have been largely completed and
dollar revenues have continued broadly in line with those of a
year ago.
A-Plant
As previously mentioned the knock-on effect of the US
accounting problem had an adverse impact on A-Plant, our UK
subsidiary, as it damaged the confidence of customers and
suppliers.  As a result the positive trend achieved in the first half
and beyond was reversed.  Full year EBITDA margins were
27.4% (32.2%) while divisional profit margins fell to 4.4% (7.8%).
During the year the integration of the four regional accounting
offices and the UK Corporate and Marketing office into our new
Warrington facility was successfully completed on time and
within budget.  A-Plant’s business was also restructured on a
product basis to give our specialist and tool hire shop
businesses a national presence and our general equipment
locations a greater focus.
A national meeting of UK managers was held in June, supported
by a number of key suppliers, to confirm the successful outcome
of the banking discussions, to share with them our strategy and
business plan and to brief them on a significant new incentive
programme with a view to increasing market share.  The
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .5.
➲ achievement of this goal has been enhanced by the impending
announcement of a 3 year preferred supplier contract with one
of the country’s largest contractors.  The contract has a potential
value of several million pounds per annum.
Since the beginning of June there has been a steady increase in
the number and value of rental contracts towards the level of
early March.
Ashtead Technology
The offshore oil and gas industry was particularly weak in
Technology’s two principal markets, Aberdeen where the effects
were partially offset by serving customers in the West African
sector and Houston.  Despite the slow US economy the
environmental business continued to trade well.  Costs and
capital expenditure were kept under tight control.  Recently we
have seen improvement in the offshore market and Technology’s
management is more optimistic about the future than it has been
for some time.
Cashflow
The Group generated a net free cash inflow in the year of
£38.9m, a £68.1m turn-round on the previous year’s outflow of
£29.2m.  Net debt at year
end was £622.3m, £53.0m
less than the previous year’s
£675.3m.  At constant
exchange rates the
reduction was £21.2m.
Capital expenditure was
limited to £85.5m down
from £113.8m in the
previous year reflecting
economic conditions.  £71.0m was spent on the equipment fleet
of which £58.4m was replacement expenditure and £12.6m for
expansion.  The average age of the fleet at 30 April 2003 was a
fraction over four years in both the UK and the US but, in the
US, when the longer-life aerial work platform fleet is excluded,
the average fleet age for the rest of the fleet reduces to slightly
below three and a half years.  This means that the Group retains
a relatively young fleet, which is important at the current difficult
stage of the economic cycle.  Gains on disposal of fixed assets
were £2.7m up from £1.5m in the previous year.
It is anticipated that capital expenditure in the coming year will
remain at similar levels but with a higher proportion spent in the
UK.  Significant net free cash flow is also expected.
Response to the US accounting issue
Immediate action was taken in response to the US accounting
issue.  Sunbelt’s financial controller left the Company.  A
temporary replacement was installed who continues to provide
transitional support to a full time appointee who joined Sunbelt
in May.  A forensic investigation was undertaken by KPMG
reporting to the Group and its banks.  Deloitte & Touche was
also employed to assist the Company in the production and
review of detailed business plans across the Group.  An
ambitious target date of the end of May was set for the
determination of the extent of the accounting problem and the
conclusion of discussions with the Group’s bankers and the
delivery of a renewed bank facility.  These deadlines were met
and an amended facility, committed to January 2005, with
revised covenants reflecting current trading conditions was put
in place at the end of May.
The audit of our financial statements has since been concluded
by PricewaterhouseCoopers and a new senior Group position,
Chief Executive’s Review
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .7.
Director of Financial Reporting, has been created and filled from
outside the Group.
Outlook
There are some indications that the worst is over as far as the
economic cycle is concerned.  US government statistics for our
principal market, non-residential construction, show that after a
30% decline in the period March 2001 to September 2002, the
position has been stable for the last eight months.  The
continued large investment in PFI work and the announcement
of a significant road-widening programme by the UK government
are signs of encouragement as A-Plant continues to develop its
major account programme.  The offshore market, particularly
that in Houston, has picked up in recent months after a slow
period.
The equipment rental industry tends to lag the economic cycle
making it prudent to be cautious.  Having addressed a number
of significant coinciding issues the Board looks forward to
making progress on the road to recovery in the coming year.
The Board is confident that all three divisions will continue to be
cash generative and that significant net free cash flow will be
generated in the coming year and beyond, with an attendant
reduction in debt levels.  The Group remains a half billion pound
business with market leading positions which offer significant
operating leverage as market conditions improve.

Revenues
Group revenues of £539.5m (2002 - £583.7m) were significantly impacted by the weak US dollar.  At constant exchange rates the
decline in Group revenues was 2%, significantly less than the 8% decline at actual rates.  Sunbelt’s revenues declined from £382.2m
to £349.1m when measured in sterling but by only 0.2% in US dollars from $548.3m to $547.0m.  A-Plant’s revenues declined 4.6%
from £187.0m to £178.4m reflecting competitive markets and the decision a year ago to withdraw from certain low return activities.
Ashtead Technology revenues reduced from £14.5m to £12.0m reflecting lower activity levels in its offshore markets in the North Sea
and Gulf of Mexico.

Divisional performance stated as the operating profit before exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation, central costs and, as discussed above, the prior
year element of the change in BET lease treatment. Divisional
margins are also discussed on the same basis.  
Total divisional profit including Group central costs declined by
49% from a restated £76.6m to £39.1m.  At constant rates of
exchange the reduction was 45%.
On the same basis Sunbelt’s divisional profit declined 47% in
sterling at actual rates of exchange but by 43% in US dollars
with the remaining 4% decline being due to the weaker US
dollar.  This decline reflected a reduction in Sunbelt’s divisional
profit margin from 16.4% to 9.4% largely due to reductions in
rental rates caused by the competitive operating environment
during the current US economic slowdown and cost growth as
the new stores opened in 2002 matured.  Equipment utilisation
was at similar levels to the equivalent period a year earlier.
A-Plant’s divisional profit declined 46% with its divisional profit
margin falling from 7.8% to 4.4%.  This decline reflected
continued competitive conditions in its principal markets.
Technology’s divisional profit declined 40% in line with the
revenue fall in its key offshore markets but its divisional profit
margin remains the highest in the group at 20.8% (2002 –
29.0%).
Net assets employed reduced over the year reflecting the ageing
of the rental fleet by an average of seven months in the year to
49 months at year-end.
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .9.
➲ The gain on sale of fixed assets in the ordinary course of trading
this year was £2.7m compared with £1.5m in the previous year.
Staff costs
Staff costs constitute the largest single expense of the business
and rose 0.5% to £195.0m (2002 - £194.0m).  The average
number of employees in the year reduced from 6,393 to 6,386
with 6,078 on the payroll at 30 April 2003 (2002- 6,545).  Staff
costs include profit share of £5.9m (2002 - £9.0m).
EBITDA before exceptional items
EBITDA before exceptional items, which is not an accounting
measure under GAAP but is presented here because it is an
important measure of performance utilised in the bank
covenants under the Company’s senior debt facility, may be
reconciled to the loss before tax for the year as follows:
Adjusted EBITDA declined by 23% in the year reflecting both a
reduction in EBITDA margins from 33.3% to 27.8% and the
impact of the weak US dollar which meant that Sunbelt’s 2003
EBITDA before exceptional items was some £9.1m less than it
would have been if measured at the rates of exchange which
prevailed during 2002.  At constant rates of exchange the
reduction in EBITDA before exceptional items was 18%.
Net interest payable and similar charges
Bank interest payable relates primarily to the interest payable on
the variable rate, secured bank facility.  Interest was payable
under this facility until March at an average premium of 250
basis points over three month LIBOR for the currency in which
the loan is drawn.  Thereafter, an additional default interest
premium of 1% applied, totalling £0.4m which is included in
exceptional costs.

into in August 2000.  The impact of these swaps is recognised
rateably over their life as part of bank interest payable with the
amount recognised in the year totalling £8.4m (2002 - £6.3m).
The average borrowing rate experienced during the year on bank
borrowings  was approximately 6% (2002 - 7%) reflecting
predominantly lower US interest rates.
Interest is payable on the £134m subordinated convertible loan
note, due 2008, held by Rentokil Initial plc at a fixed rate of
5.25% per annum (£7.0m annually) and also includes a further
annual non-cash charge of approximately £0.6m representing
the amortisation over the life of the loan note of the difference
between its fair value at date of issue and its £134m redemption
value.  Rentokil Initial plc agreed in May 2003 to defer receipt of
the semi-annual interest payments due on this facility
commencing with the payment due on 31 March 2003 until the
earlier of the date on which the Company’s secured bank facility
is refinanced and 31 January 2005.  This interest will, however,
continue to be accrued in the accounts.
Exceptional interest costs in 2003 comprise the 1% default
interest payment discussed above together with the fees paid in
March and April to certain members of the bank group.
Exceptional interest costs in the previous year comprised
variation fees payable in connection with the covenant
amendments agreed in that year.
(Loss)/profit before exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation, prior year BET lease impact and tax
Reflecting the reduction in divisional profit, there was a loss for
the year before exceptional items, goodwill and tax of £1.8m
(2002 – profit of £27.1m before the prior year BET lease impact
of £1.8m).  This loss is stated after applying the new estimation
method for self insured costs (see exceptional items below).
Application of the new estimation method increased the
provisions made for self insured costs in the current year by
£2.7m meaning that a profit of £0.9m before exceptionals and
goodwill amortisation would have been reported had the
estimation basis not been changed.
Exceptional items
Details of the principal current year exceptional items are as
follows:
The final prior year impact of the US accounting issue was
£9.4m of which an estimated £4.9m relates to the 2001/2
financial year and £4.5m to earlier years.  The adjustment is
comprised of the following errors in the balance sheet at 30
April 2002: (1) an overstatement of fixed assets by £2.4m; (2)
an understatement of debt by £1.4m; and (3) an
understatement of trade creditors and accruals by £5.6m.
Significant enhancements have been made to the controls at
Sunbelt in light of the accounting problems.
The method used to estimate the provision required in
relation to the self insured element of the Group’s US
insurance programme has been changed in the year from
the previous case by case estimates by the appointed

● ● independent claims handling agent to an actuarial estimate
of the likely total cost of the self insured retained risk based
on previous years’ experience adjusted for cost inflation and
business growth.  The impact of this change is described
more fully in the financial statements.  The increase in the
amount that would have been provided at 30 April 2002
under the new estimation basis over the amount which was
actually provided last year is £7.4m which is reported as an
exceptional item resulting from the adoption of the new
basis for estimating the liability.
Advisory and other fees relating to the Company’s debt
facilities comprise principally the professional advisory costs
incurred in resolving the defaults under the Company’s debt
facilities resulting from the revelation of the US accounting
issue together with fees paid to debt providers.  All these
costs have been accounted for in the year ended 30 April
2003 save for fees which only became payable conditional
on execution of the agreements resolving the defaults which
occurred on 30 May 2003.  Under FRS 12 these fees,
totalling an additional £6.8m (£2.9m of which has since been
paid and £3.9m which will be payable at the time the
forthcoming refinancing is completed) are required to be
accounted for as exceptional items in 2003/4 as they only
become due in that financial year.  This caption also includes
£0.4m of default interest cost.
UK business rationalisation relates to the cost of A-Plant’s
rationalisation of a number of its businesses and to the
centralisation of all of its UK accounting and head office
functions at Warrington.  Following a strategic reassessment
23 profit centres were closed in the second half under the
programme announced in January, primarily relating to areas
where A-Plant was geographically over-represented.  This
major closure programme was the first large scale
withdrawal from individual locations undertaken with
previous profit centre closures having been the combination
of two profit centres at the same site under a single
manager. Additionally A-Plant’s previous four regional
accounting centres were all shut and their functions
migrated to the new centre at Warrington. £1.0m of the total
cost relates to vacant property rental costs which will only
be paid in future periods.  
Loss before tax
After the above exceptional items, the loss before tax for the
year was £42.2m (2002 – loss of £15.5m).
Taxation
Reflecting one of the benefits of the capital intensive nature of
the Group’s operations, the  current tax charge continues to be
low at £0.3m.  No significant current tax payments are expected
in the foreseeable future due to the continuing availability of tax
losses in the US and unclaimed tax depreciation in the UK and
to ongoing benefits arising from the structure of the BET USA
acquisition.
The total tax credit for the year is £9.0m (2002 – credit of
£19.2m) and predominantly represents deferred tax credits
arising in the United States.  The Group remains in a net
deferred tax loss position in the UK and is consequently unable
to recognise any credit for its UK tax losses.  This inability to
take credit for the UK tax loss position explains why the overall
effective tax rate (based on pre- goodwill profits) of 27.1% is
less than the UK statutory rate of 30%.  For the same reason the
overall effective tax rate will remain volatile in future dependent
on the profit mix between the UK and the US.

loss per share computed on the pre-tax loss before exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation less a notional 30 per cent tax
credit was 0.4p per share (2002 – EPS of 6.2p per share).  This
additional measure of earnings per share is presented as the
directors believe that to do so is helpful to users of the
accounts.
Dividend
No dividend is recommended in respect of the year (2002 – total
dividend of £11.3m at 3.5p per share).  As announced on 2 June
2003, resumption of dividend payments is dependent on the
completion of a refinancing of the Company’s senior debt facility.
Balance sheet
Fixed Assets
Total additions to fixed assets in the year were £85.5m (2002 - £113.8m) of which £71.0m (2002 - £98.0m) was spent on rental
equipment as follows:
Capital expenditure in the year was restricted in light of the
difficult market conditions faced by all of the Group’s three
divisions.  The Group has been able to lower capital expenditure
in this way without harming the business because it entered the
slow down with a young rental fleet.  At 30 April 2003 the
average age of the fleet was 49 months.
In the coming year the Group currently anticipates that capital
expenditure will again fall below the level of the depreciation
charge and will amount to approximately £80m.  This will still be
sufficient to complete a significant replacement programme and
will result in the fleet ageing by between six and seven months
by 30 April 2004.
Current assets
Stocks of resale items, parts and consumables reduced by 10%
to £11.6m (2002 - £12.9m) and trade debtors and prepayments
(excluding non-recourse financing received under the accounts
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .13.
➲ receivable securitisation discussed further under cash flow and
net debt below) were 5% lower at £104.3m (2002 - £110.7m).
Debtor days for the Group were 60 days at 30 April 2003 (2002 –
58 days).  The bad debt charge as a percentage of turnover was
1.6% (2002 - 1.4%).
Trade and other creditors
Group creditor days declined from 135 days at 30 April 2002 to
115 days at 30 April 2003 reflecting lower capital expenditure
levels.  Suppliers continue to be paid in accordance with the
individual payment terms agreed with each of them.  The total
amount payable within trade creditors, bills payable and accruals
at 30 April 2003 relating to the purchase of rental equipment is
£33.3m (2002 - £60.7m).
Litigation
The North Carolina business court issued a ruling in May 2003
provisionally awarding Sunbelt Rentals damages of $5m tripled
under State law to $15m in a dispute with Head & Engquist.  The
events subject to litigation date back to December 1999 prior to
the acquisition of BET USA by the Company when the former
president of its BPS division joined Head & Engquist as
president of their aerial work platform division and over the
subsequent six months led the recruitment of over 100 former
BPS staff in a concerted raid on BPS’s business and staff.  
Subsequent to the Court ruling
Head & Engquist (which is
registered with the SEC)
announced that it had booked
a provision of $17m against the
litigation and related costs and
that it had amended its bank
facility to avoid breaching its covenants as a result of this
charge.  It also announced that it intended to appeal the ruling
when finalised by the Court which is expected in late Summer or
early Autumn 2003.  All litigation costs (totalling over £1m) have
been expensed by the Company since July 2000 when the
action was commenced.
Cash flow and net debt
Net cash inflow from operations before exceptional items
reduced 22% to £157.3m (2002 - £202.0m).  This reflected good
control of working capital, particularly receivables, throughout
the year.  Exceptional items paid in the year were £4.4m.
Interest paid in the year (excluding exceptional costs and, in
2002, prior year BET lease impact) fell to £41.4m (2002 - £46.2m)
and there was a small tax refund of £0.7m (2002 – payment of
£0.7m).  Cash payments to acquire fixed assets virtually halved
from £203.3m to £107.1m reflecting the impact of the active
ageing of the fleet undertaken in the past two years.
Proceeds from the sale of fixed assets decreased from £39.2m
to £29.4m but, as reported a year ago, last year’s total included
two special non-recurring items.  Excluding these items, last
year’s disposal proceeds totalled £26.6m so this year’s £29.4m
represents a good result given the lower level of new
expenditure.

(2002 - £675.3).  Measured at constant (30 April 2003) exchange
rates, total net debt was reduced in the year by £21.2m.
Further significant debt repayments are expected in both 2003/4
and 2004/5.
Bank loan facilities
The Group’s principal bank facility is the committed secured
multi-currency loan facility entered into at the time of the BET
acquisition on 1 June 2000.  Interest is payable on this facility at
variable rates linked to underlying market rates traded in the
London interbank market.  
At 30 April 2003 £417.9m (2002 - £506.7m) was drawn under the
facility with the remainder of the commitment (£42.5m) undrawn.
The effects of the surprise disclosure by Sunbelt’s financial
controller in early March that he had been failing properly to
reconcile a number of balance sheet accounts proved
immediate.  On the following day, the Group was due to make
representations and warranties as part of a normal rollover of
part of its debt facility.  In the light of the disclosure of the
inaccuracies in Sunbelt’s reported accounts, it was impossible
for these representations to be made and as a result the Group
was put in default of its banking agreements.
Following the amendment to the bank agreement agreed on 30
May 2003 resolving the defaults, the facility now terminates on
28 January 2005, four months earlier than the previous revolver
termination date of 31 May 2005.  Amortisation of the facility
prior to repayment now comprises:
$50m reduction in revolver commitment at 31 May 2003
which was effected by cancellation of part of the undrawn
revolver commitment referred to above plus the usual 1%
($3.75m) term loan amortisation on the same date;
a further $50m of reduction in revolver commitment at 31
May 2004 which is to be effected by cancelling the
remaining undrawn revolver commitment of $18m and $32m
payable from cash generation over the coming year.  The
Company has also agreed with the bank group not to use
the $18m undrawn revolver commitment in the period prior
to its expiry; and
additionally at 31 May 2004 the Company has now
committed to make a $28m amortisation payment to the term
loan holders so as to provide them with the same pro rata
paydown in 2004 as the revolver banks are due to receive.
To the extent that cash is generated from transactions outside
the normal course of business prior to 31 May 2004, all or part
amortisation payments due at that date will be accelerated and
funded from such proceeds as they are received.
The facility is secured by means of fixed and floating charges
over substantially all of the Group’s assets.  Under the terms of
the facility, the Group is required to demonstrate compliance
with certain financial covenants comprising the ratios of EBITDA
to interest and to senior and total debt levels, the ratio of debt
levels to the value of tangible assets, a maximum capital
expenditure commitment and a minimum cash flow requirement
on a quarterly basis.  These ratios were reset at the time the
banks waived the defaults resulting from the revelation of the US
accounting issue and the Board is satisfied that they provide the
appropriate financial flexibility.
Interest is now payable on borrowings under the facility at 300
basis points above LIBOR.  This margin was increased from the
average 250 basis point margin which applied prior to the default.
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .15.
➲ ● ● ● The Group also has a secured but uncommitted bank overdraft
line provided alongside the main secured facility as well as
various customary ancilliary facilities.  At 30 April 2003 £4.8m
was outstanding under the overdraft facility leaving £6.2m
undrawn.  Subsequently written confirmation was received from
the provider of this facility indicating their intention to continue to
make it available until January 2005 so long as the quarterly
financial covenants under the main bank facility are met.
The Board considers that the
renewed facilities provide
adequate funding for the
group and that the anticipated
future cash generation,
together with current cash
balances and undrawn amounts, are sufficient to meet the
agreed facility reductions.
The Board intends to refinance the existing bank facilities well
before their expiry in January 2005.  In light of the significant
cash generation this year and that which is expected in the
forthcoming two years, the Board expects that it will be able to
complete the necessary refinancing before the existing facilities
expire.
Accounts receivable securitisation
On 14 June 2002 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries
completed a rolling £60m accounts receivable securitisation with
Banc of America Securities.  Under the securitisation programme
the Group receives non-recourse funding secured against its UK
and US receivables.  
The securitisation programme contained a cross default clause
with the effect that, from 13 March 2003, the securitisation
provider could have ceased to purchase future receivables.  In
practice, however, the programme was continued throughout the
period of default and Banc of America agreed on 30 May 2003
to waive its cross default rights and to recommit the
securitisation until 28 January 2005.  A funding charge of LIBOR
plus 200 basis points now applies to amounts received under
the securitisation (previously LIBOR plus 135 basis points).
5.25% secured convertible loan note, due 2008
Part of the consideration for the BET USA acquisition was
satisfied by the issue of the £134m nominal value 5.25%
unsecured convertible loan note, due 2008 which is currently
held by the vendor, Rentokil Initial plc (“Rentokil”).  No interest
was payable on this loan note in its first year of issue but from 1
June 2001 it has borne interest at a fixed discounted rate of
5.25% per annum.  It is convertible into 89.3m ordinary shares at
any time after 1 June 2001 at the holder’s option (giving an
effective conversion price of 150p per share) and is repayable at
par in June 2008 if not previously converted.  The Company’s
consent is required for any transfer of the convertible loan which
would result in the transferee holding, on conversion, ten percent
or more of the Company’s share capital. 
Additionally, certain orderly marketing restrictions also apply to
ordinary shares issued through conversion.
Under the terms of the inter creditor agreement executed in June
2000 between the senior banks, Rentokil and the Company,
Rentokil had agreed that the banks would have the right to issue
a notice preventing the Company from making an interest
payment to Rentokil in circumstances where there was a default
under the Senior Credit agreement.  Rentokil had also agreed
that in the event of such a notice being issued it would not be
able to take any action against the Company for a minimum
period of 180 days.  On 31 March 2003 the banks issued the
relevant notice with the result that the Company did not make
Financial Review
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 the £3.5m interest payment due to Rentokil on that day.
Subsequently agreement was reached with Rentokil to defer
both this payment and all subsequent payments due up to
January 2005 (a total of £14m) until the earlier of the point at
which the Company refinances its existing senior debt facilities
and 31 January 2005.
Pensions
The Group operates pension plans for the benefit of its
employees and made contributions totalling £3.8m to these
plans in the year.  Except for the old UK plan which now covers
approximately 500 UK employees out of the UK total of 2,350
and plans affecting two directors, these plans are defined
contribution plans.
The last triennial valuation of the existing UK defined benefit plan
(as at 30 April 2001) showed a deficit of 6% (measured as the
shortfall in assets compared with liabilities) under the best
estimate assumptions required to be used under SSAP 24 for
accounting purposes and 16% under the conservative
assumptions used by the actuary for funding purposes.  In
consequence the employer’s contribution was increased from
5% to 11% of salary effective 1 November 2001 which was the
level recommended by the actuary to address the funding
shortfall.  Like most similar UK plans, the plan remains mostly
invested in equities and in light of the poor returns on equity
investments in the two years since the last valuation the
Company agreed earlier this year that the employer’s
contribution would be raised to 15% of salary effective 
1 May 2003.
This is the second year disclosure is required under the
transitional provisions of the new UK accounting standard on
pensions (FRS 17) of the actuarial position of the plan updated
to 30 April 2003.  In providing this disclosure, FRS 17 requires
use of actuarial methods and assumptions which differ from
those used by the actuary for the triennial valuations used for
funding purposes.  Reflecting these differences and the poor
performance in the past two years of the UK stock market (in
which most of the plans’ assets are invested) the deficit in the
Company’s defined benefit plans at 30 April 2003 on the basis
required by FRS 17 was £14.5m (2002 - £7.1m).

➲ Operating statistics
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, some
cash and liquid resources, and various items such as trade
debtors, trade creditors and bills of exchange payable, etc., that
arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s
operations. 
In addition to the foregoing, on 24 August 2000 Ashtead Group
plc entered into forward rate agreements with LloydsTSB Bank
plc and Bank of America under which the variable interest rates
payable under the bank facility on a total of US$250m of
borrowings were exchanged for a three year fixed interest rate of
6.825%.  On 5 March 2003 a further three year hedge
commencing 1 May 2003 was entered into with Bank of America
on a total of $100m of borrowings at a three year fixed interest
rate of 2.5%.
Derivative transactions are only undertaken for the purposes of
managing funding, interest rate
and currency risks. The Group
does not trade in financial
instruments.  The main risks
arising from the Group’s
financial instruments are interest, liquidity, counterparty and
foreign currency risks. The Board reviews and agrees objectives 
and treasury policies for managing each of these risks and they
are summarised below.
Interest rate risk management 
The Group’s interest rate management policy is to use a
combination of fixed and variable rates of interest to provide
some element of protection against sudden changes in the level
of interest rates.  New derivative transactions are only entered
into with the authority of the Group’s Finance and Administration
Committee and the Finance Director provides a regular report on
treasury matters to each Board Meeting in which the need for
new derivative transactions is reviewed and discussed.  
At 30 April 2003 some 54% of the Group’s borrowings were at
fixed rates (comprising $250m of the bank debt on which
interest rates have been fixed for three years from August 2000
as described above, the £134m convertible loan on which
interest is fixed at 5.25% and the £22.4m of finance lease debt
which carries an average interest rate of 7.9%).
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s policy is to ensure continuity of funding which is
currently provided through the committed secured loan facility
which now runs for 18 months to January 2005 and the £134m
convertible loan note which now has four years and eight
months until its maturity.   As discussed above the Board
expects to refinance the bank debt facilities before their January
2005 expiry.
Foreign exchange risk management 
With a significant portion of the Group’s operations based
outside the UK, the Group faces currency risk on its non-sterling
net assets as the translation of overseas subsidiaries can have a
considerable effect on the Group’s reported net assets. The main

Corporate office - - 12 15
449 463 6,078 6,545 exposures are to US dollar and Euro exchange rates against
sterling.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these structural
currency exposures by matching the currency of third party
borrowings against the currency of earnings generated from
assets.  At 30 April 2003, total net borrowings (excluding the
securitisation funding) of £575.1m were drawn as to a net
£389.4m in US dollars, £18.4m in Euros and £167.3m in sterling.
The Group’s exposure to exchange rate movements on trading
transactions is relatively limited.  All Group companies invoice
revenues in their respective local currency and generally incur
expense and, except in the Republic of Ireland, purchase assets
in their local currency.  Consequently the Group does not
routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or
the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of
overseas profits into sterling.  Foreign exchange risk on
significant non-trading transactions (eg acquisitions) is
considered on an individual basis.
Counterparty risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk related losses in the event of
non-performance by a counterparty to its interest rate hedging
financial instruments.  This risk is managed by entering into
derivative transactions only with institutions with a strong credit
rating and by limiting the total exposure to any single
counterparty.  At 30 April 2003 the counterparties to the Group’s
interest rate hedging transactions were LloydsTSB Bank plc and
Bank of America who are not expected to fail to meet their
obligations.

● This past year has been the most challenging year that the
Sunbelt management team has had to manage through in its
history.  Although the accounting irregularities we experienced
and our planned IT migration were difficult in themselves, the US
economy also proved to be extremely challenging.  After an
extensive internal and external investigation into the accounting
irregularities, we have isolated the issues and have taken
definitive actions to ensure that our accounting functions are
now robust enough to prevent any repetition.  I would like to
thank the Sunbelt team for their determination in continuing to
do what they do better than any in our industry, which is to
focus on the customer, through this difficult period.  I also
acknowledge the difficulties our shareholders and employees
have faced and would like to thank them for their support and
loyalty through this challenging time.
Sunbelt’s revenues and divisional profit declined from £382.2m
to £349.1m and £62.6m to £32.9m respectively.  These sterling
results were impacted by the weak US dollar as in US dollars
revenues declined only marginally from $548.3m in 2002 to
$547.0m.  Divisional profit in US dollars declined 43% from
$89.8m to $51.5m.  
The proof of the strength in Sunbelt comes from the operational
performance exhibited in a year that saw the worst construction
and industrial economic conditions in most of our life times.
Sunbelt has outperformed both the published revenue figures
from our peer group in the United States and the US economy.
Sunbelt held its revenues
virtually level at a time when
our primary market - non-
residential construction – saw a
13% deterioration and the top
ten equipment rental
companies - we are number four - reported a 6% decline in
overall revenues. 
I am pleased once again to report on the continued growth of
our specialty rental businesses, Pump and Power Services,
Scaffold Services and now also the Industrial Resource Group,
which is a new specialty we added in the past year.  Pump and
Power has now grown to 14 locations and has continued to
expand its product offerings.  It achieved same store sales
growth of 25%, while also continuing to deliver a higher return
on investment than the company average.  Pump and Power
now accounts for 6% of total revenues.  I expect the current
Pump and Power management team to continue this growth
both via new locations and also by expansion of our current
product line, without sacrificing the returns we have traditionally
achieved. 
Scaffold Services now represents 17% of total revenue broadly
similar to the level of last year despite a significant decline in
industrial maintenance activity.  The focus has been on safety,
operational improvements and continued integration with the
core Sunbelt business.  Scaffold Services continues to be an
important part of our overall strategy by allowing diversification
of both product and services offered to our current and growing
customer base.  
The Industrial Resource Group in its first year of operation
comprises two locations.  This business was developed to serve
the specialty industrial tool and equipment needs of the
industrial service contractor.  Although accounting for less than
one percent of total revenue, I believe it will continue to grow
rapidly and strengthens our ability to deliver service to our
customer at an attractive return.
While the General Tool businesses performed well given the
difficult market conditions, growing their revenues 4% over the
previous year, we continued to see significant rate pressure in
our Aerial Work Platform business whose revenues reduced 7%.
In both cases our relentless focus on customer service helped
Operational Review - Sunbelt Rentals
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
RENTALS us gain share in most markets in which we operate.
In the fourth quarter of the year just ended we successfully
migrated both our financial and point of sales system to the
industry leading US rental software package.  This was a major
project for the company, which involved training over 1,000 of
our staff on the new system.  As expected we have seen an
immediate improvement in our customer service levels and
productivity in our transactional processes resulting from this
investment.
Looking forward to this year: we plan to leverage the new IT
system to allow Sunbelt to launch strategic programs which will
further improve our service levels to the most important part of
our business - the customer.  These programs include a rental
related accessory and consumables sales program of high
margin, impulse purchase items that will be sold from our
existing infrastructure.  It also includes a program that helps
management determine the correct minimum stocking quantities
for high return rental assets and thus increases efficiency and
customer service.
We are also continuing to focus on the reconfiguration of the
rental fleet towards higher return assets while keeping tight
control over capital spending and emphasising the need for
controlled disposals of lower return assets.  The entire
management team’s profit share program is now based on
increasing our return on invested capital. 
I would like to end by thanking all the members of the Sunbelt
team for achieving the goals we set for ourselves in making
Sunbelt a safer workplace for our team members and our
customers.  This was accomplished by focus on staff turnover,
training and continued commitment to safety.  I have total
confidence we will meet and exceed the goals we have set for
the coming year.
Our business plan for the coming year is built around the
expectation that we will not see any improvement in the
economy.  We believe, however, that our competitors will
continue to rationalise their businesses through store closings
and fleet disposals from which we should benefit.  All capital
investment will be focused on fleet replacement in higher return
items as we continue to reconfigure the fleet.  I am committed to
leveraging the benefits and efficiency gains from our new IT
system and the reduction of costs through supplier
rationalisation.  This plan will be executed whilst continuing to
focus and improve upon what Sunbelt is known for - its
unequalled customer service.

● The market remained competitive and this, along with our
continued strategy to reduce our exposure to certain high
volume low return markets, resulted in a 4.6% reduction in
revenues year-on-year.  The decline was predominantly in our
Main Plant and Tool Hire businesses.  A number of our Specialist
businesses saw growth in double digits and have the potential to
improve further in the coming year.  Although we reduced our
cost base year on year, we were unable to mitigate fully the lost
revenues and consequently divisional profit declined from
£14.5m last year to £7.9m in 2003.
As we focused on our three key product areas, Main Plant, Tool
Hire and Specialist products (which includes Rail, Power
Generation, Pumps, Welding, Accommodation, Powered Access,
Acrow Formwork and Falsework, Groundcare, Bigair, Trenchless
Technology and Traffic), a great deal of work has been done to
realign our fleet from a geographical to a product based
structure. This in turn has helped keep expenditure on rental
equipment under control at £22.4m.  As a consequence despite
our reduced profitability we remained significantly cash positive
in the year.
Towards the end of the year, to increase operational efficiency,
23 profit centres were closed in geographical areas where we
had an overlap of coverage of the same product type.  This
closure programme represents the first withdrawal from
individual locations we have ever undertaken.  Previous profit
centre closures having been the combination of two profit
centres (eg Main Plant and Tool Hire) at the same location into a
single profit centre managed by one manager.  The assets from
the closed locations have been redistributed to locations that
have the capacity to do more business from their fixed cost
base.  The full benefit of the improved efficiency is ahead of us,
as markets and customers are now being developed using the
transferred fleet.
Undoubtedly the events following the announcement of the
accounting issues in the US, such as the fall in share price, UK
press speculation on the future of A-Plant and the Group, and
competitors targeting our staff and customers all had a
significant effect on our business.  Since the Group’s
announcement on 2 June that these issues have been resolved,
we have taken several steps designed to rebuild our team’s
confidence.  I would like to thank all our staff, customers and
suppliers for their commitment, loyalty and efforts
during this difficult period.
The Tool Hire rebranding programme at our 64
dedicated locations was completed on schedule
last Autumn and the Tool Hire business was then
split out last December as a separate division under
the management of one Managing Director.
During the year we also undertook the consolidation
of the four separate accounting offices and A-Plant
Marketing Department into one single office, based
in Warrington.  This not only benefits our staff but
also offers an even greater level of service to our
Operational Review - A-Plant
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 customers who now only need to deal with  a single accounting
office nationally.
Our strategy to develop major customers continued.  This
customer group accounted for 23% of our total revenue in the
year.  23 national accounts were renegotiated in the period and
we successfully won 8 new accounts.  Our contracts with
national account customers cover an average period of 2 years. 
The future
As will be clear from the report above, this has been a year of
many changes to the structure of A-Plant and has also been a
period of consolidation and bedding-in.  The market will remain
competitive in the coming year but I believe we are now well
positioned as a business to operate in the tough conditions we
expect, with the necessary structural changes made.  Our
management structure and business are now clearly aligned to
our core product areas, which gives us the ability to manage
much more efficiently.  We expect this to help us improve
revenues and profits in the coming year.

● Overall our revenues declined 17% in difficult markets last year
which, given the relatively fixed cost nature of the rental
business, inevitably led to a decline in EBITA margin from 29%
to 21%.  Divisional profit reduced from £4.2m to £2.5m.
Offshore & Inspection
This stream of our business had a particularly difficult year as
the number of both Construction & Inspection, Repair &
Maintenance projects fell from the previous year.  In some of our
markets the over-supply of equipment has led to very damaging
competitive pricing.  As the offshore business operates world-
wide, all three of our offshore operations suffered to a greater or
lesser extent the effects of this over-supply.
Our Aberdeen operation, which serves Europe & Africa, is our
largest offshore business.  The poorer second half reported last
year for this business continued into this year.  The North Sea
market appears to be in a steady decline as no large-scale
developments have been brought to the market again.  Africa’s
deepwater developments have continued to give us a steady
level of business but could not compensate for declines in
Europe.
Singapore fell back from the previous year’s strong performance.
However, our performance was encouraging against a
background of
concerns about
political and health
risks in the region.
There is still an
underlying strength
in the offshore
market as energy
demand increases
across South-East
Asia.  Ashtead has
continued to develop its product range and remains the largest
rental company of its type in the region.
Our biggest disappointment was the performance of our
Houston operation.  As with our Aberdeen operation, the poor
second half of the last financial year continued throughout this
year.  A severe decline in the Gulf of Mexico offshore market was
exacerbated by the effect of the general US economic decline
on our onshore inspection business.
Environmental
Once again we saw an increase in our Environmental revenues.
Although the effects of the US recession were not uniform
across our four North American locations only one of the
locations failed to increase its revenues and that was against a
record prior year.  The businesses have continued to benefit
from a focus on rental and a widening product range.
Prospects
Currently we are trading ahead of last year in all of our
businesses.  Offshore pricing remains competitive but against a
background of rising demand.  The environmental market is also
improving in North America and we have recently expanded by
opening a further location in the Bay area of Northern California.
Overall we believe we can deliver profit improvement in the
coming year.

Employees
The total number of employees worldwide of the Group at 30 April 2003 was 6,078.
The Group makes every reasonable effort to give disabled applicants, and existing employees becoming disabled, opportunities for
work, training and career development in keeping with their aptitudes and abilities.   The Group is an equal opportunities employer. 
The Group has taken action consistently through the year to maintain and develop arrangements aimed at involving employees in its
affairs.  For example, monthly meetings are held at Profit Centres to discuss the previous month’s performance.  The Group has a
positive approach to health and safety at work and to compliance with the law and the requirements of the regulatory bodies in both
the UK and the USA.  A copy of the relevant formal statement of the Group’s policy on health and safety is on display at profit
centres in the UK and the USA.
The Group encourages employees to become shareholders through discretionary and SAYE share option schemes. Details of options
outstanding under these schemes are set out above.
Directors and directors’ insurance
Details of the current directors of the Company are given on pages 26 to 27.  The Company has maintained insurance throughout the
year to cover all directors against liabilities in relation to the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 
Future developments 
The Group seeks to develop by expansion of its activities in equipment rental.
Policy on payment of suppliers 
Suppliers are paid in accordance with the individual payment terms agreed with each of them. The number of Group creditor days at
30 April 2003 was 115 days (30 April 2002 - 135 days) which reflects the terms agreed with individual suppliers.  There were no trade
creditors in the Company’s balance sheet at any time during the past two years.
Political and charitable donations 
Charitable donations in the year amounted to £1,250 in total  (2002 - £8,650 in the UK and $100,000 in the USA).  No political
donations were made in either year.   Director’s Report
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Environmental report
The Group, through its equipment purchasing policies, maintenance programmes and environmental monitoring practices,
endeavours to ensure that its trading activities have as little adverse impact on the environment as it is possible to achieve. In pursuit
of this ideal, the Group has developed environmental management processes which are designed to ensure:
● compliance with relevant legislation;
● removal of potential causes of environmental damage where practicable; and
● continuous reduction in environmental impact through monitoring and corrective action.
The Group’s continued investment in its rental fleet, along with its maintenance programmes, minimises both pollution to the
atmosphere and accidental contamination.  The facilities the Group maintains throughout its profit centre network enable waste to be
disposed of correctly, bulk fuels to be stored safely and fleet cleaning and maintenance to be carried out efficiently.  
Group companies have documented procedures at profit centre level for fleet maintenance, removal of waste from customers’ sites
back to Company premises for safe disposal as well as contractual arrangements for the disposal of all major waste products. 
The Group’s Performance Standards teams measure and monitor environmental performance and control measures at profit centres
as part of their rolling audit programme and report their findings to senior operational management. 
Post balance sheet events
On 30 May 2003 the Company agreed with its debt providers to waive the defaults resulting from the US accounting irregularity.
Consequential on these agreements and in anticipation of the amounts which will be payable on completion of the intended future
refinancing, the Company will record a charge of approximately £6.8m in respect of fees due to debt providers and advisers in the six
months to 31 October 2003.
Auditors
Following the conversion of the auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers to a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) from 1 January 2003,
PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned on 17 February 2003 and the directors appointed its successor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , to
fill the resulting casual vacancy on 24 February 2003.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in
office and a resolution concerning their re-appointment and authorising the directors to fix their remuneration will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 12.30pm on Monday 22 September 2003, at the offices of WestLB Panmure Limited,
Woolgate Exchange, 25 Basinghall Street, London EC2V 5HA.   For ordinary shareholders, a separate Notice of Annual General
Meeting, which includes an explanation of the proposed resolutions, is enclosed with the Report and Accounts.  In addition to the
ordinary business of the meeting, shareholder consent will be sought to renew authorities for the directors to allot ordinary shares in
the Company as set out more fully in the notice of meeting.
By Order of the Board

Company Secretary 
15 July 2003 Corporate Governance Report
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .31.
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The Board recognises that it is accountable to the Company’s
shareholders for corporate governance and this statement describes how the relevant principles have been practised by the
Company.
The Company complied during the year with the principles of corporate governance set out in Section I of the Combined Code save
that the service contracts of George Burnett and Bruce Dressel provide for either notice periods in excess of one year or pre-
determined compensation in excess of one year’s salary.  Details of these arrangements and the justification for them are given in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report.  New directors appointed since April 2000 have service contracts containing notice periods of one
year or less.  Since the year end, as discussed in the Remuneration Committee Report, it has been agreed that the notice period
under Mr Burnett’s contract will be reduced to one year.  
The Board and the Executive
The Company’s Board currently comprises the non-executive chairman, the chief executive, the finance director, the executive heads
of Sunbelt and A-Plant and three non-executive directors. Short biographies of the directors are given on pages 26 to 27.
All directors are responsible under the law for the proper conduct of the Company’s affairs. The directors are also responsible for
ensuring that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are discussed in detail and critically assessed to ensure that they
conform with the long term interests of shareholders and are compatible with the interests of employees, customers and suppliers.
The Board has reserved to itself those matters which reinforce its control of the Company. 
To ensure that the directors are suitably briefed to fulfil their roles, regular reports and briefings are provided to the Board by the
executive directors and the company secretary.  The Board normally meets at least five times a year and there is contact between
meetings to advance the Company’s activities. The directors also have access to the company secretary and a procedure is in place
for them to take independent advice as needed at the Company’s expense.
Board sub-committees
Audit Committee
Comprising the non-executive directors under the chairmanship of Philip Lovegrove, the Audit Committee meets twice a year to
consider the draft interim and final financial statements and to receive the report of the Auditors. The Committee considers the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and its financial and accounting policies and practices and also meets periodically with
the heads of the US and UK Performance Standards (operational audit) teams.  It also deals with any matters which may be brought
to the attention of the Committee by the Auditors.
Nominations Committee
With Henry Staunton as chairman, and George Burnett, Alan Wheatley and Phillip Lovegrove as members, the Nominations
Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board any appropriate changes in its structure.
Remuneration Committee
Comprising the non-executive directors under the chairmanship of Alan Wheatley, the Remuneration Committee is responsible for
setting the remuneration packages of the executive directors and for establishing the terms and conditions of their employment. 
Finance and Administration Committee
The Board has delegated authority for dealing with routine financial and administrative matters to the Finance and Administration
Committee chaired by George Burnett.  The Committee, of which Henry Staunton and Ian Robson are the other members, meets
periodically as necessary to discharge its functions.  This Committee has a quorum of any two members but there is also a list of its
business which it can only validly perform in the presence of Henry Staunton (eg final approval of announcements, other than routine
notices of major shareholdings, to the London Stock Exchange). Corporate Governance Report
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Financial reporting
The directors are required by UK company law and financial reporting standards to prepare financial statements for each financial
year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at the end of the financial year and of the
profit and cash flows of the Group for the period.
In preparing the financial statements, applicable accounting standards have been followed, the most appropriate accounting policies
have been used and applied consistently and reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made.
Going concern
The directors also have a responsibility under UK company law and financial reporting standards to prepare the financial statements
on a going concern basis unless the entity is being liquidated or the directors have no realistic alternative but to liquidate the entity or
to cease trading.  When preparing the financial statements, the directors are also required to assess whether there are any significant
doubts concerning the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
After making appropriate enquiries the directors have reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.  In forming this view the directors have reviewed the Group’s budgets and cash
flow forecasts to 30 April 2004 and outline projections for the subsequent year and considered the sufficiency of the renewed
facilities described on pages 54 and 55 of the financial statements.
Internal controls
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and confirm they have reviewed its
effectiveness.  In doing so, the Group has taken note of the guidance for directors on internal control, Internal Control: Guidance for
Directors on the Combined Code (the Turnbull Guidance).
The Board confirms that there is a process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group.  This
process has been in place for the full financial year and is ongoing.  It is kept under regular review by the Executive Directors and is
considered periodically by the Board and accords with the Turnbull Guidance.
The Board considers that the Group’s internal control system is appropriately designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives.  Any such control system, however, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.  The concept of reasonable assurance recognises that the cost of a control procedure should
not exceed the benefits.
The process for keeping risks and the related internal control under review is based initially on work undertaken by the heads of the
US and UK Performance Standards (operational audit) teams.  In the year ended 30 April 2001 they undertook a thorough review of
the Group and of the risks it faces in its business and of how these risks are managed.  Each year since, they have reviewed and
updated this work and produced an annual report in conjunction with the management teams of each of the Group’s businesses.
Their work included consideration of whether there were any matters which had arisen since their first report was prepared which
might indicate omissions or inadequacies in their initial review.  They also considered whether, as a result of changes in either the
internal or external environment, new significant risks had arisen.  The executive directors reviewed their draft report which was then
presented to and discussed by the Group Board on 27 June 2003.
This year, in conducting their review, the executive directors were especially conscious of the breakdown in internal controls which
had occurred in Sunbelt Rentals.  This control breakdown occurred because the work of Sunbelt’s financial controller was inadequate
and because he had deliberately made false entries in its bank reconciliation at 30 April 2002 and had concealed these from his
superiors.  A number of the balance sheet control account reconciliations for which the controller was directly responsible also
proved to be incomplete or inadequate when subsequently investigated in detail.
On disclosure of the issues, immediate action was taken by the Board to commission an in depth forensic investigation by KPMG, to
suspend and shortly afterwards terminate the controller’s employment and to strengthen Sunbelt’s finance department, firstly with a
qualified interim finance manager and subsequently through external recruitment of an experienced new financial controller.  
The Board and Sunbelt’s management are committed to fully implementing all the control recommendations made by KPMG forensic
and by PricewaterhouseCoopers following their 2003 audit and indeed many of these recommendations have already been actioned.
The Audit Committee has also appointed Deloitte and Touche to provide a regular financially focussed internal audit at each of the
Group’s major accounting centres to supplement the work of the Performance Standards teams whose remit is to conduct audits at
the profit centres and not centrally because this was previously assessed as the area of greatest risk. Corporate Governance Report
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .33.
Before producing the statement on internal control for the annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2003, the Board
reconsidered the operational effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems on the basis of the report referred to above.  The
control system includes written policies and control procedures, clearly drawn lines for accountability and delegation of authority, and
comprehensive reporting and analysis against budgets and latest forecasts.  
In a group of the size and complexity and geographical diversity of Ashtead, it should be expected that minor breakdowns in
established control procedures might occur.  There are supporting policies and procedures for investigation and management of
control breakdowns at any of the Group’s profit centres or elsewhere. 
The Audit Committee also meets with PricewaterhouseCoopers twice annually to discuss the results of their work.  In relation to
internal financial control, the Group’s control and monitoring procedures include:
● the maintenance and production of accurate and timely financial management information, including a monthly profit  and loss 
account and selected balance sheet data for each profit centre;
● the control of key financial risks through clearly laid down authority levels and proper segregation of accounting duties at the 
Group’s accounting support centres;
● the preparation of a regular financial report to the Board including profit and loss accounts for the Group and each subsidiary, 
balance sheets and cash flow statements;
● the preparation of annual budget and periodic update forecasts which are reviewed by the executive directors and then by the 
Board;
● a programme of periodical rotational rental equipment inventories conducted fortnightly at each profit centre by equipment type 
and independently checked on a sample basis;  
● full inventory counts at all profit centres on at least a six monthly basis with independent scrutiny on a sample basis; and
● comprehensive audits of all profit centres carried out on average at least once per year by the Performance Standards 
Department.  These reports are copied to the Finance Director to whom the heads of the Sunbelt and A-Plant Performance 
Standards Departments have direct access in the event of any issues which they may need to discuss independently of the 
operational management teams.
By order of the Board
Robert Clark
Company Secretary
15 July 2003 Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Structure of the Committee
During the year the Committee comprised all the non-executive directors with Alan Wheatley as Chairman.  None of the Committee
members has any personal financial interests, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. The Group’s Chief Executive,
George Burnett, attends the meetings of the Committee to advise on operational aspects of the implementation of existing policies
and policy proposals.  The Company Secretary, Robert Clark, acts as secretary to the Committee and is charged with the
responsibility for ensuring the Committee has the information relevant to its deliberations.
Remuneration policies
In formulating its policies, the Committee has access to professional advice from outside the Company, if required, and to publicly
available reports and statistics.  Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high
calibre needed to achieve the Group’s objectives and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The main elements of the
remuneration package for executive directors and senior management are:
● basic annual salary and benefits in kind; 
● annual performance bonus plan;
● share related incentives, including the new Investment Incentive Plan (a long-term co-investment plan) approved by shareholders 
on 8 October 2001;  and
● pension arrangements.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company compares packages offered by similar companies, which are chosen
having regard to:
● the size of the company (turnover, profits and number of people employed); 
● the diversity and complexity of its businesses; 
● the geographical spread of its businesses; and 
● their growth, expansion and change profile.
In making the comparisons, the Company takes into consideration the international scope, complexity and speed of change of the
Group’s business and, particularly, its now significant operations in the USA.  In relation to share option awards, the Committee’s
policy is to make regular awards to senior staff in order that their personal interests are aligned with those of shareholders.  The value
of the shares underlying the options awarded is assessed by reference to a number of factors including the employee’s salary,
seniority and length of service.
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design of reward packages for executive directors comprising the
appropriate mix of salary, performance related cash incentive bonuses and share options.  Mr Burnett, with the approval of the
Board, holds two non-executive appointments outside the Group and is allowed to retain the fees arising therefrom.  None of the
other executive directors has any outside appointments.
The Committee currently intends to continue with the above policies for 2003/4 and subsequent years.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board.  None of the non-executive directors has a service
contract with the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.  An ordinary resolution
concerning the Group’s remuneration policies will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Executive directors’ service agreements
Mr Burnett’s service agreement, first entered into on 27 November 1986 and amended periodically until consolidation into a new
agreement dated 21 May 1997, provides for termination by either party by the giving of two years’ notice.  However, Mr Burnett is
entitled at any time after reaching age 59 to give at least six months’ notice to retire from age 60.  Otherwise the contract remains in
place until he reaches age 65. 
Since the year-end the Company has agreed with Mr Burnett that a new service contract will be entered into.  Heads of terms
regarding the provisions of the new contract have been documented and agreed and legal advisers are currently preparing the
revised contract, which is expected to be formally signed shortly.  The new contract provides for (i) a reduction in Mr Burnett’s notice
period to one year; (ii) a partial waiver of 32% of Mr Burnett’s salary for the year to 30 April 2004 and; (iii) a reduction in his pension
entitlement.  These reductions and the salary waiver have been agreed without payment of any compensation.  Fuller details of these
changes are given in the sections of this report dealing with emoluments and pensions below. Directors’ Remuneration Report
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .35.
Mr Dressel entered into a new service agreement with Sunbelt Rentals Inc on 15 January 2001 under which he is employed as its
President and Chief Executive Officer for an automatically extended rolling period of two years until the contract is terminated.  Mr
Dressel could not terminate the contract in the first two years but can do so now by giving 180 days’ notice to Sunbelt.  Early
termination provisions apply should there be a change of control of Ashtead Group, defined as at least 50% of the voting rights
becoming held by a single person.  Sunbelt, however, can only terminate Mr Dressel’s employment by giving two years’ notice
except in the case of misconduct.  On termination, except on change of control, Mr Dressel is prohibited from working in the rental
industry in the USA for two years.  The Remuneration Committee considered that retention of the two year notice period is
appropriate at the current time but the position is being kept under review.
The service agreements between the Company and Mr Robson (dated 4 August 2000) and Mr Dhaiwal (dated 5 July 2002) are
terminable by either party giving the other twelve months’ notice.
The service agreements of the executive directors do not contain any provisions for termination payments to be made other than on

Ashtead Group
FTSE-250 excl. Inv. Trusts Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Since 1 May 2002, the annual performance related bonus plans for the executive directors are related directly to performance in the
year compared with budget.  The maximum entitlement under annual bonus plans was also capped at two-thirds of salary for all
executive directors other than Mr Dressel whose annual bonus was capped at 100% of salary.  The annual bonus plan of Mr Dressel
and Mr Dhaiwal depends exclusively on the performance of Sunbelt and A-Plant respectively.  Mr Burnett and Mr Robson’s bonuses
were dependent upon the Group’s performance.  The relevant targets were not met this year and so no bonuses were earned.
Under the provisions of the new service contract discussed above Mr Burnett has waived £138,000 of his annual salary entitlement
for the year to 30 April 2004 reducing it to £290,000.

Notes:
(1) The transfer values represent the amount which would have been paid to another pension scheme had the director elected to 
take a transfer of his accrued pension entitlement at that date and have been calculated by the schemes’ actuaries in accordance
with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.  They are not sums paid 
or due to the directors concerned.
(2) The increase/(reduction) in transfer value in the year is stated net of the members’ contributions made by Ian Robson and Sat 
Dhaiwal.
Under the terms of his existing service contract, Mr Burnett was entitled to retire at age 60 with a pension of two-thirds of
remuneration on retirement.  For this purpose remuneration is defined as the highest average annual remuneration received in the
best three consecutive years in the ten years prior to retirement with remuneration meaning basic salary effective from 1 May 2001
under a change to Mr Burnett’s employment contract agreed on 10 January 2002.  Prior to that date, remuneration is defined as the
gross value of total emoluments received in the year.
Mr Burnett’s pension entitlement is funded through contributions to the managed funds of independent fund managers operated
through the Ashtead Group plc Pension Scheme.  Mr Burnett’s pension in payment increases in line with price inflation, up to 7% a
year.  A spouse’s pension of two-thirds of Mr Burnett’s retirement benefit is payable in the event of his death either before or after
retirement.  The Company receives regular advice from external advisers on the level of contributions required to meet the
anticipated final salary liability.  
Under the new service contract discussed above, Mr Burnett’s pension entitlement will be reduced from the current two-thirds of
annual salary at age 60 to provide instead an annual pension of £275,000 at 5 April 2005.  If these new provisions had been in force
at 30 April 2003 the transfer value of Mr Burnett’s pension entitlement at that date would have been £4.1m, £1.1m less than the
£5.2m shown in the table above.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Robson is entitled to retire at age 60 on a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary for
each year of pensionable service.  He is a member of the Company’s Retirement Benefits Plan, which is a defined benefits scheme,
in respect of his earnings up to the Inland Revenue limit.  The pension in respect of his earnings above that limit is provided by an
unapproved, unfunded retirement benefits arrangement agreed between him and the Company.  Mr Robson’s contract also contains
early retirement provisions allowing him to retire and draw a pension based on actual years of service, but without deduction for early
payment which take effect once he has completed ten years service with the Company (or at anytime after age 50 if there is a
change of control).  Mr Robson pays contributions equal to 5% of his salary, all of which was paid to the Retirements Benefits Plan in
the current year.
Mr Dhaiwal’s pension benefits are also provided through the Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan.  His pension rights accrue
at the rate of one-sixtieth of basic salary for each year of pensionable service and his normal retirement is at age 65. Directors’ Remuneration Report
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .37.
Except where otherwise stated above, the Retirement Benefits Plan provides:
● in the event of death, between leaving service and retirement while retaining membership of the Plan, a spouse’s pension equal to
50% of the member’s deferred pension calculated at the date of death plus a return of his contributions;
● in the event of death in retirement, a spouse’s pension equal to 50% of the member’s pension at the date of death;
● an option to retire at any time after age 50 with the Company’s consent.  Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount 
agreed between the Actuary and the Trustees as reflecting the cost to the Plan of the early retirement;
● pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation up to a limit of currently 5% a year (although the Government is 
currently proposing that this limited inflation proofing be reduced); and
● transfer values do not include discretionary benefits.
Mr Dressel is a member of the US defined contribution plan to which the Group contributed £3,511 in the year (£2,024 in 2002).

Investment Incentive Plan
This long-term incentive plan provides for executive directors, who so elect, to invest all or a portion of their annual cash bonuses in
shares of the Company and, thus, become eligible for matching awards in the form of shares which only vest subject to demanding
performance conditions.  The maximum number of shares which may vest under issued matching awards (being, other than in
relation to the first investment, three times the number of investment shares purchased by the director) is shown below:
Awarded on
At 30 April 2002 29 July 2002 At 30 April 2003
George Burnett 1,422,006 - 1,422,006
Ian Robson 474,107 176,469 650,576
Bruce Dressel 650,878 - 650,878
The matching awards are made in respect of investment shares acquired by the director with all or part of their bonus for the
previous financial year.  The matching awards only vest, in whole or part, based on the annual growth in the Company’s earnings per
share in the three year period following the award over that of the year ended 30 April immediately prior to the date of the award and
on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance relative to a comparator group over the three year period from 8
October 2001 (when the Company’s share price at close was 72p) to 8 October 2004 for the awards held on 30 April 2002 and over
the three year period from 29 July 2002 to 28 July 2005 for the award granted in 2002/3.  The comparator group comprises all of the
FTSE 250 mid-cap stocks other than investment trusts
The above performance conditions have been chosen because they are felt most closely to align the interests of senior management
with the interests of shareholders, by rewarding management for achieving superior relative total shareholder return performance
compared with the FTSE 250 as a whole, excluding investment trusts.  The FTSE 250 is considered to be the Stock Exchange index
most appropriate to the size and scale of the Company’s operations. Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Vesting of the matching awards is based on the following required performance grid:
Vesting operates on a scaled basis for performance between the target levels shown in the grid above.  Performance is measured at
the end of the three year performance period when the awards either vest in full or part or lapse completely.  For performance
measurement purposes earnings per share is based on the profit before exceptional items measured under consistently applied
accounting policies.
In connection with the operation of the Plan, the Company established an Employee Share Ownership Trust which:
(a) on 21 and 22 January 2002, purchased 2,722,575 shares at an average cost of 57p per share, being the number of shares 
potentially equal, at the maximum performance level, to the matching awards granted.  Ownership of these shares was 
conditionally transferred to each director on 15 April 2002 subject to forfeiture to the extent that the required performance 
conditions are not attained.   175,541 of these shares subsequently reverted to the Trust when a director left the Company and his
matching awards were thus forfeited; and
(b) the 175,541 shares referred to at (a) plus 42 shares remaining in the Trust from the original purchase and a further 886 shares 
bought by the Trust on 12 August 2002 at a price of 48p per share were conditionally transferred to Mr Robson on 24 September 
2002 in satisfaction of the matching award of 176,469 shares made to him.  This award is also subject to forfeiture to the extent 
that the required performance conditions are not attained.
The executive directors have also waived their entitlement to any dividend on the shares conditionally transferred to them until the
conclusion of the relevant performance period.
The Company charges against profit each year an amount equal to one-third of the expected cost of the proportion of the matching
award expected to vest at the end of the three year performance period.

The above discretionary options are exercisable subject to the following performance criteria: 
(i) As was usual at that time, options granted in 1992, 1994 and 1995 were not subject to any performance criteria;
(ii) In line with recommendations extant at the time from Institutional shareholder representative bodies, options granted in 1997, 
1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were conditional on the Group achieving real growth in earnings per share of 2% per annum over any 
continuous three year period during the option period;
(iii) Options granted in 2002 and subsequently now require real growth in earnings per share of 3% per annum over any continuous 
three year period before they become exercisable.
The Remuneration Committee consider that the current performance hurdle is appropriately challenging while still providing
employees with a realistic opportunity to earn shares in the Company through their own efforts.
It is the Company’s practice to normally award share options in blocks taking into account the results of the Group and/or the
operating division in the financial year ending on the 30 April immediately before the date of grant and individual performance and
contribution in determining the amount of individual awards.
On 30 August 2002, George Burnett exercised options over 521,362 ordinary shares in the Company, which had been granted to him
on 16 September 1992 at an exercise price of 14.87p per share.  On the date of exercise, the closing market value of the Company’s
share was 36.25p.  Mr Burnett elected to retain the shares issued to him on the exercise of these options.  The market price of the
Company’s shares at the end of the financial year was 7.75p and the highest and lowest share prices during the financial year were
54.50p and 2.50p respectively.
Mr Dressel held an award over 250,000 units under the Company’s Cash Incentive Scheme, which was granted on 22 February 2000
at a price of 102p per unit until 22 February 2003 when they lapsed due to the performance criteria not being satisfied.  Mr Dhaiwal
also holds 50,000 units under the Cash Incentive Scheme which were granted to him on 22 February 2000 when he was not a
director.  This award is subject to the same performance conditions as apply to the Company’s unapproved share option scheme
and is exercisable in the period from 22 February 2003 to 21 February 2010.  If the performance criteria are satisfied at any point
during that period and the options exercised, the difference between the mid market price of Ashtead Group shares on that day and
the grant price multiplied by the number of units held will be paid to Mr Dhaiwal by way of a cash award.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
15 July 2003 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for the
financial year.
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently, supported by judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
● state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements
● prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless this is inappropriate 
The directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors also have responsibility for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the Group and prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Ashtead Group plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that
may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in
other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board
Robert Clark
Company Secretary
15 July 2003 Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Ashtead Group plc
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .41.
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the profit and loss account, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement,
the statement of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors’ remuneration report (“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  This
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed
by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Report, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial
Review, the Operational Reviews and the Corporate Governance Report. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part
of the directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’
remuneration report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
● the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 30 April 2003 and of its 
loss and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended;
● the financial statements have  been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
● those parts of the directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1  Accounting policies
Accounting convention and basis of consolidation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain freehold
properties and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The financial statements include the results of the Company and
all its subsidiaries.  A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been applied consistently is given in the
following paragraphs.  
Foreign currency translation and derivative financial instruments
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment of overseas subsidiaries and the difference
between the inclusion of their profits at average rates of exchange in the Group profit and loss account and the closing rate are dealt
with as movements on reserves.  Other exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.  Assets and liabilities in
foreign currencies including long term liabilities are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  This treatment is
required by statement of standard accounting practice number 20 (SSAP 20) in order to give a true and fair view of the Group’s
results.  Compliance with SSAP 20 overrides Schedule 4, paragraph 12 of the Companies Act 1985 which states that only profits
realised at the balance sheet date should be included in the profit and loss account.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate exposures.  These are principally swap agreements used
to manage the balance between fixed and floating rate finance on long term debt.  The group accounts for such derivatives, which
are only used for hedging purposes, using the accrual method under which amounts payable or receivable in respect of derivatives
are recognised rateably in net interest payable over the period of the contract.  They are not revalued to fair value or shown on the
group balance sheet at the balance sheet date.
Turnover
Turnover represents the total amount receivable for the provision of goods and services to customers net of returns and value added
tax.  Rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the contract.
Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost or valuation (net of any discounts received) less accumulated depreciation and provisions
for impairment where appropriate.  Leasehold properties are amortised over the life of each lease. Other fixed assets, including those
held under finance leases, are depreciated on a straight line basis applied to the opening cost to write down each asset to its
residual value over its useful economic life.  The rates in use are as follows: 
Per annum
Freehold property 4% 
Rental equipment 5% to 33%
Motor vehicles 16% to 25%
Office and workshop equipment 20%
Fixed assets that are not capable of individual identification (non-itemised equipment) are depreciated so as to write them down to
their residual value over their useful economic lives of 5 to 20 years.  
Some of the group’s freehold and long leasehold properties were revalued on the basis of their open market value at 30 April 1989.
On adoption of FRS 15 the group followed the transitional provisions to retain the book value of land and buildings that were
revalued in 1989 but not to adopt a policy of revaluation in future.
Repair and maintenance 
Costs incurred in the repair and maintenance of rental equipment are not capitalised but are charged to the profit and loss account
as incurred. Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .47.
1  Accounting policies continued
Acquisitions and goodwill 
Acquisitions during the financial year (if any) have been accounted for on an acquisition basis and the results of companies acquired
are therefore included from the effective date of acquisition. The net tangible assets of companies acquired are incorporated in the
consolidated accounts at their fair value to the Group. In accordance with the requirements of FRS 7, post acquisition integration
expenses are charged to the profit and loss account and, where material, disclosed as an exceptional item.
Goodwill, being the difference between the cost and fair value of the Group’s share of net assets acquired, arising on all acquisitions
since 1 May 1999 has been capitalised in the year in which it arises and is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic
life.  Goodwill arising before 1 May 1999 has been deducted from the accumulated profit and loss account reserve but will be written
back and taken to the profit and loss account in the event that it either becomes permanently impaired or if the business to which it
relates is disposed of.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided using the incremental liability approach and is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that
are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date.  Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance
sheet date except that (a) deferred tax in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries is only recognised where there
is a binding intent to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date; and (b) deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent
that they are regarded as recoverable.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised with a related credit to finance lease obligations in respect of the capital asset of the
lease payments.  Such assets are depreciated in accordance with the Company’s depreciation policy at the same rate as applied to
equivalent owned assets.  Interest payable on finance leases is computed at the rate inherent in the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pensions
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for the benefit of its employees under arrangements
established by Group companies. In respect of the defined benefit plans, actuarial valuations are made regularly and the
contributions payable are adjusted as appropriate.  Pension costs are accounted for on the basis of charging the expected cost of
providing pensions over the period during which the Group benefits from the employees’ services. The effect of variations from
regular cost are spread over the expected average remaining service lives of the members of the plan.  Contributions to defined
contribution plans are expensed as incurred.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any necessary provision for impairment in the parent company balance
sheet.  Where an investment in a subsidiary is transferred to another subsidiary, any uplift in the value at which it is transferred over
its carrying value is treated as a revaluation of the investment prior to the transfer and is credited to the revaluation reserve.
Own shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust
Shares owned beneficially by the Employee Share Ownership Trust are capitalised as fixed asset investments at cost less any
required provision for permanent impairment.  Where these shares are subject to commitments to release them to employees
(subject to the attainment of performance target) in connection with the Group’s long term incentive plans, then provision is made by
way of a charge against profits to write off the estimated cost of the shares expected to be released at the end of the performance
period over the long term incentive period which is normally three years. Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April

Audit fees payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers were £413,500 (2002 - £409,000).  This includes £25,000  (2002 - £25,000) in respect
of  the  parent company.  Fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers for non-audit services, primarily tax and accounting advice,
amounted to £583,150 (2002 - £244,500) in the UK and £63,200 in the US (2002 - £70,304).
Profits on disposal of fixed assets (excluding those relating to land and buildings) have been included within operating profit as they
resulted from routine sales of rental equipment and are considered in effect to be no more than required adjustments to depreciation
previously charged.

The prior year impact of the US accounting issue is comprised of the following errors in the balance sheet at 30 April 2002: (1) an
overstatement of fixed assets by £2.4m; (2) an understatement of debt by £1.4m; and (3) an understatement of trade creditors and
accruals by £5.6m.
The method used to estimate the provision required in relation to the self insured element of the Group’s US insurance programme
has been changed in the year from the previous case by case estimates by the appointed independent claims handling agent to an
actuarial estimate of the likely total cost of the self insured retained risk based on previous years’ experience adjusted for cost
inflation and business growth.  The increase in the amount that would have been provided at 30 April 2002 under the new estimation
basis over the amount which was actually provided last year is £7.4m which is reported as an exceptional item resulting from the
adoption of the new basis for estimating the liability.
Advisory and other fees relating to the Company’s debt facilities comprise principally the professional advisory costs incurred in
resolving the defaults under the Company’s debt facilities resulting from the revelation of the US accounting issue together with fees
paid to debt providers.  
UK business rationalisation relates to the cost of A-Plant’s rationalisation of a number of its businesses and to the centralisation of all
of its UK accounting and head office functions at Warrington.  Following a strategic reassessment 23 profit centres were closed in
the second half under the programme announced in January, primarily relating to areas where A-Plant was geographically over-
represented.  This major closure programme was the first large scale withdrawal from individual locations undertaken with previous
profit centre closures having been the combination of two profit centres at the same site under a single manager. Additionally 
A-Plant’s previous four regional accounting centres were all shut and their functions migrated to the new centre at Warrington.  Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April

In June 2002, the Group launched a revolving securitisation programme under which it sells or assigns its title and interest in a pool
of invoiced trade debtors to a third party which was funded ultimately in the commercial paper markets.  Subsequently in March
2003 the identity of the third party changed to a large, commercial bank.  Cash advanced against this pool of trade debtors takes
into account, inter alia, the risks that may be attached to the debtors and the expected collection period.  The Group is not obliged
and does not intend to support any losses arising from the assigned debtors.  In the event of default in payment by a debtor, the
providers of the finance can only obtain repayment of cash advanced, as to both principal and interest, from the remainder of the
pool of debtors in which they hold an interest.  The third party has also confirmed that it will not seek repayment from the group in
any other way.

Interest is payable on these loans currently at rates between 4% and 10%.  Secured bank debt payable in between one and two
years relate amounts drawn under the committed secured senior credit facility which, following the amendment of this facility on 30
May 2003 now expires on 28 January 2005.  Part of the outstanding amount is drawn in the form of revolving advances which were
repayable in May 2003 but are presented as long term because the revolving advance facility is committed until 28 January 2005.
Secured bank debt including secured bank overdrafts are secured by way of fixed and floating charges over substantially all of the
Group’s assets.  
The effects of the surprise disclosure by financial controller of Sunbelt Rentals Inc in early March that he had been failing properly to
reconcile a number of balance sheet accounts proved immediate.  On the following day, the Group was due to make representations
and warranties as part of a normal rollover of part of its debt facility.  In the light of the disclosure of the inaccuracies in Sunbelt’s
reported accounts, it was impossible for these representations to be made and as a result the Group was put in default of its banking
agreements.
Following the amendment to the bank agreement agreed on 30 May 2003 resolving the defaults, the facility now terminates on 28
January 2005, four months earlier than the previous revolver termination date of 31 May 2005.  Amortisation of the facility prior to
repayment now comprises:
1. $50m reduction in revolver commitment at 31 May 2003 which was effected by cancellation of part of the undrawn revolver 
commitment referred to above plus the usual 1% ($3.75m) term loan amortisation on the same date;
2. a further $50m of reduction in revolver commitment at 31 May 2004 which is to be effected by cancelling the remaining undrawn 
revolver commitment of $18m and $32m payable from cash generation over the coming year.  The Company has also agreed with
the bank group not to use the $18m undrawn revolver commitment in the period prior to its expiry; and
3. additionally at 31 May 2004 the Company has now committed to make a $28m amortisation payment to the term loan holders so 
as to provide them with the same pro rata paydown in 2004 as the revolver banks are due to receive.
The facility is secured by means of fixed and floating charges over substantially all of the Group’s assets.  Under the terms of the
facility, the Group is required to demonstrate compliance with certain financial covenants comprising the ratios of EBITDA to interest
and to senior and total debt levels, the ratio of debt levels to the value of tangible assets, a maximum capital expenditure
commitment and a minimum cash flow requirement on a quarterly basis.  These ratios were reset at the time the banks waived the
defaults resulting from the revelation of the US accounting issue and the Board is satisfied that they provide the appropriate financial
flexibility. Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April

18  Creditors - amounts falling due in more than one year continued
The Group also has a secured but uncommitted bank overdraft line provided alongside the main secured facility as well as various
customary off balance sheet facilities.  At 30 April 2003 £4.8m was outstanding under the overdraft facility leaving £6.2m undrawn.
Written confirmation has been received from the provider of this facility indicating their intention to continue to make it available until
January 2005 so long as the quarterly financial covenants under the main bank facility are met.
The Board considers that the renewed facilities provide adequate funding for the group and that the anticipated future cash
generation, together with current cash balances and undrawn amounts, are sufficient to meet the agreed facility reductions.  The
Board intends to refinance the existing bank facilities well before their expiry in January 2005.  In light of the significant cash
generation this year and that which is expected in the forthcoming two years, the Board expects that it will be able to complete the
necessary refinancing before the existing facilities expire.

2008 on which interest is fixed at 5.25% per annum, £0.2m of fixed rate loan notes issued by the Company and £5.8m of sterling
finance lease obligations.  The fixed rate US dollar borrowings relate to US$250m (£156.4m) of the borrowings under the group’s
secured loan facility on which interest rates have been fixed by means of two interest rate swaps executed in August 2000 with
LloydsTSB Bank plc (US $125m) and Bank of America (US$125m) and to £16.6m of US dollar finance lease obligations.  Interest

c) Currency profile of monetary assets
During the year the Company has used financial instruments for the purpose of managing funding, interest rate and currency risk.
Such derivative financial instruments are only used to manage or hedge underlying exposures and not to create exposures.  At 30
April 2003 the only currency exposures in the group’s operations in currencies other than their own functional currency related to
payables of £3.1m in the US payable in Euros and £0.1m in the Republic of Ireland payable in pounds sterling.  The equivalent
comparatives at 30 April 2002 were payables of £0.2m in the Republic of Ireland payable in pounds sterling.

under the senior credit facility.
e)  Borrowing facilities
Undrawn committed facilities at 30 April 2003 totalled US$68m (£42.5m) and relate to the undrawn balance of the revolving loan
commitment under the Group’s senior secured bank loan facility which expires in more than one years but less than two years.  In
accordance with the original provisions of the Senior Credit agreement US$50m (£31.3m) of this undrawn commitment lapsed on 31
May 2003 and, additionally, under the amendment agreement dated 30 May 2003, the Company has agreed not to draw on the
remaining undrawn amount until it lapses on 31 May 2004.
Undrawn overdraft facilities at 30 April 2003 totalled £6.2m.
f)  Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The table below provides a comparison, by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities at 30 April 2003. Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction
between informed and willing parties and includes accrued interest.  Where available, market values have been used to determine
fair values. Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing
interest and exchange rates.
Summary of methods and assumptions
● Bank loans and overdraft, loan notes and cash: - Fair value approximates to the carrying value because of the short maturity of 
these items or because they bear interest at floating rates which are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
● 5.25% convertible loan note and finance lease obligations: - fair value at 30 April 2003 is calculated by reference to the present 
value of the cash flows implicit in these liabilities discounted at current market rates for equivalent financial liabilities together 
with, in the case of the convertible loan note, an estimate of the option value implicit in the conversion option calculated using a 
suitable option pricing model
● Interest rate swap agreements: - fair value is determined by reference to market quotations obtained with reference to interest 
rates ruling at 30 April 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April

No deferred tax has been provided in respect of the surplus arising on revaluation of the Group’s properties because all of the
properties are employed in the Group’s business, and it is not the Group’s intention to dispose of any of them. In any event, the
likelihood of a material tax liability arising on disposal is remote due to the availability of rollover relief.  Additionally no deferred tax is
provided on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries because it is not intended to remit these in the foreseeable future.

20  Provisions for liabilities and charges continued
Self insurance provisions relate to the estimated liability in respect of costs to be incurred under the Group’s self insurance
programmes for events occurring on or prior to the year end.  In previous years the provision was estimated based on a case by
case assessment by the independent claims handling agents of the likely outturn on each case.  This year the estimation method has
been amended and the provision is now based on a projection by independent actuaries and the company’s insurance broker of the
most likely final total cost of self insured risk based on historic claims experience for Sunbelt, BET and the US industry generally.
The impact of this change in estimation method, which the Directors consider provides a more appropriate estimation of the required
provision, was to increase the amount provided at 30 April 2003 by £10.1m of which £2.7m relates to the current year and £7.4m to
the amount provided at 30 April 2002.  The latter amount is treated as an exceptional item.  Other provisions include individually
insignificant items most of which are expected to be utilised within one to two years.

In June 2000, in connection with the acquisition of BET USA, the Company issued the 5.25% £134m nominal value unsecured
convertible loan note due 2008.  This loan note is convertible, at the holder’s option, into 89,333,333 ordinary shares at any time after
1 June 2001 and if not converted is redeemable at par on 1 June 2008.  The convertible loan note bore no interest in its first year of
issue.  No transfer of the loan note is permitted in its first year of issue and thereafter it may only be transferred with the consent of
the Company which will be granted if the Company is satisfied that the transferee (and any connected persons) would not, in
consequence of the transfer, hold ten per cent or more of the issued share capital of the Company after conversion.  Certain orderly
marketing restrictions also apply to ordinary shares issued through conversion.

24  Pensions
The Group operates pension plans for the benefit of qualifying employees.  The major plans for new employees throughout the Group
are all defined contribution plans following the introduction of the new stakeholder pension plan for UK employees in May 2002.
The Group also has a number of defined benefit plans of which the largest is the former plan for UK employees.  This plan, which
was closed to new members in 2001, is a funded defined benefit plan with trustee administered assets held separately from those of
the Group.  The latest triennial actuarial valuation of this plan was performed as at 30 April 2001 by Aon Limited using the projected
unit credit method and was carried out on a market-related basis, using a conservative set of actuarial assumptions for funding
purposes and a “best estimate” set for accounting purposes (as required by SSAP 24).  The other defined benefit plans have also
been valued for accounting purposes by qualified actuaries as at 30 April 2002 using methodologies appropriate to the nature of
each plan.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the main UK plan for funding and for accounting purposes were the same except for the
pre-retirement investment return where 6.9% per annum and 7.25% per annum were used respectively for past service and future
service for funding purposes against 7.9% per annum in both cases for accounting purposes and the assumed annual increase in
salaries which was 4.5% for funding purposes and 4.0% for accounting purposes.  The other main assumptions for both funding and
accounting purposes were the post-retirement investment return for current pensioners of 5.1% and for non-current pensioners of
5.25% and the annual inflation rate of 2.5%.  
On a combined basis the market value of the plan assets at the respective valuation dates was £23.6m.  On an on-going basis,
assets at market value were sufficient to cover 81.0% of the benefits that had accrued to members on the funding basis and 89.0%
on the SSAP 24 accounting basis.  On the advice of the actuary, employer’s contributions were paid to the main UK plan during the
year ended 30 April 2003 at the rate of 11.0% of members’ pensionable salaries at 1 May 2002 (increased to 15.0% from 1 May
2003). In the case of the other plans contributions were at the amounts set by the actuary.  For accounting purposes, the actuarial
deficit in each plan is being spread over the average remaining expected service life of the employees in the plan.

the other plans:

Additional pension disclosures under FRS17
Each of the Company’s defined benefit pension commitments were valued at 30 April 2003 under the provisions of FRS 17 by
independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit valuation method.  The major financial assumptions applied by the actuary
were:  a discount rate of 5.5% (2002 – 6.0%); a rate of increase in pensions in payment of 2.5% (2002 – 2.5%) in respect of pension
accrued after April 1997; an inflation rate of 2.5% (2002 – 2.75%); and a rate of increase in salaries of 4.0% (2002 – 4.25%).  The
classes of asset in the plans and their expected rates of return were: equities 7.25% (2002 – 6.9%); fixed interest bonds and gilts
5.0% (2002 – 5.5%); and other 4.0% (2002 – 4.0%).
Under these assumptions and the methods prescribed in FRS 17, the Group’s total commitment at 30 April 2003 in respect of its
defined benefit pension commitments is:

The movement in the year from a deficit of £7.1m to a deficit of £13.9m is principally attributable to a reduction in the market value of

Total amount recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses:
- amount (7.6)

FRS 17 requires that the pension schemes are valued using market conditions at the Company’s year end.  This may produce a
volatile figure for the surplus or deficit as, given a large proportion of the plan assets are held in equities, it is largely dependent on
the level of the stockmarket at the Company’s year end.

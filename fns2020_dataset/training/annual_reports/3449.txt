Section 1: Overview
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
we increased our shareholding in DB
Power Electronics, India (DB) to 49%.
We now operate this business as a
subsidiary of the Group as we have
effective management control. Our
shareholding in DB will be increased
to 90% in July 2009. We acquired
Power & Electronic Services Limited
in Ireland to establish a presence
in this important market. In the UK,
we invested in our service business
by acquiring Siemens’ UK UPS service
activities and, shortly after the period
end, Malcolm Power Systems in
Scotland. We acquired Protech
Services to develop our service
capability in the USA. We expanded
our sales and service network with
new businesses and ofﬁces opened
in Russia, Kazakhstan, The Philippines
and Vietnam and, since the year end,
South Korea. In all cases we won
business rapidly.
Our manufacturing joint venture in
Shenzhen, China has developed quickly,
supplying new, upgraded products
to European and Asian markets.
This low cost facility will help to
underpin margins in a more competitive
environment. Product development
remained a focus. Our R&D teams now
include the DB capability, and many
new products were launched during
the year to maintain our technological
leadership position.
up 30% at £110.0 million. Adjusted
operating proﬁt increased by 29%
to £46.4 million (2008: £36.1 million).
Underlying sales growth in constant
currency was 10% and the operating
margin increased – for the seventh
successive year – by 0.7 points
to 14.2%.
Adjusted proﬁt before tax increased
by 31% to £43.7 million (2008:
£33.3 million), giving adjusted earnings
per share of 11.5p (2008: 9.5p),
an increase of 21%. Basic earnings
per share were 10.6p (2008: 10.0p).
Operating cash ﬂow was £43.0 million
(2008: £30.0 million), representing
93% of adjusted operating proﬁt,
despite an increase in stock and
debtors commensurate with the
growth of the business.
Net debt for the year was reduced
to £15.4 million (2008: £21.8 million)
as operating cash ﬂow was more than
sufﬁcient to fund acquisitions (including
further investment in DB Power
Electronics), capital expenditure,
dividend payments, tax and interest.
STRATEGIC INVESTMENT
We continued to make investments
to improve the geographic and market
sector balance of the business, and
to develop our market leading total
solutions offering. Most signiﬁcantly,
A RESILIENT BUSINESS
Despite a year of global economic
turbulence, Chloride has delivered
another year of growth in orders, sales,
proﬁts and cash. We continued to
concentrate on executing our proven
strategy and maintaining our focus
on those markets that offer long-term
growth potential. Cash and cost
management has been a priority
through 2008 and we ﬁnished the
ﬁnancial year with lower net debt
whilst maintaining investment in
people, in bolt-on acquisitions and
further development to the geographic
balance of the business. Signiﬁcantly,
the businesses outside our core market
of Western Europe generated more
than 43% of sales in the year.
The mission-critical importance of
reliable and high quality electrical
power is recognised by our blue-chip
customers, and this ongoing market
need, combined with our strong service
business, broad geographic spread
and excellent cash generation, provides
a sound basis to trade through more
turbulent times and positions Chloride
well to offer excellent growth potential
over the longer term.
KEY FINANCIALS
Total sales increased by 22% to
£326.7 million (2008: £267.6 million),
with product sales up 19% at
£216.7 million and service revenue
DESPITE A YEAR OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURBULENCE,
CHLORIDE HAS DELIVERED ANOTHER YEAR OF GROWTH
IN ORDERS, SALES, PROFITS AND CASH. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 5
Chloride, which has a robust business
model, supports mission critical
business systems and public
infrastructure. Despite the more
challenging environment, with robust
service revenues and cash generation,
and a strong balance sheet we expect
the Group to show resilience. Mindful
of this we continue to review carefully
all our markets and manage closely
our cost base.
We continue to execute our strategy,
with further careful investment in
higher growth potential markets and
sectors, and in the technology and
services that meet the demands of
our customers. Accordingly, we are
conﬁdent in the longer term prospects
for the business.

CHAIRMAN
dividend of 1.85p per share, gives a
dividend for the year of 4.7p per share
– an increase of 18% on the prior year.
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the
Annual General Meeting (AGM), the
ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 3 August
2009 to shareholders on the register
at close of business on 10 July 2009.
BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH
Chloride’s record of prudent balance
sheet management and strong cash
generation has served it well during
the exceptional upheaval in markets
during the last year. Cost control and
cash generation, together with close
management of the debt facilities,
were priorities for the business during
the year. We were able to successfully
renegotiate/replace, on sensible terms,
all expiring facilities. This focus on cash
generation allowed us to reduce net
debt signiﬁcantly and means that the
Company has more than sufﬁcient
headroom to continue investment
across the business.
OUTLOOK
Chloride operates in global markets
with robust long-term growth
characteristics, driven by increasing
Digitisation and rising Energy demand.
We enter the new ﬁnancial year with
an order book at record levels led by
Industrial Systems, but remain cautious
about the short term.
BOARD
Keith Hodgkinson, the Group’s former
Chief Executive who retired as a
director on 29 July 2008, ended his
consultancy arrangements with the
Group on 30 November 2008.
In December 2008 we announced the
addition of John Hughes to the Board
as a non-executive director. John is
Chairman of Spectris PLC, Telecity

extensive experience in the electronics,
data centre, and IT industries.
PEOPLE
Chloride’s people are at the heart of the
Group’s success and the service we
offer our customers. On behalf of the
Board I would like to thank them all for
another year of excellent performance.
The Chloride Academy, now in its
second year of operation, has gone from
strength to strength. The Academy
demonstrates Chloride’s commitment
to the training and development of its
people. I am also pleased that courses
are now being offered as part of the
services we provide to customers.
DIVIDEND
The Board is pleased to propose
a ﬁnal dividend of 2.85p per share

prospects which, with the interim

Section 2: Operating review
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
STRATEGY
Chloride is a market leading, focused
supplier of secure power solutions to
those customers who understand the
risk to business continuity of degrading
power quality. We term this Secure
Power Always.
Our Total Solutions Approach
generates competitive advantage
through establishing long-term
relationships with customers, to whom
we provide service and support for
our own and multi-vendor installations
through life, often exceeding ten years.
Looking forward, we are conﬁdent
that our strategy provides an excellent
framework for sustained growth over
the long term as well as greater
resilience in the shorter term.
We were delighted to be awarded
the European Uninterruptible Power
Supplies Growth Strategy Leadership
Best Practices Award for 2008 by the
leading independent market research
company Frost & Sullivan.
The unprecedented upheaval in ﬁnancial
and commercial markets that took place
during the last year affected all aspects
of economic activity around the world.
This has, to varying degrees, fed
through into each of the geographies
and market sectors in which we
operate. The challenge for all
businesses and management teams
has been to maximise performance
in this very different macro-economic
environment to the recent past.
At Chloride we chose to remain
focused on the consistent and
sustained execution of our proven
strategy and by doing so we have been
able to deliver another year of strong
growth in sales, proﬁts and cash ﬂow.
In view of the economic conditions,
we were especially focused on
operating cash ﬂows throughout
the year. This has allowed us to both
manage down our net debt and to
maintain investment for the future.
We managed our cost base
appropriately, driving further business
efﬁciencies and taking pre-emptive cost
reduction actions in the USA and the
UK when market conditions warranted,
to support margins.
Going forward, we will continue to
execute our strategy and maintain the
careful and prudent management of our
cash ﬂows, costs and balance sheet.
THE UNPRECEDENTED UPHEAVAL IN FINANCIAL AND
COMMERCIAL MARKETS THAT TOOK PLACE DURING
THE LAST YEAR AFFECTED ALL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY AROUND THE WORLD.
IT IS OUR STRATEGY TO OPERATE IN HIGHER GROWTH POTENTIAL
MARKET SECTORS AND GEOGRAPHIES AND TO FOCUS OUR
INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO:
 EXPAND THE NETWORK OF SALES AND SERVICE OFFICES THROUGH
WHICH WE ACCESS AND SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS
 MAINTAIN THE INDUSTRY LEADING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE
IN OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE SOLUTIONS
 DEVELOP THE SKILLS AND CAPABILITY OF THE CHLORIDE PEOPLE

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
on oil prices being greater than
US$50 per barrel (usually those involving
deepwater drilling and bitumen sands).
In Power Generation, the energy “gaps”
in many Western economies should
drive opportunities for conventional
and nuclear generation projects.
Despite a slowdown in Financial
Services the Data Centre market, which
accounts for 20% of sales, is expected
to be quite robust but with a switch from
large proprietary data centres to hosted
facilities. We will continue to use our
experience and expertise in Western
Europe to expand the business in Asia
Paciﬁc, Eastern Europe and Russia.
Whilst we generated good
performances in the Manufacturing
sector, where sales grew by 53%,
we expect this to be softer going
representing 16% (2008: 12%) and
Central Asia and Eastern Europe
generating 10% (2008: 8%).
Similarly, we have developed a better
balance to the market sectors that the
Group serves. This is achieved on a
region by region basis and our approach
is focused on the higher growth
potential sectors for Chloride in each
region. There remain opportunities for
us to grow, even in difﬁcult market
conditions, where we have historically
been underrepresented.
Energy and Oil & Gas represented 16%
of our sales and we expect this sector
to continue to generate opportunities
as we expand our geographic coverage.
Oil & Gas investment levels are
expected to be lower, particularly
affecting those projects dependent
LONG-TERM GROWTH MARKETS
The world market for Secure Power
solutions grew strongly in the ﬁrst half
of 2008 but, in common with many
other industries, the rates of growth
slowed through the second half of the
year as the economic environment
deteriorated. Nevertheless, we are
pleased to have once again delivered
growth ahead of the market and to
build market share.
Despite these shorter term challenges,
at a macro level, we are conﬁdent that
increasing Digitisation and rising Energy
demand are enduring long-term drivers
of growth in our markets.
IMPROVED GEOGRAPHIC AND
MARKET SECTOR BALANCE
During the year we continued to
focus on extending our capabilities
and geographic reach in higher growth
potential markets. In so doing we
increased our addressable market,
improved the inherent resilience of
the business and positioned ourselves
closer to customers in order to be
able to service and support them
more effectively.
This approach has signiﬁcantly
improved the geographic balance of the
business. Western Europe, our largest
market, now accounts for 57% (2008:
63%) of sales, with Asia Paciﬁc

In the UK our service business grew

impact of a slowdown in the Financial
Services related solutions business.
Chloride Masterpower, which is based
in Aberdeen and serves the Energy
and Oil & Gas markets, grew strongly
and will now be integrated into the
UK business. This will allow a more
focused approach to the many
opportunities in the UK Energy and
Oil & Gas sectors, as well as releasing
back ofﬁce efﬁciencies.

Section 2: Operating review
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
In India our strategic partnership
with DB Power Electronics (DB)
developed further as we took effective
management control in July 2008 and
agreed to acquire up to 90% of the
business in July 2009. DB, which is the
largest domestic secure power supplier
in India, has a sales and service network
of more than 40 ofﬁces. DB has a
strong technical capability and holds
the requisite qualiﬁcations to supply
the Indian nuclear industry. Going
forward DB will be responsible for
all of Chloride’s business in India, and
where appropriate DB technology will
be sold through the Chloride network.
In Italy we continued to make good
progress, building on long-term
relationships with customers across a
wide range of sectors and, importantly,
started to address hitherto unexplored
opportunities in the Energy and Oil &
Gas markets.
Spain performed well, particularly
in the Energy and Oil & Gas markets,
which more than compensated for
weakness in our traditional sectors.
Sales grew 26%.
In Sweden, where we hold a 15%
minority stake in Chloride Eltek,
performance was strong. We have
an option to acquire the remaining
interest in this business by 2010.
ACCELERATING GROWTH
IN ASIA PACIFIC
The markets in Asia Paciﬁc offer strong
long-term growth opportunities and we
continue to move quickly and decisively
to expand our presence and capability
in this territory. Sales in the region
were up 71%. We won excellent
business in China for the Olympics,
in South Korea in the Energy and
Oil & Gas sectors as well as in
Malaysia and Hong Kong.
In January 2009 we acquired Siemens
UK’s UPS service business. The
business was immediately integrated
into the UK service network and
provides access to a range of new
customers and markets. Just after
the end of the year we completed the
acquisition of Malcolm Power Systems,
a small UPS service provider
in Scotland.
In October 2008 we improved our
access to the Irish market with the
acquisition of Power & Electronic
Services Limited. Since the business
was acquired, it has performed strongly
and has generated good orders, sales
and cash.
In France, where our Industrial
Systems business is headquartered
in Lyon, performance was strong with
the focus on the Energy and Oil & Gas
markets. We also invested in our sales
and service business relocating to new
facilities and ASTE, our multi-vendor
service provider, has had a successful
year, growing strongly with a number
of customers including Aeroport de
Paris and Euro Disney.

and the Philippines and have already

Our manufacturing joint venture in
Shenzhen, Southern China, came on
stream during the year, as expected,
with the launch of three new products
under 200kVA. This signiﬁcant
investment, in which we have
management control and which is now
proﬁtable, will help underpin Group
margins going forward and provides a
local source for the Asia Paciﬁc region.
These investments reﬂect our
commitment to the region and our
determination to establish a signiﬁcant
platform for a long-term presence
in Asia Paciﬁc.
We continued to invest in Chloride
Singapore to develop a market leading
presence in the territory and were

TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS
Central to our Total Solutions Approach
is sustained investment in technology
and service offerings in order to
maintain our industry leading position
and to ensure we meet the
expectations of customers.
 The vitality index, which represents
the proportion of product sales
derived from products introduced
in the last three years, stands at
76% buoyed by signiﬁcant new
launches in both the standard
and industrial businesses.
 Our product range offers class
leading energy efﬁciency
performance and the smallest
footprints in the market.
Improvement in energy
efﬁciency is a priority in
our development process.
DB has increased our development
capability. We completed construction
of a dedicated development centre at
DB’s headquarters in Pune, India during
the year. The DB team now works in
close co-operation with our existing
design centres in Erlangen, Germany
and Bologna, Italy and has an important
role in development for both the Indian
and international markets.
BUILDING A PLATFORM
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
We achieved another year of growth
in the region with sales up 27%.
Performance was driven by good
penetration of both the standard and
Energy and Oil & Gas markets in the
UAE, Kuwait, North Africa and Saudi
Arabia. In addition, we took steps to
further strengthen the management
team and improve our technical,
project management and service
capabilities in the region.
AMERICAS
Overall performance in the Americas
was, in reported terms, up by 13%,
the highest growth rate in the region
in recent years. In North America our
small products and power conditioning
business struggled (down 11% at
constant exchange rates), a result of
the poor economic environment and
a speciﬁc exposure to retail markets.
However, the high power business
grew by 27% (10% at constant
exchange rates), its fourth consecutive
year of growth, and also beneﬁted from
the acquisition of Protech Services,
a Chicago-based service provider,
in January 2009. This acquisition,
the ﬁrst in North America for a number
of years, will allow us to accelerate the
development of the US service business.
In Latin America we grew well with
sales up 23%, the result of a strong
performance in Brazil.
DEVELOPING A PRESENCE
IN EASTERN EUROPE AND
CENTRAL ASIA
In Eastern Europe and Central Asia
we have focused on developing a local
Chloride presence in the countries
we see as important. Excellent sales
growth of 51% in Eastern Europe
reﬂected strong performances in
a number of businesses.
In Turkey, where we are the market
leader, a focus on expanding our
solutions offering and a targeted
approach to the Energy and Oil &
Gas sectors generated sales up
by 42%.
In June 2008 we opened Chloride
Rus LLC, a joint venture, with our
long standing partner in Russia,
in which we have a minority stake.
This is proving to be an exciting
opportunity with sales to the joint
venture up 25% as we developed
the local technical capability and
services platform.
Our business in Poland, Chloride
Polska, had its second year of strong
growth with sales more than doubling.
In Kazakhstan we established an
additional sales and service ofﬁce
and in Azerbaijan we are present
in Baku to support the offshore
oil and gas installations in the
Caspian Sea.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
SERVICE
Central to our strategy is the provision
of high quality service and support
to our customers, which we believe
differentiates us in the market place.
During the year we focused closely
on the development of our service
business, a key part of our business
model, as it provides resilient and
secure future earnings. We achieved
another year of excellent growth with
revenue up 30% to £110.0 million.

our extensive service network as
required. We now monitor on this
basis nearly 10,000 installations
in 32 countries across the globe.
Connections grew 9% this year and
over the past four years have grown
11%, CAGR. The next generation,
Life.Next, will provide IT-based,
customer conﬁgurable interrogation
and reporting to make critical
information available to customers.
PEOPLE
Our strategy is dependent upon the
development of the knowledge and
skill base in Chloride and on our ability
to add to and develop that base as
we expand our geographic presence.
Chloride is fortunate to have some
of the most experienced people in
the industry and I am grateful to my
colleagues for their commitment to
customers, which ultimately delivers
success for Chloride.
The service order book grew by 27%
and service revenue now accounts for
34% (2008: 32%) of total revenues.
 Our services are focused on the
needs of customers, with the aim
of developing long term relationships
with them. We have developed
and broadened our range of services
to support the wider critical power
infrastructure and now provide
generator, switchgear, emergency
lighting and control system service
support. In addition, we offer a range
of site testing and surveys including
thermal imaging, waveform analysis,
battery impedance testing and fuel
tank surveys.
 Development of our remote
diagnostic tool, Life.net, has
continued and, in addition to
being available via the internet

Section 2: Operating review
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OPERATING MARGINS
The operating margin increased by
just less than one point, the seventh
successive year of improvement.
We managed our cost base very
carefully, driving further business
efﬁciencies and taking pre-emptive cost
reduction actions in the US and the UK
when market conditions warranted,
to support margins. Our service focus
drove the higher margin service
revenues strongly ahead improving
the sales margin mix.
CURRENCY
The Group’s activities in each of the
countries in which we operate are
conducted and managed in local
currency. A majority of the Group’s
sales and proﬁts are generated within
the euro zone and the strength of
the euro relative to sterling has had
a material translational impact on
the Group’s results.
During the year the impact on sales
and operating proﬁt was £32.4 million
and £6.1 million respectively.
Signiﬁcant movements in the sterling-
dollar and sterling-euro exchange rates
have the potential to have a material
impact on the Group’s reported results
going forward.
ROBUST BUSINESS MODEL
Given the economic conditions
we were especially focused on the
generation of strong operating cash
ﬂows throughout the year. Operating
cash ﬂow was £43.0 million, (2008:
£30.0 million) with conversion at 93%
(2008: 83%). The growth in operating
cash ﬂow fed through into the free
cash ﬂow and allowed us to fund
acquisitions and reduce the gearing in
the business to 10.8% (2008: 23.1%).
This, together with good management
of our credit facilities, means that we
remain a well funded business with
the ﬁnancial resources to sustain
development and investment in
the business. The Group’s committed
borrowing facilities at 31 March 2009
amount to £110.0 million. In addition,
the Group has uncommitted facilities
of £13.0 million. Included in the
committed facilities amount are
two credit facilities amounting to
£25.0 million each that expire in June
2009 and November 2009. The Group
has been successful in renewing the
ﬁrst of these facilities and increasing
the same to £30.0 million and is well
advanced in discussions with the
renewal or replacement of the other
facility and expects to complete this
exercise in the next quarter.
– Power
to Learn, Power to Grow – is now
ﬁrmly established at the centre of the
training and development programme
for Chloride people and business
partners across the world. Blended
learning techniques combining remote
and residential attendance are used and
where appropriate courses are provided
in local languages. Rapid progress
has been made with the formal
accreditation of training centres in
Bologna, Bedford, Erlangen, Singapore,
Madrid, Istanbul, Pune and Sydney.
More than 15 trainers have passed
through a similarly rigorous assessment
to achieve trainer status.
Some 640 employees (27% of the
headcount) have undertaken training
modules in the year covering sales,
solution design and service support
that have been developed by experts,
both internal and external to Chloride.
As part of our Environmental Health
and Safety (EHS) policy our courses
incorporate the relevant EHS best
practice to safeguard employees,
customer staff and other stakeholders.
The Academy will remain a priority
for Chloride going forward.

PROSPECTS
Chloride operates in global markets
with robust long-term growth
characteristics, driven by increasing
Digitisation and rising Energy demand.
We enter the new ﬁnancial year with
an order book at record levels led by
Industrial Systems, but remain cautious
about the short term.
Chloride, which has a robust business
model, supports mission critical
business systems and public
infrastructure. Despite the more
challenging environment, with robust
service revenues and cash generation,
and a strong balance sheet we expect
the Group to show resilience. Mindful
of this we continue to review carefully
all our markets and manage closely
our cost base.
We continue to execute our strategy,
with further careful investment in
higher growth potential markets and
sectors, and in the technology and
services that meet the demands of
our customers. Accordingly, we are
conﬁdent in the longer term prospects
for the business.

market conditions in the short term

The Board’s conﬁdence in the future
is again reﬂected in the ﬁnal dividend,
which the Board recommends rises
18.75% to 2.85p, giving a full year

Over the full year the share price

shareholder return has fallen less than

it is very well positioned to drive total

power protection services in the USA
for a cash consideration of £0.5 million
with a further payment of £0.2 million
deferred until 31 December 2009.

On 10 October 2008 the Company
acquired the share capital of Power &
Electronic Services Limited, a supplier
of critical power protection services
in Eire for a cash consideration of
£1.0 million with a further payment
of £0.3 million deferred until October
2009 and 2010.
On 6 January 2009 the Company
acquired the trade and assets of
Siemens’ UK UPS Systems business,
a supplier of critical power protection
services in the UK for a cash
consideration of £0.6 million with
a further payment of £0.2 million
deferred until December 2009.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
Due to the acceleration in proﬁts and
the impact of exchange shareholders’
funds have grown further to just over
£133.0 million.
ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS
A number of small but important
investments took place during the year.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,
MANUFACTURING AND SALES
AND SERVICE IN INDIA
On 3 July 2008 the Company acquired
a further 17% of the share capital
of DB Power Electronics (P) Ltd,
a manufacturer and supplier of critical
power protection services in India,
for a cash consideration of £4.8 million.
This brings Chloride’s total investment
in the company to 49%. We now
consolidate this business as a
subsidiary as we have effective
management control. Under an
agreement with the shareholders
of DB Power, Chloride will also
purchase a further 41% during the
period to July 2009.
MANUFACTURING JOINT VENTURE
IN CHINA
During the year Chloride contributed
cash for a 50% equity stake in its
manufacturing joint venture, Chloride
Phoenixtec Electronics Limited. This
secures quality supply of key products
for the Group and seeks to reduce cost
on an ongoing basis.
ADJUSTED OPERATING CASH
FLOW AND CONVERSION
Adjusted operating cash ﬂow was
again strong, nevertheless the strong
growth in the business resulted in
some investment in working capital.
Good credit control was exercised
(year end debtor days were 76 (77 in
2008) and the level of overdue debtors
remained constant at 15 days). This
once again underpins the quality of
the customer base and the related
earnings. Management of the supply
chain has been tightened further with
inventory turns improving, although
terms with key suppliers have been
held or shortened in some cases to
ensure quality and speed of delivery.
Management remains committed
to turning proﬁts into cash to enable
reinvestment in the businesses.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
AND INVESTMENTS
Tangible ﬁxed asset capital expenditure
in the year was c. £5.0 million of
which c. £3.0 million has been spent
on service infrastructure investment
and related systems across Spain,
Australia and the USA. The balance
of expenditure was largely routine
and replacement in nature.

to £30.0 million and is well advanced

The directors have considered the
Group’s internal forecasts and
projections that take into account
reasonably possible changes in trading
performance. The levels of committed
facilities have been compared to
forecast borrowing requirements. The
directors have also analysed the effect
of forecast performance on covenant
compliance. Chloride has signiﬁcant
headroom in terms of both available
facilities and in terms of its operation
within existing covenants.
At 31 March 2009, the Company had
reduced net debt by over £6.0 million to
c. £15.4 million comprising on demand
borrowings of £1.1 million most of which
relates to the hedging of our overseas
operations, ﬁnance lease obligations of
£0.5 million and committed borrowings
of £51.9 million less cash and short-
term deposits of £38.1 million.
In its principal overseas companies
the Company has on-demand overdraft
and bill discounting facilities to provide
local funding for operating and working
capital requirements. Drawings under
these facilities provide a partial hedge
against assets held in local currencies.
CORE FACILITIES AND NET
LIQUID FUNDS
The Group’s management policy
regarding liquidity risk is to ensure
that it always has sufﬁcient
committed facilities available to meet
its foreseeable needs. As the Group
has grown in size and continued to be
cash generative so has its credit rating
grown in strength such that the Group
is regarded as having credit rating
of BBB+/A-.
The Group policy is to manage its
debt using a number of three-year
committed revolving facilities, which
mature at different points to ensure
adequacy of funding. Interest on
these facilities is charged at LIBOR or
equivalent plus an appropriate margin.
The Group’s committed borrowing
facilities at 31 March 2009 amounted
to £110.0 million of which £52.0 million
was drawn, indicating an overall
borrowing headroom of £58.0 million
in addition to cash and cash equivalents
of £38.1 million.
In addition, the Group has uncommitted
facilities of £13.0 million. Included in
the committed facilities amount are
two credit facilities amounting to
£25.0 million each that expire in June
2009 and November 2009 respectively.
The Group has been successful in
renewing the ﬁrst of these facilities
to May 2012 and increasing the same
TREASURY OBJECTIVES
AND POLICIES
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s funding, liquidity and
exposure to interest rate and foreign
exchange rate risks are managed
by the Group treasury department.
The treasury department uses a
combination of derivative and
conventional ﬁnancial instruments
to manage these underlying risks.
Treasury operations are conducted
within a framework of Board-approved
policies and guidelines.
This function operates to reduce risk
and cost and no transactions are
undertaken on a speculative basis.
The execution of ﬁnancial instruments
within the company is conﬁned to
central treasury.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY
The Group’s management is
committed to enhancing shareholder
value, both by investing in the
businesses so as to improve the
return on investment and by managing
capital structure. The Group’s objective
is to fund its growth out of existing
resources and debt, such that it
maintains a strong balance sheet and
complies with its borrowing covenants.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
the Group has regular net foreign
currency cash ﬂows which are strongly
predicted the Group hedges its net
exposure using forward foreign currency
exchange contracts. The effective
portion of the gain or loss on the hedge
is recognised in the statement of
recognised income and expense to
the extent it is effective and recycled
into the income statement when the
underlying hedged transaction impacts
the income statement.
Apart from optimising expenses and
interest on local borrowings, the Group
does not believe, as an internationally
based business, that it is appropriate
to hedge other aspects of its proﬁt
and loss account translation exposure.
Non-sterling currencies of primary
importance to the Group moved as

Euro 1.08 1.25 (14)% 1.21 1.42 (15)%
CURRENCY RISK
The Group publishes its consolidated
ﬁnancial statements in sterling and
conducts business in many foreign
currencies. As a result, it is subject
to foreign currency exchange risk due
to exchange rate movements which
will affect the Group’s transaction
costs and the translation of the
results and underlying net assets
of its foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on
the translation of foreign currency
borrowings, where they are in an
effective hedge relationship, are
recognised in the statement of
recognised income and expense.
For currencies in which there is an
active market, the Group seeks to
hedge its transactional foreign exchange
rate risk on a transactional basis. Where
The funding structures of our UK
and overseas operations are regularly
reviewed with the objective of achieving
the optimal post-tax ﬁnancing cost.
The Group also has adequate foreign
exchange contract and engagement
facilities for its day to day commercial
and exposure matching needs.
Of the £1.1 million of on demand
borrowings at 31 March 2009,
£0.3 million is guaranteed by Chloride
Group PLC. The committed term
facilities are guaranteed by Chloride
Group PLC and contain common
ﬁnancial covenants regarding interest
cover, a ceiling on net debt and
minimum consolidated shareholders’
funds. It is Group policy to manage
the consolidated balance sheet so
as to operate at all times well within
covenanted restrictions. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 23
TAX RATE
The tax charge in 2009 represents
an effective rate of 32% (2008: 30%).
The rise in rate is due to the uplift in
volume of taxable proﬁts in European
tax regimes with effective rates of
higher than 30%.
NEIL W WARNER
GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR
CREDIT RISK
The Group monitors its credit exposure
to its counterparties via their credit
ratings (where applicable) and through
its policy, thereby limiting its exposure
to any one party to ensure that they are
within Board-approved limits and that
there are no signiﬁcant concentrations
of credit risk. The counterparties to the
ﬁnancial instruments transacted by the
Group are major international ﬁnancial
institutions. Group policy is to enter
into such transactions only with
counterparties with good long-term
credit ratings.
USE AND FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
At 31 March 2009, outstanding forward
contracts existed with a gross book
value totalling £14.1 million in respect
of actual transaction exposures. The
net fair value of these forward foreign
exchange contracts was £0.3 million
at 31 March 2009. In addition to these
forward contracts the Group is exposed
to foreign exchange movements on its
overseas borrowings.
INSURANCE The Group purchases
insurance for commercial or, where
required, for legal or contractual
reasons. In addition, the Group retains
insurable risk where external insurance
is not considered an economic means
of mitigating these risks.
Net assets are held in a number of
currencies and translated at year-end
rates. This is explained more fully
in the accounting policy. The resulting
exposures are managed where
practicable by matching local currency
assets with local currency borrowings.
INTEREST RATE RISK
The majority of the Group’s borrowings
are at interest rates of LIBOR or
EURIBOR plus a margin.
The Group’s policy is to review the ratio
of ﬁxed rate debt to total outstanding
debt on an ongoing basis to minimise
the risk of major interest rate
ﬂuctuations over the medium to long
term, and to hedge as appropriate such
exposure through the use of interest
rate swaps.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had
a ratio of ﬁxed rate debt to total
outstanding debt of approximately 1%.
As of 31 March 2009 the Group had
ﬁxed £0.5 million of euro-denominated
borrowings at an average ﬁxed rate
of 2.3%. The remainder of borrowings
are at ﬂoating rate and predominantly
LIBOR based. The weighted average
remaining period as at 31 March 2009
for which the above debt was ﬁxed
was 15 months. 24 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
The Group Risk Manager monitors
the effectiveness of risk management
and internal controls through site
reviews of Group businesses. His visit
programme is approved annually by
the Audit Committee. After each site
visit a report is prepared and presented
to local area Group management,
and to the Chairman of the Audit
Committee. A copy is also made
available to the external auditors.
The Group Risk Manager is able to call
on additional resources from central
staff and external consultants as
necessary. External consultants
also review health and safety and
environmental practices at selected
sites on the basis of a rolling schedule
agreed with the Group Risk Manager.
FINANCIAL RISKS
As an international business, the major
ﬁnancial risks faced by the Group are
liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate
risk and credit risk. The Board regularly
reviews these risks and approves
policies covering the use of ﬁnancial
instruments to manage ﬁnancial risk
and overall risk limits. A detailed
summary of the Group’s ﬁnancial risks
and how these risks are managed can
be found in the ﬁnancial review on
pages 21 to 23.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this annual
report are forward-looking. Although
the Group believes that the
expectations contained in such
statements are reasonable, it can give
no assurance that these expectations
will prove to be correct. Actual results
may differ materially from those
expressed in or implied by these
forward-looking statements.
 assess and report to the Audit
Committee on the effectiveness
of the Group’s non-ﬁnancial and
ﬁnancial internal control systems;
 ensure that an embedded
framework for managing risks is
in place throughout the Group; and
 provide an appropriate level
of reporting on the status
of risk management to the
operational management and
to the Audit Committee.
The Risk Committee meets twice
a year and the minutes are circulated
to the Audit Committee Chairman.
All directors are entitled to receive
the Risk Committee papers, and to
attend the meetings.
The nature, likelihood and materiality
of the risks affecting each Group
business are assessed by operational
management on an annual basis.
On the basis of these assessments,
the Risk Committee produces a risk
map for the Group as a whole, and the
summary of material risks is reviewed
by the Audit Committee and endorsed
by the Board. The risk assessment
process applies both to normal
operational activities and to projects
which are signiﬁcant to the Group,
where a risk register is drawn up and
monitored by the Group Risk Manager
throughout the project.
As described in the corporate
governance report, there is an
embedded process for monitoring and
controlling the identiﬁed risks through
monthly ﬁnancial and operational
reporting procedures. In addition,
appropriate levels of cover are
maintained under the Group insurance
programme in respect of insurable risks.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
The Group, in common with other
international businesses, is exposed
to a number of potential risks (not all
of which are within its control) which
may have a material effect on its
reputation, ﬁnancial or operational
performance. It is not possible to identify
or anticipate every risk that may affect
the Group, or the materiality of that risk.
However, Chloride recognises that the
monitoring, assessment and response
to risks can provide resilience, and even
competitive advantage, to the business.
Accordingly, it is a matter to which
considerable attention is paid, particularly
in such uncertain economic times.
The Board has overall responsibility for
risk management and internal controls
and is assisted by the Audit Committee.
Further details of the Group’s system
of internal controls are contained in
the corporate governance report on
pages 37 and 38.
The Audit Committee has one meeting
a year dedicated to reviewing risk.
In addition, internal control and risk

RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR
Section 2: Operating review
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
 Providing a safe working
environment and encouraging
health and safety awareness.
Maintaining fair and competitive
employment practices, which
promote equal opportunities and
develop the potential of our people;
 Opposing bribery and corrupt
business practices;
 Being responsive to customer
needs, and providing the highest
standards of customer care;
 Treating our suppliers fairly and
building long-term, mutually
beneﬁcial relationships with
key suppliers; and
 Supporting local communities
through charities supported
by our employees.
Responsible behaviour towards all
of our stakeholders and the wider
community is fundamental to Chloride’s
business. We seek to ensure that
we always act with integrity; that we
manage our activities so as to control
our environmental impact; and that we
give priority to the health and safety of
our employees and those affected by
our activities. The Chloride Board takes
full responsibility for compliance with
environmental, health and safety
and ethical standards and the Chief
Executive is responsible for reporting
on these issues at Board level.
Our statement of business policies
reinforces Chloride’s commitment to:
 Setting standards of environmental
management, conservation of
resources and waste management
processes that meet or exceed the
legal requirements in the countries
where we operate;
RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS ALL OF OUR
STAKEHOLDERS AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY IS
FUNDAMENTAL TO CHLORIDE’S BUSINESS. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 27
We encourage initiatives which beneﬁt
the environment, including the
continued use of video and telephone
conferencing in order to reduce air
travel. Our energy usage at our main
operating sites continues to decrease
due to our energy recovery and
recycling technology.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS
The Group has ﬁve principal production
centres in Bologna, Italy; Lyon, France;
Chicago, USA; Pune, India, and
Shenzhen, China. These activities
mainly involve the assembly and
testing of electronic equipment;
however the use of energy, water
and hazardous substances is low.
ENVIRONMENT
Chloride is committed to maintaining
good environmental practice to
minimise the impact of its activities
on the environment. We are also a
constituent of the FTSE4Good Index.
Our policy is to comply with standards
that match or exceed environmental
legislation in all countries in which
we operate, and to comply with
ISO 14001 (2004 issue) environmental
management standards in our principal
operational sites. 28 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR
Section 2: Operating review
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
During 2008/2009 Chloride began
measuring direct CO
2
emissions
from its principal sites. CO
2
emissions
during 2008/2009 were less than three
tonnes per employee compared to
industry standards of three to eight
tonnes per employee. Plans will be
developed in the coming year to
manage and reduce the CO
2
emissions
from all of Chloride’s principal sites.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
We recognise the primary importance
of ensuring the health and safety of
our employees and others affected
by the Group’s activities. Chloride’s
policy is to manage activities so that
employees and others are not exposed
to unnecessary and unacceptable risks
to their health and safety, and to meet
or exceed the legal and regulatory
health and safety standards in the
territories in which we operate.
Health and safety management
is embedded in the organisation.
The General Manager in each business
is accountable for health and safety
issues within his/her business, and in
major sites there are designated senior
managers responsible for health and
safety. Policies and procedures are
documented and regularly updated in
our principal locations and employees’
representatives are involved in
discussions of health and safety issues
through Works Councils or Health and
Safety Committees on a regular basis.
Where health and safety issues are
identiﬁed as signiﬁcant risks, the Risk
Committee keeps under review the
actions taken to address the risk.
These, in turn, are reported to the
Audit Committee, along with statistics
on workplace accidents. Evaluation
of health and safety and environmental
performance is also an integral part
of the due diligence process on the
acquisition of businesses.
Health and safety training is provided
as necessary, particularly in relation
to battery handling and working with
electricity. The Chloride Academy
includes health and safety as an
integral part of its education
programme. We continue to focus
on minimising risk to service
engineers while providing installation,
commissioning and after-sales technical
service in customers’ premises.
We have procedures in place to
minimise the exposure of our
employees to terrorist and other risks
while working in sensitive locations.
All travel to areas deemed sensitive
by the Foreign Ofﬁce travel advice
service is subject to prior approval
by the Group Risk Manager. Business
Continuity policies developed in
response to the threat of pandemics
also restrict travel to affected areas
in the event of such an occurrence.
During the year ended 31 March 2009,
working days lost due to accidents
in the workplace was 0.5 days per
employee compared to the overall
industry of 1.2 days. Health and safety
plans are in place in all Chloride’s sites
to minimise and reduce accidents in
the workplace.
EMPLOYEES
The Group operates an equal
opportunity policy and is committed
to providing recruitment and other
opportunities regardless of age, sex,
sexual orientation, religion, race or
disability. As at 31 March 2009 the
Group had 2,333 employees. The
Group’s employees are spread over
15 countries and in the larger sites
there are dedicated human resource
managers reporting to the local
General Manager. The Group Director
of Human Resources is responsible
for compliance on a global basis
with human resources policies. It is
the practice to encourage lines of
communication at local level through
appropriate means, such as works
councils, brieﬁng groups, workshops
and newsletters.
The principal sales and service sites
are in Southampton, Bedford and
Aberdeen, UK; Erlangen, Germany;
Bologna, Italy; Istanbul, Turkey; Madrid,
Spain; and Sydney, Australia. All of
these production and sales and service
sites, with the exception of India, have
been accredited with ISO 14001, 2004
issue. India has ISO 9001 accreditation
and will work towards ISO 14001
in due course. As part of ISO 14001
requirements each site is required
to evaluate environmental risks and
measure performance on the key areas
of impact. Performance measures are
speciﬁc to each site enabling the focus
to be maintained on their particular
areas of importance. Compliance with
ISO 14001 is certiﬁed by independent
certiﬁcation bodies.
90% of Chloride’s turnover is generated
by ISO 14001 compliant sites and most
of our components are purchased from
ISO 14001 certiﬁed suppliers.
Where requested by the customer,
Chloride undertakes responsibility for
disposing of used batteries at the end
of their useful life, typically ﬁve years.
All waste batteries are handled through
licensed waste contractors who recover
and recycle any hazardous content,
and dispose of any such waste in
accordance with applicable regulations.
CHLORIDE ACADEMY – BEDFORD ANNUAL REPORT 2009 29
CUSTOMERS
CUSTOMER SERVICE
Chloride’s total power protection
solutions perform an essential role
in providing secure power to a wide
range of safety-critical applications.
These include emergency lighting
in challenging environments such as
offshore drilling rigs and underground
metro tunnels; hospital equipment;
passenger safety systems in airports;
control centres for emergency services;
signalling on railway networks and
trafﬁc management systems on major
road networks.
Our solutions are an essential part of
many renewable energy generation
projects, such as wind farms and solar
power installations. We have also
formed alliances with partners for the
supply of fuel cells (where the only
waste product is water) and for rotary
technology, in order to help our
customers achieve their environmental
goals. We continually improve our
service offerings and LIFE.net, our
industry leading remote diagnostics
software, is an important part of our
solutions offering.
PRODUCTS
We ensure that our products meet
environmental regulations in the
countries where we operate and that
new products are progressively more
energy efﬁcient. Our 80-net and 90-net
UPS systems are designed for high
energy efﬁciency and our 90-net
system has been recognised by an
independent laboratory as the most
energy efﬁcient double conversion
product of its kind.
We are actively involved in industry
bodies – notably the European
Committee of Manufacturers of
Electrical Machines and Power
Electronics (CEMEP) – which considers
the application of the EU Directive
2002/95/EC, “Restrictions of the use
of certain Hazardous Substances in
Electrical Equipment” (the RoHS
Directive) to UPS systems. Although
this directive, which requires the
reduction of substances such as lead
and cadmium in electronic equipment,
does not directly apply to UPS
systems, we are committed to avoiding
the use of non-compliant materials
where this does not compromise the
operation and reliability of the UPS
system. Our low-power ranges have
RoHS-compliant electronics and we
work with individual customers to
meet their compliance requirements.
Although currently there is no
equivalent standard covering the
USA, our Oneac subsidiary produces
all its low power products with
RoHS-compliant electronics.
SUPPLIERS
Chloride believes in building long-term
partnerships with its key suppliers.
Chloride’s joint venture with
Phoenixtec Power Company, Taiwan
to develop a high-quality, low-cost
manufacturing facility in Shenzhen,
China and with DB Power Electronics
in Pune, India continue to increase
our product and service offering in
our developing regions.
Supplier audits are carried out regularly
to ensure that our major suppliers
remain ﬁnancially viable and that
they have maintained their ISO 14001
accreditation. Alternative suppliers
for all key components have been
identiﬁed and audited.
The Group is committed to developing
and motivating its people and, in the
UK it participates in the Investor in
People scheme. There is also a
programme to help employees
to acquire professional and technical
qualiﬁcations that are relevant to their
jobs. The Chloride Academy, established
in May 2007, provides enhanced
skills training to employees and 640
employees (27% of the workforce)
successfully completed courses during
the Academy’s second year of operation.
Limits of authority are in place to
restrict the size and type of contracts
that individuals may sign, ensuring that
signiﬁcant contracts with suppliers, as
well as customers and intermediaries,
are signed off at an appropriate level
in the organisation. Employee training
programmes include policies relating
to bribery and corruption in whatever
form and we have policies in place
with our agents and distributors to
ensure that any commissions paid to
intermediates are legitimate and fairly
reﬂect the value of services provided.
Chloride encourages open and honest
communication between employees
and management throughout the
organisation and provides a “whistle
blowing” procedure which employees
can use if they have serious concerns
about ethical or management issues
that they feel unable to discuss directly
with local management.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY AND BUSINESS REVIEW
The principal activity during the year under review was the supply of secure power solutions, including the manufacture and sale of uninterruptible
power supply systems and power conditioners, and after-sale technical support.
The business review on pages 7 to 29, which comprises the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the risk management report and
the corporate social responsibility report, forms part of the directors’ report. The business review comments on the Group’s performance and
development during the ﬁnancial year, its position at the end of the year, the key performance indicators, and the principal risks and uncertainties
relating to the Group.
ACQUISITIONS
Details are set out in note 28 to the ﬁnancial statements on pages 82 to 85.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The results for the year and the ﬁnancial position at 31 March 2009 are shown in the consolidated income statement on page 51 and the
consolidated balance sheet on page 52.
The directors recommend the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 2.85p per share which, together with the interim dividend of 1.85p per share paid
on 3 December 2008 makes a total dividend for the year of 4.70p per share (2008: 4.00p). Payment of the ﬁnal dividend, if approved at the
Annual General Meeting (AGM), will be made on 3 August 2009 to shareholders on the record at the close of business on 10 July 2009.
GOING CONCERN
The results and ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, borrowing facilities and liquidity are set out in pages 18 to 23 of the ﬁnancial
review and in note 20 on page 73. The outlook for trading performance of the Group is discussed in both the Chairman’s statement and the
Chief Executive’s report. Current economic conditions create uncertainty and make forecasting difﬁcult. The principal risks and uncertainties
that may affect the Group’s results and cash ﬂows and ﬁnancial position are discussed in the key risk section of the ﬁnancial review.
The Group’s committed borrowing facilities at 31 March 2009 amount to £110.0 million of which £52.0 million was drawn indicating an overall
borrowing headroom of £58.0 million in addition to cash and cash equivalents of £38.1 million. In addition the Group has uncommitted facilities
of £13.0 million. Included in the committed facilities amount are two credit facilities amounting to £25.0 million each that expire in June 2009 and
November 2009 respectively. The Group has been successful in renewing the ﬁrst of these facilities and increasing the same to £30.0 million
and is well advanced in discussions with the renewal or replacement of the other facility and expects to complete this exercise in the next quarter.
The directors have considered the Group’s internal forecasts and projections that take into account reasonably possible changes in trading
performance. The levels of committed facilities have been compared to forecast borrowing requirements. The directors have also analysed
the effect of forecast performance on covenant compliance. Chloride has signiﬁcant headroom in terms of both available facilities and in terms
of its operation within existing covenants.
Based on the above, and after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
facilities to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the annual report and accounts.
SHARE CAPITAL
Details of the issued share capital, which comprises ordinary shares of 25p each, with equal voting rights, is given in note 25 to the ﬁnancial
statements starting on page 79.
It is a requirement of company law that any shares issued wholly for cash must be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings
unless otherwise authorised by a resolution of the shareholders. The Notice of Annual General Meeting includes resolutions to renew for a period
of one year the directors’ power to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights pursuant to sections 89 and 95 of the Companies Act 1985.
At the Annual General Meeting in 2008, an authority was given to the Company for a period of one year to make market purchases of its
own shares. A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to renew this authority for a further period of one year.
Further details of these resolutions are contained in the explanatory notes accompanying the Notice of Meeting. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 33
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
Amendments to the Articles of Association must be approved by a general meeting of the shareholders in accordance with legislation in force
from time to time.
Details of a resolution to amend the Articles of Association, principally to take account of the Companies Act 2006 changes, are included in the
explanatory notes accompanying the Notice of Meeting.
DIRECTORS
Biographical details of the directors at the year end are set out on pages 30 and 31. The Articles of Association provide for re-election of the
directors every second year. John Hughes, who was appointed as a director on 1 January 2009, retires at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting
and, being eligible, offers himself for election. Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner retire by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
Information on compensation payable to executive directors and other senior executives as a result of dismissal in the event of a takeover is given
in the remuneration report, on page 44.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS
The interests of the directors in the share capital of the Company are as shown in the remuneration report on pages 47 and 48.
The executive directors are deemed to have an interest in the Chloride Group Employee Beneﬁt Trust (the Trust) as potential discretionary
beneﬁciaries. Details of the shares held by the Trust as at 31 March 2009 are set out on page 34.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY
The Group maintains directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance. The Group also indemniﬁes its directors and ofﬁcers to the extent permitted
by UK law, including payment of defence costs in civil, criminal and regulatory proceedings. Such costs must be refunded in the event that the
director or ofﬁcer is subsequently convicted. Neither the insurance policy nor the deed of indemnity provides cover where the director has acted
dishonestly or fraudulently.
POLICY ON PAYMENT OF SUPPLIERS
Appropriate terms and conditions are agreed for transactions with suppliers and payment is generally made on these terms.
The average number of days’ credit taken by the Company for trade purchases at the ﬁnancial year end was 38 days (2008: 35 days). The average
number of days’ credit taken by Group companies at the ﬁnancial year end was 69 days (2008: 83 days), reﬂecting different payment practices
in the various countries in which Chloride operates.
CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL DONATIONS
During the year donations of £12,770 (2008: £7,030) were made to charitable organisations which are associated with employees or closely linked
with the communities in which the Group operates. No political donations were made.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMBINED CODE
The Board recognises its accountability to shareholders and is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. The Board
considers that throughout the year under review the Company has complied with the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2006 FRC
Combined Code on corporate governance (the Combined Code), and with the rules of the UK Listing Authority.
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE COMBINED CODE
This report explains how the Company has applied the principles of the Combined Code to its activities. Section 1 of the Combined Code
sets out the main and supporting principles of good governance for companies, which are split into the following topics: directors; remuneration;
accountability and audit; and relations with shareholders.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Company currently operates with a Board of seven directors comprising the non-executive Chairman, four non-executive directors, including
the Senior Independent Director, and two executive directors. On the recommendation of the Nomination Committee John Hughes was appointed
as a non-executive director on 1 January 2009. Keith Hodgkinson and Robin Southwell retired as directors with effect from the Annual General
Meeting on 29 July 2008. The number of directors and the balance between executives and non-executives provides for effective operation and
is considered appropriate to the Company’s size and scope of activities.
A schedule of formal meetings of the Board, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee is arranged each year in line with the
Company’s management reporting, and interim and annual reporting cycle. During the year, the Board met formally seven times, together with
a further meeting to review strategy. Attendance at meetings was as follows:

3 John Hughes joined the Board on 1 January 2009. He was appointed a member of the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee on 3 February 2009 – after the
date of the February Audit Committee meeting (which he did attend).
4 Keith Hodgkinson and Robin Southwell both retired as directors after the Annual General Meeting on 29 July 2008.
In addition to the formal schedule of meetings, the Board held discussions with senior operational managers on strategy, business development,
and other topics important to the Group’s progress.
The Board has reserved to itself powers relating to matters that it considers signiﬁcant to the Group’s business, operational and ﬁnancial risks.
These are set out in a formal schedule and include the approval of corporate policies, strategy, plans and budgets; major acquisitions and disposals
of companies or businesses; major investment and ﬁnancial decisions; appointments to the Board; executive remuneration policy and major
management or organisational changes.
The Chairman and Chief Executive have deﬁned roles, providing for a division of responsibilities between them, which have been documented
and approved by the Board. The Chairman is responsible primarily for the running of the Board, while the Chief Executive’s primary role is the
running of the business and the development and implementation of strategy. 36 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 3: Governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Chairman has been appointed as a director for successive ﬁxed terms totalling 12 years. The other non-executive directors have each been
appointed for a term or successive terms totalling less than six years. The effective dates of the current terms of appointment are set out in the
remuneration report on page 42.
The Chairman met the Combined Code criteria for independence on his appointment as Chairman in 2001. The Board considers that the other
non-executive directors are independent of management and free of any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement.
At the forthcoming AGM, Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner retire in accordance with the Articles of Association and will seek re-election. John Hughes,
who was appointed as a director on 1 January 2009, retires and, being eligible, offers himself for election. The Board has reviewed their
performance and strongly supports their re-election or election, as the case may be, and recommends that the shareholders vote in favour.
All the directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and senior managers generally, and may take independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense if they consider it necessary to do so in the furtherance of their duties.
The non-executive directors held one meeting during the year with the Chairman, without the executive directors present. In addition, and as
noted below, the senior independent director held individual meetings with each of the non-executive directors.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has three standing committees – the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, each with a different chairman. The Chairman
chairs the Nomination Committee and is a member of the Remuneration Committee. All the independent non-executive directors are permanent
members of the Committees. The Board considers that this is the most appropriate way of enabling the non-executives to participate in monitoring
governance issues, including executive remuneration, succession planning and risk management, without placing undue reliance on any
one individual.
The terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, which are based on the model terms of reference published
by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, are published on the Group’s website – www.chloridegroup.com.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Committee’s activities and responsibilities are described in the Audit Committee report on pages 39 and 40.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee’s activities and responsibilities are described in the Remuneration Committee report starting on page 41.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Committee’s terms of reference include the following responsibilities:
 making recommendations to the Board in respect of new appointments of executive and non-executive directors;
 succession planning for directors and senior executives; and
 making recommendations on re-appointment of non-executive directors at the end of their term of appointment.
The Committee has a process for recommending Board appointments, based on a review of the skills of the other directors, development
of a speciﬁcation and employment of a ﬁrm of recruitment specialists to draw up a shortlist. Given that the Nomination Committee consists
of all the non-executive directors, the Chairman and the Chief Executive, matters relating to re-appointment of non-executives and succession
planning are also handled within meetings of the main Board.
ACTIVITIES
During the year the Committee was asked to oversee the appointment of an additional non-executive director with electronic and electrical
industrial experience. A leading ﬁrm of recruitment consultants was engaged and this resulted in the appointment of John Hughes, whose
biographical details appear on page 31. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 37
DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Newly appointed directors receive a full induction, including a detailed information pack, visits to the Group’s operations and meetings with
senior divisional management. Training in the role and responsibilities of directors is offered on appointment, and subsequently as necessary.
The Board has a process for performance evaluation which has been applied to the Board and its Committees annually since 2003/2004.
As in previous years, in 2008/2009, the process was based on the completion of a questionnaire by the directors in relation to the Board and each
of the Committees of which they were members. The responses were collated, reviewed by the Chairman and distributed to the directors for
discussion at a Board meeting. In addition, the senior independent director conducted personal reviews with individual non-executive directors.
Performance evaluation relating to the Audit and Remuneration Committees is discussed in the Audit Committee report on page 40 and the
remuneration report on page 41.
REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for compliance with the Combined Code in determining executive directors’ remuneration.
The remuneration report on pages 41 to 48 demonstrates how Chloride applies the principles of the Combined Code relating to the level
and make-up of remuneration and to disclosure.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Board seeks to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects, through the Chairman’s statement
and the directors’ report, which includes the business review (comprising the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the risk management
report and corporate social responsibility report).
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The directors are responsible for the Company’s system of internal control which aims to: safeguard the Group’s assets; ensure that proper
accounting records are maintained; ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements; and ensure the effectiveness and efﬁciency
of operations, including the assessment and management of risk. A system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk
of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance particularly against misstatement or loss.
Chloride has a well established and embedded framework of internal ﬁnancial and operational control for identifying, evaluating and managing
the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee carries out an annual review of the effectiveness of the material controls, and the Board
receives regular information about the Group’s operations, enabling it to evaluate the nature and extent of the risks faced by the Group.
The Board is therefore able to conﬁrm that the system of internal control has been in place throughout the year under review, and up to the date
of approval of the annual report. The key elements of the framework of internal and operational control, which comply with the Turnbull guidance,
“Internal Control Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” published in September 1999, are as follows:
 Directors have responsibility for setting the strategy and monitoring the conduct of the Group. The directors and the executive management
of the Company are accountable for their conduct and performance within the agreed strategies. A management structure exists with clearly
deﬁned lines of responsibility and the appropriate levels of delegation.
 The Group and its operations are subject to a detailed annual budget process and ongoing formal capital investment appraisal process.
Actual performance during the year is monitored monthly against budget, forecast and previous year, and full-year forecasts are updated
at regular intervals during the year, based on trended historical data and realistic macro-economic forecasts. These forecasts and results
are presented to the Board regularly. The Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director each prepare Board reports monitoring performance
and actions to achieve objectives.
 The Group and its subsidiaries operate control procedures designed to ensure complete and accurate accounting of ﬁnancial transactions,
and to limit the risk of loss of assets or fraud. Measures taken include physical controls, segregation of duty in key areas and internal reviews
and checks. The identiﬁcation, mitigation and monitoring of material risks are primarily the responsibility of operating company management.
During the budget and reporting cycle, general managers and ﬁnancial controllers are required to identify risks the business is exposed to,
assess any potential impact and to put in place actions to reduce them. The Audit Committee agrees the key risks to the business, which are
endorsed by the Board and monitored throughout the year. It is assisted by the Risk Committee, the functions of which are set out in the risk
management report on page 24.
 Key functions such as tax, treasury, insurance, legal, personnel and systems are controlled centrally. Further information on policies to manage
ﬁnancial risk is contained in the ﬁnancial review on pages 21 to 23. 38 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 3: Governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
EXTERNAL AUDIT
The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the Company’s annual report and accounts. They independently and objectively review
management’s reporting of the operational results and ﬁnancial position. They also review and test the systems of internal control and the data
contained in the annual report and accounts to the extent necessary for expressing their audit opinion. The policy on independence of auditors
is included in the Audit Committee report on page 40.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and considers that the Group Risk Manager whose role is described in the
Risk Management Report on page 24 fulﬁls this function.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Relations with shareholders receive the highest priority. The Company promotes dialogue with institutional shareholders and analysts through
regular meetings following the announcement of interim and ﬁnal results, and responds positively to invitations to enter into dialogue whenever
it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally to do so. All directors are available to attend meetings with shareholders
if requested. The Senior Independent Director attends analysts’ presentations, and the Chairman or the Senior Independent Director also attend
meetings with institutional shareholders when possible. The views of shareholders and analysts are reported back to the Board.
The Company routinely communicates with shareholders six times a year, through the preliminary and interim results announcements, interim
management statements, and trading updates issued at the start of the close period before announcement of the full and half year results. At the
AGM there is an opportunity, following the formal business, for informal communication between investors and directors. In addition, information,
including the presentations made to institutional shareholders and analysts and recent announcements, is readily available to shareholders on
the Group’s website – www.chloridegroup.com. It is the Company’s practice to send the Notice of Annual General Meeting to shareholders at
least 20 working days before the meeting. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 39
Section 3: Governance
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code by the Audit Committee of the Company and has been approved by the Board.
MEMBERSHIP
The Committee is made up of four non-executive directors, all of whom the Board considers to be independent. The members at 31 March 2009
were Eric Tracey (Chairman), Gary Bullard, John Hughes and Paul Lester. Mr Tracey has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience gained through
his former positions as a partner in Deloitte and ﬁnance director of Amey PLC and Wembley PLC, and through his current roles at Governance
for Owners, NEC Group Limited, Xero Live Ltd and NZ Trade & Enterprise.
The members bring extensive experience of corporate management in senior executive positions to the Committee.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the model published by the Institute
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. The terms of reference are available on the Group’s website and include the following:
 monitoring the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements, reviewing the annual and interim reports in detail to ensure that they present a balanced
and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects;
 reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and risk management systems;
 overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, monitoring their independence, agreeing the scope of audit and monitoring the
effectiveness of the audit process;
 making recommendations to the Board on the requirement for an internal audit function and reviewing the effectiveness of internal audit; and
 reviewing the Group’s arrangements for whistleblowing.
The Committee has authority to investigate any matters within its terms of reference and has access to the resources and information it requires
for this purpose.
The Committee is entitled to obtain independent professional advice on matters within its terms of reference.
MEETINGS
The Committee met three times during the year – in May, October and February. The Company Secretary acted as secretary to the Committee and
the meetings were attended by invitation by the Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Risk Manager and other senior ﬁnance
staff. The external auditors also attended the Committee meetings.
During the year, the Committee met once with the auditors without executive managers being present. It also held a private meeting with the
Group Risk Manager. In addition, the Committee Chairman met regularly with the Group Risk Manager to review matters arising from his site
visit reports and with the external auditors.
Attendance at meetings by the Committee members was as set out in the corporate governance report on page 35.
ACTIVITIES
The meeting that took place in May 2008 was principally concerned with the draft ﬁnancial statements for the year ending 31 March 2008 together
with the draft preliminary results announcement. The Audit Committee also considered the report of the external auditors on the full-year audit,
concentrating on issues of judgement and audit focus identiﬁed in the audit plan, including a review of valuation assumptions, impairment reviews
and disclosures in the annual report. The steps taken to ensure that all relevant audit information had been disclosed to the auditors were reviewed,
enabling the directors to make the statement in the directors’ report on page 34. In addition, the Committee was updated on internal control and
risk management issues, in accordance with normal procedure.
At the October meeting, in addition to an update on internal control and risk management issues, the Committee considered the draft interim
ﬁnancial statements for the period ending 30 September 2008, together with the draft interim results announcement. In addition the audit scope
and fee proposal for 2008/2009 and audit expectations were reviewed and approved.
The meeting in February 2009 was concerned primarily with the review of the risk management process including the activities of the Risk
Committee, the outcome from risk control visits and the agreement of the Group Risk Manager’s visit plan for the forthcoming year. The external
audit plan for 2008/2009 was also considered and approved, and the external auditors reported on the structure in place to ensure their independence.
The insurance arrangements for 2008/2009 were also considered. 40 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 3: Governance
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE
During the year, the Committee reviewed its performance through the process described in the corporate governance report on page 37.
The Committee considered it had the skills to perform its responsibilities, particularly through Mr Tracey’s ﬁnancial and audit experience.
Actions for improvement focused on training requirements and adding resource to the Group Risk Management function to ensure that
the scope of activity could be maintained throughout the year.
AUDIT EFFECTIVENESS
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the audit process following the 2007/2008 audit, and shared its ﬁndings with the auditors.
The Committee considered that in addition to a high level of technical competence and objectivity, the auditors demonstrated a clear understanding
of the business and communicated the issues of judgement and focus effectively to the Committee.
Based on the Committee’s view of the performance of the external auditors and on the planning and execution of the 2008/2009 audit,
the Committee has recommended to the Board that a resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Company has a policy for determining the types of non-audit work for which
it is appropriate to use the external auditors, including a clearance procedure for fees. The Committee is satisﬁed that these procedures have been
followed during the year, and that the external auditors have in place robust procedures, including the rotation of audit staff and partners, to ensure
their independence, preserve objectivity and comply with regulatory and professional requirements. The Committee has also reviewed the
performance of the external auditors with the help of questionnaires completed by all of the directors and relevant senior management members.
As stated in note 5 to the ﬁnancial statements, audit fees of £397,000 were payable to Deloitte together with non-audit fees of £28,000 relating
to taxation advice and interim review procedures. The Audit Committee considers that this balance is appropriate and does not constitute a threat
to the auditors’ independence.

Section 3: Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations). The Regulations require the auditors to report on the “auditable part” of the
remuneration report. The audited information has therefore been separately highlighted.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the model published by the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which are available on the Group’s website and include the following:
 determination of the policy for remuneration of the executive directors and designated senior managers;
 determination of individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and designated senior managers;
 consideration of executive directors’ service agreements, pensions and related matters;
 making recommendations to the Board on the design of share incentive plans; and
 exercise of all powers and discretions of the directors in connection with the Company’s savings-related and executive share option schemes.
MEMBERSHIP
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Robin Southwell (Chairman), Norman Broadhurst, Gary Bullard, John Hughes
(appointed 3 February 2009), Paul Lester and Eric Tracey. On Robin Southwell’s retirement as a director on 29 July 2008, Gary Bullard took over the
chairmanship of the Committee.
ADVISERS
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief
Executive and the Group Personnel Director, neither of whom took part in the determination of their own remuneration. Advice was also received
from the Company Secretary in relation to the operation of the Company’s share-based incentive plans. Advice was obtained from Hewitt New
Bridge Street (HNBS), who were appointed by the Remuneration Committee to advise on executive remuneration, and long-term incentive
arrangements, including employee share schemes. HNBS has no other connection with the Company.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed its performance through the process outlined on the corporate governance report
on page 37. The Remuneration Committee considered that it had the skills and experience to perform its responsibilities.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
POLICY ON REMUNERATION
The fees of non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board and were reviewed during the year. The policy is to set fees
at the median level relative to companies with a comparable market capitalisation. Fees do not contain any performance-related element and the
non-executive directors do not participate in the Chloride Pension Scheme or in the share option or performance share schemes. Additional fees
are paid for chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, reﬂecting the additional workload and responsibility of these appointments.
Non-executive directors have no entitlement to compensation for early termination of their term of appointment, and take no part in the
determination of their own remuneration.
Details of the fees paid during the year are included in the table headed “Summary of Remuneration” on page 46.
The annual fee level for 2009/2010 is unchanged from 2008/2009, as follows:
Fee
Office £000
Chairman 115.0
Non-executive director 36.5
Remuneration Committee chairmanship additional fee 5.0
Audit Committee chairmanship additional fee 6.0 42 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 3: Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
TERM OF APPOINTMENT
The non-executive directors are appointed for speciﬁed terms of approximately three years. Their letters of appointment have no contractual notice
period, and the appointment of each non-executive director is subject to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs every
two years. The dates on which the current respective letters of appointment came into effect are as follows: Norman Broadhurst – 3 April 2007;
Gary Bullard and Eric Tracey – 2 December 2008; Paul Lester – 1 September 2007; and John Hughes – 1 January 2009. Robin Southwell’s term of
appointment expired on 20 January 2008, and was extended to 29 July 2008, the date of the Annual General Meeting.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
POLICY ON REMUNERATION
The policy is to provide a combination of salary, short and long-term incentives and beneﬁts, which form a competitive and fair total remuneration
package. Performance-related remuneration in the form of annual bonus, together with share options and performance shares, comprises a
signiﬁcant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity but is only receivable if stretching performance targets, which require substantial
improvement in ﬁnancial performance and, in the case of performance shares, superior total shareholder return, are achieved.
COMPONENTS OF THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE
BASE SALARY
The base salary of each executive director is reviewed annually, taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together
with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs in comparable industry sectors. In particular, base salaries recognise salary
levels in a group of comparably-sized companies in the electronics sector and other similar sectors. Details of salaries, bonuses and beneﬁts paid
to executive directors during the year are included in the table headed “Summary of Remuneration” on page 46.
The basic annual salaries of Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner with effect from 1 April 2009 are:
T R Cobbold – £350,000
N W Warner – £250,000
These represent a nil increase for Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner.
ANNUAL BONUS
Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees, including executive directors. Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and the
measures of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of key business issues. For the year under review, the ﬁnancial measure
applicable to the incentive plans for executive directors was actual adjusted earnings per share compared with the previous year, with on-target
performance at 10% growth and maximum bonus payable at 28% growth. In 2008/2009 for the Group Finance Director and other senior executives,
up to 25% of maximum bonus was dependent on achievement of personal objectives, in addition to the ﬁnancial target. The Chief Executive’s
bonus is dependent entirely on adjusted earnings per share performance.
For the executive directors and two senior executives, the maximum award under the 2008/2009 annual incentive plan was 100% of base salary.
Bonus amounts earned up to 55% of base salary are paid in cash. If the bonus earned exceeds 55% of base salary, the bonus earned between
50% and 75% of base salary is deferred into shares which are released after two years, subject to the executive director/senior executive
remaining in the Group’s employment. Bonus payable in excess of 75% of base salary is payable in cash. Bonus shares earned by the executive
directors under the deferred bonus plan and not yet released by the Company are included in the table headed “Interests under Share Plans”
starting on page 47. Bonuses earned by the executive directors and senior executives under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
The amount of bonus payable under this scheme is dependent on achievement of stretching ﬁnancial targets and, in the case of the Group Finance
Director and the senior executives, personal objectives also.
SIGNING ON ARRANGEMENTS
Tim Cobbold joined the Group on 1 June 2007 as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and as an executive director. In addition to participating in the
performance-related long and short-term incentive plans, life insurance and pension scheme and receiving beneﬁts in kind, he is entitled to receive the
following additional payments in each of the ﬁrst two calendar years of his employment, to assist with the transition from his previous employment:
A bonus of £50,000, net of income tax (c. £85,000 gross).
A relocation allowance of £42,000. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 43
The Committee considers these payments, which total c. £127,000 per annum gross, to be reasonable having regard to the need to attract
the best candidate for this demanding role. The payments made during the year to 31 March 2009 are included in the table headed “Summary
of Remuneration” on page 46.
Mr Cobbold is also entitled to reimbursement of certain costs if he decides to purchase a property closer to the Group head ofﬁce in London.
BENEFITS IN KIND
The taxable beneﬁts provided to executive directors during the year under review were use of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance
and medical cover.
PENSIONS
During the year, the executive directors were members of the ﬁnal salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme (the 1996 Scheme).
This Scheme is a funded, contributory, HMRC-approved, occupational pension scheme, which is contracted into the State Earnings-Related
Pension Scheme. It provides a pension of up to two-thirds of ﬁnal pensionable earnings (up to normal retirement age under the Scheme),
depending on service. The 1996 Scheme also provides for dependants’ pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed “Pension Entitlements” on page 46 shows the retirement beneﬁts, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the
deﬁned beneﬁt section of the 1996 Scheme to the executive directors during the year, together with the total accrued annual pension to which
each of them would be entitled under deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements on leaving service.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the 1996 Scheme adopted a cap on pensionable salary in place of the statutory earnings cap, which is cost neutral
to the Group. The pension beneﬁts of the executive directors are subject to this cap and they each received salary supplements in relation to salary
in excess of the cap. The amount of these payments is shown in the table on page 46 headed “Summary of Remuneration”.
EXECUTIVE SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES
POLICY
The Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain holdings of shares in the Company and believes that the potential for increased
share ownership which is provided by share-based incentive schemes is an important element in promoting closer alignment of the interests
of shareholders and executive directors. The policy is to make annual grants of share options and/or performance shares, with a combined annual
aggregate limit on the value of shares under award of two times basic salary. The effect of this overall limit is that an individual cannot receive more
value under a combination of Performance Share Plan awards and Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) grants than he could have under only
one plan. In calculating the value of awards, a performance share is deemed equal to two ESOS awards. For example, an individual could receive
a maximum ESOS option grant of 200% of salary or a performance share grant of 100% of salary. Alternatively, he could receive a 100% ESOS
option grant and a 50% performance share grant to receive the maximum level of award per annum.
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The current share option scheme is the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted under this scheme are normally
exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, on condition that the Company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS)
growth over a period of at least three consecutive ﬁnancial years from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by:
 3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% of base salary;
 4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% but not more than 150% of base salary; and
 7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% of base salary.
In the case of options granted after 31 March 2004, options will lapse if the performance condition is not achieved by the third anniversary of grant.
Adjusted EPS as disclosed in the report and accounts was chosen as the basis for the performance condition because achievement of the growth
in EPS necessary before options may be exercised would require a substantial improvement in the Group’s underlying ﬁnancial performance.
No options were granted to the executive directors under this scheme during the year. 44 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 3: Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
The Group also operates a Performance Share Plan (PSP). The maximum annual value of shares which can be granted under the PSP is 100%
of salary.
Awards granted under the PSP are normally exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of the award, to the extent that a total shareholder
return (TSR) performance target is met over a ﬁxed performance period of three ﬁnancial years. The TSR target for the years to 31 March 2009
compares the Company’s TSR with that of constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding Investment Trusts). As the Company is now
a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts), the Committee has decided that the Company’s TSR should be measured
against that index for awards granted from June 2008 onwards.
Awards vest as follows:
Chloride’s ranking % of awards which vest
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Between median and upper quartile Straight line between 30% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
In addition, no awards will vest under the PSP unless the Company’s EPS growth is at least equal to the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus
2% p.a. over the performance period.
PREVIOUS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Prior to the Chloride Group 2001 ESOS and the PSP, the Company operated the Chloride Group 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 1996 Share
Option Scheme, under which HMRC-approved options and, in the case of the 1996 Scheme, unapproved options were granted to executive
directors as well as senior executives and are still exercisable. No further options can be granted under the 1994 or 1996 schemes. Options granted
under the 1994 and 1996 Schemes are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to meeting the
performance measures stated in the notes to the table headed “Interests under Share Plans” on page 47.
SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Group operates a savings-related share option scheme – the 2007 Scheme, which expires in July 2017. Under the Scheme, options – which
are available to eligible UK employees who contract to save a speciﬁed monthly amount – are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or,
depending on an individual’s initial election, ﬁve years from the contract start date.
The 1997 savings-related share option scheme expired in July 2007, and no further options can be granted under it.
The outstanding interests of the executive directors under all executive share option schemes, the savings-related share schemes and the PSP
are set out in the table starting on page 47 headed “Interests under Share Plans”.
CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of employment, terminable on 12 months’ notice if terminated by the Company and
six months’ notice if terminated by the director.
The executive directors’ current contracts of employment became effective on the following dates:
Tim Cobbold – 29 July 2008
Neil Warner – 23 April 1997
In the event of termination by the Company, each of the executive directors would be entitled to 12 months’ salary, pension beneﬁts, salary
supplement and beneﬁts in kind. In an appropriate case the Company would have regard to the departing director’s duty to mitigate loss.
However, the contracts of employment of the directors contain special terms relating to dismissal following a change of control of the Company,
under which they would each be entitled to receive a prescribed payment made up of 12 months’ salary and beneﬁts including a bonus payment
of 20% of basic salary. Four senior executives also have contracts of employment containing this formula for a prescribed compensation
payment on dismissal following a change of control.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive directors during the year. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 45
POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The current policy is that executive directors should not take on more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval
of the Board. Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be retained by the individual. During the year, fees received and retained
were as follows:
Fee
£000 Company
Keith Hodgkinson 15.7 De La Rue plc
Neil Warner 36.3 Dechra Pharmaceuticals plc
Mr Hodgkinson’s fees relate to the period 1 April 2008 to 29 July 2008, this being the date he retired as a director of Chloride Group PLC.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN

Notes
1 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement under the terms of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme based on service to 31 March 2009.
2 The transfer values (and their increases) in columns 6, 8, 9 and 10 have been calculated in accordance with legislation.
3 The difference between the transfer value increase shown in column 6 and column 10 arises from a change in the date of calculation of transfer values and the change in the transfer value
basis adopted by the trustees over the year.
4 The normal retirement age for directors is 65. The transfer values assume that Mr Warner can receive his benefits accrued before 1 April 2006 at age 60 and his benefits accrued after
31 March 2006 at age 65 and that Mr Cobbold receives his benefits at age 65.
5 Mr Hodgkinson retired as an employee on 30 November 2008. The accrued pension and transfer value amounts shown above are calculated as at this date based on the pre-commutation
retirement benefits payable from this date.
The transfer values shown in the above table are a liability of the 1996 Scheme. The above table combines the disclosures required by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations 2002. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 47

Section 3: Governance
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
UK company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. The directors are required by the IAS Regulation to
prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and have also
elected to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial statements
are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each ﬁnancial year the Company’s ﬁnancial position,
ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in
accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 prepare and present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRS is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the impact
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Group website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We conﬁrm to the best of our knowledge:
1 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, give a true
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole; and
2 the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description
of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CHLORIDE GROUP PLC
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Chloride Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash ﬂow
statement and the related notes 1 to 34. These Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Chloride Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group ﬁnancial statements have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements. The information given
in the directors’ report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the risk management
report and the corporate social responsibility report that is cross referred from the business review section of the directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited Group ﬁnancial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Group ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the annual report.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
 the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s
affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
 the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
 the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March
1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
Chloride Group PLC is a UK-listed electronics company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as “the Company”.
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as adopted by the European Union.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements under IFRS requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions
are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of
assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. These estimates and
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions are reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements in the
period in which they are made.
GOING CONCERN
The ﬁnancial position of the Company, its cash ﬂows, borrowing facilities and liquidity are set out on page 21 of the ﬁnancial review and in
note 20 on page 73. The directors have considered the Company’s internal forecasts and projections that take into account reasonably possible
changes in trading performance. Based on these and the Company’s ﬁnancing position at 31 March 2009 and the subsequent renewal of facilities
(see note 20), the directors consider that the Company has adequate facilities to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND AREAS OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In applying the Company’s accounting policies as set out in note 2, management has made accounting judgments in the determination of the
carrying value of deferred tax assets, intangible assets, the quantiﬁcation of provisions including retirement beneﬁt obligations and the impairment
of goodwill. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes will differ from those assumptions
and estimates. An analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty is provided below.
DEFERRED TAX ASSETS
The carrying value of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts being generated in certain territories in future periods.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
To determine the net present value of certain customer relationships and trade names, management has estimated the additional future cash ﬂows
arising from these intangibles. In the case of customer relationships, management has applied an estimated attrition factor to its forecast sales for
the relevant unit and in the case of trade names has applied a notional royalty rate.
PROVISIONS
The quantiﬁcation of certain liabilities within provisions (for environmental remediation obligations and for legal costs in relation to certain claims)
has been estimated. Such liabilities depend on the actions of third parties and on the speciﬁc circumstances pertaining to each obligation, neither
of which is controlled by the Company.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS
To determine whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been
allocated. The value-in-use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit
and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
In assessing the Company’s obligations relating to retirement beneﬁts, management made key assumptions relating to current and future mortality,
expected returns on plan assets and discount rates. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 55
1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING CONTINUED
PRESENTATION UNDER IFRS
The statements are presented in pounds sterling and have been prepared under IFRS as adopted by the European Union using the historical
cost convention.
The Company therefore complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations, adjusted by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities to fair value.
The nature of these adjustments is set out in the policies below.
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following Standards/revisions to Standards and Interpretations which have not been
applied in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
− IFRS 3, Business Combinations (revised 2008), incorporates the following changes that are likely to be relevant to the Company’s operations:
 contingent consideration will be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes recognised in proﬁt or loss;
 transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred;
 pre-existing interests in the acquiree will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in proﬁt or loss; and
 any non-controlling (minority) interest will be measured at either fair value, or at its proportionate interest in the identiﬁable assets and
liabilities of the acquiree, on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
IFRS 3 will become mandatory for the Company’s 2011 accounts and will be applied prospectively from 1 April 2010. The signiﬁcance or
otherwise of the impact of these changes to the Company, will depend on the circumstances of any future acquisition.
− IFRS 8, Operating Segments requires the identiﬁcation and disclosure of segments based on the internal reporting to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker. IFRS 8 will not have a signiﬁcant impact on disclosures made by the Company and will be adopted by the Company for
its 2010 report and accounts.
− IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosure (2008 amendments) requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements and liquidity risks.
− IFRS 2, Share-based Payments (revised 2008), clariﬁes the deﬁnition of vesting conditions and will become mandatory for the Company in its
report and accounts for 2010. It is not expected to have signiﬁcant impact on the Company’s results.
− IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007/2008), revises the presentation of non-owner changes and introduces a statement
of comprehensive income. These changes will be introduced in our report and accounts for 2010 and are not likely to give rise to signiﬁcant
changes in presentation.
− IAS 23, Borrowing Costs (revised 2008), requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a signiﬁcant period of time
to prepare for use. The revised requirement will be adopted by the Company in its report and accounts for 2010. No impact on the net results
of the Company is anticipated.
− IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (revised 2008), requires changes in the level of ownership of a subsidiary,
while maintaining control to be recognised in equity. The amendment is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
No signiﬁcant impact to the Company’s net results or net assets is likely to occur.
− IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation (revised 2008) – Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations arising on Liquidation.
This is applicable to periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. No impact will arise on the Company’s net result from its adoption.
− IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (revised 2008) – recognition and measurement of eligible hedged items.
This is applicable to periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. No impact is likely to arise on the Company’s net result from its adoption. 56 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 4: Financial statements and notes
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March
1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING CONTINUED
The following IFRIC interpretations have been issued but have not yet been adopted by the Company:
− IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes.
– IFRIC 15, Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate.
– IFRIC 16, Hedge of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation.
– IFRIC 17, Distribution of Non-Cash Assets to Owners.
– IFRIC 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers.
No signiﬁcant impact on the Company’s results is likely to arise from the adoption of these interpretations.
These are the Company’s fourth ﬁnancial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Company’s transition date for adoption of IFRS
was 1 April 2005.
IFRS 1 (First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards) allows companies adopting IFRS for the ﬁrst time to take certain
exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS. Accordingly, the Company took advantage of the following key exemptions on transition to IFRS:
A) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:
The Company chose not to restate to IFRS business combinations and the resultant acquisition goodwill for acquisitions made prior to the
transition date.
B) CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES:
IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates) requires that the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised directly
in equity for foreign operations are transferred to the income statement as part of the proﬁt or loss on any subsequent disposal. As permitted
by IFRS 1 the Company reset these cumulative foreign exchange translation differences to zero at the transition date.
C) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS:
The Company applied IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments) only to awards made after 7 November 2002 and which have not vested by 1 January 2005.
D) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
The Company took the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation), and IAS 39
(Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement).
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made
up to 31 March each year. Subsidiaries are those companies in which the Company has control, directly or indirectly, over the operations so as
to obtain beneﬁts from those companies’ activities. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses
on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 57
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Company in exchange for
control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current
assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations), which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination
over the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment,
the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities recognised.
INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES
An associate or joint venture is an entity over which the Company, either directly or indirectly, is in a position to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence
by participating in, but not controlling, the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the entity.
Both entities are accounted for using the equity method. Losses of an associate or joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest in the entity are
not recognised, except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations on behalf of the entity. Proﬁts and losses recognised by the Company
or its subsidiaries on transactions with an associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate or joint
venture concerned.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
1) REVENUE
Revenue represents the amounts, excluding VAT and similar sales-related taxes, receivable by the Company for goods and services supplied to
outside customers in the ordinary course of business. Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists,
products have been delivered or services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised under the percentage to completion method of accounting and is calculated based on the ratio
of costs incurred to date compared with the total expected costs for that contract.
Revenue from long-term service provision contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet
date. This is normally determined by the proportion of the contract that has elapsed at the balance sheet date. Revenue from services provided on
a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete.
2) INTEREST INCOME
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues by reference to the effective yield on the asset.
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating proﬁt is stated after restructuring costs but before investment income and ﬁnance cost. 58 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 4: Financial statements and notes
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
INCOME TAX
Income tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and is calculated using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax
bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt. Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than
a business combination, that affects neither the taxable nor accounting proﬁt is not recognised.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of the distribution of overseas retained earnings by subsidiaries to the extent that the subsidiary, at the balance
sheet date, has entered into a binding agreement to do so.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable proﬁts available to offset it and is reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realised.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse
based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
1) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
2) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income
statements of foreign entities are translated to sterling at the average exchange rates for the year, approximating the foreign exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from the translation of shareholders’ equity to sterling at year-end
exchange rates are taken to the translation reserve. These differences are recognised as income or expense on disposal of the related subsidiary.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage operational exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate price risks. These
derivatives entered into by the Company consist mainly of currency forwards and interest rate swaps. The Company’s policy prohibits the use
of derivatives for speculation and therefore does not hold or issue ﬁnancial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are
recognised as assets and liabilities and measured at their fair values at the date at which such contracts are entered into. Subsequently derivative
ﬁnancial instruments are re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in proﬁt immediately unless
the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument in which case the timing of recognition in the proﬁt and loss depends on the
nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedge accounting is applied to derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or in cash ﬂows of the
hedged items. Under hedge accounting of ﬁnancial assets or liabilities changes in fair value of the ﬁnancial derivative are recognised in the income
statement where they are matched with changes in the fair value of the hedged item which are also recognised in the income statement. Cash ﬂow
hedges are entered into where a derivative ﬁnancial instrument is used to hedge the currency risks of anticipated future export sales, cash ﬂow
risks of anticipated future purchases and the cash ﬂow risk from changes in interest rates. The effective part of the changes in fair value of cash
ﬂow hedges are recognised in equity, while any ineffective part is recognised immediately in the income statement. When the ﬁrm commitment
or forecasted transaction results in recognition of an asset or liability, the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial
measurement of that asset or liability. Otherwise the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement
at the same time as the hedged transaction. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 59
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative unrealised
gain or loss (at that point) remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged
transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative ﬁnancial instruments
where their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with
changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
At the inception of a hedged relationship the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction
together with its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also documents at inception and
on an ongoing basis as to whether the derivatives used are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash ﬂows of the hedged item.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
1) POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Most Company undertakings have pension or retirement beneﬁt arrangements. These vary but are appropriate to the legal requirements and local
practices of the countries concerned.
Contributions to deﬁned contribution plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. For deﬁned beneﬁt plans, pension charges are determined
separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the balance sheet date. The amounts
charged to the income statement consist of current service costs, interest costs, the expected returns on plan assets and past service costs.
Past service costs are recognised immediately where they have already vested and over the average period until they vest where they have not.
Amounts recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense represent actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between
actuarial assumptions used in previous valuations and the actual outcome and changes in actuarial assumptions.
Pension obligations recognised in the balance sheet represent the present value of deﬁned beneﬁt obligations adjusted for any past service costs
not yet recognised and the fair value of any plan assets.
2) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company operates share option programmes to allow employees to acquire shares in the Company at a price ﬁxed at the time of the award.
The Company also operates share award programmes which grant shares to certain employees. These programmes are subject to both market
related and non-market related vesting conditions. For grants made after 7 November 2002 and remaining unvested at 1 January 2005 these
awards are measured at their fair value at the date of grant. This fair value is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reﬂect expected and actual forfeiture during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service
conditions or non-market performance conditions. This fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of the net identiﬁable assets of the acquired
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. This goodwill is carried in the balance sheet and is reviewed annually for impairment. Any impairment is
recognised in the income statement and will not be subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is expressed in the currency of the subsidiary to which it relates and is translated to sterling using the year-end exchange rate. Goodwill
arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the UK GAAP amounts. Goodwill written off to reserves under
UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent proﬁt and loss on disposal. 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 4: Financial statements and notes
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
1) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientiﬁc or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised
in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred except where it relates to the
development of a new or signiﬁcantly improved product or process that is technically and commercially feasible, where the Company has sufﬁcient
resources to complete the development and where the related costs can be reliably measured.
Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development
expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
2) COMPUTER SOFTWARE
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is recognised separately as an asset and is stated at cost less
subsequent amortisation.
3) OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets, acquired by the Company, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
AMORTISATION
Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The rates generally used are:
Computer software Three to seven years
Other Two to ten years
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
With the exception of certain freehold properties, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
recognised impairment losses. Assets under construction are not depreciated. Certain of the Company’s freehold properties were revalued
in 1993. These properties are held at this valuation/deemed cost plus any subsequent capital expenditure and less cumulative depreciation.
Depreciation is charged on the straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets. The rates generally in use are as follows:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings 2% to 5%
Leasehold buildings 2% to 5% (or over remaining life of lease if shorter)
Plant, machinery and other equipment 5% to 33%
Depreciation is calculated on the cost together with subsequent additions at cost. Under UK GAAP, certain assets were revalued in 1993
and have been deemed at cost on transition to IFRS.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets.
Gains/losses on disposal of an asset represent the difference between sales proceeds and the net carrying amount. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 61
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
IMPAIRMENT
Acquired goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The carrying amounts of the Company’s other assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment
loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are
recognised in the income statement unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment is recognised as a
revaluation decrease.
1) CALCULATION OF THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT
The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
speciﬁc to the asset. For an asset that does not generate independent cash inﬂows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating
unit to which the asset belongs.
2) REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT
With the exception of acquisition goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is generally determined on a ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out basis and in the case of
products manufactured by the Group, consists of direct material and labour costs together with related factory overheads. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
INVESTMENTS
Investments other than those in associated companies and joint ventures are initially recognised at their fair value at the date of the transaction and
are subsequently measured at each reporting date at their fair value. The Company’s investments comprise equity stakes in partnership enterprises.
These investments are classiﬁed as held for resale and the resultant gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of assets held for sale are
directly recognised in equity until such assets are de-recognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is
included in the net proﬁt or loss for the period. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement if there is objective evidence that the
asset is impaired.
TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are stated at their amortised cost by reference to invoiced amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for
doubtful accounts is recognised when it becomes likely that the originally invoiced amount is not fully realisable.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity
on acquisition of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right
of offset with cash balances.
TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are stated at fair value.
BORROWING
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at cost, less attributable transaction costs. Borrowing costs including premiums
payable on settlement are recognised in the income statement under the effective interest rate method.
EQUITY
Equity is recorded in the balance sheet at the proceeds received less transaction costs. 62 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 4: Financial statements and notes
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
LEASING
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance
leases. Assets held under ﬁnance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, and are measured at the lower of fair value and
the estimated present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. Interest is charged to the income statement
as a ﬁnance charge over the lease period. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the life of the lease.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of the
amount of this obligation can be made.
1) WARRANTY
Provision for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale to reﬂect the likely costs of meeting such obligations.
2) RESTRUCTURING
Provision for restructuring is recognised when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either
commenced or has been announced publicly.
3) ONEROUS CONTRACTS
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected beneﬁts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Assets are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. Such assets
must be available for immediate sale in their present condition, management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset
which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months.
An extension of the period required to complete the sale does not preclude the asset from being classiﬁed as held for sale, provided the delay was
for reasons beyond the Company’s control and management remains committed to its plan to sell the asset. Assets that are classiﬁed as held for
sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of, or satisﬁes the criteria to be classiﬁed as held for sale,
and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to disposal.

At 31 March 71,546 57,789
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. Value in use calculations are used to calculate recoverable amount. Value in use
is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax free cash ﬂows of the cash generating unit in which the goodwill
is contained, applying a discount rate of the Company post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 9.0%. This approximates to applying a pre-tax
discount of 13.1% to pre-tax cash ﬂows. These cash ﬂow projections are made over a 20-year period and are consistent with approved budgets,
and market growth rates projected by Frost & Sullivan over the ﬁrst ﬁve years and a growth rate in line with an inﬂation assumption of 2% per
annum thereafter.
In testing the goodwill for impairment the directors have considered the following downside sensitivities:
 a 1% increase in the pre-tax discount rate;
 a reduction in the long-term growth rate assumption of 1%; and
 a 1% point reduction in the forecast operating margin of the business.
With the exception of our low power North American business, Oneac, the individual cash generating units showed signiﬁcant headroom.
The assessment for Oneac showed base case headroom of £1.5 million. Current economic conditions create uncertainty and make forecasting
difﬁcult. Projections reﬂecting the sensitivities of a 1% increase in the discount rate, a reduction of 1% in the long-term growth rate and a reduction
of 1 point in the operating margin of Oneac, showed respective impairments of £0.3 million, £0.9 million and £0.7 million. No provisions for
impairment have been recognised this year on the grounds of the positive base case headroom. The Company will continue to monitor the
performance of Oneac over the next 12 months. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 69

The directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The average consolidated term for trade debtors was 76 days (2008: 77 days). Included in the Company’s trade debtors are debtors with a carrying
value of £15,350,000 (2008: £14,094,000) which were past their due date at the reporting date, for which the Company has not provided. As there
has been no overall change in the underlying credit risk associated with these debts, the Company believes that these are recoverable. The average
term by which these debtors exceed their due date is 15 days (2008: 15 days).
Trade receivables are not normally interest bearing, although the Company may exercise the right to charge interest on overdue accounts.
Allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiﬁed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the
recoverability of the cash ﬂows. Movement in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:
2009 2008

CREDIT RISK
The Company’s principal ﬁnancial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiﬁed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence
of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ﬂows.
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁnancial instruments is limited
because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Company has no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Company trades mainly with other companies with strong credit ratings and there is a good history of collection and cash generation
with a limited history of impairment. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 73

Included in the above is a loan of £0.5 million (2008: £0.7 million) at a ﬁxed rate of interest of 2.3% per annum for two years. All other borrowings
are at ﬂoating rates. A 1% change in the effective borrowing rate would change interest payable by £0.5 million.

20 BORROWINGS CONTINUED
At 31 March 2009 the Company had £110.0 million of committed facilities (2008: £90.0 million), of which £58.0 million (2008: £46.0 million)
was unutilised. Of this amount, £50.0 million expires within one year (2008: £30.0 million), £10.0 million expires within one to two years
(2008: £50.0 million) and £50.0 million (2008: £10.0 million) expires after two years.
In addition to this the Company has £7.0 million of overdraft facilities (2008: £2.0 million) of which £1.0 million were drawn (2008: £0.5 million).
On 22 May the Company signed a further £30.0 million three year committed facility with HSBC. This facility replaces a £25.0 million facility
which is included in the £50.0 million of facilities expiring within one year shown above.
The directors have considered the Company’s internal forecasts and projections that take into account reasonably possible changes in trading
performance on covenant compliance. Chloride has signiﬁcant headroom in terms of both available facilities and in terms of its operation within
existing covenants.
Based on the above, and after making enquiries, directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has adequate facilities
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

CURRENCY RISK
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the fair value of the Company’s ﬁnancial instruments,
to the income statement and to equity of a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at
31 March 2009, with all other variables remaining constant. A 10% variation in the valuation of sterling at the balance sheet date would have an
impact of £8,000 (2008: £424,000). All of this would be taken to the income statement.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that speciﬁed changes occur. Actual
results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global ﬁnancial markets which may cause ﬂuctuations
in exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered a projection
of likely future events and losses. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 77

The Company’s core borrowings comprise three-year committed facilities with a number of banks. Typically the Company draws under these
facilities for periods between one week and three months and the interest rates applicable, LIBOR (or equivalent), are determined at the outset
of each drawing. The above table is drawn up on the assumption that the Company will continue to draw on these loans until the expiry of the
facility and that interest rates have been set at the rate applicable at 31 March. Note 20 shows further details on availability of credit facilities.
The Company holds ﬁnancial assets which mature within one year of £139,565,000 (2008: £107,225,000) and £1,681,000 (2008: £699,000),

28 ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES
A) DB POWER ELECTRONICS (PVT) LTD (DB POWER)
On 3 July 2008 the Company acquired a further 17% of the share capital of DB Power, a manufacturer and supplier of critical power protection
services in India for a cash consideration of £4.8 million. This brings the Company’s total investment in DB Power to 49%. Under an agreement
with the shareholders of DB Power, the Company intends to exercise its right to purchase a further 41% during the period to July 2009.
Based on the Company’s right to acquire the additional 41% of DB Power’s share capital and resulting from its rights to govern the ﬁnancial
and operating policies of DB Power and its exposure to its risks and rewards in the intervening period, the Company has a controlling interest
in DB Power. As a consequence from July, the Company ceased to account for DB Power as an interest in associate and now consolidates
its ﬁnancial statements.
The purchase has given rise to acquisition goodwill of £2.0 million and other intangibles (intellectual property, customer lists and trade name)
of £11.9 million.

32 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Company has a number of pension or retirement beneﬁt arrangements, which are established to meet local legal requirements and practices
in the countries in which it operates. These arrangements comprise both deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. At 31 March 2009,
the Company had a net deﬁcit of £12.6 million (2008: £7.0 million) in respect of its obligations under these arrangements.
Total retirement beneﬁt costs of £2.8 million were charged in the period (2008: £2.1 million), of which £1.9 million related to deﬁned contribution
schemes (2008: £1.6 million).
The principal deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are operated in the UK and Germany, and in Italy the Company participates in the statutory Trattamento
a Fine Rapporto (TFR) scheme. The bases of these schemes are as follows:
UK
In the UK the Company operates a hybrid pension scheme with both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution sections (the Chloride 1996 Scheme).
At 31 March 2006 the deﬁned contribution section of the scheme was separately identiﬁed within the scheme, with a separate investment pool. The
disclosures below for 2009 therefore represent only the deﬁned beneﬁts element. The deﬁned beneﬁt section of the Chloride 1996 Scheme has been
closed to new members since 1 April 1998. Funding is set after formal funding valuations carried out every three years by independent actuaries.
GERMANY
In Germany the Company operates a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme which, in accordance with local practice, is unfunded. Provision for future liabilities
is made in the balance sheet in accordance with advice given by an independent actuary.
ITALY
In Italy the Company participates in the statutory TFR scheme which, in accordance with local practice, was unfunded. With effect from 1 January
2007 the administration of the scheme was changed so that entitlements for future service are funded and cease to be classiﬁed as deﬁned
beneﬁts. Provision for past service, for which the employee has not elected to take payment, continues to be accounted for as a deﬁned beneﬁt
obligation. These changes resulted in a curtailment credit in the prior year of £329,000 which has been taken to the income statement.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CHLORIDE GROUP PLC
We have audited the company ﬁnancial statements of Chloride Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise, the balance sheet,
the cash ﬂow statement and the related notes 1 to 16. These parent company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements of Chloride Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009 and on the information
in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent company
ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the directors’ report
includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the risk management report and the corporate
social responsibility report that is cross referred from the business review section of the directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited parent company ﬁnancial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside
the annual report.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company ﬁnancial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in
the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:

CURRENCY RISK
The Company has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the fair value of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments,
to the income statement and to equity of a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at
31 March 2008, with all other variables remaining constant. A 10% variation in the valuation of sterling at the balance sheet date would have an
impact of £2.8 million (2008: £2.9 million). All of this would be taken to the income statement.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that speciﬁed changes occur. Actual
results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global ﬁnancial markets which may cause ﬂuctuations in
exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses. 102 ANNUAL REPORT 2009

facilities for periods between one week and three months and the interest rates applicable, LIBOR (or equivalent), are determined at the outset
of each drawing. The above table is drawn up on the assumption that the Company will continue to draw on these loans until the expiry of the
facility and that interest rates have been set at the rate applicable at 31 March.

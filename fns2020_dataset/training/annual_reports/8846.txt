“2013 represents another year of good growth for Wood 
Group. In my first full year as CEO, the leadership team 
and I have considered the Group’s strategy which remains 
sound and positions us well for the longer term. We have 
reviewed all parts of the Group from three perspectives: 
risk profile, current and future financial performance and 
strategic fit with the Group overall, and this has resulted 
in a number of actions including the acquisition of Elkhorn 
and the joint venture with Siemens. Looking to 2014, our 
mix of opex and capex activities and the contribution of 
completed acquisitions is expected to lead to growth 
overall.” Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements

Revenue earned from continuing operations is derived from the price and 
volume of services and products we provide to customers. 
Progress in the year: Revenue increased 3% in 2013 reflecting growth in 
Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN, partly offset by a reduction 
in Wood Group GTS.
EBITA is a key profit measure and excludes exceptional items. EBITA margin 
demonstrates our ability to convert revenue into profit. 
Progress in the year: EBITA growth of 16% reflects Growth in Wood Group 
Engineering and Wood Group PSN offset by a reduction in Wood Group GTS.
Earnings before exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax, divided by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. AEPS 
demonstrates the value we create on a per share basis.
Progress in the year: Adjusted diluted EPS for the year increased by 16% 
due principally to the increase in underlying profitability. 
We aim to deliver the highest standards of health and safety. Total 
recordable case frequency is the total of lost work cases, restricted work 
cases and medical treatment cases, per million man hours.
Progress in the year: Over many years we have reduced the recordable 
injury rates to our people whilst growing our workforce. This continued in 
2013 with a 10% reduction in TRCF.
EBITA divided by average capital employed measures our ability to generate 
profits relative to the capital required to support our business. Days sales 
outstanding indicates our efficiency in collecting customer receipts.
Progress in the year: The Group’s pre-tax return on average capital 
employed increased slightly with an increase in Wood Group PSN being 
offset by reductions in Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group 
GTS. Average days sales outstanding increased to 54 principally due to an 
increase in Wood Group Engineering.
The share of AEPS distributed to shareholders.
Progress in the year: The directors have recommended a final dividend 
of 14.9 cents per share which makes a total distribution for the year of 22.0 
cents, an increase of 29%. Reflecting confidence in future growth, the Board 
currently expects the dividend increase in 2014 to be around 25%.
Cash inflows which we use to maintain and grow our operations.
Progress in the year: Cash generated from operations post-working  
capital increased by over 60% to $536m.  
Attracting and retaining people helps support our continued growth.
Progress in the year: Total headcount increased by 6%. Headcount 
increased in Wood Group PSN by 7% largely due to acquisitions. Headcount 
also increased by 5% in Wood Group Engineering.

Chairman’s statement
“2013 has been a year of good 
growth and important strategic 
development for the Group.  
Having supported Bob through the 
planned period of transition, I will 
retire from the Board at the AGM on  
14 May 2014. I am delighted that 
Ian Marchant will take over as 
Chairman of Wood Group. His 
appointment represents a natural 
evolution in the Group’s stewardship 
and provides important continuity.” 
Introduction 
2013 has been a year of good growth and 
important strategic development for the Group 
under Bob Keiller’s leadership in his first full 
year as CEO, having taken over in November 
2012. My appointment as Chairman at that time 
reflected the need for continuity amongst the 
senior team. Since his appointment in 2012, Bob 
has shown excellent leadership as he further 
develops the Group’s strategy and direction.
Having supported Bob through the planned 
period of transition I will retire from the Board at 
the AGM in May. I am delighted that Ian Marchant 
will take over as Chairman of Wood Group. 
Ian knows the Group well, having served as a 
non-executive director on the Board since 2006, 
latterly as senior independent director. Ian was 
Chief Executive of SSE plc for over 10 years, 
is non-executive chairman of Infinis Energy plc 
and a non-executive director of Aggreko plc. His 
appointment represents a natural evolution in 
the Group’s stewardship and provides important  
continuity. I am confident that Ian will be an 
excellent leader of the Board and ensure its 
continued effectiveness.
Markets
Energy markets generally remained favourable 
during 2013 with analysts typically estimating an 
increase in E&P spend of around 10%. For 2014, 
analysts estimate some reduction in that growth 
rate, reflecting a greater focus on capital budgets 
by our customers. The Group continues to have a 
good balance of opex and capex activities which 
should help underpin growth in the medium term.
Financial performance and dividends 
In 2013, Total Revenue was up 3% and Total 
EBITA was up 16% to $533.0m, with EBITA 
margin increasing from 6.7% to 7.5%. Adjusted 
diluted EPS increased from 85.2 cents to 98.6 
cents. We are declaring a final dividend of 14.9 
cents which will bring the full year dividend to 
22.0 cents, an increase of 29% on 2012. 
Board changes
In September, we announced that Mike 
Straughen, Group Director for Wood Group 
Engineering intends to retire from the Board 
during 2014. Mike has stepped away from 
his Wood Group Engineering role and now 
oversees the Group’s Health, Safety, Security 
and Environment (HSSE) activities and sits on the 
Safety & Assurance committee. The committee is 
chaired by Tom Botts, formerly of Shell, who was 
appointed as non-executive director in January 
2013.
In October we entered an agreement to form a 
joint venture between elements of Wood Group 
GTS and Siemens’ TurboCare business, at which 
point Mark Dobler, Group Director for Wood 
Group GTS stepped down from the Board. Mark 
will transfer to the new joint venture on formation 
as its CEO.
Neil H Smith retired from the Board in December. 
Neil was a non-executive director from 2004 and 
served on the Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees during his time on the Board. His 
knowledge of the power generation industry 
greatly assisted Board discussions on the 
strategic development of our gas turbine 
activities.
I have enjoyed leading Wood Group during an 
exciting period of organic growth and strategic 
development including, most recently, the 
acquisition of PSN and the sale of the Group’s 
Well Support business. I am leaving the Group 
well positioned for growth in good long-term 
markets and in the hands of a strong Board and 
management team. I will continue to follow the 
Group’s ongoing development with keen interest. 
Finally, I would like to thank our management and 
employees for their enormous and continuing 
contribution in making Wood Group a great 
company.

been included in discontinued operations in the Group Financial Statements for 2013. 
Safety & Assurance 
The safety of our people, and those affected by 
what we do, is our top priority. Tragically we had 
a fatality during the year in our Pyeroy business 
in Wood Group PSN. We have assessed, and 
are acting on, the lessons learned. In 2013, we 
saw some improvement in our total recordable 
case frequency (TRCF) and our lost work case 
frequency (LWCF) remained relatively flat. During 
2013 we established a Board-level Safety & 
Assurance committee to provide enhanced 
visibility and awareness of our performance, and 
we extended our Safety Leadership Programme 
to a wider audience.  
Financial performance
2013 represents another year of good growth 
for the Group with Total EBITA up 16%. In Wood 
Group Engineering, revenue increased by 11% 
and EBITA increased by 12% reflecting growth 
in all three segments: Upstream, Subsea & 
pipeline and Downstream. In Wood Group PSN, 
strong EBITA growth of 28% included a full 
year contribution from the Duval and Mitchells 
acquisitions in the US completed during 2012, 
although performance overall was impacted 
by continuing losses in Oman where we are 
now agreeing a transition plan to exit. In Wood 
Group GTS, revenue fell 19% and EBITA fell 
9%, with Maintenance up slightly on 2012 and 
a lower contribution from Power Solutions. Net 
debt at the end of December was $310m and 
average net debt during the year was $258m. 
Net debt excludes a receipt in January in 
respect of a recovery in relation to a previously 
terminated contract in Venezuela which after 
costs, payments to non-controlling interests and 
taxation is expected to be around $40m. 
Group review 
Since my appointment as CEO I have focused 
on a number of key issues. I have delivered a 
consistent message to our people that our Core 
Values are vital for our future success and that we 
can be even better if we increase collaboration 
across our business. I have been developing our 
leadership team on the Executive Committee 
and, together, we have considered the Group’s 
strategy which remains sound and positions us 
well for the longer term. We are predominantly 
an upstream oil & gas services business and our 
intention is to broaden and deepen the services 
we can offer in this sector. 
We have also reviewed all parts of the Group from 
three perspectives: risk profile, current and future 
financial performance and strategic fit with the 
Group overall, and this has resulted in a number 
of actions covered below.
I have previously highlighted the need to remain a 
lower risk, predominantly reimbursable business.

contracts that contain lump sum or fixed-price 
elements, to ensure that we keep our overall 
risk profile within acceptable levels. Typically, 
these contracts together represent less than 
10% of revenues. Specifically in the Power 
Solutions business of Wood Group GTS, where 
we have executed large lump sum projects, the 
risk profile was too high. The Dorad contract is 
the last remaining contract of this scale and is 
approaching completion. It is anticipated that the 
contract will be profitable overall, but will generate 
a loss in 2013 and we will not pursue further 
opportunities of this size.
We looked at financial performance across the 
Group and recognised that in Wood Group 
GTS, certain Maintenance activities with less 
differentiation were not delivering an acceptable 
level of return. We concluded that a sale of 
the underperforming parts was not in the best 
interest of shareholders, and recognised that our 
activities in joint ventures typically deliver stronger 
performance over the longer term. In October 
we therefore entered an agreement to form a 
joint venture consisting of the Maintenance and 
Power Solutions businesses of Wood Group GTS 
(excluding the Rolls Wood Group, TransCanada 
Turbines and Sulzer Wood joint ventures), and 
Siemens’ TurboCare business unit which provides 
aftermarket design, repair and manufacturing 
services. The joint venture will be a stronger, 
better differentiated business, providing access 
to certain OEM know-how. The joint venture 
is expected to deliver annual net synergies to 
Wood Group of around $15m by year three. 
In other areas of the Group, we have taken 
steps including merging operations in Canada, 
reorganising our Engineering divisional structure 
and addressing underperforming contracts.
Our consistent message on increasing 
collaboration has resulted in business 
opportunities from people working more closely 
together. Wood Group Mustang and Wood 
Group PSN jointly secured a topsides detailed 
engineering and procurement scope in Canada, 
and we are working more closely together in 
the US, Australia and elsewhere. We recently 
completed a corporate rebranding exercise which 
we believe will improve customer awareness 
and understanding of the Group’s services, and 
better facilitate our collaborative efforts. We are 
increasingly focused on deepening customer 
relationships at a Group level and this is resulting 
in a number of potential opportunities.
In 2013, we invested $276m in acquisitions which 
we believe will improve our financial performance 
and strategic positioning. In December we 
acquired Elkhorn for a consideration of $215m, 
representing around six times pro forma EBITA. 
Elkhorn is a Wyoming based construction 
services provider which enhances our US shale 
exposure and complements our construction, 
maintenance and fabrication activities. We also 
acquired Pyeroy in July to expand the range of 
services we provide into specialist coatings and 
fabric maintenance, and in May we acquired 
Intetech, a niche provider of software and 
engineering consultancy services for well integrity 
and corrosion management. We will continue to 
pursue acquisition opportunities in 2014.
Our consideration of capital structure is informed 
by our assessment of operating cash flows, 
investment opportunities, and the risks in our 
business. We would generally expect a net debt 
to EBITDA range of around 0.5x to 1.5x going 
forward, and to be typically below 1.0x. To the 
extent that the Group has financial capacity 
which is surplus to the anticipated needs for 
acquisitions and organic growth, we would look 
to return this to shareholders through share buy 
backs or special dividends.
The Group continues to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy taking into account its capital 
requirements, cash flows and earnings. Since  
IPO in 2002, we have increased the dividend by 
an equivalent of 20% per annum compound.  
The directors have recommended a final dividend 
of 14.9 cents per share which makes a total 
distribution for the year of 22.0 cents, an increase 
of 29%. Reflecting our confidence in future 
growth, the Board currently expects the dividend 
increase in 2014 to be around 25%, and our 
intent would be to increase the US dollar value  
of dividend per share paid from 2015 onwards  
by a double digit percentage. 
Outlook  
I would like to thank Allister for his valuable 
support during 2013 and for his extraordinary 
dedication and leadership over 23 years with 
Wood Group. During the year, we have taken 
some important strategic steps and achieved 
good growth. In 2014, our mix of opex and capex 
activities and the contribution of completed 
acquisitions is expected to lead to growth overall, 
with growth in Wood Group PSN offsetting a 
reduction in Wood Group Engineering. More 
details of anticipated performance are set out in 
the balance of this report. Looking further ahead, 
we believe our strategy remains sound and 
positions us well for growth over the longer term.

EBITA margin 12.4% 12.3% 0.1pts
People 10,700 10,200  5%
In Wood Group Engineering, revenue increased 
by 11% and EBITA increased by 12%, reflecting 
growth in all three segments: Upstream, 
Subsea & pipeline and Downstream. EBITA 
margin increased slightly from 12.3% to 12.4%. 
Headcount increased by 5% from 10,200 to 
10,700 reflecting additions in Saudi Arabia and 
London, offset by reductions in Canada and 
Houston. 
Our Upstream business accounted for around 
40% of divisional revenue. Our scope on the 
significant Mafumeira Sul and Ichthys projects is 
substantially complete and made a good EBITA 
contribution in 2013. We remain active on a 
number of current offshore projects, including 
Hess Stampede and Anadarko Heidelberg 
in the Gulf of Mexico, Husky White Rose in 
Eastern Canada and Ivar Aasen for SMOE in 
the North Sea, although increased focus on 
capital budgets is evident in the slower pace of 
significant new offshore awards. Performance 
in Western Canada continues to be impacted 
by a weak upstream oil sands market and 
we have taken steps to position our business 
appropriately.
Subsea & pipeline represented around 40% of 
divisional revenue. In subsea, the US market 
remains strong, and in the North Sea we have 
seen good ongoing brownfield activity including 
BP Quad 204 and Andrew, despite the impact 
of some delays such as Chevron Rosebank. 
Australia has been a strong greenfield market 
for our subsea business in recent years and we 
anticipate that a good market for brownfield, 
infill, tie back and integrity management work 
will develop in the longer term. Our onshore 
pipelines business continues to benefit from 
healthy activity in US shale and we see further 
pipeline opportunities in North America more 
generally. 
Downstream, process & industrial saw 
increased activity in the US, Saudi Arabia 
and Latin America and delivered an improved 
performance over 2012, although the market 
remains competitive. 
Outlook
In 2013, Wood Group Engineering delivered 
EBITA growth of 12%, following growth of 
over 30% in 2011 and 2012. Looking ahead 
to 2014, we anticipate growth in Subsea & 
pipeline to be more than offset by a reduction 
in Upstream, where we see good prospects 
although not of the scale of the significant 
offshore projects recently completed. Overall we 
see a good long-term market for our services 
but continue to anticipate a reduction in 
Engineering EBITA of around 15% in 2014.

EBITA margin 6.6% 5.6% 1.0pts
People 31,100 29,200 7%
In Wood Group PSN, strong EBITA growth 
of 28% includes a full year contribution from 
the Duval and Mitchell’s acquisitions in the US 
completed during 2012, although performance 
overall was impacted by continuing losses in 
Oman. EBITA margin increased from 5.6% to 
6.6% in part due to the change in geographical 
mix of our business towards shale, overhead 
reductions and lower losses in Oman. 
Headcount increased by 7% from 29,200, 
principally due to the impact of the acquisitions 
of Pyeroy in July and Elkhorn in December. 
In the Americas, which accounted for around 
30% of revenue, we saw strong growth led 
by our US onshore shale related business. In 
December, we enhanced our US shale market 
exposure with the acquisition of Elkhorn, a 
Wyoming based construction services provider, 
serving the Niobrara, Permian, Marcellus and 
Utica shales. Wood Group PSN now has 
around 4,500 onshore personnel providing 
construction, maintenance and fabrication 
activities across the most significant US shale 
plays.
We saw growth in the North Sea, which 
accounted for around 40% of revenue. The 
market remains strong and we secured nine 
contract renewals in 2013 with customers 
including CNR, ConocoPhillips, Dana, Nexen, 
Talisman Sinopec and Total. In December, we 
also won a support services contract for BG’s 
central North Sea assets. These awards help 
maintain our leading position and provide good 
revenue visibility. The acquisition of Pyeroy in 
July further expanded our range of services and 
we are starting to see the benefit from Pyeroy’s 
expansion with oil & gas customers. 
In international markets, performance was 
held back by losses on the PDO contract 
in Oman, despite an improvement in the 
underlying position. We are in the process of 
agreeing a transition plan to exit, after which 
PDO plans to pursue a different contracting 
model. We have made an exceptional provision 
of $28.0m to reflect this. In other international 
markets, we recently signed a new engineering 
and construction contract with NCPOC in 
Kazakhstan and secured significant renewals 
in Africa. In Asia Pacific, the recently awarded 
contract with ExxonMobil in Papua New Guinea 
will help replace successful project work in 
Australia which is anticipated to complete in the 
first quarter of 2014. 
Outlook
Wood Group PSN is well positioned to deliver 
good growth in 2014, led by our US onshore 
shale related business which will benefit from 
the full year contribution of Elkhorn. Our North 
Sea business has good revenue visibility 
following a number of awards. In international 
markets, we have provided for the impact of 
potential future losses on the PDO contract and 
see good prospects in Africa, Asia Pacific and 
in the Middle East.

was up slightly on 2012 with strength in our 
power plant services business offset to some 
extent by performance elsewhere including 
the impact of deferrals in our aero derivative 
activities. Power Solutions was down on 2012 
but benefitted from final settlement on the 
completed GWF contract. We also saw a good 
contribution from the completed NRG and 
Pasadena contracts. 
The Dorad contract is anticipated to be 
profitable overall, but generated a loss in 2013 
due to factors including the impact of project 
slippage and associated increased costs. We 
anticipate that the project will reach substantial 
completion in the first quarter of 2014 and that 
future change orders should result in some 
profit recognition in 2014. We are the preferred 
contractor on a number of smaller Power 
Solutions contracts, although they are not yet in 
our order book.
In October we entered an agreement to form 
a joint venture consisting of the Maintenance 
and Power Solutions businesses of Wood 
Group GTS (excluding the Rolls Wood Group, 
TransCanada Turbines and Sulzer Wood joint 
ventures), and Siemens’ TurboCare business 
unit which provides aftermarket gas turbine, 
steam turbine and generator design, repair and 
manufacturing services. The shareholding will 
be split 51% Wood Group: 49% Siemens. The 
joint venture should enhance the differentiation 
and future prospects of our gas turbine 
activities, bring together complementary 
strengths, customers, geographies and 
provide access to certain OEM know-how. It 
is expected that the joint venture will deliver 
annual net synergies to Wood Group of around 
$15m by year three. 
Outlook
Completion of the joint venture with Siemens 
is anticipated in the first half of 2014. On 
completion, all Wood Group’s predominantly 
opex related gas turbine activities will be in 
joint ventures and will be reported within Wood 
Group PSN. It is the Group’s intention to retain 
proportional consolidation for management 
and segmental reporting into 2014, and we 
will continue to provide good visibility of the 
performance of our gas turbine activities within 
Wood Group PSN going forward. Performance 
in those activities is expected to be broadly 
flat in 2014, with growth in Maintenance offset 
by a lower contribution from Power Solutions, 
reflecting our current order book and lower risk 
appetite. 12

The trading performance figures include revenue 
and EBITA related to the Wood Group GTS 
businesses which the Group is transferring to 
the recently announced gas turbine joint venture 
with Siemens. As required under IFRS 5, the 
results of the Wood Group GTS businesses that 
are being transferred into the new joint venture 
are presented as discontinued activities in the 
consolidated income statement. However, the 
Group will own 51% of the new joint venture and, 
although we will not exercise control, it will remain 
part of the Group, therefore the Group’s results 
as prepared for internal management reporting 
purposes are presented here.   
As noted at the time that the joint venture was 
announced, it is the Group’s intention to retain 
proportional consolidation for management 
and segmental reporting into 2014, which is 
consistent with the approach above. 
A review of the Group’s trading performance is 
contained within the CEO’s review. 
The performance of the Group on a pro forma 
constant currency basis is set out below. The 
2012 results have been restated to include the 
results of acquisitions made in 2012 as if they 
had been acquired on 1 January 2012, and 
also to apply the average exchange rates used 
to translate the 2013 results. The 2013 results 
exclude the post-acquisition results of the Pyeroy, 
Elkhorn and Intetech acquisitions made during 
2013; EBITA of $8.8m was earned from these 
acquisitions in 2013.

recorded in the period in respect of a one-off 
compensation payment received by the Group for 
vacating sub-let office space. 
Restructuring charges of $15.9m have been 
expensed in 2013 relating to the merging of 
certain businesses in Canada, the write down 
of assets in Wood Group PSN’s Americas 
business and the reorganisation of Wood 
Group Engineering to reflect a change in the 
management structure of the business.
The Group’s contract with PDO in Oman has 
continued to make losses in 2013, albeit at a 
lower level than 2012. The parties are in the 
process of agreeing a transition period to exit, 
after which PDO plans to pursue a different 
contracting model. The Group has made an 
exceptional provision of $28.0m to reflect the 
onerous nature of this contract, comprising an 
assumption of losses during the period of run-off 
and an accelerated write-off of assets.
A gain of $6.0m has been recorded in respect of 
cash recovered against bad debt write-offs treated 
as exceptional charges in previous periods.
Costs of $11.1m have been incurred in the period 
in respect of acquisition activity (see note 27 
to the Group financial statements) and costs in 
relation to the formation of the joint venture with 
Siemens, and have been treated as exceptional.
During the period, the Group settled certain 
matters relating to the Well Support disposal 
in 2011. As a result of the settlement and a 
subsequent review of the carrying value of the 
related warranty provision, $34.4m was credited 
to exceptional items in 2013.
In 2009, the Group made provision against 
assets owned and amounts receivable under a 
contract to provide services in Venezuela which 
was terminated and subsequently taken over by 
PDVSA. In January 2014, the Group finalised a 
settlement agreement and received a payment 
of $62.5m. The net recovery, after deduction of 
costs, payments to non-controlling interests and 
taxation is expected to be around $40m and will 
be recorded as a 2014 exceptional gain.

Dividend
The Group continues to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy taking into account its capital 
requirements, cash flows and earnings. Since IPO 
in 2002, the Group has increased the dividend by 
an equivalent of 20% per annum compound. 
In line with our policy, the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 14.9 cents per share, an 
increase of 32%, which when added to the 
interim dividend of 7.1 cents per share makes a 
total distribution for the year of 22.0 cents per 
share (2012: 17.0 cents), an increase of 29%. 
The dividend of 22.0 cents is covered 4.5 times

2,407.4 2,227.1
Non-controlling interests 8.9 8.2
Total equity 2,416.3 2,235.3
Non-current assets are primarily made up of 
goodwill and intangible assets, and property, 
plant and equipment.   
The increase in net current assets since 
December 2012 is primarily due to higher trade 
receivables in Wood Group Engineering and 
Wood Group PSN due to increased activity and 
higher inventory in Wood Group GTS.
The increase in non-current liabilities in 2013 
is primarily due to the increase in long-term 
borrowings as a result of the three acquisitions 
completed during the year.   
Capital efficiency
Net debt to total EBITDA at 31 December 2013 
was 0.53 times (2012: 0.31 times). The Board 
would generally expect net debt to EBITDA to 
be in a range of around 0.5 to 1.5 times going 
forward, and to be typically below 1.0 times. 
To the extent that the Group has financial 
capacity which is surplus to the anticipated 
needs for acquisitions and organic growth, the 
Group would look to return this to shareholders 
through share buy backs or special dividends.
The Group’s pre-tax Return on average Capital 
Employed
6
 (ROCE) increased slightly from 
19.3% to 19.4% with an increase in Wood 
Group PSN being offset by reductions in Wood 
Group Engineering and Wood Group GTS. 
The Group’s ratio of average Operating 
Capital Employed to Revenue
7
 (OCER) 
worsened from 12.5% to 15.6% principally 
due to a combination of increased inventory 
and lower revenue in Wood Group GTS and 
higher average receivable days in both Wood 
Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN.

In February 2013, the Group renewed and 
extended its bilateral borrowing facilities from 
$800m to $950m with the maturity date being 
extended to February 2018. 
Cash generated from operations pre-working 
capital increased by $77.3m to $597.9m and 
post-working capital increased by $208.7m to 
$536.4m. The working capital outflow of $61.5m 
relates primarily to higher trade receivables as 
a result of increased activity in the period along 
with higher inventory in GTS, offset by higher 
payables. 
Cash paid in relation to acquisitions totalled 
$275.5m (2012: $158.3m) and deferred 
consideration paid in respect of prior period 
acquisitions amounted to $11.8m (2012: 
$30.4m). Included within acquisition spend is 
$3.1m (2012: $nil) relating to the purchase of 
non-controlling interests. 
Payments for capex and intangible assets 
increased to $142.0m (2012: $127.2m). We 
anticipate spend on capex and intangible assets 
to be around $140m in 2014.  
The Group’s employee share trusts purchased 
3 million shares during the year at a cost of 
$47.8m.
The reduction in tax paid in the year was due 
to timing of instalment payments in certain 
jurisdictions and payments relating to the 2011 
Well Support disposal made in 2012.  
The increase in interest, dividend and other 
largely relates to the increased dividend paid in 
the period.
Pensions
The majority of the Group’s pension 
arrangements are on a defined contribution basis. 
The Group operates one UK defined benefit 
scheme which had 241 active members and 940 
deferred, pensionable deferred or pensionable 
members at 31 December 2013. At 31 December 
2013 the scheme had a deficit of $41.2m (2012: 
$55.0m) before recognition of a deferred tax 
asset of $9.1m (2012: $12.7m). In assessing 
the potential liabilities, judgment is required to 
determine the assumptions around future salary 
and pension increases, inflation, investment 
returns and member longevity. The reduction 
in the deficit from 2012, although affected by a 
number of factors, was due primarily to better 
than anticipated investment performance in the 
period. 
The scheme is closed to new members and 
future benefits under the scheme are currently 
provided on a Career Average Revalued Earnings 
(CARE) basis. The Group has entered into 
consultation with members of the scheme with 
regard to a proposal which would result in closure 
to future accrual from 30 June 2014. No impact 
of the proposed change has been reflected in the 
2013 net liability.
Full details of pension assets and liabilities are 
provided in note 29 to the Group Financial 
Statements. 
Acquisitions
During the year the Group completed the 
acquisitions of Intetech, which is a niche provider 
of software and engineering consultancy services 
for well integrity and corrosion management 
services; Pyeroy, a provider of specialist coating 
and fabric maintenance services; and Elkhorn, a 
provider of construction services for midstream oil 
& gas facilities in the US shale market. The total 
initial consideration for these acquisitions was 
$275.5m, net of cash and borrowings acquired, 
of which Elkhorn made up $217.4m ($215.0m 
consideration plus $2.4m borrowings acquired).

Footnotes
1. Total EBITA includes continuing and discontinued 
operations and represents total operating profit of 
$431.4m (2012: $374.3m) before exceptional income of 
$0.5m (2012: $0.7m) and the deduction of amortisation 
of $102.1m (2012: $85.5m) and is provided as it is 
a key unit of measurement used by the Group in the 
management of its business. Total operating profit for the 
year comprises operating profit from continuing operations 
of $365.6m (2012: $335.0m) and operating profit from 
discontinued operations of $65.8m (2012: $39.3m).
2. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing 
earnings before exceptional items and amortisation, net of 
tax, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue during the period, excluding shares held by the 
Group’s employee ownership trusts and adjusted to 
assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
3. Number of people includes both employees 
and contractors at 31 December.
4. Interest cover is total EBITA divided 
by the net finance charge. 
5. Dividend cover is AEPS divided by the total 
dividend per ordinary share for the period. 
6. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) is total 
EBITA divided by average capital employed.   
7. Operating Capital Employed to Revenue (OCER) is 
the average operating capital employed (property, 
plant and equipment, intangible assets (excluding 
intangibles recognised on acquisition), inventories 
and trade and other receivables less trade and 
other payables) divided by total revenue.    Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements

Our Core Values continued
Safety & Assurance
Safety & Assurance is our top priority 
because lives depend on it. We passionately 
care about the safety of our people and 
behave as safety leaders. We are committed 
to preventing injuries and ill health to our 
people and everyone we work with. We 
provide our people with the training, knowledge 
and tools to work safely and prevent accidents. 
We are focused on assuring the safety of 
everything we design, construct, operate and 
maintain.
Our Safety & Assurance Core Value leaves no 
room for complacency. It is our major business 
driver, against which we set ourselves the highest 
standards. During 2013 we implemented a range 
of proactive and reactive measures with a view to 
achieving exemplary safety performance.
In 2013 we also looked closely at our HSSE 
strategic direction for the next three years. We 
refreshed our HSSE strategy which will shape our 
progress from 2014 onwards.
We established a Board-level Safety & Assurance 
committee to ensure our approach and 
performance is open to scrutiny and challenge 
at the highest level. This committee also ensures 
our strategy is validated, communicated and 
deployed.
Despite our good efforts, some elements of 
our safety performance have not improved as 
anticipated. In the UK and Americas, where we 
saw a decline in safety performance, we invested 
considerable time and resources to reverse this 
downward trend and began to see improvements 
towards the end of the year. 
Overall, whilst we have seen improvement in our 
total recordable case frequency (TRCF), our lost 
work case frequency (LWCF) remains relatively 
flat.
We tragically had a fatality at an onshore site 
in our UK business. We have captured and are 
acting on the lessons learned to avoid such a 
tragedy ever happening again.
During 2012 we successfully began raising the 
profile of how we apply and verify our HSSE 
systems. We continued to reinforce this process 
in 2013 with increased formality, engagement and 
rigour. It has now been embedded across the 
Group and is a key part of our HSSE strategy.
We invested in our security organisation to mirror 
our global footprint, and reflect and mitigate 
political fragility on some of our operations around 
the world.
The process safety gains made in 2012 were 
sustained and strengthened in 2013. We 
analysed more actual and potential integrity 
incidents, and conducted more extensive trend 
analysis to uncover weaknesses. We continue 
to apply the lessons learned from the Black Elk 
platform explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2012, 
where we were a main contractor. This has 
helped focus our attention on assuring clarity of 
roles and responsibility, plus the integrity of all of 
our operations.
Through our Safety Leadership Programme we 
deliver safety leadership training to our senior 
business leaders. During 2013 we extended 
the programme’s reach to a wider employee 
audience, in more locations and delivered in more 
innovative ways.
Relationships
Our business depends on healthy 
relationships with customers, business 
partners and suppliers. We build and nurture 
strong relationships that are mutually beneficial, 
making sure that we deeply understand the 
people we deal with, so that we can anticipate 
their needs and always aim to exceed their 
expectations. Everyone in our organisation 
contributes to the quality of the relationships we 
build and we actively seek feedback. 
We have a broad range of customers including 
international oil companies, national oil 
companies and independents, and power and 
industrial companies. Our relationships with 
our customers grow through delivering service 
excellence,  open and honest communication, 
and building trust. We are focused on developing 
strong relationships with our customers by 
listening to, understanding and satisfying their 
requirements, and providing cost-effective and 
reliable project delivery.
Our success in this area is demonstrated by the 
long-term relationships we have fostered with 
customers around the world. During 2013, we 
negotiated more than 30 contract renewals with 
clients globally, including 15 long-term contract 
extensions with key oil & gas industry operators 
on North Sea facilities. We have a diverse 
customer base, both in terms of industry sector 
and geography, ensuring we avoid dependency 
on any one customer. Our top 10 customers 
typically generate less than 40% of total Group 
revenues.
Collaboration across business units and divisions 
has been a key theme for 2013. Sharing ideas 
and opportunities across the Group allows 
us to offer a unified, seamless service to our 
customers. There are numerous examples of how 
we have collaborated to meet customer demand 
for comprehensive, cost-effective solutions, 
adding value to their business.
In the Gulf of Mexico, three of our businesses 
have jointly supported the Jack/St. Malo floating 
semi-submersible production platform: Wood 
Group Mustang performed topsides FEED and 
detailed design; Wood Group Kenny performed 
detailed design for the 136 mile oil export pipeline 
Energeticos in Colombia, part of Wood Group 
Mustang, was highly commended for Safety & 
Assurance in our 2013 ‘Living our Values’ Awards 
for outstanding Health, Safety and Environment 
performance, which was recognised by the 
Colombian Safety Council.

connecting the Jack/St. Malo facility to the Boxer 
A fixed platform; and Wood Group PSN planned, 
managed and performed field execution of 
commissioning for the facility.
Wood Group PSN introduced Wood Group 
GTS’ team to a customer experiencing issues 
with its fleet of rotating equipment on offshore 
assets. Wood Group GTS provided a solution to 
the customer’s problems and was subsequently 
awarded a long-term maintenance contract with 
them.
We continue to maintain good relationships with 
our business partners, including our joint venture 
partners and suppliers. We work closely with 
Government and industry bodies, including Oil 
& Gas UK, Step Change in Safety and the North 
America Generator Forum.
Social Responsibility 
Being socially responsible is integral to what 
we do. We aim to make a positive difference 
to the communities where we operate and 
seek ways to assist them. We prioritise the 
hiring and development of local people and 
work with local supply chains where we can. 
We are committed to minimising the impact of 
our activities on the environment by conserving 
resources, reducing waste and emissions, and 
preventing environmental pollution and we 
work with our customers to provide the best 
environmental solutions. 
Our charitable support spans health, education, 
the arts, medical research and the prevention 
and reduction of poverty, and our employee 
giving funds support causes that our people are 
involved with and care about. In Bangladesh 
we actively supported initiatives to provide 
education to children without access to local 
primary schools, and in Africa we partnered 
with the Vine Trust to bring medical and housing 
support in Tanzania. In the US we supported the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the ALS Association 
and the MS150 bike ride for multiple sclerosis. 
In the UK we supported the Young Engineers & 
Science Club, the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, 
Transition Extreme, the ARCHIE Foundation and 
the Maggie’s Centres Appeal.
Our environmental strategy has three key 
elements. Firstly, we develop and implement 
sound management systems. Wood Group 
Kenny was the first company in Australia to 
achieve ISO 50001 certification, a technical 
standard specific to energy usage and 
consumption. Several of our businesses also 
received ISO 14001 environmental management 
system certification. We identify and monitor 
the environmental impact of our main areas of 
environmental risk, including platforms where we 
are dutyholder, power plants and facilities that we 
operate, and the facilities we design.
Secondly, we seek to reduce the environmental 
impact of our internal operations. Our main 
CO
2
 emissions come from energy use in our 
buildings and business travel by employees. 
We are committed to improving performance 
in both of these areas. We have carried out 
energy efficiency improvements, particularly 
in the UK, that are helping us create a better 
working environment for our employees and 
improve our environmental performance. We 
continue to participate in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP) for carbon emission reporting, 
and the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC), 
a UK Government scheme encouraging carbon 
emission reduction.
Thirdly, we use our engineering and production 
support capabilities, and our developing 
renewable energy expertise, to provide our 
customers with solutions to help them reduce 
their environmental impact. Where appropriate, 
we aim to improve our customers’ environmental 
performance by designing processes and facilities 
which monitor and limit emissions, use fewer 
materials in fabrication, and contribute to more 
efficient operation.
Our commitment to Social Responsibility is 
demonstrated across our organisation. Through 
our renewable engineering consultancy, 
SgurrEnergy, part of Wood Group Kenny, we 
have supported renewable energy projects 
globally. In Ethiopia, our wind monitoring and 
analysis services are being provided for a 400MW 
wind farm which is significant for the expansion 
of renewable energy development in Ethiopia 
and across East Africa. Our cutting edge wind 
scanning technology, using Galion Lidar devices, 
was deployed in the Gulf of Mexico and used 
for research by a university in China. In the US, 
Wood Group GTS installed two steam turbines in 
the 250MW Mojave Solar Project, one of several 
large-scale renewable energy initiatives that 
will enable the state of California to secure one 
third of its energy requirements from renewable 
sources by 2020. Wood Group Mustang’s 
biofuel team has applied its process engineering 
expertise on several projects, including the 
design of two major biofuel plants using the latest 
technology concepts.

In partnership with the Vine Trust, we are helping 
make a difference to people’s lives in Tanzania by 
supporting the design and construction of a floating 
medical facility, and our employees are volunteering 
to help build homes in the region.
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission sources 
required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
These sources fall within our consolidated financial 
statements. We do not have responsibility for any 
emission sources that are not included in our  
consolidated financial statements.
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate  
Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), 
data gathered to fulfil our requirements, and emission 
factors from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014. Where data 
was not available due to timeframes, estimation of 
data has occurred to best reflect an accurate view  
of those sources included in the reporting.

hollow corporate strapline. With around 46,000 
employees working in over 50 countries 
worldwide, our competitive edge is delivered 
through the quality of our people. We pride 
ourselves on the character, energy and diversity 
of our employees. This means that everyone is 
treated fairly, honestly and individual differences 
are respected. 
To attract the best people to work for Wood 
Group we understand that we must offer a 
combination of interesting and rewarding work 
in a safe, friendly and supportive working 
environment. The best people are also attracted 
by working in an organisation that is led by the 
best. During 2013, the Wood Group Leadership 
Framework was created to help us further 
develop our leaders and provide a guide to the 
intrinsic behaviours that Wood Group requires of 
its leaders to achieve our strategic ambitions.
Retaining our senior talent is critical to our 
business, reflecting not only their direct 
contribution but also the influence they have on 
others. During 2013, we improved our approach 
to resourcing at leadership level in what is a very 
competitive global labour market. Also, in a key 
part of our business we aligned the approach 
with our People Core Value and created our Gold 
Box of senior leaders in the business. Using 
the Wood Group Leadership Framework as the 
benchmark, we are now delivering Leadership 
Development Centres which have the dual 
benefit of helping our organisation understand 
the aspirations of our people as well as providing 
our leaders with the opportunity to achieve their 
potential.
To operate at the highest levels we know that 
we need to develop our talent and invest in 
our people regardless of career stage, location 
and role. Our extensive development portfolio 
provides blended development opportunities 
designed to equip the organisation with new skills 
as well as refine and update existing ones. Our 
bespoke leadership development programmes 
were updated during 2013 to place more 
emphasis on our Core Values and organisational 
collaboration. This reflects our determination and 
belief that excellent leaders both understand and 
display the behaviours we expect to truly support 
our strategic direction.
We are committed to bringing the next generation 
of talent into the business and achieve this 
through industry leading apprenticeships and 
graduate development programmes. During 
the past five years we have brought more than 
830 graduates and apprentices into our global 
business, which includes over 200 in 2013. 
We recognise that in order to retain the best 
talent, we need to offer career progression and 
a variety of opportunities within our business 
and this is achieved through our approach to 
career management at the end of our structured 
development programmes.
Ours is an exciting business that offers our people 
a diverse mix of career development opportunities 
around the world. We encourage innovation and 
fresh thinking that embraces our cultural diversity 
and encourages the kind of effective teamwork 
that results in tailored solutions to client problems 
across different environments. We recognise 
the significant advantage in working together 
across divisions and geographies to harness our 
collective strengths.
Innovation
Innovation gives us competitive advantage. 
We promote collaboration and sharing of ideas 
across our business. We have a structured 
approach to recognising innovations, rapidly 
testing ideas and sharing learnings. We 
encourage our people to challenge established 
practices and achieve continuous improvement. 
We are committed to delivering thorough and 
sound solutions to every challenge.
Our culture is to encourage innovation in 
everything we do. Innovation helps us respond 
successfully to the developing and changing 
needs of our customers around the world, 
and we invest in operational and engineering 
excellence initiatives to deliver continuous 
improvement. We have been actively involved in 
many such initiatives during 2013.
We renewed our sponsorship of the Wood 
Group Chair of Arctic and Harsh Environment at 
Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada 
for a second five-year term. The Arctic and cold 
regions are a strategically important area of future 
industry development. Through our R&D chair 
we aim to develop enabling technology and 
environmentally robust solutions for offshore oil & 
gas developments in these regions.
Wood Group Kenny won the Industry Innovation 
and Technology award at the Subsea Energy 
Australia 2013 Business Awards for its lightweight 
riser vacuum testing equipment. This innovative 
tool weighs just one percent of traditional vacuum 
testing systems, meaning it can be quickly 
mobilised to remote locations by helicopter. 
MSi Kenny’s Virtuoso™ pipeline hydraulic and 
process simulation tools were installed on the 
Nord Stream pipeline system, linking Russia 
to Germany via the Baltic Sea, to monitor the 
operations of two pipelines feeding gas to 
consumers in Europe.
Wood Group Mustang took an off-the-shelf 
process and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) 
system and customised it to create its own 
system to meet customers’ P&ID expectations.

The system reduces time and errors by using 
original data. The business has also been 
involved in a project that is leading the industry 
in sustainability and ecological design. In 
response to Canada’s requirement to ship oil 
sands bitumen to refineries in the US, the NWR 
Sturgeon Refinery in northeast Canada is an 
exciting and innovative new project that will have 
the capacity to produce 150,000 barrels per 
day of refined product. The project is the first in 
the world to incorporate gasification and carbon 
capture, reducing its environmental impact. 
Wood Group Mustang’s scope of work involved 
earthworks, deep undergrounds and firewater 
and water treating facilities for the first phase of 
the facility.
A creative Wood Group PSN solution was 
deployed during expansion of a North Sea 
platform which could not cope with the extra 
weight of a new module. The team designed 
the largest structural strengthening scope in the 
client’s history, allowing a further 1,900 tonnes 
to be installed. Wood Group PSN breathed new 
life into the infrastructure, extending its life while 
assuring the design’s technical integrity.
Wood Group GTS conducted its first Critical 
Infrastructure Protection (CIP) conversion at a 
500MW power plant in the US. The conversion 
provided a continuous audit-ready compliance 
programme, enabling the customer to manage its 
complex compliance requirements, and helping 
to safeguard North America’s power system from 
cyber security risks.
Financial Responsibility 
We expect to receive fair reward for our 
business performance. We are cost aware and 
carefully manage our own and our customers’ 
costs. We manage financial risk systematically 
and communicate our financial performance in a 
clear, concise manner.
Securing fair reward for our services allows us 
to invest in the future of the Group, reward our 
investors, and satisfy our suppliers and lenders 
appropriately. Having the relevant financial 
expertise across our business is key to this and 
is not limited to the finance function. More than 
400 people have attended our internal ‘Finance 
for Managers’ programme which enables 
operational management to better understand 
financial reporting and the importance of working 
capital and improved cash management, which 
ultimately frees up capital for further investment. 
We track average Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) 
as a key indicator of working capital performance, 
and this moved from 51 in 2012 to 54 in 2013, 
principally due to an increase in Wood Group 
Engineering. The finance function supports 
business decision making, provides stewardship 
to protect the Group’s assets, ensures 
compliance with financial reporting requirements, 
and understands and responds to risks facing our 
business.
The management of our own and our customers’ 
costs remains crucially important, particularly in 
a market environment where project returns and 
capital discipline are high on the agenda. Our 
current capital expenditure programme includes 
investment in integrated business management 
systems across the Group. In 2013, Wood Group 
Mustang’s US operations went live and we 
believe this will increase our cost effectiveness 
and our ability to better service customers.
As a public company we must proactively 
communicate our financial performance and 
future expectations in a clear and concise 
manner. Managing this flow of information helps 
ensure that we are fairly valued in the market. 
During the year we communicated our view of a 
deteriorating outlook for parts of the business in 
2014 as conditions changed, and we provided 
clear guidance to the market about our updated 
expectations of financial performance in this area. 
We understand the importance of maintaining 
relationships with the financial community that 
are built on trust, including investors, analysts 
and the financial media. It is crucial that our 
stakeholders understand the impact of the risks 
and opportunities facing our business and our 
ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
We seek investor feedback throughout the year, 
both informally through our investor relations 
team, as well as through investor roadshows 
and one-to-one sessions with our CEO and 
CFO. Recognising the insight that operational 
management can bring to investors, additional 
members of our senior leadership team took part 
in our results presentations and investor meetings 
during the year. We also participated in a number 
of investment bank conferences and held further 
meetings in response to ad hoc requests. 
In February 2013, the Group renewed and 
extended its bilateral borrowing facilities from 
$800m to $950m with the maturity date extended 
to February 2018. This helped facilitate working 
capital requirements and nearly $300m of 
spending on acquisitions during 2013, which we 
believe will improve our financial performance.
Our next Annual General Meeting, to be held 
on 14 May 2014, will provide an opportunity for 
shareholders to raise questions with the Board. 
We will continue to communicate regular formal 
updates during the course of the year, including 
final and interim results, interim management 
statements, and trading updates. In addition, 
following the success of the Wood Group 
Engineering capital markets day in 2012, and 
recognising the changes to the Group structure 
as our gas turbine activities transfer to the 
stewardship of Wood Group PSN, we intend to 
hold a Wood Group PSN capital markets day 
during 2014.

Integrity
We are proud of our reputation, built over 
many years, which depends on us doing 
the right thing. Integrity is our cornerstone and 
character is as important as ability. We build 
trust and act with honesty. We comply with our 
Business Ethics Policy, management system and 
all local rules and regulations. We foster a culture 
of transparency and responsibility. We investigate 
all alleged breaches and complaints and take 
appropriate action. 
Our Business Ethics committee oversees our 
business ethics compliance programme and the 
implementation of our Business Ethics Policy. 
The committee comprises senior managers 
from across the Group and is chaired by Robbie 
Brown, Company Secretary. Our Group Chief 
Compliance Officer serves as the focal point for 
business ethics and compliance matters across 
the Group’s global activities. The Business Ethics 
committee also appoints the Group’s Responsible 
Officers who, liaising with a number of designated 
Country Officers, are responsible for promoting 
ethical conduct across all businesses and 
locations in their area of responsibility. We also 
use various forms of communication to embed 
the Integrity message across the Group, including 
video and email messages, posters and our 
Business Ethics intranet site.
Our Business Ethics Policy sets the high ethical 
standards that we expect of our business 
operations, our people and every company 
that we work with. It highlights the importance 
of conducting business ethically and legally 
throughout our global organisation. The 
policy is updated regularly, is available in nine 
languages and is widely communicated to our 
people. In 2013 more than 5,300 (2012: around 
5,000) business ethics personnel completed 
on-line training and confirmed their continued 
compliance. Business ethics personnel are 
identified based on a range of roles and 
responsibilities, including those that liaise with 
customers and third parties.
Using our confidential Business Ethics helpline, 
people can raise their concerns, report suspected 
breaches of the Business Ethics Policy, and 
ask questions. Since October 2013 the helpline 
has been externally hosted to improve multi-
lingual access and emphasise the confidentiality 
of reporting. In addition, matters may also 
be reported directly to management, Group 
Compliance, Legal or Human Resources.
We conduct timely investigations whenever we 
receive information alleging potential breaches 
of our Business Ethics Policy. A register of 
business ethics matters is maintained by the 
Group Chief Compliance Officer and the Business 
Ethics committee, and the Board receive 
regular reports and updates. During 2013 we 
conducted a number of internal investigations into 
allegations of unethical behaviour. Appropriate 
disciplinary action was taken based on the facts 
and circumstances. This included one formal 
dismissal for behaviour that violated the Business 
Ethics Policy and four other cases where the 
employee left during or immediately upon 
completion of an investigation. We take prompt 
action to deal with any confirmed breaches. 
Equally, through our ‘Living our Values’ awards, 
we continue to recognise individuals or teams 
who demonstrate integrity in an exemplary 
manner.
At Wood Group, employees are consistently 
reminded that they play a crucial role in ensuring 
that we conduct business ethically, and apply 
moral and principled behaviour in all our 
transactions. In spite of this, we know that errors 
of judgement can occur, and therefore we are 
never complacent and are relentlessly focused on 
adhering to our Integrity Core Value.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Effective risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management which is 
fundamental to the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives. 
Our Core Values
The effective management of risk is necessary 
across all aspects of our business model and our 
Core Values provide our people, customers and 
suppliers with a clear view of how we operate 
which helps frame the risk culture across the 
Group. 
Operations
Our people across our business operations are  
at the forefront of effective risk management.  
The risk profile across each of our divisions 
varies through the nature of our activities, specific 
customer contracts and geographic spread, 
and each division operates under an established 
policy and procedural framework which supports 
our corporate attitude to risk. 
Oversight
The Board formally reviews risk management and 
internal control arrangements twice a year, usually 
in February and August, and through the course 
of the year the Board will consider current and 
emerging risks facing the Group. In addition, the 
Board monitors the Group’s attitude to risk with a 
specific focus in 2013 relating to our appetite for 
lump sum and fixed price contracting. 
Our leadership teams provide oversight through 
specific activities designed to monitor key risks 
in such areas. This is an ongoing process and 
we are continually seeking to enhance our risk 
monitoring and reporting tools. 
Assurance 
Various assurance mechanisms are utilised 
across the Group such as peer reviews on certain 
significant or higher risk contracts as well as 
a programme of risk based audits performed 
by the Group Internal Audit function. This work 
complements business specific activity in areas 
such as Safety, HR and Quality. 
We continue to review our approach to risk 
management and seek to improve associated 
internal control processes. Some of the more 
recent developments introduced in 2013 include: 
• a refresh of the Group’s risk assessment 
process, including a series of facilitated 
workshops involving divisional and 
functional senior managers across the 
Group
• the introduction of revised policies in 
respect of the risk associated with the 
bidding and execution of lump sum and 
fixed price contracts
• an update of our security policy and 
associated process for assessing security 
risk within the locations in which we 
operate.

Wood Group’s Core Values provide a sound basis on which to make decisions and assist us in considering the  
broad spectrum of risks and uncertainties that can impact operational and financial performance across the Group.  
The risks below include the principal risks faced by the Group during the year and were included in the Board review 
process carried out during February 2014 in accordance with the guidance on internal controls in the Turnbull 
guidance published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). 22

Operational Financial Environmental
Change in risk
from 2012  
Failure to deliver safety excellence 
and process assurance could 
harm people, damage assets, 
impact our reputation and result in 
customers no longer selecting the 
Group as a supplier of services.
We have a fundamental duty to 
protect our people and recognise 
the risks associated with poor 
safety performance leading to a 
major incident resulting in a loss 
of life.
A number of our recent 
acquisitions involve construction 
work and increased driving activity 
which bring an element of inherent 
safety risk. Although we continue 
to embed our safety processes 
within new acquisitions, the 
overall safety risk profile within the 
Group has increased slightly. 
Failure to deliver expected 
operational performance could 
lead to a requirement for work to 
be repeated, loss of work through 
damage to our reputation, or 
liability claims.
Specific risks in this area include 
the start up and execution of 
new contracts as well as risks 
associated with the integration 
of acquired businesses and the 
formation of joint ventures.
An internal or external event 
that impacts our ability to raise 
finance, achieve forecast, 
effectively manage our working 
capital or hampers management’s 
ability to make effective decisions 
or report on our financial position.
The Group operates in a number 
of countries where the tax 
regimes can be complex and 
uncertain. This can increase 
the risk of operating in certain 
geographies. The Group may 
take a position on a particular tax 
treatment that differs from that of 
a tax authority on audit, leading to 
disagreement or dispute, and the 
risk of higher tax payments. 
An environmental incident could 
lead to legislative or regulatory 
action, harm to the environment 
and associated reputational 
damage.
Safety & Assurance continues 
to be our top priority and is 
underpinned by the Group HSSE 
management system.
We established a sub-committee 
of the Board to specifically cover 
Safety & Assurance matters.
We use indicators to monitor and 
measure personal and process 
safety performance.
High Potential and High Severity 
incidents are subject to increased 
scrutiny, with formal cross-
divisional review and learning 
processes introduced. ‘Near Miss’ 
reporting, analysis and learning 
was further developed during 
2013.
Our internal review process 
includes self assessment and 
certification.
Our Safety Leadership 
Programme has been extensively 
deployed across the Group.
We have a review and approval 
process for new work aligned to 
formal delegations of authority.
We have start-up and execution 
plans for key projects supported 
by monitoring and reporting.
We seek to deliver high-quality 
project execution and operational 
performance.
Integration teams are assigned 
to new acquisitions with detailed 
plans developed to monitor the 
integration process. 
Collaboration across business 
units and divisions has been a 
key theme for 2013. Sharing 
ideas and opportunities across 
the Group allows us to offer a 
unified, seamless service to our 
customers.
We have Group-wide accounting, 
treasury and tax policies that 
underpin our approach to 
managing financial risk.
We execute regular budgeting, 
forecasting and monitoring 
processes.
We carry out a review and 
approval process in relation to 
capital commitments, acquisitions 
and disposals.
We have internal audit, quarterly 
self-certification and annual 
financial risk self-assessment 
processes embedded across the 
Group.
In February 2013, the Group 
renewed and extended its bilateral 
borrowing facilities from $800m 
to $950m, with the maturity date 
being extended to February 2018. 
This gives us the opportunity to 
invest in future growth. We drive 
strong cash flow and maintain a 
robust balance sheet to have the 
flexibility to invest in the business 
and make acquisitions.
We seek to deliver high-quality 
project execution and operational 
performance.
A large number of our business 
units have ISO 14001 certified 
or equivalent environmental 
management systems and we 
participate in the CDP initiative to 
get external benchmarking of our 
performance.
We drive heightened 
environmental awareness through 
HSE alerts and environment 
initiatives.
Our integrity management focus 
contributes to process integrity, 
which helps mitigate against spills 
and pollution. We also continue to 
focus on expanding our carbon 
footprint reduction activities.

Change in risk
from 2012               
Weaknesses in the pre-contract 
award process, inappropriate 
pricing, misalignment of contract 
terms, or failure to comply with 
contractual conditions could lead 
to reputational damage, or poor 
financial performance. 
Our exposure to specific risks 
associated with lump sum and 
fixed price contracts reduced 
during the year as we introduced 
a new policy and associated 
controls for contracts that contain 
lump sum or fixed-price elements 
to ensure that we keep our overall 
risk profile within our comfort 
levels. 
A substantial ethical breach or 
non-compliance with laws could 
lead to reputational damage, 
associated regulatory or legislative 
action, loss of business and 
claims for compensation.
We operate in a number of 
countries with a higher risk of 
corruption and recognise the 
heightened risk if we utilise third 
parties to conduct business on 
our behalf.
The availability of appropriately 
skilled personnel remains a 
challenge for our industry. 
Failure to attract, develop or retain 
suitably qualified personnel to 
support our clients’ needs could 
restrict our growth.
Unplanned changes to our 
management teams could impact 
our ability to deliver operational 
and strategic objectives.
Changes in market conditions 
may influence customers’ 
investment decisions which could 
lead to a decline in demand for 
our services. Over-exposure to 
any one customer, geographic 
market or loss of a significant 
business partner could impact our 
performance. 
Analysts estimate some reduction 
in growth in E&P spend reflecting 
a greater focus on capital budgets 
by our customers and this is 
reflected in the slight increase in 
our risk profile in this area.  That 
said, the mix of opex and capex 
activities and the contribution 
of completed acquisitions is 
expected to lead to growth overall 
in 2014, with growth in Wood 
Group PSN offsetting a reduction 
in Wood Group Engineering.
We have a rigorous approach 
to the review and approval of 
price, scope, subcontractor 
management and contract risk 
on contracts with lump sum and 
fixed price elements.
Derogation from the Group’s 
contracting procedure is subject 
to a range of approvals.
Senior management undertake 
commercial reviews of 
performance on selected 
contracts and report to the Board. 
We monitor the adequacy of our 
insurance cover.
We negotiate appropriate 
protections in relation to 
acquisitions where we can, 
typically including warranties and 
indemnities.
We look to maintain a balance of 
opex and capex based activities 
to provide relative profit and loss 
and cash flow stability.
We have a Business Ethics Policy 
which forms the foundation of 
our compliance programme, 
and requires our personnel to 
conduct business ethically and 
legally throughout our global 
organisation.
Our Business Ethics committee 
oversees our business ethics 
compliance programme and the 
implementation of our Business 
Ethics Policy. The committee 
comprises senior managers from 
across the Group. It appoints 
the Group’s Responsible Officers 
who, liaising with designated 
Country Officers, are responsible 
for promoting ethical conduct 
across all businesses and 
locations.
During 2013 we moved our 
business ethics helpline facility 
to an independent provider to 
improve multilingual access 
and emphasise the option of 
confidentiality of reporting.
We conduct timely investigations 
and revised our investigation 
process and protocol during the 
year.
We monitor export controls, 
trade compliance and intellectual 
property risk.
We carry out a Board succession 
planning process, led by 
the Nomination Committee. 
We maintain detailed line 
management succession plans 
which are monitored by the 
Group’s HR teams.
Businesses measure their 
performance against established 
human resources practices.
We operate competitive and 
performance based reward 
practices.
We offer appropriate training and 
development programmes.
We aim to attract the best people 
to our business by building on 
our management track record of 
delivering through cycle growth 
and by building market leading 
positions.
We seek to diversify risk by 
maintaining a broad customer and 
geographic spread across the oil 
& gas and power sectors. 
We seek a balance of business 
between customers’ capex and 
opex spend. We also monitor and 
report customer concentration.
We maintain relationship 
management programmes across 
top customers and business 
partners.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Governance – Letter from the Chairman of the Board
“In considering who should succeed 
me as Chairman, the Nomination 
Committee concluded that Ian 
Marchant was the outstanding 
candidate. His appointment is a 
natural evolution in the Group’s 
stewardship and fully complies with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
on Chairman appointments.”
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Group’s governance 
report for 2013, giving me the opportunity to 
highlight some significant developments and how 
the principles relating to the role of the Board 
have been applied in contributing to challenge, 
debate and effective decision making.
My appointment as Chairman in 2012, after my 
tenure as CEO, followed a consultation with 
key shareholders led by our senior independent 
director. Those shareholders unanimously 
supported the decision of the Board, who 
considered the appointment necessary to provide 
continuity at the top level over the period of 
transition of executive leadership to Bob Keiller 
as CEO. Since then, Bob has demonstrated 
excellent leadership as he has developed 
the Group’s strategy in 2013. As a result, it is 
appropriate that I now retire from the Board 
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May 
2014. In considering who should succeed me as 
Chairman, the Nomination Committee concluded 
that Ian Marchant was the outstanding candidate. 
Ian has served as a non-executive director since 
2006, latterly as senior independent director. 
His appointment is a natural evolution in the 
Group’s stewardship and fully complies with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code on Chairman 
appointments.
The Board is supported by a number of 
committees in addition to the Nomination 
Committee, which bring appropriate insight to 
the Board’s deliberations and ensure that the 
long-term interests of the Group are met. Our 
Safety & Assurance Committee was established 
in May 2013 and oversees the management of 
Safety & Assurance, consistent with its status as 
the Group’s top priority. The Committee includes 
Mike Straughen who has stepped away from his 
Wood Group Engineering role and now oversees 
the Group’s HSSE activities, and is chaired by 
Thomas M Botts, formerly of Shell, who was 
appointed as non-executive director in January 
2013.
In 2013, the responsibilities of the Audit 
Committee expanded to reflect changes in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. These 
included the requirement, as requested by the 
Board, to advise whether the Company’s annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy. The Committee’s report also includes 
additional detail on the primary areas of financial 
reporting judgement considered in relation to the 
2013 financial statements and how they were 
addressed. 
The Remuneration Committee focused on two 
main priorities in 2013. Firstly, we introduced the 
Group’s new long-term incentive arrangements, 
the Long-Term Plan (LTP), which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2013 AGM. The LTP 
covers both incentive and retention awards 
and provides a framework which we believe 
will continue to support the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic goals. Secondly, we sought 
to address new regulations aimed at improving 
the transparency of directors remuneration. Our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR) reflects 
these new regulations which provide shareholders 
with a greater say in remuneration policy as it 
relates to company directors. The Board is fully 
supportive of these changes in regulation and we 
trust that shareholders will welcome the revised 
format. 
There were a number of Board changes 
announced during the second half of the year. 
In September, Mike Straughen, Group Director 
for Wood Group Engineering, advised that he 
intends to retire from the Board during 2014. 
In October, Mark S Dobler, Group Director for 
Wood Group GTS stepped down from the Board 
and will become CEO of the new joint venture 
with Siemens on its formation. Neil H Smith 
retired from the Board in December. Neil was a 
non-executive director from 2004 and served on 
the Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
His knowledge of the power generation 
industry greatly assisted Board discussions on 
the strategic development of our gas turbine 
activities. 
I am confident that the Board retains an 
appropriate balance of skills, diversity, experience 
and personalities, and that in his role as 
Chairman, Ian Marchant will ensure its continued 
effectiveness in the best long-term interests of 
the Group.

Corporate governance
Statement of Compliance
The Board remains fully committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and believes that this 
is key to overall performance and integrity, consistent with our Core Values. The following section explains how 
the Company has applied the main principles of Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, Remuneration and 
Relations with shareholders outlined in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Governance Code). A copy of the 
Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. The directors consider that the Company has fully complied with 
the provisions of the Governance Code during the year ended 31 December 2013. The Board considers that the 
annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. The Board 
also believes that good corporate governance extends beyond regulatory compliance and consistently monitors 
developments in best practice, including guidance published by investor groups.
What is the role of the Board?
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for its consideration and approval. 
These include responsibility for Group strategy, 
the annual budget, significant acquisitions, risk 
management and the overall system of internal 
control. Executive management is responsible for 
the implementation of Board decisions in these 
areas and all other aspects of managing the 
business. A typical Board agenda is set out on 
page 25. 
What is the composition of the Board?
The Board comprised 13 directors for the 
majority of the year. At all times the non-executive 
directors comprised a majority of the Board 
(excluding the Chairman) as recommended by the 
Governance Code. 
In January 2014, the Chairman advised that he 
will retire from the Board effective from the date 
of the next Annual General Meeting (to be held on 
14 May 2014). Ian D Marchant, currently senior 
independent director, will become Chairman of 
the Board from that date. An announcement on 
the new senior independent director and chair of 
the Audit Committee will be made in due course.
In September 2013, Mike Straughen advised 
that he intends to retire during 2014. Mike was 
Chief Executive of Wood Group Engineering from 
2007 until October 2013 and now oversees the 
Group’s HSSE activities. In October 2013, he 
joined the Safety & Assurance Committee.
Mark S Dobler left the Board on 9 October on 
announcement of the proposed formation of 
a joint venture with Siemens AG for rotating 
equipment services which he will lead. He 
remains CEO of the GTS Division pending the 
formation of the joint venture.
Thomas M Botts joined the Board as a non-
executive on 8 January 2013. 
Neil H Smith retired as a non-executive director 
on 31 December 2013 after nine years on the 
Board. 
A clear separation of the roles of the Chairman 
and the CEO has been agreed by the Board, 
in compliance with the Governance Code. The 
Chairman is responsible for the leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board. He chairs the Board 
meetings, ensures the agendas are appropriate 
and is responsible for facilitating that all directors 
actively contribute to the determination of the 
Group’s strategy. The CEO is responsible for 
the day-to-day management of the Group and 
implementation of the Group strategy, develops 
proposals for Board approval, and ensures that a 
regular dialogue with shareholders is maintained. 
Executive Board Members report directly to the 
CEO. 
Are the Board members independent? 
After careful consideration, the Board 
considers all of its non-executive directors to 
be independent in character and judgement 
and, other than set out below, that there are no 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to 
affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement. 
Brief biographies of the directors appear on 
pages 26 and 27. 
In October 2013, Jeremy R Wilson retired as 
vice-chair of J.P . Morgan’s Energy Group. He 
continues as a senior adviser to J.P . Morgan on 
a part-time basis. The Company has a material 
business relationship with J.P . Morgan Cazenove, 
who act as joint corporate broker, adviser and 
lender to the Company. Having considered 
whether his role at J.P . Morgan could affect 
his judgement as a director of the Company, 
the Board continues to believe that Jeremy 
is independent in character and judgement 
and, accordingly, has determined that he is 
an independent non-executive director for the 
purposes of the Governance Code.
Are Board members standing  
for re-election? 
All directors, other than Allister G Langlands, will 
seek re-election at the 2014 AGM. 
How does the Board discharge its 
responsibilities?
There were six scheduled Board meetings during 
2013, plus one unscheduled meeting. Four of the 
meetings were scheduled as two-day sessions 
and were held in Aberdeen (twice), Houston 
and Calgary. Safety & Assurance is always the 
first item on the agenda at Board meetings. The 
Board received detailed presentations from senior 
management within the Group’s businesses 
during the year, each including updates on Safety 
& Assurance. 
The executive directors attended monthly Group 
Executive Committee meetings throughout the 
year which include reports and discussions on 
Safety & Assurance, operational issues, finance, 
legal and business ethics, investor relations and  Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements
29
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
human resources matters. In addition, divisional 
CEO’s conduct Quarterly Review Meetings 
with senior managers of all businesses within 
their division. These meetings are also normally 
attended by the Group CEO and CFO. 
In addition to Board meetings, a summary of the 
Group’s financial performance is made available 
to the Board on a monthly basis. 
The directors have access, via a secure intranet 
site, to presentations from the Group’s brokers 
which contain investors’ feedback, copies 
of relevant regulations, analyst research and 
appropriate administrative information. 
What training do the Board members 
receive? 
The training needs of directors are periodically 
discussed at Board meetings and briefings 
arranged on issues relating to corporate 
governance. Arrangements are in place for newly 
appointed directors to undertake an induction 
process designed to develop their knowledge 
and understanding of the Group’s business. This 
includes briefing sessions during regular Board 
meetings, visits to Group operating sites and 
discussion of relevant business issues. Upon their 
appointment, directors are advised of their legal 
and other duties and their obligations as directors 
of a listed company and under the Companies 
Act 2006. 
All directors are encouraged to attend relevant 
external seminars. There is a procedure for any 
director to take independent professional advice 
at the Group’s expense and all directors have 
access to the services of the Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that the Board’s 
procedures are followed. 
How is the Board’s performance  
evaluated? 
The Board completed a formal evaluation of 
its own performance and of its committees 
(other than the Safety & Assurance Committee 
established during the year), individual 
directors, and of the Chairman during the year. 
In accordance with paragraph B.6.2. of the 
Governance Code, the Board retained Lintstock 
Limited (Lintstock) as advisors to facilitate the 
Board evaluation process. The evaluation involved 
directors completing detailed questionnaires, the 
results of which were analysed by the Chairman 
and the Company Secretary and presented by 
way of a report for discussion both at Board 
meetings in August and October 2013 and 
separate meetings between each director  
and the Chairman. 
The non-executive directors, facilitated by 
Lintstock and led by the senior independent 
director, were responsible for the performance 
evaluation of the Chairman, taking into account 
the views of the executive directors. 
Key areas covered by the Board evaluation were 
the effectiveness of the Board and committee 
meetings, individual director performance 
& assessment of the Chairman, and the 
nature & extent of the Board’s interaction with 
the management of the Group. The main 
observations from the evaluation were:
• A desire to rearticulate the Group’s 
strategic direction, which was subsequently 
addressed at Board meetings in December 
2013 and February 2014 and is described 
in the Strategic report
• A preference for rebalancing the Board 
agenda and papers from operational to 
strategic considerations, which will be 
reflected in the Board schedule by ensuring 
that more time is available at Board 
meetings for strategic considerations
• A request to review the extent of any 
duplication in activities between the 
Board and its committees, which is being 
addressed through a review of the Audit 
Committee’s terms of reference
• A desire to extend the depth of the Board’s 
review of senior management succession 
planning, which was subsequently 
considered at the Board’s meeting in 
December 2013
Lintstock have no other connection to the Group. 
How are conflicts of interest dealt with? 
The Board requires directors to declare any 
appointments or other situations which would 
amount to a possible conflict of interest. The 
Board has procedures in place to deal with and,  
if necessary, approve any such conflicts. 
What is the Board’s approach to 
managing the Group’s tax affairs?
Our tax affairs are managed consistent with our 
Core Values at all times, such that all relevant 
laws and regulations are observed. We conduct 
our affairs with tax authorities around the world 
in an open, professional and courteous manner. 
Diligent professional care and judgement is used 
to manage tax and mitigate tax uncertainty.
Stewardship – how do you engage with 
your shareholders? 
Our investor relations activities are led by the 
Group’s CEO and CFO, supported by the investor 
relations team and other members of senior 
management as appropriate. We provide the 
opportunity for significant shareholders to meet 
with the CEO and CFO twice a year around 
the interim and final results announcements. 
Shareholder feedback following these meetings is 
provided to the Board to ensure that their views 
are well understood. Our investor relations team 
organises ad-hoc meetings with management, 
manages capital markets day presentations for 
investors and analysts and maintains an ongoing 
dialogue with the financial community through 
analyst relationships. An Investor Relations report 
is covered at each Board meeting. Further details 
can be found in the Financial Responsibility 
section of the Our Core Values section of this 
report on page 19. 
In 2013, we also consulted with significant 
shareholders and investor bodies in relation to the 
approval of a new long-term share incentive plan 
(LTP) for senior management and executives. The 
LTP was approved at the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting.
The Chairman and the senior independent 
director are also available to shareholders on 
request. 
How does the Board manage risk?
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems 
of internal control and risk management which is 
fundamental to the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives. Clear risk management 
is required in all aspects of our objectives as 
outlined on page 21.

The Board has delegated some of its 
responsibilities to committees – the Safety & 
Assurance Committee (established in May 2013), 
the Nomination Committee, the Audit Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. A summary of 
the work of the Safety & Assurance, Nomination 
and Audit Committees is set out below and 
the report of the Remuneration Committee is 
included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 35-56. 
The Charters and terms of reference of the 
Board’s committees are available on the Group’s 
website. 
Attendance by directors at the meetings of the 
Board and its committees is summarised here. 
The dates of future Board meetings have now 
been agreed until the end of 2016.
“The Safety & Assurance Committee 
was established in May 2013 and 
is responsible for overseeing the 
Group’s management of Safety 
& Assurance (including personal 
security), consistent with its status  
as the Group’s top priority.” 
Thomas M Botts 
Chairman, Safety & Assurance Committee
Who is on the Safety & Assurance  
Committee?
The Committee comprises the pictured Board 
members above. Thomas M Botts is chairman 
of the Committee. Until she left the Group in 
September 2013, Trish Sentance, Group Head

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
“The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for recommending 
candidates to the Board and 
ensuring succession plans are in 
place. The Nomination Committee 
aims to promote high standards of 
corporate governance by ensuring 
the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience of the Board both now 
and in the future.” 
Allister G Langlands
Chairman, Nomination Committee
Who is on the Nomination Committee?
The Nomination Committee comprises the 
Chairman and all of the independent non-
executive directors. Neil H Smith retired from 
the Board and the Committee on 31 December 
2013.
How does the Committee discharge its 
responsibilities?
The Committee meets at least once a year, and 
has written terms of reference (which are available 
on the Group’s website) setting out its roles and 
responsibilities. 
Main responsibilities: 
• reviewing Board structure, size and 
composition
• making recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any changes
• identifying and nominating candidates for 
the approval of the Board
• filling Board vacancies
• ensuring succession plans are in place 
The Committee considered a number of 
candidates for appointment as a non-executive 
director including discussions with external 
consultants. However, given Thomas M Botts’ 
wealth of experience in the oil & gas industry 
following an outstanding career with Shell, 
no external consultant was retained or open 
advertising undertaken in connection with his 
appointment in January 2013.
Given the importance of the role of Chairman of 
the Board, the Committee carefully considered 
who should succeed Allister G Langlands, who 
will retire from the Board at the AGM on 14 
May 2014. Given Ian Marchant’s knowledge of 
the Group, having served as a non-executive 
director since 2006, latterly as senior independent 
director, the Committee considered him the 
outstanding candidate. The Committee views 
Ian’s appointment as natural evolution in the 
Group’s stewardship and that it provides good 
continuity. As a result, no external consultant 
was retained or open advertising undertaken in 
connection with his appointment which is to take 
effect at the next AGM (to be held on 14 May 
2014).
Korn/Ferry International Limited (Korn Ferry), 
an external consultant, has been retained to 
advise the Committee in connection with the 
appointment of an additional non-executive 
director with a view to them assuming the chair 
of the Audit Committee. Korn Ferry has no other 
connection with the Company.
The Committee is cognisant of the Governance 
Code’s requirement to pay due regard to the 
benefits of diversity, including gender when 
conducting a search for Board candidates. 
Wood Group is committed to remaining an equal 
opportunities employer.
The Committee met twice during 2013.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
“It has been my privilege to chair 
the Audit Committee during 2013. 
Our activities as an Audit Committee 
continue to be focused on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
financial controls and financial risk 
management, the integrity of the 
Group’s financial reporting and 
effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit processes. As a 
Committee we aim to promote high 
standards of corporate governance 
by ensuring robust and effective 
financial control.”
Ian D Marchant 
Chairman, Audit Committee
Who is on the Audit Committee? 
The Audit Committee comprises the pictured 
Board members above. 
What are the Committee’s 
responsibilities?
The Committee has written terms of reference, 
which are available on the Group’s website and 
are reviewed on an annual basis, setting out its 
roles and responsibilities, including:
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
financial controls 
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and its interim and 
preliminary announcements 
• as delegated by the Board, advising 
whether the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy
• reviewing the Company’s procedures 
for whistle blowing in relation to possible 
improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting, financial control or any other 
financial matters
• monitoring and assessing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal audit function
• reviewing the terms of engagement, 
independence and objectivity of the Group’s 
external auditors
• advising the Board on the policy with regard 
to audit tendering taking into account 
relevant regulatory requirements
• assessing the external audit process and 
the effectiveness of the external auditors to 
supply non-audit services, in accordance 
with Group policy 
• reporting to the Board any matters which 
it considers to be in need of action 
or other improvement, and making 
recommendations as to the steps to be 
taken 
Audit Committee members have been selected 
with the aim of providing the range of financial 
and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil the 
Committee’s roles and responsibilities. The Board 
considers that I have recent and relevant financial 
experience as required by the Governance Code.
How does the Committee discharge  
its responsibilities?
The Committee met four times in 2013 and 
on each occasion we invited the Group CFO, 
Group Financial Controller, Group Head 
of Internal Audit and the external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to attend. 
During the year other relevant people from the 
business were invited to attend certain meetings 
to provide deeper insight into specific issues 
and developments across the Group. The Group 
Head of Internal Audit and the external auditors 
have the right of direct access to me as Chairman 
of the Committee at all times, and to meet the 
Committee without management present. 
I report to the Board on the activity of the 
Committee as part of a separate agenda item.
During 2013 the Committee focused on the 
following areas:
Financial reporting and significant 
accounting issues
The primary areas of financial reporting 
judgement considered by the Committee in 
relation to the 2013 financial statements and how 
they were addressed are outlined below.
Review of significant contracts
In 2013, the Group worked on a small number 
of material lump sum and fixed price contracts. 
While these contracts only accounted for less 
than 10% of the Group’s revenue in 2013, the 
recognition of profit or loss on such contracts 
during the year is subject to management 
estimation. The Committee received regular 
updates on the status of lump sum and fixed 
price contracts including presentations from 
management within all three of the Group’s 
divisions. Some examples of this included an 
update from the Wood Group GTS CEO in 
August 2013 and February 2014 on the Dorad 
contract, presentations by the CFO’s of Wood 
Group Mustang and Wood Group Kenny in May 
2013 on the status of the lump sum contracting 
activity in their businesses, and an update from 
the Wood Group PSN CFO in February 2014 
on the PDO contract in Oman. The Committee 
also received written and verbal summaries of 
the work undertaken by Group Internal Audit on 
such contracts included within their annual audit 
plan. In addition, external audit assessed this as 
an area of particular focus and the Committee 
received updates on related work undertaken by 
PwC.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Carrying value of inventory
The Group holds a small number of high 
value engines for use within future gas turbine 
Engineering, Procurement and Construction 
(EPC) contracts or for resale. The carrying value 
of such engines is subject to management 
judgement and market valuation. During the year 
the Committee received updates on opportunities 
to utilise these engines on EPC projects, or sell 
engine units to our customers, which helped 
inform the discussion on any provision for 
impairment. This is also a specific area of focus 
for external audit.
Disclosure and classification of  
exceptional items
The Group has certain items which are 
separately disclosed by virtue of their size or 
incidence to enable a full understanding of the 
Group’s underlying financial performance. The 
Committee reviews those items considered 
by management to be exceptional in order to 
ensure that they meet the Group’s accounting 
policy, that the treatment of such items is 
consistent from period to period and that the 
narrative disclosures made are adequate. The 
exceptional items included in 2013 are set out 
in note 4 to the Group financial statements and 
in the Financial review on pages 12 to 14.  
Review of subjective provisions 
At each meeting the Committee receives and 
reviews a management report which includes 
details of material subjective provisions made 
in respect of items including doubtful debts, 
warranties, contract accruals, pending legal 
issues and tax related matters. The adequacy 
and appropriateness of these provisions and 
any disclosures required are discussed and 
challenged. 
Acquisitions, divestments and fair value 
adjustments 
In 2013 the Group made several acquisitions 
and a disposal which are set out in note 27 to 
the Group financial statements on pages 96 to 
98. The Committee received summaries of the 
accounting for these transactions, including 
subjective areas such as the valuation of 
intangible assets acquired, any gains or losses 
on disposal, and any subsequent fair value 
adjustments made.  
Internal financial control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. The Audit Committee 
has been delegated the responsibility to review 
the effectiveness of the internal financial control 
systems implemented by management. In 
supporting the Board we considered the process 
by which the Group evaluated its internal financial 
control environment. Our work here was primarily 
driven by regular updates from the Group Head 
of Internal Audit on the effectiveness of internal 
financial controls across each division and the 
results of the financial risk self-assessment 
process undertaken across the Group. External 
audit also provide feedback on their assessment 
of specific areas of financial control as 
appropriate during the course of their work.  
In addition, the Committee also received 
presentations in relation to the implementation 
of major IT systems underway across the Group 
during 2013 and also considered the Group’s 
treasury and tax policies and associated risks.
Internal audit
Monitoring the activity of Group Internal Audit 
is an agenda item at each Committee meeting. 
Reports from the Group Head of Internal Audit 
typically include updates on progress against 
the annual internal audit plan, a summary of the 
key matters arising from internal audit reviews, 
an update on the status of actions arising from 
the work of Group Internal Audit and updates on 
relevant regulatory matters impacting on the role 
of the Audit Committee. In addition, we receive 
summaries of investigations undertaken in relation 
to suspected fraudulent activity or ethical issues 
that have a material financial or commercial 
impact.
I hold private discussions with the Group Head 
of Internal Audit as necessary during the year 
outside the formal Committee process.
External audit
As part of the external audit process, PwC 
prepare an audit plan identifying their assessment 
of key audit risks. These risks are discussed 
during the year with input from management and 
the Group Head of Internal Audit as necessary, 
providing the Committee with an opportunity to 
challenge matters of judgement. We assess the 
effectiveness of the audit process through the 
reporting we receive from PwC at both the half 
year and year end. The Committee also review 
the standing, experience and tenure of the 
external audit lead partner, the arrangements for 
ensuring the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors, the nature and level of services 
provided, including the robustness of the external 
auditors’ handling of key judgemental areas and 
the quality of the external auditors’ interaction 
with, and reporting to, the Committee. In addition, 
we conduct an annual exercise seeking feedback 
from management on the effectiveness of the 
audit process. 
We provide an opportunity for open dialogue and 
feedback between the external auditors and the 
Committee without management being present.
Appointment and independence
The Committee has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that the external auditors’ independence 
and objectivity is not compromised.
The Committee considers the reappointment of 
the external auditor, including, when applicable, 
the rotation of the lead audit partner, each year 
and also assesses their independence on an 
ongoing basis. During the year we received 
confirmation from the external auditors regarding 
their independence. In accordance with UK 
regulations and to help ensure independence, our 
auditors adhere to a rotation policy based on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Auditing Practices 
Board standards that require the Group audit 
partner to rotate every five years. This is the first 
year that the current lead audit partner has been 
involved in the audit of the Group and I had direct 
involvement in the rotation process.
PwC have been the Group’s external auditors 
since the Group became a publicly listed 
company in 2002. Whilst the Group has not 
formally tendered the audit since then, as part 
of the Committee’s review of the objectivity and 
effectiveness of the audit process, a detailed 
assessment was undertaken in 2012 as part of 
the audit partner rotation process where it was 
decided not to put the audit engagement out 
to tender. During the year we considered the 
audit tendering provisions outlined in the revised 
Governance Code and announcements by the 
Council of the European Union on reforms within 
the audit market. Having considered the need to 
tender the external audit, to date the Committee 
has been satisfied with the effectiveness of 
the external auditors and have not considered 
it necessary to require PwC to tender for the 
external audit work.
The Committee provided the Board with 
its recommendation to shareholders on the 
reappointment of PwC as external auditors for 
the year ending 31 December 2014. Accordingly 
a resolution proposing the reappointment of 
PwC as our external auditors will be put to 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
We will continue to assess whether the Group 
should put the audit engagement out to tender 
and at present our intention is that the latest date 
such a tender exercise would be undertaken is on 
conclusion of the 2017 audit process, when the 
current lead audit partner is due to rotate. 
There are no contractual obligations that restrict 
the Group’s choice of external auditors.
Non-audit services
One of the key risks to external auditors’ 
independence is the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor. The Committee 
considers and approves fees in respect of 
non-audit services provided by the external 
auditors as appropriate for the scope of work in 
accordance with the Group’s policy in this area, 
which is set out in the Audit Committee’s terms 
of reference. The cost of non-audit services 
provided in 2013 was equivalent to 4% of 
PwC’s total fee and is reported in note 3 to the 
Group financial statements. In the opinion of 
the Committee, the provision of these non-audit 
services did not impair PwC’s independence. 
Committee evaluation
The Committee’s activities formed part of the 
external review of Board effectiveness performed 
in the year. Details of this process can be found 
on page 29. While the overall results of the Audit 
Committee effectiveness evaluation were positive, 
we have sought to improve the Committee’s 
effectiveness during the year through greater 
involvement of business personnel during Audit 
Committee meetings.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Internal control 
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. 
The Board has established an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group that has 
been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of approval of this annual report. The 
process is regularly reviewed by the Board and 
is in accordance with the revised guidance on 
internal controls published by the Turnbull Review 
Group. The Group, for the purposes of applying 
the Turnbull Review Group guidance referred to 
above, comprises John Wood Group PLC, its 
subsidiaries and joint ventures. 
Any system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The key elements of the ongoing procedures, 
which the directors have established to review the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control on 
an annual basis, are listed below. 
As a result of these ongoing procedures the 
Board’s assessment was that the internal control 
environment was operating effectively. 
Ongoing procedures
Overall control environment: 
The Group has a clear organisational structure 
for the control and monitoring of its businesses, 
including defined lines of responsibility and 
delegation of authority. The Group has issued 
policies which define the standards of business 
conduct and include Accounting Policies; 
Contract Risk Management and Review; Health, 
Safety, Security and Environment; and Business 
Ethics. A Group Business Ethics helpline, 
operated by an independent third party, is in 
place to enable staff and third parties to raise 
concerns in confidence about possible non-
compliance with the Group’s Business Ethics 
Policy. 
Monitoring of the internal control systems: 
The Board has agreed certain reporting 
procedures to monitor key risk areas on an 
ongoing basis, including safety, legal and 
financial matters. The Audit Committee has 
been delegated the responsibility to review the 
effectiveness of the internal financial control 
systems implemented by management. It is 
assisted by the internal auditors and, where 
appropriate, the external auditors. The Chairman 
of the Audit Committee regularly reports to the 
Board on their discussions. 
Information and communication: 
The Group has a comprehensive system for 
reporting performance to the Board. This includes 
monthly and quarterly reports. The quarterly 
reports include a detailed financial review against 
budgets and revised forecasts. The executive 
directors also receive detailed monthly financial 
reports and meet on a monthly basis to discuss 
financial performance and other operational 
matters. In addition, each division holds Quarterly 
Review Meetings (QRMs) involving discussions 
with senior managers and certain of the executive 
directors. The CEO and the CFO normally attend 
the QRMs. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic report on pages 5 to 20. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Financial review on pages 12 to 14. 
In addition, note 17 to the Group financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, 
its financial risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities, 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group has considerable financial resources 
together with the cash inflows generated from 
its existing activities as set out in notes 13, 15 
and 26 to the Group financial statements. As 
a consequence, the directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully. Having made the appropriate 
enquiries including a review of cash flow 
projections and key sensitivities, the directors 
consider, in accordance with the Governance 
Code, that the business is a going concern. 
Adequate resources exist for the Group to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Group and the parent company financial 
statements. 
Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
annual report, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the Group and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, 
and the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The 
Group and parent company financial statements 
are required by law to give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and the 
Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. 
In preparing those financial statements, the 
directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently 
• make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent 
• state that the Group financial statements 
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and with regard to the 
parent company financial statements that 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and to enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and, hence, for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 26 and 27, confirms 
that, to the best of their knowledge: 
• the Group financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group, and 
• the directors’ report on page 27 includes 
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces 
So far as the directors are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware. Relevant information is 
defined as ‘information needed by the Company’s 
auditors in connection with preparing their 
report’. Each director has taken all the steps that 
he ought to have taken as a director in order 
to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Letter from the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
Our Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR) this 
year follows the format laid out in the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 
which came into effect on 1 October 2013.  
Those regulations aim to improve the 
transparency of reward arrangements and to 
provide shareholders with a greater say over 
remuneration policy as it relates to company 
directors. The Board is fully supportive of 
these regulatory changes and we trust that 
shareholders welcome this new revised format.  
As a result of the above legislation, the DRR 
is now split into two parts. Part 1 covers the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy which lays out 
the Company’s proposed future policy with 
regard to directors’ remuneration and is subject 
to a binding shareholder vote which will be held 
at least every three years. This contains details 
of the proposed policy as it applies to each 
individual element of remuneration as well as 
containing scenario charts which illustrate the 
potential value of overall remuneration. Subject to 
the policy report contained in Part 1 of the DRR 
being approved by shareholders, this policy will 
become effective from the 2014 AGM. 
Part 2 of the DRR contains the Annual Report 
on Remuneration, which describes how the 
Company’s policy has been implemented in the 
previous year and how it will be implemented 
in the coming year. This includes details of all 
elements of remuneration provided to directors 
during 2013 and, as was the case previously, this 
part of the DRR is subject to an annual advisory 
vote by shareholders. 
As this is the first year the new format has 
been used to report directors’ remuneration, 
shareholders will be asked to vote on two 
separate resolutions, one in relation to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy and another in 
relation to the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
both of which I hope you will be able to support. 
Our objective continues to be to provide a 
remuneration package to attract and retain 
executive directors and senior executives of 
the necessary calibre to support the successful 
future growth of the business. We do this through 
a balance of fixed and variable pay, which we 
intend will result in competitive total remuneration 
packages that reflect performance. 
A priority for the Committee during 2013 was the 
introduction of the new Long-Term Plan (LTP) 
which replaced the Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) and Long-Term Retention Plan (LTRP) 
which was approved by shareholders at the 
2013 AGM. As described in last year’s DRR, the 
LTP covers both incentive and retention awards 
and provides a framework which we believe 
will continue to support the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic goals. For executive directors 
and senior executives, long-term incentives 
granted in 2013 will continue to vest subject to 
challenging TSR (total shareholder return), AEPS 
and, for certain participants, EBITA targets. Whilst 
there is flexibility under the LTP to incorporate 
up to 25% of the maximum award to be based 
upon clearly defined and measurable strategic 
key performance indicators this provision has not 
been utilised to date.
Group performance was good in 2013 with 
growth in EBITA of 16.1%, and in adjusted 
earnings per share (AEPS) of 15.7%, which 
contributed to annual bonuses at between 
68% and 83% of maximum being awarded to 
executive directors. The 2013 performance also 
contributed to a strong performance in the LTIP 
fourth cycle (2011 – 2013) with growth in AEPS 
over the three year cycle of 248% and TSR 
performance against selected peer companies at 
3 out of 17.  
During the year, the Committee considered the 
Chairman’s and executive directors’ remuneration 
packages for 2014. Allister Langlands’ 
remuneration from 1 January 2014 reflects his 
role as part-time, non-executive Chairman. As 
was the case in 2013, he will not participate in 
LTP and from 2014 will no longer receive pension 
accrual or annual bonus. When Bob Keiller 
was appointed Group CEO, the Committee 
determined that his salary should be modestly 
positioned with the intention to increase his salary 
to a more competitive level once he had further 
developed into the role and Allister Langlands 
had transitioned to a part-time non-executive 
Chairman role and transferred his remaining 
executive responsibilities. Following review, the 
Committee considered that Bob Keiller should 
be awarded a salary increase of 12.5% reflecting 
the progress he has made since his appointment 
and greater responsibility. Bob has accepted 
that in principle his salary should increase but for 
2014 has decided that, given the need to show 
leadership on cost saving measures, it would 
be more appropriate to defer this increase for 
12 months. The increase will now take effect 
on 1 January 2015. Robin Watson has been 
awarded a salary increase of 12.5% reflecting 
the increased scale of the Wood Group PSN 
business for which he is responsible including 
management of the Turbine joint ventures. 
Employer pension contributions to the GPP on 
behalf of Robin will also increase from 10% to 
15%. Other executive directors were awarded 
increases of 3% to base salary in line with 
employees generally. The Committee consulted 
major shareholders holding in aggregate 48% 
of the equity of the Company at that time in 
relation to the proposed salary increases and 
no objections to the proposed increases were 
received. 
In preparing the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for 2013, the Committee has endeavoured to 
provide full and clear explanations of decisions 
made and the reasons for these. At the 2014 
AGM, shareholder approval will be sought for the 
Remuneration Policy Report, which is intended 
to remain in effect for the next three years. While 
the policy reflects existing approved share plans 
and remuneration practices, it does provide 
sufficient flexibility to allow certain elements of 
the remuneration package, such as annual salary 
or the selection of annual bonus targets, to be 
adjusted to respond to changing circumstances 
and to ensure that the package continues to 
support achievement of the Group’s strategic 
goals. One change that has been included in the 
policy, is that from 2014 the part of the annual 
bonus award that is deferred for two years 
(50% of total bonus awarded), will be paid in 
shares rather than cash to further strengthen the 
alignment between executive management and 
shareholders.

Remuneration Committee 
During 2013, the Remuneration Committee comprised four independent 
non-executive directors: David K Woodward (Chairman), Michel Contie, Neil 
H Smith and Jeremy R Wilson. Neil H Smith retired on 31 December 2013. 
The Remuneration Committee advises the Board on executive remuneration 
and sets the remuneration packages of each of the executive directors. The 
Committee has a written charter which is publicly available on the Group’s 
website.
During the year, the Committee took advice from Deloitte LLP , who were 
retained as external advisors to the Committee. Deloitte LLP is a member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under 
the Code of Conduct in relation to Executive Remuneration Consulting in the 
UK. Deloitte received £60,700 for the provision of services to the Committee 
during the year. These fees consisted of core services (where the cost was 
agreed in advance) and additional services (which were charged on a time 
and materials basis). As well as advising the Remuneration Committee, 
Deloitte LLP also provided tax and global mobility advice to the Group during 
2013. The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte during 
the year and is comfortable that it has been objective and independent. The 
Committee has reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that 
there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
Where appropriate, the Committee receives input from the Chairman, Group 
CEO, Group Head of Human Resources and the Director of Compensation 
& Benefits. This input never relates to their own remuneration. The Company 
Secretary attends each of the Committee meetings in their role as Secretary 
to the Committee. 
The aim of the Committee is to establish an overall remuneration structure 
which will:
• attract, retain and motivate executives
• reflect the size and complexity of the Group’s business
• take account of executives’ individual responsibilities and geographical 
location
• clearly align remuneration with the Group’s long-term strategy in the 
pursuit of maximising shareholder value
• consider executive remuneration within the broader setting of pay 
conditions elsewhere within Wood Group
In setting remuneration policy the Committee gives full consideration to the 
relevant provisions of the Governance Code and relevant regulations enacted 
under the Companies Act 2006.
During 2013, the Committee met four times to discuss the remuneration 
issues arising and the operation of the remuneration policy. The following 
table sets out what the Committee covered at each of those meetings.

Part 1 Policy report
This part of the DRR contains the directors’ remuneration policy. In accordance with section 439A of the Companies 
Act, a binding shareholder resolution to approve this policy report will be proposed at the 2014 AGM. It is intended that 
this policy takes effect from the date of the 2014 AGM, subject to shareholder approval. 
1.1 Future policy
The tables below summarise the remuneration policy in relation to executive and non-executive directors. 
Future remuneration policy for executive directors
Element
Purpose and link to 
strategic objectives 
of the Group Remuneration Policy details
Salary To provide an 
appropriate level of 
fixed salary to attract 
and retain individuals 
with the qualities, 
skills and experience 
required to deliver our 
short and long-term 
strategic objectives.
Operation
Typically reviewed annually by the Committee, with any changes approved and effective from 1 January (although the 
Committee may make changes effective from any other date if it considers it appropriate).
Consideration is given to: 
• the scale, scope and responsibility of the individual executive’s role including any changes in responsibility;
• the skills, experience and performance of the individual;
• the  salary of individuals undertaking similar roles in companies of comparable size and complexity;
• business performance and the wider market and economic conditions; and
• the range of salary increases applying across the Group.
Having considered these items, the Committee determines appropriate levels of base salary. Executive directors based 
in the US are paid locally in US dollars.
Salary levels of current executive directors for the 2014 financial year are shown on page 49. 
Maximum opportunity
There is no prescribed maximum salary. Annual increases will normally be in line with comparable increases across the 
Group. 
Higher increases may be awarded, at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion in certain circumstances.  
For example, this may include:
• significant increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the individual’s role; or
• development of the individual within the role.
In addition, where an executive director has been appointed to the Board at a low starting salary, larger increases may 
be awarded to move them closer to salaries paid to individuals undertaking similar roles in companies of comparable 
size and complexity or other executive directors as their experience develops.

Benefits To provide market

to attract and retain 
individuals with the 
qualities, skills and 
experience required 
to deliver our strategic 
objectives. 
Operation
Benefits provided include car or car allowance, private medical insurance (or contributory health and welfare cover 
for US based executive directors), dental insurance and permanent health insurance. The types of benefits provided 
are reviewed from time to time and may be adjusted by the Committee if deemed appropriate to ensure on-going 
competitiveness.
Where executive directors are required to relocate or complete an international assignment due to business 
requirements, additional benefits such as relocation assistance or other expatriate benefits may be offered, if 
considered appropriate. Benefits may also be varied according to local practice. 
Maximum opportunity
Given the complexity of assessing the future monetary cost of some benefits, the Committee has not set an absolute 
limit on the value of benefits delivered but aims to ensure that the level of benefits provided remains, in its opinion, 
appropriate. 
Performance metrics
None. Benefits are not performance related.
Bonus To incentivise 
executives to deliver 
strategic business 
priorities for the 
financial year with 
deferred payment 
designed to provide 
additional alignment 
with shareholders and 
reinforce retention.
Operation
Bonuses are awarded annually based on performance in the relevant financial year. The performance measures which 
apply to the bonus plan are chosen by the Committee at the start of the year to ensure the Company is focused on its 
strategic objectives.  The Committee sets threshold, target and stretch objectives for each of the financial measures 
and determines the appropriate weighting for each. Stretch objectives are also set in relation to the non-financial 
element of the plan. At the end of the year, the Committee reviews actual performance against the relevant measures. 
This outcome is then considered by the Committee in the context of underlying business performance. The Committee 
is able to adjust the outcome at its discretion to ensure it is fair and appropriate, taking into account the overall 
performance of the Company. Where discretion is, or has been, used, this will be disclosed in the following year’s DRR 
as appropriate.
At least half the value of any bonus earned is subject to automatic deferral for a further period of at least two years 
and, subject to legal restrictions or adverse tax consequences in foreign jurisdictions, will be awarded as shares. 
Dividend equivalent payments will be accrued on the shares comprising the deferred bonus award prior to vesting and 
will be paid out proportionately with the award (also in shares). The vesting of any deferred bonus may be reduced 
or cancelled at the absolute discretion of the Committee. Such circumstances include a material misstatement of 
the financial results of the Company or any business unit; a material failure of risk management by the Company or a 
relevant business unit; a serious breach of health and safety standards; serious reputational damage to the Company 
or a relevant business unit; or serious misconduct or fraud by the executive. 
Details of awards to be made in 2014 are shown on page 49.
Maximum opportunity
The maximum opportunity will not exceed 200% of base salary in respect of any financial year. The 2014 bonus 
opportunity for executives will be 125% of salary.
Performance metrics
At least 50% of the maximum potential bonus is based on financial measures with the remainder being based on 
non-financial measures. The balance between financial and non-financial measures is reviewed annually and may be 
adjusted by the Committee if deemed appropriate to ensure alignment with overall Group objectives. Non-financial 
objectives are measured annually against agreed team and/or personal objectives and associated targets which are 
aimed at achieving business goals in line with the Group’s Core Values. Typically, these will include objectives linked to 
safety, risk management, business development, strategy, process improvements, working capital control and people 
development.  40

Long-
term 
incentives 
– the LTP
To reward and 
retain executives 
while aligning their 
interests with those 
of shareholders 
by incentivising 
performance over 
the longer term. 
Performance 
measures are linked to 
longer-term creation of 
shareholder value.
Operation
The LTP is the Group’s current long-term incentive plan for senior executives including executive directors and is 
based on a rolling performance cycle of at least three years. Executive directors may be granted conditional share 
awards or nil cost options over shares in the Company at the start of the cycle (or in the case of a new appointment, 
at the earliest opportunity deemed appropriate by the Committee). Awards may also be settled in cash. 
Performance is measured over a period of at least three financial years. Up to 80% of an award may vest on the 
Committee’s determination of the Group’s performance over that period.
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, to aid retention, the vesting of at least 20% of any award is normally 
deferred for a further period of at least two years (or such other period to be determined by the Committee) after the 
Committee’s determination of Group performance. The number of shares subject to award will, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, be increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid on the award shares 
that vest between grant and vesting, assuming reinvestment of the dividends in shares on a simple basis. For nil-
cost options, no shares will be awarded in lieu of dividends post-vesting (i.e. between vesting and exercise). The 
Committee reviews actual outcomes in the context of underlying business performance with the Committee able to 
adjust the outcome at its discretion and may, in its absolute discretion, choose to reduce or cancel unvested awards 
or impose further conditions on them. Such circumstances include: a material misstatement of the financial results of 
the Company or any business unit; a material failure of risk management by the Group or a relevant business unit; a 
serious breach of health and safety standards; or serious misconduct or fraud by the executive.
Awards may be amended a) in the event of any variation of share capital, demerger, delisting, special dividend rights 
issue or other event which may affect the current or future value and b) in accordance with the rules approved by 
shareholders in 2013.
Details of awards to be made in 2014 are shown on page 49.
Maximum opportunity
The maximum opportunity does not normally exceed 200% of base salary in respect of any financial year of 
the Company (with the Committee having the discretion to award up to 250% of base salary in exceptional 
circumstances). 
Where salary is materially amended during the performance period, the Committee may adjust the number of shares 
under award to reflect the salary change. 
Performance metrics
Awards made to the executive directors vest based on performance against a combination of performance measures. 
At least 25% of the award will be based on TSR and a portion of the remainder will be based on financial measures. 
During the course of a performance cycle, the Committee has the discretion to adjust the performance targets when it 
considers an amended target would be more appropriate and not materially easier to satisfy.
For ‘threshold’ levels of performance, no more than 25% of the award vests, increasing on a straight line basis to 
100% of the award for maximum performance.
Pension

To aid attraction and 
retention of individuals 
with the qualities,

Operation
New executive directors can choose to participate in the relevant local defined contribution pension arrangement 
or receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension (or a combination thereof). Payment may be up to 15% of salary, with 
Company contributions to the relevant local defined contribution pension arrangement being restricted to the limit for 
tax relief in place at the time. 
Life assurance cover of up to four times base salary (and 8 times up to a maximum of £2,500,000 for the CEO) is also 
provided. 
The level of pension provided and the associated level of life assurance cover are reviewed from time to time and may 
be adjusted by the Committee if deemed appropriate to ensure on-going competitiveness.
Maximum opportunity
For new executive directors, a maximum payment of up to 15% of base salary with life assurance cover of up to  
four times base salary capped at £1,500,000. For existing executive directors, maintenance of existing arrangements.

Historical plan – Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Operation
No further awards will be made under this plan. 
The LTIP was based on three-year rolling performance cycles. The 2011 – 2013 and the 2012 – 2014 cycles have 
still to vest; they will do so in 2014 and 2015 with deferred elements in 2016 and 2017 respectively subject to the 
achievement of relevant performance targets. 
Each cycle awarded executive directors a combination of shares and restricted shares up to a maximum of 125% of 
their base salary at the start of the cycle. The number of shares awarded was calculated using the average share price 
in the period prior to the start of the cycle and, for non-UK employees, the applicable exchange rate. 
Performance is measured over a period of at least three financial years with one-third of the award vesting at threshold 
performance. 20% of any award subsequently earned is made in forfeitable restricted shares and deferred for two 
years after vesting to aid retention, with dividends accruing during this additional holding period. 
The Committee may, in its absolute discretion, choose to reduce or cancel unpaid or unvested awards or impose 
further conditions. Such circumstances include a material misstatement of the financial results of the Company or any 
business unit; a material failure of risk management by the Company, any Group member or a relevant business unit; a 
serious breach of health and safety standards; or serious reputational damage to the Company, any Group member or 
a relevant business unit as a result of serious misconduct or fraud by the Participant.
Maximum opportunity
A maximum annual opportunity of 125% of base salary.
Performance metrics
Awards made under the previous LTIP plan to the CEO and the CFO were based on TSR and AEPS (weighted 25% 
and 75% respectively). Divisional directors were also measured on Divisional EBITA, the split of measurement being 
TSR 25%, AEPS 37.5% and Divisional EBITA 37.5%. 
Historical plan – Long-term Retention Plan (LTRP)
Operation
No further awards will be made under this plan and existing awards will vest in the ordinary course. The basis of 
the LTRP is that a bonus pool is generated annually based on the growth of the Group’s AEPS in the previous year. 
Awards under the LTRP are made wholly in the form of par value share options at a price of 4.286 pence per share. 
There is a four year vesting period before options can be exercised.
Maximum opportunity
A maximum annual opportunity of 50% of base salary.
Performance metrics
Not performance related.
Notes to the policy report for executive directors 
In drafting this section of the DRR the Committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any 
discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they 
are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed 
(i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not 
a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes 
“payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in 
relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are deemed to be agreed at 
the time the award is granted.
The performance metrics for those elements of variable remuneration which are 
subject to performance measures are chosen in light of their appropriateness to the 
objectives of the Group, and the Committee sets targets against these measures at the 
commencement of each performance cycle. During the course of a performance cycle, 
the Committee has the discretion to adjust the achievement levels required, but only so 
that the new levels are considered as demanding as those first set.
The bonus performance measures are chosen by the Committee at the start of the year 
to ensure the Group is focused on its strategic objectives, providing an appropriate 
balance between incentivising executives to meet financial targets for the year and to 
deliver specific business goals in line with the Group’s Core Values.
The Committee considers that strong performance under the LTP’s performance 
measures should result in sustainable value creation over the longer-term, which is the 
ultimate goal of our strategy. 42

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group
• The remuneration policy for executive directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration policy 
throughout the Group
• The Group aims to provide employees with remuneration packages that are market competitive within each employee’s country of employment. Where 
appropriate, employees participate in the annual bonus and LTP arrangements, with their threshold, target and maximum levels of participation being set 
by reference to their position in the organisation and the local market in which they are employed
• The remuneration policy for executive directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and long-term incentives than in the Group’s workforce 
more generally. The Committee considers this appropriate to ensure greater alignment between the reward arrangements of executive directors and the 
delivery of sustained results to shareholders

Fees and 
remuneration
To attract and retain

to provide a positive

Board.
Operation
The Chairman receives an all-inclusive remuneration payment which is reviewed annually by the Committee, with 
changes ordinarily effective from 1 January.
The fees for the non-executive directors are generally reviewed annually by the Board with increases effective from  
1 January if applicable.
Fee levels are typically set taking into account:
• the expected commitment levels and the skills and experience of the individual
• the fee levels paid to individuals undertaking similar roles in companies of comparable size and complexity
Non-executive directors can elect to be paid in either pounds sterling or in US dollars at the applicable exchange 
rate at the time of payment. Payments may be made in the form of either cash or shares.
Maximum opportunity
No prescribed maximum for directors’ fees or chairman’s remuneration although an aggregate maximum for 
directors fees of £500,000 is included in the Articles of Association.
Fees are set by the Board at a level considered appropriate to attract and retain the calibre of individual required 
but avoiding paying more than necessary for this purpose.  Fee increases may be made if considered appropriate 
in line with market movements.
Non-executive directors receive a base fee in relation to their role. Additional fees may be paid for related duties 
including the senior independent directorship and for chairing, membership and attendance of certain Board 
Committees.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1.2 Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee’s approach where the Group appoints a new executive or 
non-executive director is typically to align the remuneration package with the 
terms of the remuneration policy laid out in the relevant tables in section 1.1 
of this report. 
In the event of internal promotion to the Board any commitments made 
before promotion will continue to be honoured under this policy even if 
they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the 
commitment is fulfilled. 
As far as possible, the Committee will seek to structure all awards in line 
with the stated remuneration policy. The Committee retains the discretion 
to deviate from the stated remuneration policy to ensure the hiring of 
candidates of the appropriate calibre. For example, the Committee may 
provide additional remuneration arrangements (which may include additional 
benefits), if considered appropriate and with due regard to the best interests 
of shareholders.
To facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make one-off awards to “buy 
out” variable pay or contractual rights which an individual would forfeit on 
leaving their current employer. Any such buy-out would, where possible, 
be on a comparable basis and would take into account value, performance 
targets, the likelihood of those targets being met and vesting periods. 
Generally, buy-out awards will be made on a comparable basis to those 
forfeited. In considering its approach, the Committee will give due regard to 
all relevant factors (including quantum, the nature of remuneration and the 
jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from). 
Excluding the value of any potential buy-out, the maximum value of variable 
remuneration offered at recruitment to any new executive director will be 
450% of base salary. This is within the maximum amounts currently laid 
out in the relevant policy table detailed at section 1.1 of this report, namely 
a maximum annual bonus opportunity of up to 200% of base salary and a 
maximum LTP award of up to 250% of base salary. 
Shareholders will be provided with full details including the rationale for the 
relevant arrangements in the next published remuneration report. 
For the recruitment of a non-executive director or Chairman, remuneration 
would be provided in line with that provided to the Company’s other non-
executive directors or Chairman.

Non-executive directors have each entered into letters of engagement 
addressing remuneration, services to be provided, conflicts of interest and 
confidentiality. The letters of engagement do not have fixed terms to be paid 
and are terminable with up to 90 days’ written notice. None of the letters 
of engagement provide for predetermined amounts of compensation in the 
event of early termination and there are no further obligations contained

Notes to the charts illustrating the application of remuneration policy 
The following assumptions have been used in preparing these charts.
Minimum performance – under this scenario, it has been assumed that each executive 
director receives his base salary, benefits and pension related benefits only. 
In line with expectations (target) – under this scenario, it has been assumed 
that each executive director receives their base salary, benefits and pension. For the 
purposes of bonus, it has been assumed that annual bonus awards have been made 
at target levels and that LTP performance is such that awards have vested at threshold 
level. 
Maximum performance – under this scenario, it has been assumed that each 
executive director receives his base salary, benefits and pension. For the purposes of 
bonus, it has been assumed that annual bonus awards have been made at maximum 
levels and that LTP performance is such that awards have vested at maximum level. 
In all scenarios, fixed remuneration comprises base salary, benefits and pension. The 
figures used in preparing the charts are as follows: salary is the last confirmed salary; 
benefits is the last known figure as set out in the single figure of remuneration table at 
section 2.1 of this report; for defined benefit or defined benefit equivalent pension, the 
figure included is that set out in the single figure of remuneration table at section 2.1 of 
this report and for defined contribution pension or cash allowance in lieu of pension, 
the figure is based on the policy as laid out in the future policy table at section 1.1 of 
this report and the last confirmed salary; short-term and long-term incentives are based 
on the policy as laid out in the future policy table at section 1.1 of this report and the 
last confirmed salary. Although the LTP allows for awards of up to 200% of base salary 
(250% of base salary in exceptional circumstances), the illustration reflects potential 
awards to be made in 2014 (150% of base salary for the CEO and 125% of base salary 
for the other executives). Under the LTP , dividends accrue during the performance 
period and are paid in shares proportionately in respect of the number of shares which 
subsequently vest. For reasons of clarity, any dividend accrual has been excluded from 
the charts above. In line with the methodology outlined in the relevant legislation, no 
share price growth has been assumed for the purpose of these illustrations. 
The percentage figures contained within each of the bars illustrates the 
percentage of the total comprised by each of the parts. The figure at the end of 
each bar is the total amount represented by each bar.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1.5 Policy on payment for loss of office 
It is the Company’s policy for all executive directors to have service 
contracts which can be terminated by the director or by the Company on 6 
months’ notice, except in the case of the CEO and CFO or where historical 
agreements are in place when 12 months’ notice applies. 
On termination of service contracts by the Group, in certain circumstances 
executive directors are entitled to the payment of their remuneration, subject 
to a general duty to mitigate their loss. There are no specific provisions 
under which executive directors are entitled to receive compensation upon 
early termination, other than in accordance with the notice period. Executive 
directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the 
Company or termination with a payment in lieu of notice, at the Company’s 
discretion.
The Committee’s policy in respect of the different elements of remuneration 
for executive directors leaving under different scenarios is as follows:
Payment “Good” leaver Other leaver 
Base salary, pension 
and benefits
Paid up to the date of leaving, including any untaken holidays and, subject to mitigation, 
payment in lieu of notice where the Company considers it inappropriate for a departing 
executive director to work the required notice period.
Disbursements such as legal costs, outplacement may be considered.
Paid for the proportion of the 
notice period worked.
Annual bonus For reason of injury, disability, ill-health, retirement, sale of employing entity out of the Group and 
in such circumstances as the Committee may determine otherwise (including redundancy):
• Paid up to the date of leaving based on completed months worked in the year with 
payment made on normal payment date once plan outcomes are known 
• Any deferred amounts from previous years which are not yet paid are paid at the normal 
payment date for such deferrals
On death, an immediate payment may be made, at the discretion of the Committee, taking into 
account performance and the proportion of the relevant bonus year served. Deferred bonus 
amounts will vest in full at the time of death. 
No entitlement to any award for 
the current year and the forfeit 
of any deferred awards from 
previous years not yet paid.
Long-term incentives For reason of injury, disability, ill-health, sale of employing company or business or, for any other 
reason determined by the Committee: 
• Unless the Committee determines otherwise, where the executive director has completed 
the required period of service set by the Committee (normally 18 months from the start of 
the performance period) then awards will vest on a proportionate basis as if the participant 
had not ceased office or employment unless the Committee determines that awards 
should vest as soon as practicable following cessation
• The number of shares that vest in these circumstances shall be determined by the 
Committee taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
satisfied and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of time elapsed 
since grant
• For US executives who have completed the required period of service set by the 
Committee (normally 18 months from the start of the performance period), where 
cessation of employment occurs before the Committee’s assessment of the performance 
condition, awards will vest on the date of such termination, unless the Committee 
determines awards should vest as soon as practicable following cessation of employment
On death, unless the Committee determines otherwise, where the executive has completed the 
required qualifying period of service set by the Committee (normally 18 months from the start 
of the performance period), unvested awards vest to the extent determined by the Committee 
taking into account the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied and, if the 
Committee considers it appropriate, the period that has elapsed since grant. 
All existing awards lapse.  46
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1.6 Change of control
In the event of a change of control, vesting of awards (shares and/or cash) 
under the Company’s short- and long-term incentive plans depends on the 
extent to which performance conditions have been met at that time. Time 
pro-rating may be disapplied if the Committee considers it appropriate given 
the circumstances of the change of control.
In the event the Company is wound up or if there is a demerger, delisting, 
special dividend or other event that may materially affect the current or 
future value of shares, the Committee may determine that awards may vest 
depending on the extent to which performance conditions have been met at 
that time.
1.7 Consideration of employment conditions  
elsewhere in the Group
The Committee is mindful of pay and conditions in the wider workforce 
within the Group and is kept informed on the pay and benefits provided 
to employees below the level of executive director by the Group Head of 
Human Resources, including any relevant information received via employee 
feedback. One particular factor considered by the Committee when 
reviewing the base salary increases for executive directors is the range of 
base pay increases which apply elsewhere in the Group. 
Given the size of the Group and the way remuneration practice varies by 
jurisdiction, the Committee did not consider it appropriate to consult with 
employees across the Group on the remuneration policy for directors or to 
use any other remuneration comparison measurements linked to the pay 
and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Group when 
determining the quantum and structure of the directors’ remuneration. 
1.8 Consideration of shareholders views 
The Committee’s policy is that shareholder consultation will take place 
in advance of any material change being proposed to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy as described above. A summary of any such 
consultation and the Company’s response to substantive points raised will 
be included in this section in future years.

Notes to the single figure of remuneration (chairman and executive directors) 
(a) Salary received during the year.
(b) Taxable benefits received during the year. Taxable benefits include company car or 
car allowance, private medical, dental and contributory health and welfare cover as 
applicable. For those directors based in the US, the cost of benefits reflects the amounts 
that would be chargeable to UK income tax if the director were resident in the UK for tax 
purposes. 
(c) Bonus awarded in relation to the year inclusive of all amounts subject to further 
deferral. 
The bonus performance measures at maximum were split between financial (70%) and 
non-financial (30%) measures. The financial measures consisted of EBITA and DSO 
weighted 70% and 30% respectively. Non-financial measures consisted of personal 
objectives. No payment is made against EBITA performance if EBITA is 85% or less of 
target, with the maximum payment being made under this element (61.25% of base 
salary) when EBITA is 15% above target. No payment is made against DSO performance 
if DSO is 110% or more of target, with the maximum payment being made under this 
element (26.25% of base salary) when DSO is 10% better than target. A maximum 
payment of 37.5% of base salary is made in respect of performance against personal 
objectives. Reporting of the specific financial and non-financial targets is considered 
commercially sensitive and the Committee has therefore concluded it would not be in the 
Company’s interest to do so. 
In 2013, Group EBITA actual performance was 98.2% of target with DSO actual 
performance at 105.4% of target producing a payment of 47.1% of base salary in 
respect of the financial measures. Performance against personal objectives varied by 
each director with payments under this element ranging from 27.5% to 31% of base 
salary. 50% of the total bonus was deferred into cash for a further two years with 
continued employment a requirement to receive payment other than for those classified 
as good leavers. 
In 2012, Group EBITA actual performance was 102.6% of target with OCER actual 
performance at 100.8% of target producing a payment of 64% of base salary in respect 
of the financial measures. Performance against personal objectives varied by each 
director with payments under this element ranging from 28.7% to 34.3% of base salary. 
50% of the total bonus was deferred into cash for a further 2 years with continued 
employment a requirement to receive payment other than for those classified as good 
leavers. 
(d) The value of long-term incentives which vested in respect of performance periods 
ending during the year inclusive of all amounts subject to further deferral. Calculated 
using the closing mid-market share price on 31 December 2013 of £6.86.
2013 - this figure relates to awards under the LTIP 2011-2013 cycle which vested at 
31 December 2013. The LTIP performance measures were split between TSR and 
AEPS (weighted 25% and 75% respectively) for the CEO and CFO. Divisional directors 
were also measured on Divisional EBITA, the split of measurement being TSR 25%, 
AEPS 37.5% and Divisional EBITA 37.5%. Maximum awards under the 2011-2013 
cycle were 125% of base salary at the start of the cycle. No awards are made for 
less than the ‘threshold’ performance for AEPS and Divisional EBITA (where relevant), 
or 50th percentile for TSR. On reaching the ‘threshold’ or 50th percentile, one-third 
of the AEPS and Divisional EBITA or TSR-related element becomes payable and on 
reaching the ‘maximum’ performance, or 75th percentile, 100% of the AEPS or TSR 
element becomes payable. For achievement level between ‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’ 
or between the 50th and 75th percentile performance the allocation is on a straight line 
basis. The TSR of the Group is compared to a peer group comprising Aker Solutions, 
AMEC, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, Fluor, Foster Wheeler, Jacobs Engineering, 
KBR, McDermott, Petrofac, Saipem, SBM Offshore, Sulzer, Technip, Weir Group, Worley 
Parsons and WS Atkins. The AEPS targets for the 2011-2013 cycle were set at 82.5 
cents at the ‘threshold’ and 90.0 cents at the ‘maximum’. The relevant Divisional EBITA 
targets were set consistently with the AEPS target. Reporting of the specific detail 
relating to Divisional EBITA is considered commercially sensitive and the Committee has 
therefore concluded it would not be in the Company’s interest to do so. The actual AEPS 
achieved was 98.6 cents and Wood Group was ranked 3rd out of 17 companies for TSR  48
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
purposes resulting in 100% award on AEPS and TSR measures. 20% of the long-term 
incentive amount was deferred for two years to aid retention with continued employment 
a requirement to receive payment other than for those classified as good leavers. 
2012 - this figure relates to awards under the LTIP 2010-2012 cycle which vested at 
31 December 2012. The LTIP performance measures were split between TSR and 
AEPS (weighted 25% and 75% respectively) for the CEO and CFO. Divisional directors 
were also measured on Divisional EBITA, the split of measurement being TSR 25%, 
AEPS 37.5% and Divisional EBITA 37.5%. Maximum awards under the 2010-2012 
cycle were 125% of base salary at the start of the cycle. No awards are made for 
less than the ‘threshold’ performance for AEPS and Divisional EBITA (where relevant), 
or 50th percentile for TSR. On reaching the ‘threshold’ or 50th percentile, one-third 
of the AEPS and Divisional EBITA or TSR-related element becomes payable and on 
reaching the ‘maximum’ performance, or 75th percentile, 100% of the AEPS or TSR 
element becomes payable. For achievement level between ‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’ 
or between the 50th and 75th percentile performance the allocation is on a straight line 
basis. The TSR of the Group is compared to a peer group comprising Aker Solutions, 
AMEC, Baker Hughes, Cameron International, Fluor, FMC, Foster Wheeler, Halliburton, 
Jacobs Engineering, KBR, National Oilwell Varco, Petrofac, Saipem, SBM Offshore, 
Schlumberger, Sulzer, Technip, Weatherford International, The Weir Group and Worley 
Parsons. The AEPS targets for the 2010-2012 cycle were set at 43.8 cents at the 
‘threshold’ and 49.4 cents at the ‘maximum’. The relevant Divisional EBITA targets 
were set consistently with the AEPS target. Reporting of all the specific detail relating to 
Divisional EBITA is considered commercially sensitive and the Committee has therefore 
concluded it would not be in the Company’s interest to do so. The actual AEPS 
achieved was 85.2 cents and Wood Group was ranked 2nd out of 21 companies for 
TSR purposes resulting in a maximum award on AEPS and TSR measures. 20% of the 
long-term incentive amount was deferred for two years to aid retention with continued 
employment a requirement to receive payment other than for those classified as good 
leavers. 
(e) Pension figure reflects cash value of Defined Contribution pension contribution or 
cash alternative or, for defined benefits style arrangements, figures are calculated in 
accordance with the basis set out in The Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. Further detail in relation 
to individual pension arrangements is provided in section 2.2 on page 50.
(f) The single figure of remuneration, being the sum of columns (a) to (e) inclusive. 
(g) Allister G Langlands was appointed Chairman at 1 November 2012. His 
remuneration for 2012 largely reflects his previous role as Group CEO which he 
held up until his appointment as Chairman. As reported to shareholders in the 2012 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, his remuneration in 2013 reflected his significant time 
commitment to the Group in providing necessary continuity at the top level following his 
appointment as Chairman. From 1 January 2014, the Chairman’s remuneration is in line 
with comparable part-time non-executive Chairman roles. 
(h) Bob Keiller was appointed Group CEO at 1 November 2012. His remuneration for 
2012 largely reflects his previous role as Wood Group PSN CEO which he held up until 
his appointment as Group CEO. 
(i) Both Alan G Semple and Mark S Dobler are based in the US and receive their 
remuneration in US dollars. All figures relating to these individuals in the above table are 
therefore expressed in US dollars. 
(j)  Mark S Dobler stepped down from the Board on 9 October 2013 to lead the 
proposed joint venture with Siemens AG therefore his details reflect the period up to this 
date.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the 
following financial year
This section provides an overview of how the Committee will implement the 
remuneration policy in 2014, which will be in line with the details outlined in 
the future policy tables provided at section 1.1 of this report. 
Base salary
The table below shows base salaries for 2013 and 2014.
2013 annual  
base salary 
Annual base 
salary from  
1 January 2014 % increase
Bob Keiller £560,000 £560,000* 0%
Alan G Semple $634,000 $653,500 3%
Robin Watson £336,400 £378,500 12.5%
Mike Straughen £336,400 £346,500 3%
*The Remuneration Committee awarded Bob Keiller an increase of 12.5% to 
GBP 630,000 with effect from 1 January 2014 to reflect his assumption of the full 
responsibilities and development in the CEO role. After due consideration, Bob decided 
that given the need to show leadership on cost saving measures he would defer the 
approved increase for 12 months. 
Benefits
The current executives will continue to participate in their existing benefit 
arrangements as stated in the future policy table.
Pension
The current executives will continue to participate in their existing benefit 
arrangements as stated in the future policy table, except for Robin Watson 
who will receive an increase to 15% employer contribution from 1 January 
2014.
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the executives will remain at 
125% of salary in 2014.
The table below provides further information on the performance measures 
against which performance will be measured.
Relative weighting
(% of bonus opportunity)
Financial measures 60%
EBITDA 50%
DSO 10%
Personal measures 40%
For 2014, the threshold EBITA performance required for a payment under 
this bonus element will be set at 90% of target. Once 90% of EBITA target is 
achieved, bonus starts to accrue. Maximum payment against this element is 
made when EBITA is 10% above budget. 
No payment is made against Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) performance 
if DSO is 10% worse than target. Maximum payment against this element 
is made when DSO is 10% better than target. DSO is a key contributing 
factor to cash flow and the Committee believes incentivising management to 
reduce DSO remains the best route to drive improvement in cash flow.
Non-financial objectives are measured annually against agreed personal 
objectives and associated targets which are aimed at the achievement of 
the Group’s business goals in line with the its core values. For 2014, this 
will consist of personal objectives including objectives related to safety, and 
positioning for future growth.
LTP
Awards of up to 125% of salary (150% to the CEO) will be made to executive 
directors. 
Awards made to the CEO and the CFO will be based on TSR and AEPS 
(weighted 25% and 75% respectively). Divisional directors will also be 
measured on Divisional EBITA, the split of measurement being TSR 25%, 
AEPS 25% and Divisional EBITA 50%. 
The performance measures have been chosen in light of their 
appropriateness to the objectives of the Group, and targets are set against 
these measures at the commencement of each performance cycle. During 
the course of a performance cycle, the Committee has the discretion to 
adjust the achievement levels, but only so that the new levels are considered 
as demanding as those first set. 
The TSR of the Group is compared to a peer group comprising the following 
engineering/construction and support services companies – Aker Solutions, 
AMEC, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, Fluor, Foster Wheeler, Jacobs 
Engineering, KBR, McDermott, Petrofac, Saipem, SBM Offshore, Sulzer, 
Technip, The Weir Group, Worley Parsons and WS Atkins. 
No awards are made for less than the ‘threshold’ performance for AEPS 
and Divisional EBITA (where relevant), or 50th percentile for TSR. On 
reaching the ‘threshold’ or 50th percentile, 25% of the AEPS, Divisional 
EBITA or TSR-related element becomes payable and on reaching the 
‘maximum’ performance for AEPS and Divisional EBITA (where relevant), 
or 75th percentile for TSR, 100% of the AEPS, Divisional EBITA  or TSR 
element becomes payable. For achievement level between ‘threshold’ and 
‘maximum’ for AEPS and Divisional EBITA, or between the 50th and 75th 
percentile performance for TSR, the allocation is on a straight line basis.

cover of four times basic salary up to a maximum of £1,200,000.
Pension benefits provided to US-based executive directors
Mark S Dobler participates in the Wood Group 401k plan, which is a defined contribution scheme. A Company contribution of 5% of base salary is provided 
based on his personal contribution. In 2012, he did not participate in any Company pension plan and did not receive any cash payment in lieu of pension 
provision. He is provided with life assurance cover of $1,200,000.
Alan G Semple is provided with a pension arrangement of a defined benefit nature, providing an equivalent level of benefits to that provided in the John Wood 
Group PLC Retirement Benefit Scheme. If he dies in pensionable service, his surviving spouse or dependants are entitled to a pension of half of the pension 
that would have been received at normal retirement date based on the final pensionable salary at the date of death. Final pensionable salary is capped from 6 
April 2012 at $640,599 per annum, increasing at RPI plus 1.25% and he is provided with life assurance cover of approximately four times basic salary. Alan G 
Semple’s defined benefit pension arrangement will cease at the end of June 2014, and Alan G Semple will then receive a 15% p.a. contribution to a pension 
arrangement.

CEO and vested based on performance targets linked to performance of that division.
(b) Allister Langlands was appointed Chairman on 1 November 2012. His remuneration 
for 2012 relates to his time as Group CEO only. 
2.8 Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The following table provides a summary of the increases in remuneration 
for the Group CEO as compared with the average increase for all other UK 
based employees in the Group.

Notes to the percentage change in CEO remuneration 
(a) The position of Group CEO changed in November 2012, therefore for comparison 
purposes, the change figures are based on pro-rated salary, benefits and bonus for 2012 
for Allister G Langlands and Bob Keiller for 2012, with the comparison measured against 
Bob Keiller for the entirety of 2013. There was no increase in Bob Keiller’s CEO salary 
from 2012 to 2013.
(b) Given the wide variation in inflation rates across the various geographies in which the 
Group operates, the comparator group used is all other UK based employees to ensure 
a valid comparison is provided. UK based employees constitute approximately 31% of 
the overall workforce. Benefits increase is based on a sample employee on a salary of 
£50,000 per annum with the full suite of employee benefits including private medical and 
dental insurance; and life and permanent health insurance. 
(c) Average bonus increase is based on average bonus paid as a percentage of 
salary during 2012 for the noted comparator group against average bonus paid as a 
percentage of salary during 2013.

Report on the Group financial statements 
Our opinion
In our opinion the Group financial statements, defined below:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the  
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of 
this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements, which are prepared by John Wood Group 
PLC, comprise:
• the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2013;
• the Consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive 
income for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated statement of changes in equity and Consolidated cash 
flow statement for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include the accounting 
policies and other related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). An audit involves obtaining 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”) to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Group financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach 
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a 
whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the 
Group financial statements as a whole to be $22m, which is based on the 
Group’s profit before tax.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group has three divisions; Wood Group PSN; Wood Group Engineering; 
and Wood Group GTS, spread across 50 countries. The Group financial 
statements are a consolidation of the reporting units within these divisions 
and centralised functions. 
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the 
type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting units by us, as the 
group engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK, from other 
PwC network firms and other firms operating under our instruction. Where 
the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of 
involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to 
be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a 
whole. 
Through a combination of full scope audits and directed scope procedures 
we performed work at the Group’s principal reporting units. This, together 
with additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us the 
evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a 
whole.

Independent auditor’s report continued
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both.
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of focus 
identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that they considered to be significant 
issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on page 32.
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Significant Lump Sum, Fixed Price and Engineering, Procurement 
and Construction (EPC) Contracts
We have focused on this area as the Group has a small number of 
contracts on which the profit or loss is recognised subject to management 
estimation. Management’s evaluation of whether contacts are onerous also 
relies on management judgement. 
In 2013, lump sum, fixed price and EPC contracts made up less than 
10% of revenue. Discussions were held with both senior management and 
operational staff to update our understanding and to establish the future 
outlook of these major contracts. We tested the inputs (costs incurred and 
billed) along with the revenue and profit then recognised, as well as the 
basis for provision for losses and assessment of whether the contracts are 
onerous.
Valuation of GTS engines
The Group holds engines with a view to resale or use within EPC contracts. 
Given the nature of the engines and the lack of recent sales there is 
potential for overstatement on the valuation of inventory. 
We evaluated the carrying value of the engines by challenging 
management’s forecast and assumptions as it relates to existing and new 
opportunities to sell the engines. 
We obtained external market data to corroborate the valuation of the 
engines. 
Current and deferred tax balances
The Group operates in a number of different tax regimes and must comply 
with various corporate tax regulations in the countries in which they 
operate.
Our focus on this area was specifically on the completeness of the 
provision for uncertain tax positions and the recognition of current and 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and their impact on the effective tax rate.
We tested the Group tax provision and the calculation of the provisions for 
a number of significant entities, as well as the judgements surrounding the 
basis for deferred tax assets and liabilities. This included deferred tax assets 
relating to share-based compensation and the pension scheme. We also 
tested the basis for significant uncertain tax positions. Additionally, we held 
discussions with Group management including the in-house tax specialists 
to identify any significant tax compliance issues.
Areas of focus – Significant risks prescribed by Auditing Standards How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Fraud in revenue recognition
Auditing standards require that we consider the risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition. We have focused on the potential manipulation of revenue by 
the manual posting of journal entries on top of the day-to-day recording of 
transactions.
We tested the timing of revenue recognition taking into account contractual 
obligations and validity of manual journal entries. We also tested the 
revenue from significant Engineering, Procurement and Construction 
contracts, which are subject to management’s estimates.
Management override of controls 
Auditing standards require that we consider the risk that management may 
override controls within their organisation. 
Employees in management positions are incentivised by financial 
performance measures and as a result, fraud risk, due to over-ride of 
controls and/or manipulation of results may be increased.
We tested key reconciliations and manual journal entries. We considered 
whether there was evidence of bias by the directors in the significant 
accounting estimates and judgements relevant to the financial statements. 
We also assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including 
the arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions, and 
interviewed senior management and the Group’s internal audit function. 58
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, 
set out on page 34, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it 
is appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the 
Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors 
intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements 
were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use 
of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these 
statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Opinion on matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Review and the Directors 
Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law have not been made, and under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration. We have no exceptions to report arising from these 
responsibilities.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the Parent Company’s compliance with 
nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
Within the Annual Report, as required by the Code Provision C.1.1, the 
directors state that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for members to assess the Group’s performance, business model and 
strategy. As required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee has set out 
the significant issues that it considered in relation to the financial statements, 
and how they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
• the statement given by the directors is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; 
or
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us 
to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Group financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements 
of John Wood Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013 and on 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the financial statements 
for the year to 31 December 2013
General information
John Wood Group PLC, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, provide services to the oil and gas and power generation industries worldwide. Details of the 
Group’s activities during the year are provided in the Strategic Report. John Wood Group PLC is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in 
Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement. 
Significant accounting policies 
The Group’s significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently 
applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements are the result of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings from the date of 
acquisition or up until the date of divestment as appropriate. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies and generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The Group’s interests in joint ventures are accounted 
for using proportional consolidation. Under this method the Group includes its share of each joint venture’s income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows 
on a line by line basis in the consolidated financial statements. Transactions between Group subsidiaries are eliminated and transactions between the Group 
and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture. All Group companies apply the Group’s accounting policies and 
prepare financial statements to 31 December.
At 31 December 2013, certain Wood Group GTS assets and liabilities that are being transferred into a new joint venture with Siemens, which is currently 
anticipated to take place in the first half of 2014, have been shown as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Group balance sheet. Assets held for sale 
are recorded at the lower of cost and fair value. The 2012 and 2013 trading activity for the relevant entities has been presented as profit from discontinued 
activities in the Group income statement, the 2012 income statement having been restated accordingly. See note 27 for further details.
Critical accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge 
of the amount, event or actions and actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions that could result in a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are addressed below.
(a) Impairment of goodwill
The Group carries out impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. 
In addition, the Group carries out an annual impairment review. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than the 
carrying amount. The impairment tests are carried out by CGU (“Cash Generating Unit”) and reflect the latest Group budgets. The budgets are based on 
various assumptions relating to the Group’s businesses including assumptions relating to market outlook, resource utilisation, foreign exchange rates, contract 
awards and contract margins. The outlook for the Group is discussed in the CEO Review. Pre-tax discount rates of between 11% and 13% have been used to 
discount the CGU cash flows and a sensitivity analysis has also been performed (see note 8). 
(b) Revenue recognition
Revenue on fixed price or lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed price long-term service agreements is recognised according to 
the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs. Estimating the 
costs to completion and therefore the total contract costs is a key judgment in respect of the revenue recognition on these contracts.
(c) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. The Group 
recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters is different 
from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such 
determination is made.
(d) Retirement benefit liabilities
The value of the Group’s retirement benefit liabilities is determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions will 
impact the carrying value of the liability. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate to be used in the actuarial valuation at the end of each financial 
year following consultation with the retirement benefit scheme actuary. In determining the rate used, consideration is given to the interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity similar to those of the related retirement benefit obligation. 
See note 29 for further details.
(e) Provisions
The Group records provisions where it has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Where the outcome is less than probable, but more than remote, 
no provision is recorded but a contingent liability is disclosed in the financial statements, if material. The recording of provisions is an area which requires the 
exercise of management judgement relating to the nature, timing and probability of the liability and typically the Group’s balance sheet includes provisions for 
doubtful debts, inventory and warranty provisions, contract provisions (including onerous contracts) and pending legal issues.  Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the financial statements continued
Accounting policies (continued)
Functional currency
The Group’s earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the principal functional currency is the US dollar, being the most representative currency of the Group. 
The Group’s financial statements are therefore prepared in US dollars.
The following exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts:
2013 2012
Average rate £1 = $ 1.5673 1.5845
Closing rate £1 = $ 1.6563 1.6255
Foreign currencies
Income statements of entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange for the period and 
assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of net 
assets in such entities held at the beginning of the year, together with those differences resulting from the restatement of profits and losses from average to 
year end rates, are taken to the currency translation reserve. 
In each individual entity, transactions in overseas currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Where more than one exchange rate is available, the appropriate rate at which assets can be readily realised and liabilities can be extinguished is 
used. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Any exchange 
differences are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the 
exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate ruling 
on the date it was raised.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. 
Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably. Revenue from services is recognised as the services are rendered, including where they are based on contractual rates per man hour 
in respect of multi-year service contracts. Incentive performance revenue is recognised upon completion of agreed objectives. Revenue from product sales is 
recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally upon delivery of products and customer 
acceptance, if any. Revenue is stated net of sales taxes (such as VAT) and discounts. 
Revenue on fixed price or lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed price long-term service agreements is recognised according to 
the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs. An estimate of 
the profit attributable to work completed is recognised, on a basis that the directors consider to be appropriate, once the outcome of the contract can be 
estimated reliably, which is when a contract is not less than 20% complete. Expected losses are recognised in full as soon as losses are probable. The net 
amount of costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less the sum of recognised losses and progress billings is disclosed within trade receivables/trade 
payables.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the 
Group’s financial performance. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include gains and losses on divestment of businesses, write downs 
or impairments of assets including goodwill, restructuring costs or provisions, litigation settlements, provisions for onerous contracts and acquisition and 
divestment costs.
Finance expense/income
Interest income and expense is recorded in the income statement in the period to which it relates. Arrangement fees in respect of the Group’s borrowing 
facilities are amortised over the period which the Group expects the facility to be in place. Interest relating to the unwinding of the discount on deferred and 
contingent consideration liabilities is included in finance expense. Interest relating to the Group’s retirement benefit scheme is also included as finance income/
expense.
Dividends
Dividends to the Group’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim dividends are 
recognised when paid.
Goodwill 
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Acquisition costs are expensed in 
the income statement.  66
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Accounting policies (continued)
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future economic benefits 
attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately identifiable and there is control over the use of the asset. 
Where the Group acquires a business, intangible assets on acquisition such as customer contracts are identified and evaluated to determine the carrying value 
on the acquisition balance sheet. Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Software and development costs  3-5 years
Intangible assets on acquisition  3-10 years 
Property plant and equipment
Property plant and equipment (PP&E) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. No depreciation is charged with respect to freehold 
land and assets in the course of construction. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 25-50 years 
Short leasehold buildings  period of lease 
Plant and equipment   3-10 years
When estimating the useful life of an asset group, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the durability of the assets, the intensity at which the 
assets are expected to be used and the expected rate of technological developments. Asset lives and residual values are assessed at each balance sheet 
date.
Impairment
The Group performs impairment reviews in respect of PP&E and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. In addition, the Group carries out annual impairment reviews in respect of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognised when 
the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount. 
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit (“CGU”). The CGUs are aligned to the structure the Group 
uses to manage its business. Cash flows are discounted in determining the value in use.
Inventories
Inventories, which include materials, work in progress and finished goods and goods for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Service 
based businesses’ inventories consist of spare parts and other consumables. Serialised parts are costed using the specific identification method and other 
materials are generally costed using the first in, first out method. Product based businesses determine cost by weighted average cost methods using standard 
costing to gather material, labour and overhead costs. These costs are adjusted, where appropriate, to correlate closely the standard costs to the actual costs 
incurred based on variance analysis. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated selling expenses. 
Allowance is made for obsolete and slow-moving items, based upon annual usage.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and other short-term bank deposits with maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included 
within borrowings in current liabilities. Where the Group uses pooling arrangements with a right of set-off, overdrafts and cash are netted and included in the 
appropriate category depending on the net position of the pool.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision 
for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The provision is determined by reference to previous experience of recoverability for 
receivables in each market in which the Group operates. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Deferred and contingent consideration 
Where it is probable that deferred or contingent consideration is payable on the acquisition of a business based on an earn out arrangement, an estimate 
of the amount payable is made at the date of acquisition and reviewed regularly thereafter, with any change in the estimated liability being reflected in the 
income statement. Changes in the estimated liability in respect of acquisitions completed before 31 December 2009 are reflected in goodwill. Where deferred 
consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Accounting policies (continued)
Taxation
The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from the profit reported in the income statement due to items that are not taxable or deductible in any period and also due to items that are taxable or 
deductible in a different period. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation on PP&E, tax losses carried forward and, in 
relation to acquisitions, the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired and their tax base. Tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the 
balance sheet date are used to determine deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be 
utilised.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of 
recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. 
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge);  
(2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations (net investment hedge).
Where hedging is to be undertaken, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the inception of the 
transaction, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both 
at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair 
values or cash flows of the hedged items. The Group performs effectiveness testing on a quarterly basis.
(a) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in administrative expenses in the income statement, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
(b) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the hedging reserve in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses (in the case of forward contracts) or finance 
income/expense (in the case of interest rate swaps) in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in 
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in 
equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
(c) Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to 
the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in administrative expenses in the 
income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
(d) Derivatives that are not designated as hedges
Certain derivatives, whilst providing effective economic hedges are not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are 
not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of their estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts 
is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are obtained from 
valuations provided by financial institutions. 
The carrying values of trade receivables and payables approximate to their fair values. 
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group 
for similar financial instruments.

Operating leases
As lessee
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received and 
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the period of lease.
As lessor
Operating lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Retirement benefit liabilities
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a number of defined contribution schemes. The liability recognised in respect of the defined benefit scheme 
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the scheme assets. The assets of this scheme are held in separate trustee 
administered funds. 
The defined benefit scheme’s assets are measured using fair values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured annually by an independent actuary using 
the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability. The 
increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit scheme expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to 
operating profit. The interest income on scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities arising from the 
passage of time are included in finance income/expense. Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full in 
the period in which they occur. The defined benefit scheme’s net assets or net liabilities are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Provisions 
Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services still under warranty, including claims already received, based on past experience. 
Other provisions are recognised where the Group is deemed to have a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Where amounts provided are payable after more than one year the 
estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Share based charges relating to employee share schemes
The Group has a number of employee share schemes:
(i) Share options granted under Executive Share Option Schemes (‘ESOS’) are granted at market value. A charge is booked to the income statement as 
an employee benefit expense for the fair value of share options expected to be exercised, accrued over the vesting period. The corresponding credit is taken 
to retained earnings. The fair value is calculated using an option pricing model.
(ii) Share options granted under the Long Term Retention Plan (‘LTRP’) are granted at par value. The charge to the income statement for LTRP shares 
is also calculated using an option pricing model and, as with ESOS grants, the fair value of the share options expected to be exercised is accrued over the 
vesting period. The corresponding credit is also taken to retained earnings.
(iii) The Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for executive directors and certain senior executives was in place from 2008 to 2012. Participants 
are awarded shares or share options dependent on the achievement of performance targets. The charge to the income statement for shares awarded under 
the LTIP is based on the fair value of those shares at the grant date, spread over the vesting period. The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings. 
For those awards that have a market related performance measure, the fair value of the market related element is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation 
model.
(iv) The Group’s Long Term Cash Incentive Plan (‘LTCIP’) for senior management was in place in 2011 and 2012. Participants are paid a cash bonus 
dependent on the achievement of performance targets. The charge to the income statement is based on the fair value of the awards and is linked to 
movements in the Group’s share price. The charge is spread over the vesting period with the corresponding credit being recorded in liabilities.
(v) During 2013, the Group introduced the Long Term Plan (‘LTP’) to replace the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP. The LTP comprises two separate awards, an 
award of share options on a similar basis to the LTRP and an award of shares or share options on a broadly similar basis to the LTIP scheme. The charge to 
the income statement for the LTP is as outlined for the LTRP and LTIP above with the corresponding credit being recorded in retained earnings.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Share capital
John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are classified as equity. Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability or 
charged to equity until they have been approved by shareholders. 
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts, therefore they have been consolidated in the 
financial statements of the Group. Shares acquired by and disposed of by the employee share trusts are recorded at cost. The cost of shares held by the 
employee share trusts is deducted from equity.

Segmental reporting
The Group has determined that its operating segments are based on management reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’),  
the Group’s Chief Executive. The Group’s reportable segments are Wood Group Engineering, Wood Group PSN and Wood Group GTS. 
The Chief Executive measures the operating performance of these segments using ‘EBITA’ (Earnings before interest, tax and amortisation). Operating 
segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reports provided to the Chief Executive who is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Wood Group Engineering offers a wide range of engineering services to the upstream, subsea and pipelines, downstream and industrial, and clean energy 
sectors. These include conceptual studies, engineering, project and construction management (‘EPCM’) and control system upgrades. Wood Group PSN 
offers life of field support to producing assets through brownfield engineering and modifications, production enhancement, operations and management, 
training, maintenance management and abandonment services. Wood Group GTS is an independent provider of rotating equipment services and solutions 
for clients in the power and oil and gas markets. These services include power plant engineering, procurement and construction; facility operations and 
maintenance; and repair, overhaul, optimisation and upgrades of gas and steam turbines, pumps, compressors and other high speed rotating equipment. 
Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards
(a) Amended standards and interpretations 
The following revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory as of 1 January 2013:
• IAS 1 (amended 2012) ‘Financial statement presentation’ 
• IAS 19 (revised 2011) ‘Employee benefits’ 
• IFRS 13 (amended 2012) ‘Fair value measurement’
The amendments to IAS 1 relates to other comprehensive income. The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group 
items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification 
adjustments). The amendments do not address which items are presented in OCI.
The revision to IAS 19 does not have a material impact on the financial statements. The revision has been adopted in the current period and has resulted in 
an increase of $2.5m in net finance expense in the income statement (see note 29). As the impact of this revision is not material in both the current and prior 
period, no restatement of the comparative information has been made. 
IFRS 13 measurement and disclosure requirements are applicable for periods commencing from 1 January 2013. IFRS 13 does not have a material impact on 
the financial statements.
Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards (continued)
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following relevant standards and amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’
The Group does not anticipate any material impact on the financial statements on the adoption of IFRS 10.
The Group currently accounts for its interests in joint ventures using proportional consolidation. IFRS 11 does not permit proportional consolidation and 
therefore from 1 January 2014, for all periods presented, the Group will account for its interests in joint ventures using equity accounting. The use of equity 
accounting will have no impact on Group profit for the year or earnings per share, but will impact the presentation of the Group’s interests in joint ventures in 
the income statement and in the balance sheet. The Group will continue to prepare its management information using proportional consolidation and this will 
be presented in the segmental reporting note in future years.
The adoption of IFRS 12 may result in some additional disclosures in the financial statements.

5 Taxation (continued)
Tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The expected rate is the weighted average rate taking into 
account the Group’s profits in these jurisdictions. The expected rate has increased in 2013 due to the change in mix of the tax jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. The tax charge for the year is lower (2012: higher) than the expected tax charge due to the following factors:

Basic discontinued earnings per share for the year is 12.7 cents (2012: 11.5 cents) and diluted discontinued earnings per share is 12.3 cents (2012: 11.1 
cents).
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to owners of the parent divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Group’s employee share trusts. For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The Group’s dilutive ordinary shares 
comprise share options granted to employees under Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Retention Plan and shares and share options 
awarded under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan and Long Term Plan. Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share are disclosed to show  
the results excluding the impact of exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax. 80

8 Goodwill and intangible assets (continued)
Value-in-use calculations have been prepared for each CGU using the cash flow projections included in the financial budgets approved by management 
for 2014 and 2015. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% per annum for a further three year period. A terminal value is 
applied thereafter in order to calculate long-term estimated cash flows using the same anticipated long-term growth rate of 3% across all CGUs. The growth 
rate used does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate. The cash flows have been discounted using pre-
tax discount rates appropriate for each CGU.

31 December 2013 (see note 27).
Details of the key assumptions underlying the cash flows are included in critical accounting judgements and estimates in the Accounting Policies on page 64.
The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU. No goodwill has been written off during the year. $1.9m of goodwill was impaired 
during 2012. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and that the discount rates are 1% higher than 
those above in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review. This analysis did not identify any 
impairment.
Intangibles arising on acquisition include the valuation of customer contracts and customer relationships recognised on business combinations. 
Development costs with a net book value of $22.4m (2012: $20.8m) are internally generated intangible assets. 82

calculation of 54 indicates that closing trade receivables represent the most recent 54 days of continuing revenue. A provision for the impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the original 
receivables.

As per note 27, $3.6m of other non-current liabilities has been classified as ‘held for sale’ at 31 December 2013.
17 Financial instruments
The Group’s activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity 
risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the 
Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Group’s Treasury policies. Group Treasury, together with the Group’s 
business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks. The Group’s Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange 
risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash. 88

Where the Board considers that a material element of the Group’s profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geo-political 
uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. The Group has a number of subsidiary companies whose revenue and 
expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. The Group uses strategies such as the payment of dividends to minimise the amount of net 
assets exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
Some of the revenues of the Group’s businesses are to customers in overseas locations. Where possible, the Group’s policy is to eliminate all significant 
currency exposures on revenues at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts. Changes in the forward 
contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is recorded in 
equity.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any 
foreign currency exposure. 
The Group’s main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate. Movements in the sterling/US dollar rate impact the 
translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
If the average sterling/US dollar rate had been 10% higher or lower during 2013 (2012:10%), post-tax profit for the year would have been $15.1m higher or 
lower (2012: $10.6m). If the closing sterling/US dollar rate was 10% higher or lower at 31 December 2013 (2012:10%), exchange differences in equity would 
have been $59.4m (2012: $48.0m) higher or lower respectively. 10% has been used in these calculations as it represents a reasonable possible change in the 
sterling/US dollar exchange rate.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates 
of interest and then uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations. At 31 December 2013, 24% (2012: 19%) of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps. 
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that 
cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of ‘A’ or better, where possible. If average interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during 
2013 (2012: 1%), post-tax profit for the year would have been $2.6m lower or higher respectively (2012: $1.9m). 1% has been used in this calculation as it 
represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
(iii) Price risk
The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables. The Group’s operations comprise three divisions, Wood Group Engineering, Wood Group 
PSN and Wood Group GTS each made up of a number of businesses. Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses with support being 
provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency. Where required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as letters of 
credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk. 
The Group’s major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. Where a 
customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be 
obtained. The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for 
impairment of trade receivables. 
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance. There is significant management focus 
on receivables that are overdue. A table showing trade receivables and receivable days by division is provided in note 12. Receivable days calculations are not 
provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric. 
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of ‘A’ or better where 
possible. 81% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2013 (2012: 100%) was held with such institutions.
(c) Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Group’s main priority is to ensure continuity of funding. At 31 December 2013, 84% (2012: 96%) of the Group’s borrowing facilities 
(excluding joint ventures) were due to mature in more than one year. Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future 
obligations. In February 2013, the Group increased its bilateral facilities from $800m to $950m, with the maturity date being extended to February 2018. Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements

17 Financial instruments (continued)
(d) Capital risk
The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure. The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and when 
applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent. Gearing at 31 December 2013 was 12.9% (2012: 6.9%).
Interest cover is calculated by dividing total EBITA by net finance expense. Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2013 was 28.7 times (2012: 35.6 times). 
The ratio of net debt to total EBITDA at 31 December 2013 was 0.53 (2012: 0.31).
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the 
contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Drawdowns under long term bank facilities are for 
periods of three months or less and are not therefore discounted and loan interest payable is excluded from the amounts below.

Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
The fair value of short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and cash at bank and in hand 
approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments. Drawdowns under long-term bank 
facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
Details of derivative financial instruments are not disclosed in the financial statements as they are not material.

Warranty provisions
These provisions are recognised in respect of guarantees provided in the normal course of business relating to contract performance. They are based on 
previous claims history and it is expected that most of the costs in respect of these provisions will be incurred over the next two years. The opening balance 
has been adjusted by $32.2m to reflect a reclassification from trade and other payables at 31 December 2012.
Other provisions
At 31 December 2013, other provisions of $53.6m (2012: $65.0m) have been recognised. This amount includes provisions for future losses on onerous 
contracts, a provision for non-recoverable indirect taxes and provisions relating to the divestment of businesses. It is expected that any payment required in 
respect of these provisions would be made within the next two years. The net movement of $14.5m during the year includes the release of the Well Support 
provision and the creation of the Oman onerous contract provision as detailed in note 4. 90

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As these earnings are continually reinvested by the 
Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. 
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $105.9m (2012: $192.7m) to carry forward against future taxable income.

20 Share based charges 
The Group currently has a number of share schemes that give rise to share based charges. These are the Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’), the Long 
Term Retention Plan (‘LTRP’), the Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), the Long Term Cash Incentive Plan (‘LTCIP’) and the Long Term Plan (‘LTP’). The LTP 
replaced the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP in 2013. The charge to operating profit in 2013 for these schemes amounted to $22.4m (2012: $26.2m). $21.0m (2012: 
$19.6m) of the total charge is credited to retained earnings and $1.4m (2012: $6.6m), relating to the LTCIP, is included in liabilities as the LTCIP is a cash 
settled scheme. 
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below:
ESOS and LTRP
Around 1,300 employees participate in these schemes. For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing 
model has been used. Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, 
which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 15% and 20%. The share price volatility used in the calculation of 35%-40% is 
based on the actual volatility of the Group’s shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies. The risk free rate of return is based on the implied 
yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant. The rate used ranges from 0.5% to 
2.5%. A dividend yield of between 1.0% and 2.0% has been used in the calculations. 
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS during the year ranged from £2.29 to £2.52 (2012: £2.09). The fair value of options granted under the LTRP 
during the year ranged from £7.56 to £7.97 (2012: £6.43 to £7.48). The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options at 31 December 2013 is 
5.9 years (2012: 5.6 years).
LTIP/LTP
The share based charge for the LTIP/LTP was calculated using a fair value of £3.01 for the third cycle, £5.10 for the fourth cycle, £6.18 for the fifth cycle and 
£7.53 for the sixth cycle (LTP). The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account 
of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award. Further details of the LTIP/
LTP are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
LTCIP
The share based charge for the LTCIP was calculated using a fair value of £6.62 (2012: £7.01). The fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes option 
pricing model using similar assumptions to those used for ESOS and LTRP above. Payments under the LTCIP are linked to movements in the Group’s share 
price.

exercised during the year and 742,850 options lapsed during the year. The weighted average share price for ESOS options exercised during the year was 
£8.54 (2012: £7.59).
Options granted to directors under the executive share option scheme are subject to performance criteria. No options have been granted to executive 
directors since 2009. There are no performance criteria under this scheme for options granted to employees.

Options are granted under the Group’s LTRP at par value. The basis of the scheme is that an overall bonus pool is calculated annually based on performance 
criteria that consider the growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings per share in the prior year. There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of 
options under the LTRP. 256,500 options (2012: 145,000) were exercisable at 31 December 2013. 913,680 LTRP options were granted during the year, 
2,104,012 LTRP options were exercised during the year and 304,424 LTRP options lapsed during the year. The weighted average share price for LTRP 
options exercised during the year was £8.45 (2012: £7.51). Further details on the LTRP are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) has been in place since 2008. Under this Scheme, the executive directors and certain senior executives are 
awarded shares or share options dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee. The performance 
measures for the LTIP are EBITA, OCER (ratio of operating capital employed to revenue), total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
The LTIP awards are in the form of shares or share options and forfeitable restricted shares or share options. 20% of any award earned over the three year 
performance cycle is deferred for a further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares or share options. At 31 December 2013, 2,661,359 shares or 
share options were potentially issuable under this scheme. Further details of the LTIP are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Long Term Plan
The Group’s Long Term Plan (‘LTP’) was introduced during 2013 to replace the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP. Two distinct awards will be made under LTP. Nil 
value share options will be awarded on the same basis as awards under LTRP (see above). Awards to former LTIP and LTCIP participants will be made on a 
broadly similar basis to LTIP with the performance measures being EBITA, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These awards are 
in the form of shares or share options and forfeitable restricted shares or share options. 20% of any award is deferred for two years in the form of forfeitable 
restricted shares or share options. At 31 December 2013, 1,742,591 shares were potentially issuable under this scheme. Further details of the LTP are 
provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The following options granted under the Group’s LTP were outstanding at 31 December:
Number of ordinary shares under option Exercise price
Year of grant 2013 2012 (per share) Exercise period
2013 11,500 – 0.00p 2017-2018
Options are granted under the Group’s LTP at nil value. There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of these options. No options were 
exercisable at 31 December 2013. 11,500 LTP options were granted during the year, no options were exercised or lapsed during the year. Further details on

During 2012, the Parent Company received $43.5m of proceeds from Group companies relating to the exercise of employee share options under the share 
symmetry scheme. This amount was credited to share premium in the Parent Company and an equivalent amount deducted from retained earnings on 
consolidation. Under the share symmetry scheme, subsidiary companies remit share proceeds to the Parent Company in respect of employee share options 
granted before the IPO in 2002. 
 
Retained earnings are stated after deducting the investment in own shares held by employee share trusts. Investment in own shares represents the cost of 
11,640,553 (2012: 11,599,912) of the company’s ordinary shares totalling $158.9m (2012: $112.7m). No options have been granted over shares held by the 
employee share trusts (2012: nil).
Shares acquired by the employee share trusts are purchased in the open market using funds provided by John Wood Group PLC to meet obligations under 
the Employee Share Option Schemes, LTRP, LTIP and LTP. 
During 2013, 1,900,000 new shares were allocated to the employee share trust. 3,934,000 shares were purchased during the year at a cost of $47.8m. 
4,227,436 shares were issued during the year to satisfy the exercise of share options at a value of $7.9m. 1,565,923 shares were issued during the year to

31 December 2013 was $132.3m (2012: $137.0m) based on the closing share price of £6.86 (2012: £7.27). The employee share trusts have waived their 
rights to receipt of dividends on ordinary shares. 
 
Transactions with non-controlling interests include $2.5m relating to the cost of acquiring minority shareholdings, the excess of cost ($3.1m) over book 
value ($0.6m) being charged directly to equity. In addition, included within dividends to non-controlling interests was a payment of $0.8m in excess of the 
shareholders interest in the subsidiary which has also been charged to equity.

The Group has used acquisition accounting for purchases and, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, the goodwill arising on consolidation of 
$138.9m has been capitalised. 
During the year the Group acquired 90% of the share capital of Intetech Limited, 95% of the share capital of Pyeroy Limited and 100% of the share capital 
of Elkhorn Holdings Inc. Due to its size, the acquisition of Elkhorn is considered material and has been presented separately in the table above. The other 
acquisitions are not considered to be material on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated above. 
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Group’s wider client base and use the Group’s resources to further grow and develop their 
businesses. These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions. 
Provisional fair value adjustments of $82.5m, representing the fair value of customer contracts, have been recorded in relation to the acquisitions made in 
the year. Other provisional fair value adjustments of $3.0m have also been recorded. Trade and other receivables acquired of $94.3m are expected to be 
recovered in full.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents in respect of acquisitions is analysed as follows:

The results of the Group, as if the above acquisitions had been made at the beginning of period, would have been as follows:
$m
Total Revenue 7,458.1
Total EBITA 571.5
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2013, the acquisitions contributed $113.1m to revenue and $8.8m to EBITA.
Divestments
In October 2013, the Group entered into an agreement with Siemens to form a joint venture company containing the maintenance and power solutions 
businesses of Wood Group GTS and the Siemens ‘TurboCare’ business unit. Wood Group will have a 51% shareholding in the new joint venture and the 
transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2014. Whilst Wood Group will have a 51% interest in the net assets and the income, all significant 
decision making requires unanimous consent from both parties and therefore Wood Group do not have control, and the new company will be treated as a 
joint venture.
Wood Group GTS’s assets and liabilities that will be transferred into the new joint venture company have been treated as assets and liabilities held for sale 
in the Group balance sheet at 31 December 2013 and the profit of those businesses is included in profit from discontinued operations in the Group income 
statement.
Wood Group GTS’s existing joint ventures, Rolls Wood Group, Trans Canada Turbines and Sulzer Wood will not form part of the new entity. The assets and 
liabilities of these companies have not been treated as assets and liabilities held for sale and the profits of these joint venture companies are included in profit 
from continuing operations.
In December 2013, the Group disposed of a small Australian business for $0.3m. The assets of this business had been provided against in previous periods 
and a small gain arose on the sale.
Details of the 2012 divestments are included in the 2012 Annual Report and Accounts.
Analysis of results from discontinued operations 
Discontinued operations comprise the Wood Group GTS business being transferred into the new joint venture company with Siemens, the aero engine 
overhaul business divested by Wood Group GTS in 2012 and the Well Support business divested in 2011.

29 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is contracted out of the 
State Scheme, and a number of defined contribution plans. The assets of the defined benefits scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being 
invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds. Since 5 April 2007 members have accrued benefits under the scheme on a 
‘CARE’ (Career Averaged Revalued Earnings) basis. The Group has entered into consultation with members of the scheme with regard to a proposal which 
would result in closure to future accrual from 30 June 2014. No impact of the proposed change has been reflected in the 2013 net liability.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 by a professionally qualified actuary. As a result of the valuation, the Group 
has agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of $4.7m (£2.9m) per annum from 2014 until 2021. At 31 December 2013, there were 241 active members 
(2012: 254), 286 pensioners (2012: 270) and 654 deferred members (2012 : 667) of the scheme. 
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were:
2013 2012
% %
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.40 5.00
Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.40 3.00
Discount rate 4.50 4.50
Rate of retail price index inflation 3.40 3.00
Rate of consumer price index inflation 5.00 4.90
At 31 December 2013, the mortality assumption used to determine pension liabilities is based on the most recent mortality tables which consider UK wide 
mortality data relevant to the Group’s pension scheme. The mortality rates are then adjusted to allow for expected future improvements in mortality using up to 
date projections. The mortality assumption can be fully described as PCA00 CMI_2012 (1.25%).
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:

Scheme risks
The retirement benefit scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are:
Volatility
The defined benefit obligation is measured with reference to corporate bond yields and if scheme assets underperform relative to this yield, this will create a 
deficit, all other things being equal. The scheme investments are well diversified such that the failure of a single investment would not have a material impact 
on the overall level of assets.
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in the corporate bond yields will increase the defined benefit obligation. This would however be offset to some extent by a corresponding increase 
in the value of the scheme’s bond asset holdings.
Inflation risk
The majority of benefits in deferment and in payment are linked to price inflation so higher actual inflation and higher assumed inflation will increase the defined 
benefit obligation.
Life expectancy 
The defined benefit obligation is generally made up of benefits payable for life and so increases to members’ life expectancies will increase the defined benefit 
obligation all other things being equal.
Sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation
The impact of changes to the key assumptions on the retirement benefit obligation is shown below. The sensitivity is based on a change in an assumption 
whilst holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When 
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the 
pension obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.
Assumption Change Impact on obligation

Rate of retail prices index inflation 0.1% $3.4m

At the balance sheet date the Group had cross guarantees without limit extended to its principal bankers in respect of sums advanced to subsidiaries. 
From time to time and in the normal course of business the Group is notified of legal claims in respect of work carried out. Management believe that the Group 
is in a strong position to defend these claims. In addition, the Group is currently cooperating with an investigation in relation to a facility where it previously 
provided services. Management do not believe that it is probable that any material liability will arise from any of these matters.

$62.5m. The net recovery, after deduction of costs, an amount payable to non-controlling interests and tax is expected to be around $40m. 104

Report on the Parent Company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2013; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of 
this report.
What we have audited
The Parent Company financial statements, which are prepared by John 
Wood Group PLC, comprise:
• the Parent Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2013;
• the Parent Company reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ 
funds for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the Parent Company financial statements, which include 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
comprises applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a 
number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made 
assumptions and considered future events.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK & Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves obtaining 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Parent 
Company financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the Parent Company financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company 
financial statements.
• The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Accounting policies 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable Accounting 
Standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
Reporting currency
The Company’s transactions are primarily US dollar denominated and the principal functional currency is the US dollar.
The following sterling to US dollar exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts: 
2013 2012
Average rate £1 = $ 1.5673 1.5845
Closing rate £1 = $ 1.6563 1.6255
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are included in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment
The Company performs impairment reviews in respect of fixed asset investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the asset’s net realisable 
value and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward contracts have been arranged, at 
the contractual rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet dates 
or at a contractual rate if applicable and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate ruling 
on the date it was raised.
Financial instruments
The accounting policy for financial instruments is consistent with the Group accounting policy as presented in the notes to the Group financial statements with 
the exception of the policy on net investment hedges which does not apply to the Company. The Company’s financial risk management policy is consistent 
with the Group’s financial risk management policy outlined in note 17 to the Group financial statements.
Use of estimates
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Employee share trusts
The Company is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts. They have therefore been included in the 
financial statements of the Company. Under UITF 38 the cost of shares held by the employee share trusts is deducted from shareholders’ funds.
Share based charges
The Company has a number of share schemes as detailed in the Group accounting policies and note 20 to the Group financial statements. Details relating 
to the calculation of share based charges are provided in note 20 to the Group financial statements. In respect of the Company, the charge is shown as an 
increase in the Company’s investments, as the employees to which the charge relates are employed by subsidiary companies.
Taxation
The current tax charge is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profits differ from the profit reported in the profit and loss account due to timing 
differences and other items that require adjustment as set out in legislation. The Company’s liability for tax is calculated using rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. The deferred tax position is calculated using the rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax losses are surrendered or claimed in the form of group relief with consideration being received or paid accordingly. The group relief amount is recorded 
separately within the debtors and creditors amounts in the balance sheet, as applicable, and is calculated by applying the tax rate enacted or substantially 
enacted at the balance sheet date to the loss amount. 
Dividends
Dividends to the Group’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Dividend income is 
credited to the profit and loss account when the dividend has been approved by the board of directors of the subsidiary company making the payment.

6 Financial instruments
Financial risk factors
The Company’s activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact 
on the Company’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Group’s Treasury policies which are approved by the Board of Directors. 
Group Treasury identify, evaluate and where appropriate hedge financial risks. The Group Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange 
risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. The Company hedges part of its net investment in non-US dollar 
subsidiaries by using foreign currency bank loans.
Where possible the Company’s policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as 
forward currency contracts. Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the profit and loss account.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Company finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The company borrows in the desired currencies at floating 
rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Company’s exposure to 
interest rate fluctuations. At 31 December 2013, approximately 30% (2012: 22%) of the Company’s borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of 
interest rate swaps.
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Company’s policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring 
that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of ‘A’ or better, where possible.
(iii) Price risk
The Company is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
(b) Credit risk
The Company’s credit risk primarily relates to its inter-company loans and inter-company receivables. Management believe that no further risk provision is 
required in excess of the current provision for impairment.
The Company also has credit risk in relation to cash balances or cash held on deposit. The Company’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions with an ‘A’ 
rating or better where possible. There was no cash held on deposit at 31 December 2013. Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements

6 Financial instruments (continued)
(c) Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Group’s policy is to ensure continuity of funding. At 31 December 2013, 100% (2012: 100%) of the Company’s borrowing facilities 
were due to mature in more than one year. Based on the current outlook the Company has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
(d) Capital risk
The Company’s capital risk is determined by that of the Group.

Information for shareholders
Payment of dividends
The Company declares its dividends in US dollars. As a result of the shareholders being mainly UK based, dividends will be paid in 
sterling, but if you would like to receive your dividend in US dollars please contact the Registrars at the address below. All shareholders 
will receive dividends in sterling unless requested. If you are a UK based shareholder, the Company encourages you to have your 
dividends paid through the BACS (Banker’s Automated Clearing Services) system. The benefit of the BACS payment method is that the 
Registrars post the tax vouchers directly to the shareholders, whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the shareholder’s 
Bank or Building Society account. UK shareholders who have not yet arranged for their dividends to be paid direct to their Bank or 
Building Society account and wish to benefit from this service should contact the Registrars at the address below. Sterling dividends will 
be translated at the closing mid-point spot rate on 11 April 2014 as published in the Financial Times on 12 April 2014.

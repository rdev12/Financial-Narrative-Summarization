CHAIRMAN
Once again I have the pleasure to announce another year of excellent performance, with a 39% 
increase in underlying proﬁ t before tax* to £74.2 million and a 43% increase in underlying earnings 
per share* to 160p.
 
The Board has given careful consideration to an appropriate dividend payment in the current 
economic environment but with the continuing strong growth in the Group’s earnings, record cash 
ﬂ ow and a solid balance sheet, the Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 25p. This gives a total 
for the year of 35p, an increase of 40% over last year.

2 STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
43% increase 
in underlying 
earnings per 
share* to 160p During the year, the Group acquired 
Richmond Electronics & Engineering Limited in 
the UK and completed three further acquisitions 
in the US – Scot, Inc., Martin Electronics, Inc. and 
Titan Dynamics Systems, Inc. The acquisition 
of Non-Intrusive Inspection Technology, Inc. 
(NIITEK) was completed in December 2008. 
These acquisitions were funded by £12 million 
in cash, utilising existing bank facilities, and the 
issue of £61 million equity. Each of the acquired 
businesses further strengthen the Group’s 
presence in our target markets. 
The Energetics division grew strongly, with 
revenue increasing by 54% to £196.7 million 
and underlying operating proﬁ t increasing 
by 64% to £45.7 million, now making it 
our largest division in revenue and proﬁ t 
terms. Countermeasures had a record year, 
driven by an exceptional performance from 
Chemring Countermeasures in the UK and 
strong revenue growth at Kilgore in the US.
A reconciliation of the underlying results to the 
statutory results is set out in the Review by the 
Finance Director on page 15.
Balance sheet, cash ﬂ ow and debt
At this time of global economic and monetary 
stress, shareholders will inevitably be concerned 
to ensure that the Company’s funding position is 
secure and adequate for both current and future 
plans. In recent years, the Board has focused 
on ensuring that the Group had a sound cash 
position and debt structure. This strategy has 
proved to be beneﬁ cial. 
In November 2007 the Company completed 
a $150 million private placement in the US 
of ten year ﬁ xed interest loan notes, with 
an interest rate of approximately 6.30%. 
In August 2008, although the Company had 
sufﬁ cient bank facilities to acquire Scot and 
Martin Electronics for cash, the Company issued 
new equity to raise £60 million. This helped to 
reduce the Group’s gearing, which now stands 
at 51% (2007: 80%), and enabled the Group 
to maintain a good level of headroom on its 
established bank facilities. 
With a record operating cash ﬂ ow of 
£83.7 million in the year, the expectation 
that this trend will continue in 2009 and an 
easily managed debt repayment proﬁ le, the 
Board believes that the Group has more than 
adequate ﬁ nancial resources to meet its current 
expansion plans, including signiﬁ cant planned 
capital expenditure and continuing research 
and development investment.
Energetics
The Group is driving forward its programme 
of product and plant reorganisation within its 
production facilities in the UK, Germany, Italy, 
Norway, Spain, Australia and the US, whilst 
continuing to grow revenue and earnings to 
record levels. The expansion of our Energetics 
activities is enabling an increasing number 
of our product components to be sourced 
internally, particularly in those parts of 
the business where technology transfer 
restrictions across national borders are not 
as stringent as have historically applied in the 
countermeasures business.
 CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN 3
Record operating 
cash ﬂ ow of 
£83.7 million Of particular signiﬁ cance during the year 
was the development of our training 
rounds business, where the combination of 
Chemring Defence (formerly Comet) in Germany 
and Titan Dynamics Systems in the US makes 
the Group the clear market leader in the area of 
battleﬁ eld simulation products. Titan’s products, 
in particular, are in great demand in the US. 
The Group has also expanded its capabilities 
in the supply of equipment for detecting and 
responding to improvised explosives devices 
(IEDs), unexploded ordnance clearance and 
demilitarisation of munitions. With Chemring EOD 
in the UK (comprising BDL Systems and 
Richmond) and with the recent addition of 
NIITEK in the US, the Group now has a signiﬁ cant 
presence in this sector. In NIITEK we believe 
we have acquired the world’s foremost vehicle 
mounted mine detection system. 
Countermeasures
Our UK business, Chemring Countermeasures, 
followed its record achievement in 2007 
with another record year, delivering growth 
in revenue of 37%. Although the business 
continues to sell and export a wide range of 
decoys, its recent success emanates principally 
from the development of a spectral ﬂ are for the 
UK armed forces. This ﬂ are, which is in great 
demand, has a number of export variants which 
it is anticipated will generate excellent sales in 
the immediate future.
Kilgore, which is in a very strong position as the 
designated supplier of advanced ﬂ ares for new 
aircraft such as the F-22 and the Joint Strike 
Fighter, also had a record year, with growth 
in revenue of 48%. However, the business 
was affected by delays in customer testing 
of certain products, which resulted in some 
revenue and margin being deferred into the ﬁ rst 
quarter of the current ﬁ nancial year. During 
the year Kilgore commissioned a new advanced 
ﬂ are production facility. 
Alloy Surfaces, the most proﬁ table business 
in the Countermeasures division, had another 
solid year of earnings and cash generation. 
However, we have had to recognise that 
its dramatic growth in recent years cannot 
continue indeﬁ nitely, and we anticipate more 
modest growth for the next few years pending 
the introduction of the next generation of 
special material decoys. 
The strong relationship between our two 
US businesses and the US Department of 
Defense has developed further over the last 
year and culminated in the award of several 
ﬁ ve year IDIQ (Indeﬁ nite Delivery, Indeﬁ nite 
Quantity) contracts, with a total value of up to 
$731 million. Whereas these may not necessarily 
translate into committed orders in that quantum 
over the next ﬁ ve year period, it does give a 
clear indication of the long term potential of our 
expendable countermeasures business.
During the year, our Australian business was 
awarded a ten year contract by the Australian 
Government, worth A$160 million (£67 million), 
for the supply of a range of countermeasures 
and pyrotechnics. This is a great success and 
establishes us as the principal supplier of 
these products in the region. As part of the 
arrangement, we have committed to building 
a new, state-of-the-art decoy manufacturing 
facility near Melbourne, as well as creating a 
research and development centre for the design 
of future products.
Group strategy
Our Group strategy remains unchanged. We will 
continue to concentrate on our two segments 
of Energetics and Countermeasures, combining 
organic growth with acquisitions which ﬁ t our 
designated market sectors and product offering. 
With the continuing development of the Group 
around the world, the Board has identiﬁ ed 
the need to strengthen the senior executive 
team with the appointment of a third divisional 
managing director. This individual will head up 
the Group’s international business outside of the 
UK, Europe and the US; in particular, in Australia, 
India, Korea, Japan and the Middle East.
The Group already has customers in India, 
Korea and Japan but we believe that permanent 
production facilities in each of these countries 
will be required in the future in order to 
maintain and increase our presence in both 
Countermeasures and Energetics. We recognise 
that in these countries some form of joint 
venture is likely to be the required structure. 
Health and safety
The Group has not only maintained its 
commitment to health and safety throughout 
the year but has recently strengthened it 
through the appointment of a new senior 
executive to concentrate full time on all aspects 
of this discipline. The new Group Director 
of Safety is now a member of the Executive 
Committee which runs the day to day activities 
of the Group. In a Group which works every day 
with sensitive, explosive materials, our attention 
to the protection of our employees cannot be 
emphasised enough.

4 STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 Board of directors
The composition of the Board in terms of the 
number of members, their length of service and 
their skills is kept under continuing review. The 
Board does not consider that there is any need 
for immediate action.
Staff and employees
In recent years we have grown to over 3,000 
employees across the world. Although this is 
still not a large number in terms of international 
businesses, it has been a rapid increase for 
the Group. In these difﬁ cult economic times, 
it is understandable that employees may be 
apprehensive over the security of their jobs. In 
this statement, I have attempted to set out my 
convictions for the future of the Group and its 
current sound ﬁ nancial position. The Board can 
set the scene and determine the “big picture” 
for the Group but it needs the commitment of all 
members of staff and employees to deliver that 
potential. If we do so, as we have done in the 
past, our employees can feel comfortable about 
their continuing employment prospects. 
The Board extends its thanks to all employees, 
including those in recently acquired companies, 
for their efforts that have made 2008 another 
very successful year for the Group.
Pensions
Whilst the assets held by our deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension schemes have inevitably been impacted 
by the recent fall in stock markets, the deﬁ cit on 
the schemes is not signiﬁ cant in the context of 
the Group and we remain comfortable with the 
future funding requirements.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 
25p per ordinary share, a 40% increase on the 
ﬁ nal dividend for 2007. This, together with the 
interim dividend of 10p paid in August 2008, 
gives a total dividend for the year of 35p, a 
40% increase over 2007. The dividend is over 
4.6 times covered on underlying proﬁ ts after 
tax of the continuing operations. The shares 
will be marked “ex dividend” on 25 March 2009 
and the dividend is payable on 17 April 2009 
to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 27 March 2009.
Prospects
Our ongoing commitment to delivering total 
shareholder return has inevitably been 
restricted by the performance of the Company’s 
shares, although I believe that shareholders will 
recognise that the external inﬂ uences of the 
economic and ﬁ nancial dramas were outside of 
our control. In the circumstances, I believe our 
share price has held up relatively well compared 
to the stock market as a whole. 
The Board has examined thoroughly not only 
the plans for the current year but also the 
next ﬁ ve years, and whilst recognising that 
we cannot remain completely immune to 
economic recession, we are convinced that 
our growth strategy, consistent with that 
articulated in previous years, is still soundly 
based. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier in 
this statement, we believe that the Group has 
adequate ﬁ nancial resources to deliver
this strategy.
We enter 2009 with an excellent order book, an 
Energetics division growing rapidly but still in its 
youth, and several newly-acquired businesses 
determined to show the Group what they can 
achieve. The Countermeasures division will 
continue to produce solid earnings and cash ﬂ ow.
 
As a leading defence business, the issues 
associated with the current military operations 
around the world make many judgments difﬁ cult 
but looking to the future of the Group, these 
international tensions do not make the world 
look a safer place. In rapidly changing economic 
circumstances there are many imponderables 
which could affect the outcome for the next year. 
However, once again I believe we will experience 
another year of above average growth, with 
all-round solid ﬁ nancial performance.

Dr D J Price
CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Group results
The Group performed strongly throughout the 
year and revenue from continuing operations 
increased by 39% to £354.2 million. Growth of 
17% was achieved from our existing businesses, 
14% from the full year trading of acquisitions 
made in 2007 and 8% from the four 
acquisitions completed in 2008. The Energetics 
division had another excellent year, achieving 
a 54% increase in revenue to a record level 
of £196.7 million, in spite of a disappointing 
performance from our US subsidiary, 
Technical Ordnance. The Countermeasures 
division increased its sales to a record level of 
£157.5 million, with very strong growth at both 
Kilgore and Chemring Countermeasures in the 
UK. The second half performance of the Group 
was particularly good, generating £204 million 
of revenue, £57 million of underlying operating 
proﬁ t* and £75 million of operating cash ﬂ ow.
 
Underlying operating margins* for the Group 
remained steady at 24% for the full year, with 
the strong second half performance (28%) 
compensating, as expected, for the lower 
margins achieved in the ﬁ rst half. Operating 
margins in the Energetics Division improved 
to 23%, due to the introduction of automated 
manufacturing and the operational gearing 
achieved from higher volumes of activity. 
However, margins in our Countermeasures 
division reduced slightly to 29%, as the material 
cost of magnesium and higher sales of naval 
countermeasures affected the businesses. 
Consequently, underlying operating proﬁ t* rose 
by 39% to £84.9 million. We remain conﬁ dent 
that this level of proﬁ tability is sustainable into 
the future. 
The operating cash inﬂ ow during the year 
was excellent at £83.7 million, equivalent to a 
cash conversion rate of 99%. Our operating 
cash inﬂ ow in the second half of the year was 
particularly strong, with an equivalent cash 
conversion of over 130%. Capital expenditure 
increased by 113% to £34 million as the Group 
continued to invest signiﬁ cantly in improved 
automation, additional manufacturing facilities 
and important improvements in manufacturing 
safety. Research and development (R&D) also 
increased by 39% to £9.3 million, driven by 
a signiﬁ cant increase in customer funding. 
Company funded R&D grew at a more modest 
7%. Our new ﬁ ve year research partnership 
with the Defence Academy at Shrivenham 
has started well with four doctoral research 
programmes and three major product studies. 
At the year end, the Group had a record order 
book of £409 million, some 38% higher than 
the previous year. This level of order cover 
continues to underpin the prospects for 2009. 
I am pleased to report that the order book for 
the Energetics division at the year end was 
£281 million, 58% higher than the previous 
year, continuing to provide a real foundation for 
further strong growth in the future. 
Since the year end, the order book has 
increased by a further 43% to a record current 
order book of £585 million.
 
Health and safety
Following the detailed investigation into the 
incident that occurred in October 2007 in a 
manufacturing building at the Simmel Difesa 
site in Colleferro, Italy, a detailed restart 
process was implemented to ensure that 
appropriate lessons were learned and that 
risks were reduced to as low as reasonably 
practicable, in line with the Group’s commitment 
to achieving the highest levels of safety in both 
its products and its manufacturing facilities. 
Review by the Chief Executive
Revenue 
increased 
by 39% to 
£354.2 million  CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 REVIEW BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE 7
The restart process was reviewed by 
independent experts and then implemented 
prior to commencing any operation, including 
all buildings and operations not involved in the 
incident. It included the use of a forty seven 
point checklist which ensured that all risks were 
adequately considered, mitigated and managed. 
Simmel Difesa has now safely begun production 
in all areas, with the exception of the building 
in which the incident occurred, which was 
substantially damaged. Production was affected 
during the ﬁ rst four months of the year but 
the impact was minimised by ensuring that 
key production items were sub-contracted to 
alternative manufacturing facilities whilst the 
restart process was being implemented. These 
alternative manufacturing facilities were fully 
qualiﬁ ed by the customer and have performed 
well during the remainder of the year.

Pyrotechnics and
explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)
Our pyrotechnics and EOD business continues 
to grow strongly, with revenue up 45% 
year-on-year to £110.8 million. Our Italian 
subsidiary, Simmel Difesa, was a great success 
during its ﬁ rst full year of ownership, generating 
£25.8 million of pyrotechnic business. 
Demand for its pyrotechnic illumination mortar 
rounds continued to be strong, driven by 
continued high levels of operational use during 
peacekeeping operations by the UK Army. Over 
60,000 rounds were delivered this year and the 
award of a multi-year contract for the supply 
of another 140,000 white-light and 50,000 
black-light illumination rounds will maintain 
volume production throughout 2009 and 2010.
Chemring Defence also performed well, with 
encouraging growth in the sales of both 
pyrotechnic and demolition stores products. 
Production of smoke products, for signalling or 
screening, grew by 26% to record levels with 
over 800,000 units delivered to the
UK Ministry of Defence and other NATO 
countries. Qualiﬁ cation of the L96/L97 
vehicle discharge grenades for the US Army 
was completed to schedule and volume 
production continues in line with the 
multi-year requirements. Sales of demolition 
stores grew by 20% year-on-year, with a 
signiﬁ cant expansion of our customer base 
in Europe and the Middle East. In particular, 
our portable mine-breaching system, PEMBS, 
continued to be in demand, with new orders 
from Australia, Spain, Poland and Slovenia.

Battleﬁ eld training products have also 
continued to be in strong demand. The 
customer base for our MECS (multiple effects 
cartridge system) battleﬁ eld simulation 
ammunition continued to expand, with France 
and Saudi Arabia becoming important new 
customers. Record production levels were 
achieved for thunderﬂ ash products, with 
deliveries of in excess of 1 million units to 
European and Far Eastern customers. US 
Army usage continued to be strong and 
production reached 1.5 million units during 
the year. The US Army believes that realistic 
training conditions are a vital component of 
maintaining readiness, and plans to signiﬁ cantly 
expand the capabilities of its training ranges. 
Towards the end of the year, Chemring Defence 
received a $5 million contract from Unitech in 
the US for the delivery of the new Improvised 
Explosive Devices (IED) simulator launchers for 
installation at various US Army training ranges. 
Further opportunities for the system and the 
associated MECS ammunition are expected to 
emerge over the next twelve months as a large 
number of countries involved in peacekeeping 
activities evaluate what type of training is 
needed prior to the deployment of troops.
Chemring Marine also grew strongly in 2008, 
expanding sales of its maritime distress signals 
by 16%, with a signiﬁ cant increase in deliveries 
to the US market to satisfy cruise liner 
requirements. Worldwide qualiﬁ cation of both 
its new Mk8 parachute distress rocket and its 
new day and night distress ﬂ are were achieved 
in the year and these new products should 
maintain our competitive position for the future. 
Chemring Energetics saw lower production 
volumes of pyrotechnics during the year, 
principally due to a one-off change by 
Martin Baker in their manufacturing inventory 
policy that led to a short-term stop in demand for 
pyromechanisms and rocket motors used during 
their ejector seat production. A greater emphasis 
has been placed on growing the munitions 
component and sub-system opportunities.
Our US subsidiary, Technical Ordnance, had a 
disappointing year, with sales of pyrotechnics 
substantially lower than the previous year. 
Multi-year contracts for the delivery of BBU-35, 
BBU-36 and CCU-45 impulse cartridges for 
the US Air Force and US Navy were completed 
during the year but there has been a signiﬁ cant 
delay in the follow-on competitive process. The 
consequent gap in production reduced annual 
volumes by 30% to 4.2 million units, which 
had a substantial impact on revenue. The new 
multi-year contracts are now under negotiation. 
All of our new acquisitions performed strongly 
during 2008. Richmond Electronics was 
acquired at the start of the ﬁ nancial year and 
has made an encouraging start, with a record 
level of sales and the successful capture of 
major orders from the UK, Italy, Bangladesh 
and Kuwaiti governments. Titan Dynamics, in 
Texas, has also made great progress since its 
acquisition, with a further 400 BES (battleﬁ eld 
effects systems) launchers installed at US Army 
ranges to take the installed base to more than 
1,500. The production of BES cartridges has 
also been increased to 65,000 per month 
using the automated manufacturing expertise 
at Technical Ordnance. Further increases to 
100,000 per month are planned to occur in 2009.
Scot also performed well, delivering strong 
sales and operating margins during the latter 
part of 2008. It secured new contracts for the 
supply of BBU-63 impulse cartridges for use 
on the B-2 stealth bomber and a substantial 
contract from Lockheed Martin for the aft 
and forward thrusters used on the Atlas V 
heavy lift launch vehicle. The business also 
won some important contracts (canard 
actuator, separation nuts) on the Orion Crew 
Expeditionary Vehicle, which is the NASA 
successor to the Space Shuttle.

Munitions 
Our munitions business also grew strongly, with 
revenue up 66% year-on-year to £85.9 million. 
The full year of trading from Simmel Difesa was an 
important component of this growth, generating 
£26 million of revenue. Naval ammunition 
continued to be the most important aspect of the 
business, with deliveries of 40mm ammunition to 
a number of Italian and Middle Eastern customers. 
Production of 76mm naval ammunition remained 
steady during the year with deliveries to several 
Far Eastern and South American countries. 
Simmel was also awarded its ﬁ rst contract from 
the French Navy for the qualiﬁ cation of a range 
of 76mm ammunition for the French Horizon and 
FREMM frigates. 
Simmel had further success in its other niche 
markets. It delivered the ﬁ rst batch of 120mm 
tank ammunition to a NATO customer to 
schedule, and received a signiﬁ cant award 
for the supply of 125mm tank ammunition 
to a Middle East customer. A qualiﬁ cation 
programme for the dual-mode warhead of the 
ASTER air defence missile was also successfully 
completed during the year and volume 
production has now started. 
 
The munitions part of Chemring Energetics 
grew strongly in 2008, with good progress 
made on the development of our rocket motor 
business. The qualiﬁ cation of the NLAW 
rocket motors was completed in the early part 
of the year and production increased to its 
steady-state requirement. A new rocket motor 
for an 84mm anti-tank weapon was developed 
in the year and the ﬁ rst batch delivered to the 
European customer. In addition, good progress 
continues to be made to extend our partnership 
with BAE Systems for the supply of detonators, 
primers and energetic components for a wide 
range of their ammunition products. 
Chemring Energetics is also working with 
BAE Systems and other prime contractors on 
the development of new explosive materials, 
particularly those that are insensitive to ﬁ re 
or high velocity impacts. During the year, we 
received a substantial contract from Nexter for 
insensitive explosive material for use in the new 
French 155mm ammunition.
Technical Ordnance also expanded its 
component supply business with the principal 
US ammunition prime contractors, ATK and 
General Dynamics. Production of explosive 
detonators, pellets and tracers increased by 
24% year-on-year and we continue to explore 
the opportunity for more sub-system contracts, 
such as complete fuzes. 
The newly acquired Martin Electronics performed 
well during the last few months of the year, 
increasing production and capturing a number of 
important new orders. Production of the M228 
training grenade fuze continued strongly at 
300,000 units per month in its semi-automated 
facility. Full automation of the assembly, 
inspection and packaging was introduced 
during 2008 and has successfully completed all 
qualiﬁ cation testing. Contract options in excess of 
$22 million were also awarded.
Martin Electronics also successfully 
manufactured 40mm illumination rounds for 
the two US system prime contractors. Two 
further pyrotechnic rounds passed their factory 
acceptance testing and will begin production 
shortly. $17 million of new orders were also 
received, giving Martin a strong order book 
with which to start the new ﬁ nancial year.

Countermeasures
•  Orders: £155.2 million 
•  Revenue: £157.5 million 
•  Operating proﬁ t: £45.5 million
•  Operating margin: 29% 
Our Countermeasures division showed strong 
growth during the year, with revenue up 25% 
year-on-year to £157.5 million. However, some 
of this growth can be attributed to the strength 
of the dollar during the last quarter and the 
growth on a constant exchange rate is much 
closer to 20%, broadly in line with the growth in 
the global market.
Chemring Countermeasures, our UK business, 
had another excellent year, generating 
£42.4 million of revenue, which was 37% 
higher than the previous year. This growth 
was driven by a record production of 240,000 
spectral ﬂ ares for use by the UK and coalition 
partners in peacekeeping operations to protect 
helicopters, transport aircraft and combat 
aircraft. Production of conventional ﬂ are types 
also continued at record levels, with growing 
interest being shown for our range of 26mm 
and 50mm ﬂ ares for use on Russian made 
helicopters and aircraft. A substantial number 
of ﬂ ares for Typhoon were delivered to the 
participating nations and good progress was 
made on the development of some advanced 
ﬂ ares for future qualiﬁ cation on that platform. 
Revenue from 130mm naval countermeasures 
grew by over 170% year-on-year with major 
deliveries to Denmark, Norway, Spain and Chile. 
Interest in both IR and chaff rounds continues 
to grow, particularly for countries looking to 
operate in crowded littoral operational theatres. 
Historically, the operating margins from our 
naval countermeasures business have been 
considerably lower than that usually associated 
with our aircraft countermeasures. The strong 
growth in this area has, therefore, contributed 
to the small decrease in operating margins 
compared with 2007. However, company-funded 
programmes to develop alternative options to the 
existing bought-in rocket motors and electronics 
sub-systems are underway and should lead to 
higher margins over the next few years. 
Kilgore also delivered a strong performance, 
with sales up 48% year-on-year to a record 
level of $76.8 million. Production of the 
three high volume, conventional MTV ﬂ ares 
ran extremely well throughout, with total 
production exceeding 1.6 million ﬂ ares. This 
performance would have been even stronger 
but for the fact that production volumes had to 
be reduced during the latter part of the year, as 
a consequence of administrative delays in the 
award of follow-on options. 
Three new ﬂ ares were scheduled to enter 
production in 2008. A ﬂ are for C-17 transport 
aircraft successfully passed ﬂ ight qualiﬁ cation 
and factory acceptance testing (FAT) during the 
year; full production started at the end of the 
year and will continue throughout the current 
ﬁ nancial year. A set of advanced ﬂ ares for the 
B-52 also successfully passed its ﬂ ight test and 
factory acceptance testing but the US Air Force 
customer requested that a new high altitude 
test be completed before volume production 
commenced. Since this ﬂ ight test could only 
be scheduled at the very end of the ﬁ nancial 
year, the start of production was delayed into 
2009. Similarly, problems with the technical 
data package on the advanced ﬂ are for the 
F-18 aircraft have taken a considerable length 
of time to resolve and production has been 
delayed until 2009. 
Considerable progress has, however, been 
made on the advanced ﬂ ares for the F-22 and 
F-35 aircraft. Production of the ﬂ are set for 
F-22 increased steadily to 700 units per month, 
although a problem with the US Government 
test facility delayed delivery of several batches 
of ﬂ ares in the last six weeks of the year. The 
construction of the new advanced material 
facility at Kilgore, with its highly efﬁ cient fully 
automated production process, was completed 
and fully commissioned during the year. All 
F-22 production has now been transferred to 
this new facility. Successful validation testing 
of the ﬂ ares for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) 
has been completed and the test results exceed 
expectations. The transition to low rate initial 
production is now expected to occur in 2009.

Another major success for Kilgore in 2008 was 
the capture of the multi-year award to supply 
the M212 ﬂ are, which is a component of the 
current ﬂ are suite used by the US Army and the 
US Air Force to protect helicopters from infra-red 
guided missiles. This contract, with a maximum 
value of $382.9 million, is the largest framework 
contract ever placed with the Group by the 
US Government. The ﬁ rst delivery order was for 
just over 200,000 ﬂ ares, production of which is 
expected to begin in the latter part of 2009. 
Finally, Alloy Surfaces had another satisfactory 
year, generating $128.5 million of revenue, 
which was similar to last year. Decoy production 
rose to a record level of over 1.7 million 
ﬂ ares but a change of product mix affected 
total revenue. The US Army awarded Alloy a 
multi-year contract to supply the M211 ﬂ are, 
which is another component of the current 
ﬂ are suite used by the US Army for the 
protection of helicopters. This contract, with 
a maximum value of $347.9 million, provides 
the framework for continued production of 
this product over the next ﬁ ve years. However, 
the US Air Force recently selected a modiﬁ ed 
design, called the MJU64, for its future airlift 
protection requirements and has placed an 
initial contract on Alloy for $22.9 million. This 
change in requirement and the reduced demand 
from operations in Iraq, following the apparent 
success of the US and Iraqi forces “surge” 
initiative, resulted in a gradual decrease in the 
monthly production rate throughout 2008. 
Production of the MJU64 is now 10,000 units 
per month and is likely to stay at this rate for 
the foreseeable future. 
In May 2008, the US Air Force awarded Alloy a 
$30 million contract for the continued supply of 
MJU-50 decoys for protection of its transport 
aircraft. Production has been ramped up to 
33,000 units per month and negotiations for 
a follow-on contract at higher rate production 
in 2009 have now started. The UK Ministry of 
Defence has placed additional contracts for the 
BOL/IR special material decoys and production 
has been increased to 40,000 units per month; 
this level of production should continue 
throughout 2009.
Future prospects
Energetics – Pyrotechnics
and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)
The global market for pyrotechnics and EOD 
is estimated to be in excess of £3 billion per 
annum and to be growing steadily at over 10% 
per annum. In 2008, the Group had sales of 
£110.8 million, which represents a 3.5% market 
share. The market remains fragmented with a 
large number of small players, many of whom 
are nationally focused and with limited product 
ranges. Our recent acquisitions of Richmond, 
Titan, Scot and NIITEK have considerably 
enhanced our capabilities and market 
presence particularly in the US. We continue 
to believe that the opportunities for further 
growth are excellent.
There is growing interest in the use of white-
light and black-light illumination payloads for 
use in peacekeeping operations and for training 
requirements. Demand for our 81mm mortar 
rounds remains high but many of our customers 
are looking for alternative delivery systems. We 
are adapting our payloads for 60mm and 120mm 
mortar rounds and expect demand for the 
product to grow strongly over the next few years. 
The Group 
received its 
largest ever 
framework 
contract 
from the 
US Government 12 REVIEW BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
Signalling and screening smokes are used 
regularly during operational duties and training 
exercises, and there is growing interest in 
lower toxicity and multi-spectral performance. 
Demand for our products continues to grow 
within UK and NATO customers but we are 
starting to see growing export interest, 
particularly from Middle East and Far East 
customers. There are a number of large 
multi-year contracts that will be placed in 
2009, which could signiﬁ cantly enhance our 
production volumes over the next few years. 
Realistic battleﬁ eld simulation is considered 
essential for the preparation of troops 
prior to tours of active duty. The number of 
sophisticated training ranges continues to 
grow, particularly in the US, with our MECS 
and BES launchers as standard installations. 
Over the next ﬁ ve years, the installed launcher 
base will triple in number and this will lead to a 
substantial increase in the consumption of both 
MECS and BES pyrotechnic cartridges. 
In October, we announced the acquisition 
of NIITEK, a leading developer of robot and 
vehicle-mounted mine and Improvised Explosive 
Device (IED) detection systems, incorporating its 
advanced Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and 
metal detection technologies. This acquisition, 
completed in December, is a critical step in the 
development of our EOD business and provides 
a platform to access the £500 million mine 
detection market. NIITEK has developed its 
sensor technology into an operationally proven, 
vehicle-mounted system and is in the process 
of delivering $33.8 million worth of orders for 
thirty systems to the US Army in support of its 
counter-IED operations. Future developments 
of the technology include a robot-mounted 
sensor which will remove the human operator 
from hazardous mine detection activities in 
both peacekeeping operations and post-conﬂ ict 
reconstruction.
Energetics – Munitions
The global market for munitions remains 
comparatively stable at about £10 billion 
per annum and is not expected to change 
signiﬁ cantly over the next three years. 
Simmel continues to maintain its position 
as world leader in naval ammunition and is 
looking to substantially expand its order book in 
South America and the Far East. 
A major contract from the Italian MOD for 
medium calibre ammunition should be awarded 
shortly and there are a number of attractive 
export opportunities over the next eighteen 
months. Of particular note is the US 40mm 
ammunition programme for the C130 gunships, 
where Simmel is working in collaboration with 
General Dynamics. 
Our opportunities within the US have been 
signiﬁ cantly enhanced by the acquisition of 
Martin Electronics. Full year trading from the 
automated production of the M228 training 
grenade fuze will give immediate growth and 
the competition for the next multi-year contract 
has now started. Full production of the three 
pyrotechnic 40mm variants will also take place 
in 2009, and there is growing interest in our 
medium velocity family for longer range, high 
accuracy engagements. 
Collaboration between Martin Electronics and 
Simmel will also ensure that any technology 
transfer into US will be done as efﬁ ciently 
as possible.

Countermeasures
The market outlook for our expandable 
countermeasures business continues to be 
positive, although there are signs that the rate 
of market growth is starting to subside. Over 
the next three years, we believe that the global 
market will continue to expand at between 15% 
and 20% per annum, driven by strong demand 
from the US Air Force for advanced decoys 
to combat the latest air-to-air missile threats 
and the continued demand from NATO forces 
for the protection helicopters and transport 
aircraft during peacekeeping missions. Our 
successful track record in recent competitive 
procurements, such as the M212 contract, 
continues to give conﬁ dence that we can 
maintain our 50%+ market share position.
In Iraq, the enhanced security position has 
seen a gradual reduction in the operational 
consumption of decoys, particularly by the 
US Army. Moreover, the Iraqi government has 
now reached agreement with the US that all 
combat troops will be withdrawn by the end of 
2011. However, the Iraqi government is starting to 
procure signiﬁ cant improvements in its military 
equipment, and has recently submitted requests 
to the US Government to acquire quite sizeable 
numbers of helicopters and combat aircraft. 
In Afghanistan, the total number of US and 
NATO troops assigned to ISAF and Operation 
Enduring Freedom has increased to 79,000, 
and they continue to conduct extensive 
operations against the insurgents across the 
south of the country and on the border with 
Pakistan. The new US administration has 
indicated its intention to bolster the force with 
additional troops currently allocated to Iraq. 
The UK Ministry of Defence and other NATO 
nations also appear to be committing higher 
numbers of helicopters and aircraft to the 
mission, which will further increase demand for 
our products. 
A number of important new aircraft will enter 
service over the next ten years. In Europe, 
the introduction of Typhoon will have a major 
impact on demand for decoys, particularly for 
our BOL/IR special material decoys and other 
advanced technologies to combat sophisticated 
surface-to-air or air-to-air threats. However, 
the biggest growth is expected to be in the 
US market, where procurement of advanced 
ﬂ ares for new combat aircraft, namely the F-22 
and the F-35, is planned. 
F-22 decoy production will start full sustainment 
funding in 2010, when the full complement of 
aircraft and the need to establish a war reserve 
will signiﬁ cantly increase annual procurement 
quantities. Decoys for the F-35 start low rate 
production in 2009 and production volumes 
are expected to grow steadily over the next ten 
years as substantial numbers of aircraft enter 
service with the US, UK, Australia and other JSF 
partner nations.
The Australian Government has just awarded 
Chemring Australia a ten year contract, 
worth A$160 million, for the supply of 
countermeasures and pyrotechnics. As part of 
the arrangement, we will invest A$18 million 
in the build of a new state-of-the-art 
manufacturing facility near Melbourne and 
create a research and development centre 
for the design of future products. This new 
capability will allow Chemring Australia to bid for 
the second source supply for the F-35 decoys, 
and the additional production capacity will be 
used as part of the Group operations network to 
satisfy our global export ﬂ are requirements. 
Overall, the future outlook remains encouraging 
and many opportunities exist for growth. The 
Group has a strong order book, which now 
stands at a record level of £585 million, up 46% 
since January 2008. This large order book, 
our healthy cash ﬂ ow and strong balance sheet 
make the Board conﬁ dent that the prospects for 
the Group in 2009 continue to be excellent.

During the year, the April 2006 actuarial valuation for the 
UK Staff Pension Scheme was agreed with the scheme trustees, 
together with a funding plan to address the deﬁ cit on the scheme 
over the period to June 2014. The Group’s ongoing contributions 
to the scheme were reduced under the funding plan. However, 
the Group agreed to provide a £6 million bank guarantee to the 
scheme, which can be called upon in certain events of default 
by the Company. In addition, £5 million has been placed in an 
escrow account, to provide additional security to the scheme in 
the event of a default.
The next triennial valuations of the UK Executive Pension Scheme 
and the Staff Pension Scheme will be carried out as at 6 April 2009.
The Executive Pension Scheme is closed to new entrants.
The Staff Pension Scheme remains open for future accrual for 
current members but is only open to new employees at the 
discretion of the Board.
A new deﬁ ned contribution pension scheme was introduced in 
the UK during the year. This scheme is now the main source of 
pension provision for the Group’s UK employees. The majority 
of our overseas pension arrangements are deﬁ ned contribution, 
save in those European countries where certain deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
retirement payments are required.

On 14 November 2007, the Group completed a $150 million 
private placement of ten year ﬁ xed interest loans in the US with 
a number of institutional investors. The loan notes, which mature 
in 2017, carry an interest rate of approximately 6.30%. The 
proceeds were used to repay existing US dollar debt and provide 
additional working capital facilities for the Group.  CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 REVIEW BY THE FINANCE DIRECTOR 17
The directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on going 
concern. Whilst the current volatility in ﬁ nancial markets has 
created general uncertainty, the Group has signiﬁ cant working 
capital headroom, strong covenant compliance and a record 
order book. Accordingly, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that adequate ﬁ nancial resources will continue 
to be available for the foreseeable future.

Energetics strategy
Pyrotechnics and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)
Our strategy is to become the world leader in pyrotechnics, 
through focused investment in new products that displace 
existing incumbents and better meet our customers’ 
requirements. We also intend to consolidate the market through 
carefully selected acquisitions in both Europe and the US.
We aim to become the world leader in demolition stores, and 
signiﬁ cantly expand our expertise in EOD. We will become a 
major European competitor in the demilitarisation of unwanted 
ammunition and munitions, and we will develop a world-leading 
position in counter-mine and counter-IED technologies.
Munitions
Our strategy is to develop a position as the preferred supplier of 
energetic materials to the key prime contractors for ammunition 
and missiles in Europe and the US. This will be achieved through 
investment in new products, by targeted competition against 
existing sole-source suppliers, and by further complementary 
acquisitions. We will maintain our position as the world market 
leader in naval ammunition, and we will develop our focus as 
a prime contractor in certain special niche markets that are 
complementary to those of our principal customers.
Countermeasures strategy
The core strategy for the Countermeasures business is to maintain 
our share of the expendable countermeasures market and expand 
the business in line with the size of that market, which is expected 
to grow steadily over the next ﬁ ve years. We will increase our 
investment in new products and technologies, and will build on our 
current leadership in special material, spectral and thrusted ﬂ are 
technologies. We will continue to invest in new fully automated 
production facilities that will improve operator safety, signiﬁ cantly 
enhance our operational efﬁ ciency, and maintain our lead role in 
the development of new products for the next generation of ﬁ xed 
wing and rotary aircraft.
Geographic strategy
Our geographic strategy has ﬁ ve components:
We will maintain our US operations as 50% of the Group.
 We intend to manufacture in the US for the US market and in 
Europe for the European market. 
 We will use our excellent worldwide sales network to export both 
the Group’s and third parties’ products to global markets from 
both Europe and the US. 
 We will establish local manufacturing facilities in countries where 
we need to do so in order to access certain key national markets.
 We will increase our regional marketing presence in the Far East 
and the Middle East.

Contractual arrangements
As referred to above, the Group contracts with a wide range 
of customers, comprising governments, armed forces, prime 
contractors and OEMs across the globe. The US Department of 
Defense is the largest single customer, and procures the Group’s 
products under a signiﬁ cant number of separate contracts 
placed with individual Group businesses.
The Group’s businesses utilise many suppliers across the world, and 
arrangements are in place to ensure that businesses are not totally 
reliant on single suppliers for key raw materials or components.
Principal risks and uncertainties
As described on page 50 and 51, the Board is responsible for 
the Group’s systems of internal control and its risk management 
systems. The Board has constituted a Risk Management 
Committee, which meets quarterly, to review the key risks 
associated with the achievement of the annual budget and the 
ﬁ ve year plan for each business; the top ﬁ ve health and safety 
risks identiﬁ ed at each site; and the risk control procedures 
implemented. The Committee reports biannually to the Audit 
Committee and the Board and, through this process, the Board 
has identiﬁ ed the following principal risks currently facing 
the Group. The Group mitigates its risk exposure through an 
insurance programme that covers property and liability risks, 
where it is appropriate and cost effective to do so.
Health and safety risks 
The nature of the Group’s operations, involving energetic materials, 
is such that the Board considers health and safety to be a key area 
of focus in managing risk. Accordingly, health and safety is included 
on the agenda at every Board meeting and is also discussed at the 
monthly Group Executive Committee meeting. The Board believes 
that responsibility for the delivery of world class safety standards 
is an integral part of the operational management accountability, 
and managers are therefore expected to embrace a positive 
safety culture and to demonstrate leadership and commitment in 
the workplace. All employees are encouraged to report potential 
hazards, and to raise any health and safety concerns through the 
appropriate channels.
Our stated aim is to achieve zero injuries and to reduce health 
and safety risks, where they cannot be eliminated altogether, to 
a level which is “as low as reasonably practicable”. All businesses 
are expected to proactively manage their own risks but in addition, 
the top ﬁ ve site risks at each business and their associated 
mitigation programmes are reviewed on a monthly basis by the 
Group Executive Committee and quarterly by the Risk Management 
Committee. Technology and automation roadmaps support the 
Group’s strategy for risk reduction through increased automation 
and remote operations included within its ﬁ ve year plan. 
Further details on the Group’s approach to health and safety are 
set out in the Corporate Responsibility Report. 
Management resource
The Group requires competent management if it is to achieve 
its growth expectations, successfully integrate its acquired 
businesses and meet its aggressive order capture targets. 
Accordingly, the Group Executive Committee reviews the 
strengths and weaknesses of the management team at 
each business twice a year. We continue to strengthen the 
management organisation across the Group, and a number 
of new senior appointments have been made during the year. 
We have undertaken a detailed review of our future sales and 
marketing resource requirements, and a recruitment drive is now 
under way in this area. A similar review of engineering resource 
is in progress. 
A bespoke management development programme for our senior 
management will be delivered in 2009 by Henley Management 
College, with the intent that this will be rolled out to the next tier 
of management during 2010.
Competitors
Defence is a global industry, which is constantly challenged to 
counter ever-changing threats. The Group’s strategy is to focus 
on targeted niches in energetic materials and systems, 
Business Review
CONTINUED  CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 BUSINESS REVIEW 27
where the nature of the products and the requisite production 
and qualiﬁ cation processes provide signiﬁ cant barriers to new 
entrants. However, as threats evolve, new businesses offering 
new solutions may enter the market. 
The nature of the threat from missiles and other weapons 
is continually changing, particularly as new platforms are 
introduced in different countries, and countermeasures 
solutions need to develop on an ongoing basis to meet the 
enhanced requirements. The number of countermeasures 
manufacturers is currently small but as technologies change, 
existing manufacturers compete for new products and new 
businesses can enter into the market. The Group is currently 
the world leader in the supply and manufacture of expendable 
countermeasures, with a number of proprietary products, 
and we intend to maintain this position through our continued 
investment in research and development, and world class 
manufacturing facilities.
Timing of orders
The Group has a very strong order book but in general, the 
majority of the Group’s contracts are of a relatively short 
duration and, with the exception of framework contracts with 
key customers, do not usually cover multi-year requirements. 
This means that an unmitigated delay in the receipt of key orders 
could affect the Group’s earnings, and achievement of its growth 
targets, in a given ﬁ nancial year. Maximising order intake is 
therefore a key priority for the Group. We are addressing this 
through the strengthening of our sales and marketing resources. 
The development of world class manufacturing facilities, with 
the ability to transfer manufacture across sites, also provides 
us with the ﬂ exibility to change our manufacturing schedules if 
anticipated orders are delayed and need to be replaced at short 
notice, and to satisfy our customers’ surge requirements. 
Introduction of new products
The Group’s approach to innovation and continued research 
and development activity ensure that we are continually 
adding new products to the range. During the year, our position 
was further strengthened in this area by the demand for our 
countermeasures on a range of new platforms.
In order to satisfy these requirements, we need to ensure that 
new product development is completed in a timely manner to a 
standard which allows us to undertake volume manufacturing, 
and to produce products against high reliability and safety criteria 
to meet our customers’ requirements. New manufacturing 
facilities have been established in the year to accommodate the 
production of these new products, and in other areas, there has 
been a requirement to signiﬁ cantly increase capacity on our 
existing production lines. This necessitates careful management 
of contractors - where construction work is being undertaken, 
suppliers - where new components have to be qualiﬁ ed for use 
in our products, and employees - where training in new skills 
is required. We continue to introduce Six Sigma techniques as 
appropriate within the organisation to improve our manufacturing 
capabilities. This investment in new facilities is ongoing.
Introduction of new manufacturing facilities 
Over the next two years, we will be investing signiﬁ cant capital 
expenditure in the establishment of new countermeasures 
manufacturing facilities in the UK and Australia. We need to 
ensure that these facilities are completed within budget and on 
time, in order to maximise our manufacturing capacity for our 
future growth expectations. We have appointed a senior Project 
Director to oversee the design and construction activities, and 
progress is being monitored by the Group Executive Committee.     
Technology transfers 
The formation by the Group of centres-of-excellence for the 
production of energetic materials has generated considerable 
interest from major prime contractors in both the US and 
Europe, who are looking for strategic partners. Progressing the 
development of these relationships and securing the transfer 
of technologies from these large prime contractors is a key 
objective for the Group over the next ﬁ ve years. Accordingly, 
the Group has been recruiting new personnel to manage these 
activities, and reviewing manufacturing capabilities and investing 
capital where necessary, to ensure that we mitigate the risk 
associated with the technology transfers and maximise the 
opportunities that are presented.
Management of prime contracts
The Energetics division now has substantial prime contracts with a 
number of countries, and is planning to secure more. The contracts 
provide for the supply of an extensive range of our own and third 
party products over the next three years, and require a particular 
type of programme management expertise. Dedicated programme 
managers have been appointed, with a reporting chain through 
to the Group Executive Committee, which undertakes a regular 
high level review of programme status and supply chain issues. 
During the year we appointed additional personnel with specialist 
knowledge of the management of offset requirements and complex 
export compliance issues for this growing area of business.
Political risks
It is recognised that the nature of the current military operations 
around the world may change over the next three to ﬁ ve years. 
Our energetics activities are less dependent on these military 
activities, particularly as our product portfolio continues to grow 
in areas such as training and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).
We do not believe that the Group’s countermeasures business 
will be signiﬁ cantly impacted by a change in current military 
operations, as our products will still be required to provide 
defensive protection during the continuing peacekeeping 
activities. Growth in the countermeasures business will be 
delivered as our proprietary products are ﬁ tted to a range of new 
platforms in the US and Europe.
The US Department of Defense is the Group’s largest customer. 
At the present time, we do not foresee any signiﬁ cant change 
to the level of future demand for the Group’s products in the US 
following the recent change in administration. 
Compliance and corruption risks
The Group has committed to adherence to the European 
Aerospace and Defence Association’s Common Industry 
Standards on Anti-Corruption, and is currently reviewing all of its 
business processes in order to achieve full compliance. 
Economic risks
Fortunately, the Group has not been greatly affected by the difﬁ cult 
economic conditions prevailing in many countries around the world 
and the Board continues to believe that the future prospects for the 
Group are very good. However, we will continue to closely monitor 
our potential exposure to further economic changes. 
Financial risks
Details of the ﬁ nancial risks to which the Group is potentially 
exposed are set out in Note 24 of the ﬁ nancial statements. Corporate Responsibility Report
Corporate responsibility management
and accountability
The Board fully acknowledges its obligation to ensure the 
responsible operation of the Group’s businesses at all times 
with due regard to the interests of shareholders, employees, 
customers, suppliers and the wider community. The Board 
has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining 
the Group’s policies in this area, and the Chief Executive 
is accountable to the Board for ensuring that the Group’s 
businesses adhere to these policies.
Business conduct
The Group has adopted a Code of Business Principles, which 
requires our employees, our businesses and all third parties who 
act on our behalf to comply with our standards of acceptable 
business conduct and applicable laws and regulations in all of 
the countries in which we operate. The managing directors of 
each business are required to report to the Chief Executive on 
compliance with the Code of Business Principles on an annual basis. 
Ethics and anti-corruption
The Group has committed to adherence with the European 
Aerospace and Defence Association’s Common Industry 
Standards on Anti-Corruption, and we are currently reviewing all 
of our business processes across the Group in order to ensure 
that we achieve full compliance. This involves entering into new 
arrangements, compliant with the Common Industry Standards, 
with all of our agents and other third parties who act on behalf 
of the Group. Our Code of Business Principles has also been 
updated to incorporate the Common Industry Standards. 
Our US businesses have adopted an ethical compliance 
programme to satisfy US Government requirements for ethical 
training for employees, compliance audits, an employees’ 
“hotline”, and related investigation procedures. We are currently 
running a similar ethics and anti-corruption training programme 
for the management of our businesses outside of the US.
The Group has a whistleblowing policy and procedures in place 
which enable all employees to raise concerns, in conﬁ dence, 
about possible improprieties. These arrangements now reﬂ ect 
the requirements of the Common Industry Standards.
Policy on the sale of goods and services
The Group’s strategy is to become the world leader in the 
manufacture energetic material products and countermeasures 
for the global defence market, and we are presently delivering 
signiﬁ cant growth in this area though a combination of organic 
development and acquisitions. The scope of the Group’s activities 
has signiﬁ cantly widened over the last few years, particularly 
with regards to the supply of components and sub-systems for 
various types of munitions, and there is increasing demand 
for the supply to our customers of third party products. 
Consequently, the Board has adopted a Policy on the Sale of 
Goods and Services, which provides guidance to all stakeholders 
on the products and services that the Group will supply and to 
which customers, and sets out a clear deﬁ nition of what we will 
not supply. 
Health and safety 
The Board recognises that the highest levels of safety are required 
in order to protect our employees, whilst achieving growth and 
maintaining leadership in the Group’s chosen markets. The Board 
believes that all injuries are preventable, and management systems 
and a long term strategy have been adopted to ensure that we 
continually improve our performance and reduce risk within the 
constraints of what is reasonably achievable. 
The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for health, safety and 
environmental matters across the Group. A new Director of Safety 
was appointed during the year, who reports directly to the 
Chief Executive, and is responsible for the effective administration 
and implementation of the Group’s health, safety and 
environmental strategy. Strategic direction is considered by the 
Group’s Risk Management Committee, and the Director of Safety 
reports to the Executive Committee on the performance of the 
businesses against agreed objectives. The Chief Executive reports 
monthly to the Board on all key health and safety issues.
The Board requires that all businesses systematically manage 
their health, safety and environment hazards, set objectives, 
monitor progress by regular measurement, audit and review, and 
take additional action where necessary. Each Managing Director 
is responsible for the management of health, safety and 
environmental issues within their business and for providing 
adequate resources to satisfy the Board’s requirements. 
Managers are required to enforce procedures, and to provide 
leadership and commitment to promote and embrace a positive 
health and safety culture. We emphasise the importance of 
individual responsibility for health and safety at all levels of the 
organisation. We expect employees to report potential hazards, 
to be involved in implementing solutions, and to adhere to rules 
and procedures. 
We recognise that a key element in the continual improvement 
of health, safety, and environmental management is sharing 
best practice and lessons learnt from incidents across all 
of the Group companies. A common incident reporting and 
investigation procedure is in place, as well as an alert system 
that formally ensures key ﬁ ndings from incidents are quickly 
communicated to all operational sites and actions taken as 
appropriate. All accidents and near misses are investigated. 
An annual Group health, safety and environment conference is 
attended by representatives from all businesses, and a Health, 
Safety and Environment Technical Committee supports continual 
improvement through the development and promotion of good 
practice across the Group and provision of training and support.
We continue our successful implementation of formal management 
systems across the business and now have seven sites validated 
as compliant with the health and safety management system 
OHSAS18001. We require all newly-acquired businesses to 
achieve certiﬁ cation within two years of joining the Group and, 
with the exception of these businesses, we expect all other Group 
companies to have achieved certiﬁ cation by the end of 2009.
28 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 Whilst we are pleased to report that there were no serious safety 
incidents in the year, our safety programmes have been heavily 
inﬂ uenced by the incident which occurred at Simmel Difesa in 
October 2007, which led to the death of one of our employees. 
Following the incident, a formal structured investigation and root 
cause analysis was undertaken using an established process. 
This generated a series of actions which were disseminated 
across the Group. We are determined to do all we can to minimise 
the likelihood of similar incidents in the future. 
Following three years of static lost time performance, added 
focus on the management of health and safety resulted in a real 
improvement in performance during the year, with our lost time 
incident rate (calculated using the US OSHA rules) reducing from 
1.56 to 1.20 incidents per 100 employees, as set out below:
This performance improvement has been achieved by 
implementation of several structured and formal
processes including:
cultural development
product safety management
introduction of formal “safety case” processes
enhanced training
manufacturing process reﬁ nement
extended audit programmes; and
product safety reviews.
Six of our sites reported no lost work days in the year, which is an 
excellent achievement.
A focus on “near misses” during the year resulted in 1,332 near 
misses being formally reported and acted upon. Employees 
are encouraged to report issues, however small, which then go 
through a rigorous corrective action process.

In recognition of the need to drive further improvements in the 
management of health and safety within the Group, we embarked 
upon a project to develop and establish a common safety culture 
across the Group’s businesses. The project undertook audits 
and employee culture surveys at most sites in Europe and the 
US, and from the themes which emerged, a number of common 
approaches have been deﬁ ned including leadership behaviour, 
training and competence, maintenance management and the 
implementation of safety case methodology.  The project also 
included a review of the Group’s health, safety and environment 
management system, which has been updated and re-published 
as a result.
Cultural development is an ongoing activity and further actions 
will emerge.
Newly-acquired businesses are rapidly introduced to the Group’s 
safety philosophy, with detailed regulatory compliance audits 
and programme gap analysis. Risk registers are compiled and 
businesses are required to reduce their major health and safety 
risks to as low as reasonably practicable.
In the US, all businesses participated in a process safety 
management workshop, with external speakers, to ensure that a 
common level of knowledge and awareness was in place and best 
practice networks established.
 
The Group has committed to substantial investments in facilities 
that will, in addition to improving productivity, improve the safety 
of the workforce by reducing the levels of risk. 
The Group has also established a relationship with 
Cranﬁ eld University, both for the supply of employee training 
programmes and for the development of simulation modelling 
to evaluate blast and thermal effects from the ignition of 
pyrotechnic materials. 
Environment 
The Board believes that environmental protection will help to 
secure the long term future of our businesses. The Group’s 
Health, Safety and Environment Policy states that we will control 
pollution, minimise the quantity of material burnt at each site, 
consume resources efﬁ ciently, and use materials that minimise 
the environmental impact of our operations where practicable. 
We now have ten sites certiﬁ ed to the environmental 
management system ISO14001. As with OHSAS18001, we require 
all newly-acquired businesses to achieve ISO14001 certiﬁ cation 
within two years of joining the Group. All other businesses are 
expected to achieve certiﬁ cation by the end of 2009.
Our ISO14001 programme requires that all sites have their own 
goals and objectives which are very much focused on local 
aspects and impacts. However, we continue to monitor key 
environmental data from a Group perspective, speciﬁ cally energy 
consumption to allow us to derive CO
2
 emissions and waste.

CONTINUED
We are continually improving our waste management and 
percentage of waste recycled. Our total waste volumes are 
dominated by a caustic etching process at Alloy Surfaces, which 
prepares metal products for coating. The waste is sold to a 
third party who is able to use it as feedstock for waste water 
treatment. This has eliminated the discharge of 6,177 tonnes of 
process water to local sewer systems, signiﬁ cantly reducing the 
need for the third parties to purchase neutralisation materials. 
Our total non-recycled waste in the year, excluding that generated 
by businesses acquired during the year, was as follows:
Non-hazardous 1,027 tonnes
Hazardous 1,425 tonnes
Total 2,452 tonnes
In order to better understand our CO
2
 sources, the Group 
monitored car and air travel throughout the year to gauge the 
size of this impact against the more easily accessible utilities data. 
The year of data collection revealed that only 2.77% of our total 
CO
2
 emissions were generated by travel. As this data capture was 
difﬁ cult and time-consuming, we propose not to collect this data in 
the coming year but may return and check it again at some stage 
in the future. Our major source of CO
2
 is indirect emission from 
electrical power generation. All Group businesses now have goals 
to reduce their future consumption. A breakdown of CO
2
 emissions 
is set out below:  
Our total emissions, excluding those of businesses acquired during 
the year, in CO
2
 equivalents were as follows:
 Source
 
2008
(tonnes CO
2
)
 
2007
(tonnes CO
2
)
  Electricity 27,131 21,556
  Gas 12,384 11,931
  Oil 2,351 2,878
 Total 41,866 36,365
Our total CO
2
 emissions increased by 15% in a year in which 
the Group’s revenue increased by 39%. Whilst this reduction in 
intensity is pleasing, we will increase our efforts to address energy 
conservation and thus indirect emissions in the future.
This year we are monitoring water consumption. Dependant
upon what we ﬁ nd we may establish future targets and 
improvement programmes.
During the year we acquired Scot, Inc., which is based in 
Downers Grove, Illinois, USA. We were aware, prior to acquiring 
the business, that the Downers Grove area has “superfund” 
status under the US contaminated land (CERCLA) regime, and 
this was reﬂ ected in the price agreed for the business. There 
is a £5.0 million provision in respect of the pre-acquisition 
environmental liabilities associated with the site, which the 
Board considers to be adequate (see Note 25 of the ﬁ nancial 
statements). We are now working with external consultants to 
ensure that the legal obligations of the business in relation to 
this matter are fully satisﬁ ed.
Employees
The Board recognises the valuable contribution that the Group’s 
employees continue to make to its success, and aims to provide a 
working environment that reﬂ ects and rewards this. The Group now 
has over 3,000 employees in seven countries.
The Group pursues a policy of employee communication through 
meetings (including team brieﬁ ngs and works councils) and 
in-house magazines by which employees are made aware of the 
progress of the Group and the companies in which they work. A 
Group magazine, The Chemring Eye, was introduced during the 
year, which is distributed to all our employees on a quarterly basis 
and has been well-received to date. 
We continue to address training and development requirements 
for employees at all levels within the organisation. We are in the 
process of implementing a tailored management development 
programme for senior managers in the Group, which will be 
delivered by Henley Management College. This will subsequently 
be rolled-out to the next tier of management. Succession planning, 
human resource requirements and the future organisational 
structure of the Group as it continues to grow are reviewed on a 
regular basis by the Board.

of a savings-related share option scheme at the last Annual 
General Meeting. The Chemring Group 2008 UK Sharesave Plan 
was launched for UK employees in July 2008, and The Chemring 
2008 US Stock Purchase Plan was launched for US employees in 
August 2008. The Board is keen to encourage eligible employees 
to join the schemes in order that they can share in the future 
success of the Group. Provided that there is sufﬁ cient interest 
from employees, we also intend to introduce similar schemes in the 
other countries in which we operate.
The Group employs disabled persons wherever circumstances 
permit, and full and fair consideration is given to applications for 
employment by disabled persons having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and disabilities. Disabled persons in employment receive 
equal treatment to that afforded to other employees, in line with 
the Group’s philosophy of equal opportunities for all employees, 
irrespective of race, nationality, gender, disability or age. The 
Group is committed to meeting, at a minimum, the labour rights 
and legislation requirements in each country in which it operates, 
and in practice, often exceeds these. These policies are introduced 
at newly-acquired businesses at the earliest opportunity after they 
join the Group. During the year, Martin Electronics received an 
award from its local governor, by which it was recognised as one of 
Florida’s top employers of persons with development disabilities. 
Community
The Board recognises that each of the Group’s businesses has an 
important role to play in its local community. 
The Board operates a charitable policy, which conﬁ rms its 
commitment to support selected charitable causes with a focus 
on the military and armed services, and those linked to the local 
communities in which the Group’s businesses operate. At a Group 
level, charitable donations are considered on a monthly basis by 
the Executive Committee, and each business has its own locally 
held charity budget. Examples of support provided during the 
year include:
 Donations to a range of charities including “Help for Heroes”, 
the Falklands Veterans’ Association, Wiltshire Air Ambulance, 
the Salvation Army, various local hospitals and hospices, and 
ongoing support for the Mary Rose Appeal. 
 Sole sponsorship of the 7 Air Assault Battalion Royal Electrical 
and Mechanical Engineers (REME) Royal Navy Field Gun Crew.  
The Group is proud to be associated with the 7 Air Assault 
Battalion, who provide support to the vehicles, weapons and 
aircraft of 16 Air Assault Brigade.  The soldiers support aircraft 
in various areas of conﬂ ict around the world. 
 Sponsorship of a UK employee in his efforts to compete in his 
chosen sport of archery at the 2012 Olympics. 
•
•
•
In addition to making cash donations, the Group also encourages 
and supports employees who undertake voluntary work in 
the local community, where appropriate. During the year, our 
employees donated their time and services on a wide range of 
projects, several of which had an educational bias.
The Group is involved with a number of educational initiatives, 
notably including the sponsorship of various local schools. Each 
year, Kilgore awards a scholarship to a student graduating from 
its local high school to enable the student to pursue a college 
education. Certain businesses are assisting their employees 
who did not graduate from senior school to return to academic 
studies in order to supplement their vocational training. The 
Group has a partnership agreement with Cranﬁ eld University, 
under which the Group has committed to the provision of 
signiﬁ cant funding for students’ research activities over the next 
ﬁ ve years. The Group has also instigated a programme which 
aims to attract new graduates to pursue a career in the Group, 
and we are now offering gap year placements in the UK.
 
With regards to the impact of our manufacturing activities 
on the local community, at locations where our operations 
may inconvenience neighbours through product prooﬁ ng, we 
liaise with local residents to minimise any impact. We are also 
cognisant of the potential impact of our operations on the 
local environment, and we are addressing this through our 
environmental strategy.

Approach to share ownership
The Group actively encourages its employees to share in the future success of the Group. The UK Sharesave Plan and the US Stock 
Purchase Plan were both launched during the year, following approval at the Annual General Meeting held on 20 March 2008. The 
Board is currently considering the establishment of similar schemes for employees in Group companies outside of the UK and the US.
Share capital and shareholder rights
General
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares of 5p each and preference shares of £1 each, which are fully paid up and 
quoted on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Full details of the movements in the authorised and issued share capital of 
the Company during the ﬁ nancial year are provided in Note 27 of the ﬁ nancial statements.
All holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at any general meeting of the Company and to appoint a proxy 
or proxies to exercise these rights. At a general meeting, every shareholder present in person, by proxy or (in the case of a corporate 
member) by corporate representative has one vote on a show of hands, and on a poll has one vote for every share held.
To decide who can attend or vote at a general meeting, the notice of meeting can give a time, which must not be more than 48 hours 
before the meeting, by which shareholders must have entered on the register in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting.
If a shareholder has been properly served with notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 requiring information about 
interests in shares, and has failed to supply such information within 14 days after the service of the notice, then the shareholder is not 
entitled to attend and vote at a shareholder meeting.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company other than certain restrictions which may 
from time to time be imposed by law, for example insider trading law. In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, certain employees are required to seek the approval of the Company to deal in its shares.
The cumulative preference shares carry an entitlement to a dividend at the rate of 7p per share per annum, payable in equal 
instalments on 30 April and 31 October each year. Holders of the preference shares have the right on winding-up to receive, in priority 
to any other classes of shares, the sum of £1 per share together with any arrears of dividends.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
and/or voting rights.
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders.

Issue of shares
Under the provisions of section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”) the Board is prevented from exercising its powers under 
the Articles of Association (“the Articles”) to allot shares without an authority in terms of the Act contained either in the Articles or 
in a resolution of the shareholders in general meeting. The authority, when given, can last for a maximum period of ﬁ ve years, but the 
Board proposes that renewal should be sought at each Annual General Meeting. Such proposal is set out as resolution 9 in the Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting.
Section 89 of the Act requires that an allotment of shares for cash may not be made unless the shares are ﬁ rst offered to existing 
shareholders on a pre-emptive basis in accordance with the terms of the Act. In accordance with general practice, to ensure that 
small issues of shares can be made without the necessity of convening a general meeting, the Board proposes that advantage be 
taken of the provisions of section 95 of the Act to not apply the Act’s pre-emptive requirements. Accordingly, a special resolution (set 
out as resolution 10 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting) will be proposed which, if passed, will have the effect of granting the 
directors the power to allot not more than 5% of the present issued ordinary share capital free of the requirements of section 89 of 
the Act. No issue of these shares will be made which would effectively alter the control of the Company without prior approval of the 
shareholders in general meeting.
Purchase of own shares
During the year the Company purchased 160,000 (2007: 150,000) of its ordinary shares. At 31 October 2008, the Company held a 
total of 310,000 ordinary shares in treasury (representing 0.9% of the ordinary shares in issue on 1 November 2008). All purchases of 
ordinary shares were by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange. Further details can be found in Note 30 of 
the ﬁ nancial statements.
A special resolution (set out as resolution 11 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting) will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, to renew the Company’s authority to purchase its own shares in the market up to a limit of 10% of its issued ordinary share 
capital. The maximum and minimum prices are stated in the resolution. The directors believe that it is advantageous for the Company to 
have this ﬂ exibility to make market purchases of its own shares. The directors of the Company will consider holding repurchased shares 
pursuant to the authority conferred by this resolution as treasury shares. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue treasury 
shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional ﬂ exibility in the management of its capital base. 
Any issues of treasury shares for the purposes of the Company’s employee share schemes will be made within the 10% anti-dilution limit 
set by the Association of British Insurers. The directors will only exercise this authority if they are satisﬁ ed that a purchase would result in 
an increase in expected earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the ﬁ nancial statements. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. The directors are required by 
the IAS Regulations to prepare the Group accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. The Group ﬁ nancial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁ nancial statements 
present fairly for each ﬁ nancial year the Company’s ﬁ nancial position, ﬁ nancial performance and cash ﬂ ows. This requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the deﬁ nitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the Preparation 
and Presentation of Financial Statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all 
applicable International Financial Reporting Standards. Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁ c requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards 
is insufﬁ cient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
ﬁ nancial position and ﬁ nancial performance;
 for the Company ﬁ nancial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed; and
 prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern, 
management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities and for the preparation of a directors’ report, which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors conﬁ rm that suitable accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgments and 
estimates, have been used in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements, and that applicable accounting standards have been followed.

Directors’ Responsibility Statement
We conﬁ rm to the best of our knowledge that:
 the ﬁ nancial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position, and proﬁ t and loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole; and
 the Statement by the Chairman, the Review by the Chief Executive, the Review by the Finance Director, the Business Review and the 
Corporate Responsibility Statement, which are cross-referred from the Directors’ Report, include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face. 
Provision of information to auditors
Each of the directors at the date of approval of this report conﬁ rms that:
 so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
 the director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁ rmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Close company provisions
As far as the directors are aware, the close company provisions of the Taxes Acts do not apply to the Group nor has there been any 
change in that respect since 31 October 2008.
Auditors
On 1 December 2008, Deloitte & Touche LLP changed its name to Deloitte LLP. A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditors will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 March 2009, together with explanatory notes, appear 
in the separate Notice of Annual General Meeting sent to all shareholders.

• Directors’ Remuneration Report
This report sets out the information required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”). The Report 
has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors’ remuneration in the Combined 
Code. As required by the Regulations, the Directors’ Remuneration Report will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting on 25 March 2009.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee comprised:
Mr I F R Much (Committee Chairman)
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman
Mr K C Scobie
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
 determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing from time to time the overall policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the 
executive directors, the Company Secretary and certain other senior executives in the Group, and their individual remuneration 
packages and any changes thereto;
 approving the terms and conditions of employment, and any changes thereto, of the executive directors; 
 approving any compensation payments for executive directors;
 approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group;
 reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and the Company’s shareholders; and
 overseeing any major changes in employee beneﬁ ts structures across the Group.
None of the Committee members has any personal ﬁ nancial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee (other than the 
Chairman in respect of his own remuneration; accordingly, he is not present during any discussions relating to this matter), nor do 
they have any conﬂ icts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and they are not involved in the day to day running of the Group’s 
business. Therefore, they are regarded by the Board as independent.
The Committee met six times during the year. The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but is not present during any 
discussions relating to his own remuneration. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Advisers
During the year the Committee received advice on remuneration matters from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Committee also consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Committee’s policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market 
rates across comparator companies, reﬂ ect the performance of the business against ﬁ nancial objectives, and which take into account the 
individual contribution and performance of each executive director. Remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
(i) basic salary and beneﬁ ts, including pensions;
(ii) annual bonuses linked to the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance; and 
(iii)  awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a signiﬁ cant proportion 
of remuneration is performance-related. This is achieved through the performance-related elements of annual bonuses and 
share-based incentives.
In January 2008, the Committee decided that it needed to undertake a full review of the total remuneration packages which applied 
to the executive directors and senior managers, against the background of the substantial growth achieved by the Group in terms of 
revenue, proﬁ ts and market capitalisation over the last few years and the enhanced complexity of the Group arising from this growth.

38 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 This review was carried out using a number of published reports prepared by third parties and an independent report which was 
commissioned from Hewitt New Bridge Street. The main ﬁ ndings of the report were that:
 directors’ ﬁ xed pay levels were at or below lower quartile when compared with both sector companies and general companies of 
similar turnover and market capitalisation;
 the maximum annual bonus potential for directors of 60% of salary was signiﬁ cantly below the market norm; and
 the total value of the remuneration package of both of the executive directors was at or below the market lower quartile. 
Following this review, the Committee decided to increase basic salaries from 1 April 2008 for Dr Price and Mr Rayner to £400,000 per 
annum and £250,000 per annum respectively to reﬂ ect their outstanding performance and to bring them closer to market norms. It also 
agreed to increase the maximum bonus potential for the executive directors to 100% of salary with effect from 1 November 2008. 
The Committee believes that these changes achieve the correct balance between an appropriate level of basic pay and the 
opportunity to see increased levels of variable pay if the Group continues to be as successful as in the last three years. The Committee 
is comfortable that the resulting packages are appropriate, given the strong recent growth of the Company, and necessary to ensure 
the retention of key executives whose recent performance has proved their signiﬁ cant value to the business and shareholders.
Basic salaries and beneﬁ ts
The executive directors’ basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into 
account individual performance and comparable salary levels in manufacturing companies of a similar size and in other companies 
within the aerospace and defence sector. The Committee refers to published salary surveys and data provided by its remuneration 
advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information presented in the annual reports of companies in 
the reference group. 
The main taxable beneﬁ ts for executive directors are company cars, fuel for private motoring and private medical insurance.
Annual bonuses
During the year under review, the Company operated an annual performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors, with key 
characteristics as follows:
 a maximum bonus potential for the executive directors of 60% of basic salary, with an on-target bonus of 30% of basic salary;
 three quarters of the bonus potential linked to two separate ﬁ nancial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and 
cash ﬂ ow (with equal weighting). The conditions, which are set by the Committee, take into account a number of factors including 
budget, market expectations, long term growth prospects and the previous year’s out-turn. No bonus is payable for achievement 
of less than 90% of target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better 
achievement of target;
 one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with the satisfaction of personal objective criteria set at the 
beginning of the ﬁ nancial year. These comprise a mixture of short term and longer term objectives linked to the delivery of the 
Company’s strategic plan. No part of this element of bonus is payable unless threshold performance of both the ﬁ nancial conditions 
described above is achieved; 
 one quarter of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Company’s shares, with vesting subject to continued 
employment (save in good leaver scenarios) three years from the award of bonus; and 
 the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the discretion of the Committee.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
The table below summarises the bonuses earned by the executive directors, as a percentage of basic salary, in respect of the current 
and last years:

 CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 39 As noted above, the review undertaken by the Committee in January 2008 identiﬁ ed that a maximum annual bonus potential of 60% 
of salary for executive directors is below market norms. The median maximum bonus in both comparator groups and the FTSE 250 as 
a whole is 100% of salary. It has therefore been agreed that, with effect from 1 November 2008, the maximum bonus potential for the 
executive directors will increase to 100% of annual salary, with appropriate targets to ensure that the upper quartile of payments is 
only achieved in exceptional years. All other aspects of the bonus scheme will remain unchanged (namely 25% deferred in shares and 
bonus determined by a mixture of EPS, cash ﬂ ow and personal targets).
In relation to this increase in bonus potential, shareholders can take comfort from the Committee’s track record of setting highly 
challenging bonus targets in recent years, as evidenced by the fact that the executive directors have not received maximum bonuses 
in any of the last four years despite outstanding levels of EPS growth and returns to shareholders (see chart below).

Performance share plan
The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior 
management team who inﬂ uence the performance and prospects of the Group. The key features of the plan are as follows:
 conditional awards can be made of the Company’s shares worth no more than 100% of basic salary each year;
 awards will vest three years after grant subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved 
over a single three year performance period (with no ability to re-test the performance condition). The performance condition is 
based on the growth of the Company’s earnings per share in excess of RPI over three consecutive ﬁ nancial years. The Committee 
considers an earnings per share condition to most closely align the interests of participants with those of the Company’s 
shareholders; 
 the following vesting schedule applies in respect of awards made prior to 23 January 2007:
Total earnings per share growth 
per annum (not compounded) 
over three ﬁ nancial years
Percentage of the total
number of shares under an 
award that vest
Less than RPI + 5% Nil

 the following vesting schedule applies in respect of awards made on or after 23 January 2008. The Committee has determined that this 
highly challenging performance condition remains appropriate for any awards which may be made during the current ﬁ nancial year:
Total earnings per share growth 
per annum (not compounded) 
over three ﬁ nancial years
Percentage of the total
number of shares under an 
award that vest
Less than RPI + 10% Nil
RPI + 10% 25%
RPI + 30% or more 100%
Between RPI + 10% and RPI + 30%
Between 25%-100% on a
straight-line basis
 earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as speciﬁ ed by the Committee prior to grant; and
 market purchase shares or new issue shares (including treasury shares) may be used to satisfy awards. To the extent that new issue 
shares or treasury shares are used, these will count towards the usual share usage dilution limits (10% in ten years for all schemes 
and 5% in ten years for discretionary (executive) schemes).
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the Committee to the executive directors and senior management of the 
Group, both in the UK and overseas. The following awards were made under the plan during the year:
 Date of award
 
Total number of 
shares awarded
 
Number of 
participants
receiving awards
  23 Jan 2008 98,771 24
Details of the awards made to executive directors during the year are set out on page 45. The Committee has veriﬁ ed that the current 
annual awards to the executive directors of performance shares worth 100% of salary are around market compared to the Company’s 
two comparator groups and the FTSE 250 as a whole. The current arrangements for the level of awards to the executive directors 
under the plan will therefore remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.
The executive directors are expected to build-up, over a ﬁ ve year period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the 
Company equivalent to one year’s basic salary. Other participants in the plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to 25% of 
their basic salary following vesting of the awards.
During the year, the Company purchased 160,000 (2007: 150,000) treasury shares at a cost of £2.9 million for use in the plan.
Other schemes
The Company introduced all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK (The Chemring Group 2008 Sharesave Plan) and the 
US (The Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan) during the year. There are no performance criteria for these arrangements and 
options are issued to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue and Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations.
Between 1998 and 2005 the Company operated the Chemring 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme. Following the introduction 
of the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan, no further grants have been made under the option scheme, save in exceptional 
circumstances such as on recruitment, and the conditions applying to any such grants have accorded with current corporate 
governance best practice. The scheme ceased to operate for any new grants on 4 March 2008. 
The Company previously operated a long term incentive scheme known as the Chemring Group PLC Share Based Incentive Scheme. 
This scheme is not being utilised at present.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within “Executive Remuneration - ABI Guidelines on Policies and 
Practices”. At 31 October 2008, awards outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted 
to 2.87% of the ordinary share capital of the Company. At 31 October 2008, awards outstanding and issued under executive share 
schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 2.71% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.

Performance graph
The following graph shows a comparison of the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) over the last ﬁ ve ﬁ nancial years against a 
“broad equity market index”, as required by the Regulations. The FTSE 250 Index has been selected by the Committee for this comparison 
because it provides the most appropriate measure of performance of listed companies of a similar size to the Company.
Pensions
Dr Price is a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme (“the Staff Scheme”). This is an approved ﬁ nal salary scheme, 
which is contracted out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds of salary, 
subject to Inland Revenue limits. The Staff Scheme also provides life assurance cover, dependants’ pensions and lump sum payments 
on death-in-service. Members of the Staff Scheme are required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of 
pensionable salary.
Dr Price’s pension under the Staff Scheme accrues at 1/80th of ﬁ nal pensionable salary for each year of membership, and he 
also accrues a cash lump sum at 3/80ths of ﬁ nal pensionable salary for each year of membership. On death-in-service, Dr Price’s 
dependants would receive a lump sum payment of two times basic salary and, in addition, a 50% spouses’ pension would be payable. 
Dr Price is subject to an earnings cap (equivalent to the cap applied by HM Revenue and Customs prior to April 2006) in respect of his 
membership of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayner is a member of the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme (“the Executive Scheme”). The Executive Scheme is also an 
approved ﬁ nal salary scheme but is not contracted out of the State Second Pension. Members of the Executive Scheme are required 
to make monthly contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of pensionable salary. Mr Rayner’s beneﬁ ts under the Executive 
Scheme accrue in an identical manner to that in which Dr Price accrues beneﬁ ts under the Staff Scheme, as set out above, save that 
a two-thirds’ spouses pension is payable in respect of service accrued to 31 January 2004, reducing to 50% for service accrued 
thereafter. Mr Rayner is also subject to an earnings cap.
Although the current pension arrangements for the executive directors (1/80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings 
cap) are well below market norms, the Committee determined, following its January 2008 review, that it would not change either the 
accrual rate or the notional earnings cap.
Both Dr Price and Mr Rayner have a normal retirement age of 65.  CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 43
Service contracts
Dr Price has a rolling service contract dated 4 April 2005. This provides for termination by either party on twelve months’ notice. 
The Company may however terminate without notice, and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of the salary due for 
the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual beneﬁ ts. Any such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these 
circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayner has a rolling service contract dated 27 August 1999. This provides for termination by either party on twelve months’ notice. 
The Company may however terminate without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of twelve months’ salary 
plus the value of any contractual beneﬁ ts. There are no other provisions relating to compensation on early termination.
It is the Committee’s general policy that all new executive directors appointed in the future will have service contracts with the 
Company which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months’ notice. The service contracts will contain provisions permitting the 
Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and will require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Policy on outside appointments
With the speciﬁ c approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive 
directors of other companies, provided that they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group, and may retain any related 
fees paid to them. Neither of the executive directors currently hold any such external appointments.
Non-executive directors
Mr Scobie has a service contract with the Company which will expire at the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting in 
March 2010, unless terminated earlier on twelve months’ notice by either party. His appointment may be extended by one further 
year by mutual agreement of both parties. His remuneration under the contract, part of which is paid to his company for consultancy 
services, is £125,000 per annum. He is required to devote such time to his role as is reasonably necessary for the proper performance 
of his duties. 
Mr Evans, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss have letters of appointment covering, 
amongst other items, their terms of appointment and expected time commitment. These letters of appointment provide for 
three year appointments, unless terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months’ written notice. 
Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss are currently serving their second three year terms as non-executive directors, which 
will expire on 30 April 2010 and 30 November 2010 respectively. It is anticipated that, subject to satisfactory performance, 
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman will also be invited to serve a second three year term on expiry of his current appointment on 25 May 2009. 
Mr Evans’ current appointment as a non-executive director expires on 30 March 2009; in view of his continuing contribution to 
the Board, it has been agreed that, subject to re-election by the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, his 
appointment will be extended for an additional three year term. 
The basic fee payable to each of the four non-executive directors is £40,000 per annum. The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much 
each receive an additional fee of £6,000 per annum, in respect of their Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee respectively.
Fees for the non-executive directors are determined annually by the Board, having regard to the practice of other companies 
and the particular demands of the Group. The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Scobie, Mr Evans and 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company’s pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes. However, 
Mr Evans does receive a pension from the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme, which he accrued during his former 
employment with the Company. In addition, a long term incentive scheme, known as The Chemring Group Phantom Share Option 
Scheme, was established in 1997 to secure the appointment of Mr Scobie as Chairman at a difﬁ cult time when the Group was 
undergoing a fundamental reorganisation. Mr Scobie, who was the only participant in the scheme, acquired a contractual entitlement 
on his appointment in 1997 to the grant of phantom options over 141,025 ordinary shares in the Company at a notional exercise 
price of 78p per share. Mr Scobie exercised his rights under this scheme on 31 October 2007 and received a cash payment from the 
Company in November 2007 of £3,008,063 (gross), being equivalent to the difference between the market value of the ordinary 
shares on the exercise date (2,211p) less the total exercise price. This scheme has now terminated.

Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Directors’ Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 20 January 2009.
Signed on behalf of the Board
I F R Much
CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Statement on Corporate Governance
This statement sets out how the Company has applied the main and supporting principles of good governance set out in Section 1 of 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council (“the Combined Code”), and whether 
or not the Company has complied throughout its accounting period with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code.
The Board
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and four non-executive directors. The Board 
considers that three of the current non-executive directors, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, 
are independent in character and judgment, and meet the criteria for independence set out in the Combined Code. The directors’ 
biographical details are set out on pages 32 and 33. 
The Board, which meets at least ten times a year, approves the Group’s long term goals and strategies and provides overall ﬁ nancial 
and organisational control. The Board has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁ cally reserved to it for consideration and approval, 
including: approval of the Group’s corporate plan; approval of the annual operating budgets; acquisitions, disposals and major capital 
expenditure; ﬁ nancing and treasury; pensions; ethical policies; health and safety strategy; reviewing the Group’s systems of ﬁ nancial 
control and risk management; approving appointments to the Board and approving policies relating to directors’ remuneration; and 
maintaining an effective dialogue with shareholders. All directors take decisions objectively in the interests of the Company.
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the Executive Committee, including: implementation of the Group’s strategies and policies 
as determined by the Board; monitoring of operational and ﬁ nancial results against budget; allocation of resources across the Group 
within the overall plan approved by the Board; capital expenditure within limits imposed by the Board; and developing and implementing 
risk management systems. Further details of the Executive Committee are set out in the section of this report covering Board Committees.
Procedures are in place covering the content, presentation and timely delivery of papers to the Board for each Board meeting, to 
ensure that directors have sufﬁ cient information to make expedient and considered decisions in fulﬁ lment of their ﬁ duciary duties. 
Where directors have concerns which cannot be resolved about the running of the Company or a proposed action, such concerns are 
recorded in the Board minutes.
Each director has full access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary who, under the direction of the Chairman, is 
responsible for maintaining good information ﬂ ows within the Board and its committees, assisting with induction and keeping 
the directors informed about changes to their duties and responsibilities, and advising the Board on all governance matters. 
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
All directors are entitled to take independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties at the Company’s expense, if the need 
should arise.
An internal induction programme on the Group’s operations and its strategic and business plans is provided for newly-appointed directors. 
The Company Secretary also provides detailed information on directors’ legal duties and responsibilities on appointment, and updates the 
Board on a regular basis with regards to regulatory changes affecting the directors and the Group’s operations generally. Directors are 
continually updated on the Group’s businesses and the matters affecting the market in which they operate. The Company meets the cost 
of appropriate external training for directors, the requirement for which is kept under review by the Chairman. 
The Company separates the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code. The 
division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive, and their respective job descriptions, are set out in writing 
and agreed by the Board.
In addition to chairing the Board, the Chairman is responsible for: ensuring that the Board is kept properly informed and is consulted 
on all decisions reserved to it; promoting constructive relations between the executive and non-executive directors; ensuring that the 
development needs of directors are identiﬁ ed and the performance of the Board evaluated on a regular basis; and ensuring effective 
communication with shareholders and acting as a conduit to ensure that the views of shareholders are communicated to the Board. 
The Chairman has no signiﬁ cant business commitments other than his chairmanship of the Company.
The non-executive directors perform an essential role in safeguarding shareholders’ interests. They actively participate in the 
development of strategic objectives and monitor the performance of executive management in achieving these objectives. 
The non-executive directors also review ﬁ nancial performance, and consider the integrity of the ﬁ nancial information produced 
by the Group and whether the ﬁ nancial controls and risk management systems are robust and defensible. They meet periodically 
with the management of the Group’s operating companies. In addition to participating in Board meetings, the three independent 
non-executive directors are the members of the standing committees set up to deal with audit and the remuneration of executive 
directors and senior management. The Board considers that the current balance of executive and non-executive inﬂ uence which 
exists is appropriate for the Company, taking into account its size and status.
The Board has not appointed a senior independent director, as it does not consider this to be appropriate at the present time in view 
of the size of the Board.
During the ﬁ nancial year, the Chairman met regularly with the non-executive directors without the executives present.

48 STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
Mr Evans, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss all have letters of appointment covering, amongst other 
items, their terms of appointment and expected time commitment. These letters of appointment provide for a three year appointment, 
unless terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months’ written notice. The non-executive directors’ letters of 
appointment are available for inspection on request to the Company Secretary.
In accordance with the Combined Code and the Company’s Articles of Association, all directors submit themselves for re-election every 
three years. The Chairman will now offer himself for re-election annually, having reached the age of 70 and having served for more than 
nine years as a non-executive director. 
The papers accompanying the Notice of Annual General Meeting include a statement from the Chairman conﬁ rming that the 
performance of each non-executive director seeking re-election at the meeting continues to be effective and that each such director 
continues to demonstrate commitment to their role.
A full evaluation of the performance of the Board and its committees was undertaken during the year. The process adopted involved 
each of the directors considering a structured questionnaire, the responses to which were discussed at a full Board meeting. 
In addition, the Chairman and the non-executive directors considered the individual performance of the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director as part of the annual remuneration review. Similarly, the performance of the Chairman was considered by the 
non-executive directors during the annual review of his remuneration, and the Chairman and the Chief Executive reviewed the 
performance of the non-executive directors. No signiﬁ cant issues were identiﬁ ed but minor areas for improvement are being addressed. 
The Company maintains directors and ofﬁ cers liability insurance in respect of legal action against its directors.

Board Committees
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee are posted on the 
Company’s website and are available on request from the Company Secretary.
Audit Committee
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss all served as members of the Audit Committee during the 
year. The Rt Hon Lord Freeman is Chairman of the Committee. The Committee met four times during the year and operates within 
formal written terms of reference. As referred to above, the terms of reference are available on the Company’s website. Meetings 
of the Committee are attended, at the invitation of the Committee, by the external auditors, the Chairman, the Finance Director and 
representatives from the Group ﬁ nance and internal audit function. The Committee meets with the auditors on a regular basis without 
executive directors present. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee and minutes of meetings are circulated to all 
Board members.
The Committee is authorised to seek any information it requires from any employee of the Company in order to perform its duties, 
and to obtain any outside legal or other professional advice it requires at the Company’s expense.
The Committee monitors the integrity of the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements and the effectiveness of the external audit process. It 
is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate relationship between the Group and the external auditors is maintained, including 
reviewing non-audit services and fees. The Committee keeps under review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
ﬁ nancial risk management systems, and on an annual basis, considers the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function. The 
Committee reviews annually its terms of reference and its effectiveness, and recommends to the Board any changes required as the 
result of such review.  CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 49
During the year, the Committee, operating under its terms of reference, discharged its responsibilities by:
 reviewing the Group’s draft 2007 ﬁ nancial statements and 2008 interim results statement prior to Board approval and reviewing 
the external auditors’ detailed reports thereon;
 reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies, and reviewing various accounting matters raised by management 
and the external auditors in the context of ﬁ nancial disclosures;
 considering and approving changes to the Group’s accounting policy manual;
 reviewing the potential impact in the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements of certain matters such as impairments of ﬁ xed asset values and 
International Financial Reporting Standards;
 reviewing the external auditors’ plan for the 2007 and 2008 ﬁ nancial statements and the 2008 interim report, including key risks on 
the accounts, conﬁ rmation of auditor independence and the proposed audit fee, and approving the terms of engagement for the audit; 
 considering the Group’s transfer pricing policy and certain other tax-related matters;
 receiving reports from the Risk Committee and reviewing the Group’s risk register;
 approving a revised whistleblowing policy and procedures for employees; and
 reviewing the work undertaken by the Group’s internal audit function.
The Company appointed an Internal Auditor in 2007. The initial internal audit programme focused on a review of ﬁ nancial controls 
across the Group. These activities have now been widened to include an audit of certain non-ﬁ nancial controls and procedures. 
The Committee reviews the internal audit plan and receives regular reports from the Internal Auditor. 
 
The Board has accepted the Committee’s recommendation that Deloitte LLP be proposed for re-appointment as auditors at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Committee keeps under review the level of non-audit services which are provided by the external auditors, to ensure that this does not 
impair their independence and objectivity. The Committee, in conjunction with the Finance Director, also ensures that the Group maintains 
a sufﬁ cient choice of appropriately qualiﬁ ed audit ﬁ rms. During the year, work on corporate ﬁ nance matters was sourced from the 
external auditors only where there was no direct conﬂ ict with their role as external auditors and where there were clear efﬁ ciencies and 
value added beneﬁ ts for the Company. The Committee has now adopted a policy which states that the external auditors should no longer 
be appointed to provide services in relation to corporate ﬁ nance matters, unless the Committee agrees that their appointment would be in 
the best interests of the Company’s shareholders in particular circumstances. Details of the amounts paid to the external auditors during 
the year for audit and other services are set out in the notes to the ﬁ nancial statements on page 66.
Nomination Committee
Mr Scobie, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss all served on the Nomination Committee during the year. Mr Scobie is Chairman 
of the Committee but, in accordance with the Committee’s terms of reference, is not permitted to chair meetings when the Committee 
is dealing with the appointment of his successor. As referred to above, the Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website.
With regards to the recruitment and appointment of new directors to the Board, the Committee considers the speciﬁ c knowledge and 
expertise which would be of beneﬁ t to the Group’s current operations and future strategy, and provides a brief to external search agents 
based upon its conclusions. The search agents put forward a short list of candidates for the Committee to interview before making its 
recommendations to the Board. The Board interviews preferred candidates prior to making any formal offers of appointment. 
Remuneration Committee
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much, Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss and Mr Scobie all served on the Remuneration Committee during 
the year. Mr Much is Chairman of the Committee. The Committee met six times during the year. Further details on the Committee and 
the Company’s policy on directors’ remuneration are included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Executive Committee
The Chief Executive, Dr Price, chairs the Executive Committee, which meets monthly. The other members are the Finance Director, 
the Company Secretary, the Business Development Director, the Group Director of Safety, the Managing Director of the European 
Energetics Division and the President of the Group’s US operations. The Executive Committee is responsible for the executive 
day-to-day running of the Company, submission to the Board of strategic plans and budgets for the Group’s operations, and 
monitoring the day-to-day performance of the Group as a whole.
Relations with shareholders
The Company maintains an active dialogue with institutional shareholders through regular brieﬁ ng meetings and formal 
presentations following the release of interim and annual results. Meetings are usually attended by the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
and the Finance Director. However, the non-executive directors are offered the opportunity to meet with major shareholders and 
attend meetings if so requested by major shareholders. No such requests were received during the year. Communication with private 
investors is achieved largely through the medium of the interim report and the ﬁ nancial statements.

Statement on Corporate Governance
CONTINUED
The Company’s website (www.chemring.co.uk) provides ﬁ nancial and business information on the Group.
The directors are provided with reports and other written brieﬁ ngs from the Company’s principal shareholders and analysts, and are 
regularly informed by the Company Secretary about changes to signiﬁ cant shareholdings.
It is the Company’s policy that all directors should attend and make themselves available to take questions from shareholders or address 
any concerns at the Annual General Meeting. At other times of the year, the directors can be contacted via the Company’s head ofﬁ ce.
All substantial issues, including the adoption of the annual report and ﬁ nancial statements, are proposed on separate resolutions 
at the Annual General Meeting. The number of proxy votes received for and against each resolution, together with the number of 
abstentions, are indicated after votes have been dealt with on a show of hands. The Notice of the Annual General Meeting is sent to 
shareholders at least twenty working days before the meeting.
Financial reporting
The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the ﬁ nancial statements and accounting records maintained by the 
Company is set out on page 36.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has continued to review the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control, including ﬁ nancial, operational and 
compliance controls, and risk management systems.
 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and attaches considerable importance to these 
systems, which are designed to meet the Group’s particular needs and identify those risks to which it is exposed. However, the systems can 
only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement, loss or mismanagement of the Group’s assets.
In carrying out its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control in compliance with provision C2.1 of the 
Combined Code, the Board has taken into consideration the following key features of the Group’s risk management systems and 
control procedures which operated during the year:
 The Board assesses the key risks associated with achievement of the Group’s business objectives as part of the annual strategic 
planning process. Out of this process, each business establishes a ﬁ ve year plan and annual budget, which are subject to approval by the 
Board. The performance of each business against budget and prior years is reviewed on a monthly basis at both operational level and by 
the Board. Achievement of strategic business objectives and the associated risks are monitored by the Board on an ongoing basis.
 All businesses hold monthly operating meetings, which are attended by at least one main Board director, either in person or, in the 
case of the overseas companies, by video conference. In the case of the US businesses, formal Board meetings are held quarterly 
and these are attended by main Board directors and external non-executive directors appointed in the US. The US non-executive 
directors are available to provide guidance and monitor governance in the US businesses throughout the year. External 
non-executive directors have also been appointed to the Board of the Group’s Italian subsidiary, Simmel Difesa S.p.A.
 Each business is required to comply with the Group’s accounting policy manual, which sets out formal procedures for incurring 
certain types of expenditure and making contractual commitments. Compliance with the accounting policy manual is audited by 
the Internal Auditor, who reports regularly to the Audit Committee on his ﬁ ndings.
 The Board retains primary responsibility for acquisitions and disposals, and ﬁ nancing arrangements for the Group. Treasury 
management, IT strategy, insurance and signiﬁ cant legal matters are dealt with centrally from the Group head ofﬁ ce, and the Board 
receives regular reports on each of these items. Reviews of the Group’s pensions, insurance and risk management arrangements 
are carried out by external advisors on a regular basis.
 The Group Director of Safety, supported by two divisional Health and Safety Management Committees, co-ordinates and controls 
the activities of each business in relation to health and safety and environmental matters, which are a key focus for the Board in 
view of the nature of the Group’s operations. The Chief Executive is the Board member nominated with speciﬁ c responsibility for 
health and safety. The Chief Executive meets formally with health and safety professionals from each business on an annual basis.
 The Group committed to adherence with the European Aerospace and Defence Association’s Common Industry Standards on 
Anti-Corruption in the year, and is now reviewing all its business policies and procedures to ensure compliance. 
The Group’s Risk Management Committee meets on a quarterly basis. The Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the 
Company Secretary, the Business Development Director, the Director of Safety, the Managing Director of the Energetics Division 
and the President of the Group’s US operations serve on the Committee. The Committee reviews the key risks associated with the 
achievement of the annual budget and the ﬁ ve year plan for each business, and the risk control procedures implemented. It also 
considers the top ﬁ ve health and safety risks which have been identiﬁ ed at each site and agrees the action plan to address these. The 
Risk Management Committee reports biannually to the Audit Committee and the Board on the top ten risks from a Group perspective, 
and monitors the actions being taken to mitigate these.

The Board conﬁ rms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management which 
were in place during the ﬁ nancial year ended 31 October 2008, and it conﬁ rms that systems of internal control and risk management 
compliant with the Combined Code and the Turnbull Guidance were in place throughout the year and have remained in place up to the 
date of approval of these ﬁ nancial statements. Notwithstanding this, the Board will continue to take steps to embed internal control 
and risk management further into the operations of the Group and to deal with any areas of improvement which come to the attention 
of management and the Board.
Compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
Throughout the year ended 31 October 2008, the Company has been in compliance with the code provisions set out in Section 1 of 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 2006, with the exception that the Board 
has not nominated a non-executive director as the senior independent director (provision A.3.3), as it does not consider this to be 
appropriate at the present time in view of the size of the Board. This requirement will be kept under review.
Procedures to deal with directors’ conﬂ icts of interest
With effect from 1 October 2008, all directors have a duty under the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘2006 Act’) to avoid a situation in 
which he or she has or can have a direct or indirect interest that conﬂ icts or possibly may conﬂ ict with the interests of the Company. 
The Company has procedures in place to deal with situations where directors may have conﬂ icts of interest. The Company will be 
seeking shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to amend its Articles of Association to include updated 
provisions for dealing with directors’ conﬂ icts of interest in accordance with the 2006 Act. In accordance with these amended 
provisions, the members of the Board will endeavour to:
consider each conﬂ ict situation separately on its particular facts;
 consider the conﬂ ict situation in conjunction with the rest of their duties under the 2006 Act;
 keep records and Board minutes as to authorisations granted by directors and the scope of any approvals given; and
regularly review conﬂ ict authorisation.
Going concern
The directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on going concern. They have made appropriate enquiries and taken into account 
factors such as:
the strong order book of £409 million as at the year end;
the Group’s operating cash ﬂ ow of £83.7 million during the year;
the strong balance sheet at the year end of £230.6 million; and
 the Group’s available banking facilities, which amount to £107.1 million with maturities through to March 2012 (see Note 21).
The Group’s banking covenants have all been met with a comfortable margin during the past year and the expectation is that this will 
continue. Details of how the Group manages its liquidity risk can be found in Note 24 of the ﬁ nancial statements.
Whilst the current volatility in ﬁ nancial markets has created general uncertainty in respect of the current economic outlook, the long 
term nature of the Group’s business, taken together with the Group’s forward order book, provide a satisfactory level of conﬁ dence to 
the Board in respect of trading in the year ahead.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.

• We have audited the Group ﬁ nancial statements of 
Chemring Group PLC for the year ended 31 October 2008 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the 
Notes to the Cash Flow Statement and the related Notes 1 to 39. 
These Group ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual company 
ﬁ nancial statements of Chemring Group PLC for the year ended 
31 October 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an Auditors’ Report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors
and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities in the Directors’ Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described 
as having been audited in accordance with relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and whether the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
described as having been audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report 
includes that speciﬁ c information presented in the Statement by 
the Chairman, the Review by the Chief Executive and the Review 
by the Finance Director that is cross referred from the review of 
the year and results section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Statement on Corporate Governance 
reﬂ ects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the 2006 Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review by the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s 
statement on internal control covers all risks and controls, or 
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as 
described in the contents section including the unaudited part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and consider whether it 
is consistent with the audited Group ﬁ nancial statements. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any further information outside the annual report. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence 
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant 
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation 
of the Group ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group ﬁ nancial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of 
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 October 2008 and of 
its proﬁ t for the year then ended; 
 the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation; 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as 
having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the Group ﬁ nancial statements.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2008 58 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
1. General information
Chemring Group PLC is a company incorporated in England and Wales under registration number 86662. The address of the 
registered ofﬁ ce is Chemring House, 1500 Parkway, Whiteley, Fareham, Hampshire PO15 7AF. The nature of the Group’s operations 
and its principal activities are set out in Note 5 and in the Directors’ Report on pages 34 to 37. These ﬁ nancial statements are the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of Chemring Group PLC and its subsidiaries (“the Group”).
These ﬁ nancial statements are presented in pounds sterling. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policy set out in 
Note 3 of the ﬁ nancial statements.
2. Adoption of new and revised standards
In the year under review two Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee were 
effective. These were IFRIC11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions and IFRIC14/IAS19 The Limit on a Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Asset, 
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the Group’s 
accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁ nancial statements the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in 
these ﬁ nancial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS1 (amended)/IAS27 (amended) Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate
IFRS2 (amended) Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
IFRS3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations
IFRS8 Operating Segments (effective from 1 January 2009)
IAS1 (revised 2007) Presentation of Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2009)
IAS23 Borrowing Costs (effective 1 January 2009)
IAS27 (revised 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IAS32 (amended)/IAS1 (amended) Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation
IFRIC12 Service Concession Arrangements
IFRIC15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate
IFRIC16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the 
ﬁ nancial statements of the Group.
3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union. These will be those 
IAS, IFRS and related Interpretations (Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC)/International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) interpretations), subsequent amendments to those standards and related interpretations, future standards and 
related interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been endorsed by the 
European Commission (collectively referred to as IFRS). These are subject to ongoing review and endorsement by the European 
Commission or possible amendment by interpretive guidance from the IASB and the IFRIC and are therefore still subject to change.
Basis of accounting
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The particular accounting policies adopted have been applied 
consistently throughout the current and previous year and are described below.
Accounting convention
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain properties and 
ﬁ nancial instruments.
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁ nancial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. A subsidiary undertaking is an entity over 
which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁ ts from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated from the date on which control passes to the Group and the results of disposed 
subsidiaries are consolidated up to the date on which control passes from the Group.
All companies within the Group make up their ﬁ nancial statements to the same date. All intra-group transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

3. Accounting policies continued
Operating proﬁ t
Operating proﬁ t is stated before the share of results of associates and before ﬁ nance expense. Operating proﬁ t excludes the results 
of discontinued operations.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for deliveries made, work completed or services 
rendered during the year, net of discounts, VAT and other revenue related taxes. Revenue is recognised when title passes, or when the 
right to consideration, in exchange for performance, has been completed. For bill and hold arrangements revenue is recognised when 
the risks and rewards are transferred to the customer, typically on formal acceptance. An appropriate proportion of total long term 
contract value, based on the fair value of work performed, is included in revenue and an appropriate level of proﬁ t is taken based on 
the percentage completion method when the ﬁ nal outcome can be reliably assessed. Provision is made in full for foreseeable losses as 
soon as they are identiﬁ ed.
Investment income
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Acquisitions
On acquisition of a subsidiary, the cost is measured as the fair value of the consideration given plus any directly attributable costs. 
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary that meet the IFRS3 Business Combinations recognition criteria are 
measured at the fair value at the date of acquisition. Where cost exceeds fair value of the net assets acquired the difference is 
recorded as goodwill.
Where the fair value of the net assets exceeds the cost, the difference is recorded directly in the income statement. The accounting 
policies of subsidiaries are changed where necessary to be consistent with those of the Group.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
The purchased goodwill of the Group is regarded as having an indeﬁ nite useful economic life and, in accordance with 
IAS36 Impairment of Assets, is not amortised but is subject to annual tests for impairment. In reviewing the carrying value of goodwill 
of the various businesses the Board has considered the separate plans and cash ﬂ ows of these businesses consistent with the 
requirements of IAS36 and is satisﬁ ed that these demonstrate that no impairment has occurred in respect of continuing operations. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to 
being tested for impairment at that date. On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁ t or loss on disposal.
For acquisitions after 1 November 2004 the Group recognises separately from goodwill intangible assets that are separable or arise 
from contractual or other legal rights and whose fair value can be measured reliably. These intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, averaging ten years.
Other intangibles
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure, where 
it meets certain criteria given below, is capitalised on a straight-line basis over typically three years from the date commercial 
production commences. Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
An intangible development asset is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
the development costs are separately identiﬁ able;
the development costs can be measured reliably;
management are satisﬁ ed as to the ultimate technical and commercial viability of the project; and
it is probable that the asset will generate future economic beneﬁ ts.
Patents and trademarks
Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives.

Property, plant and equipment
Other than revalued land and buildings, property, plant and equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
recognised impairment loss. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. On other assets depreciation is provided at rates calculated 
to write down their cost or valuation to their estimated residual values by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic 
lives, which are considered to be:
Freehold buildings   – up to 50 years

Impairment of non-current assets
Assets that have indeﬁ nite lives are tested for impairment annually. Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are 
reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. To the extent 
that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss is recorded for the difference as an expense in the 
income statement. The recoverable amount used for impairment testing is the higher of the value in use and its fair value less costs 
of disposal. For the purpose of impairment testing assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiﬁ able 
cash ﬂ ows.
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents materials, direct labour, other direct costs and 
related production overheads and is determined using the ﬁ rst-in ﬁ rst-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is based on estimated 
selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for slow moving, obsolete and defective items where appropriate.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁ t for the year. Taxable proﬁ t differs from net proﬁ t as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items of income that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
ﬁ nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable taxable proﬁ ts will be available in the future against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill 
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither 
the tax proﬁ t nor the accounting proﬁ t.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Special capital reserve
The special capital reserve was created as part of a capital reduction scheme involving the cancellation of the share premium account 
which was approved by the Court in 1986 and is in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.

3. Accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies
The individual ﬁ nancial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, the results and ﬁ nancial position 
of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation 
currency for the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not re-translated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the re-translation of monetary items, are included in the 
proﬁ t or loss for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and forward currency 
structures which are accounted for as derivative ﬁ nancial instruments (see below for details of the Group’s accounting policies in 
respect of such derivative ﬁ nancial instruments).
For the purpose of presenting consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigniﬁ cant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁ ed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis to the Income 
Statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 62 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
3. Accounting policies continued
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the ﬁ nancial risks of interest rate and foreign currency transactions, and it uses derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge its exposure to these transactional risks. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts, foreign 
exchange forward contracts and other forward currency structures to reduce these exposures and does not use derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are revalued at 
fair value at each balance sheet date. The method by which any gain or loss is recognised depends on whether the instrument is 
designated a hedging instrument or not. To be designated as a hedging instrument the instrument must be documented as such at 
inception and must be assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 
ﬂ ows of hedged items.
Hedge accounting principles are used for foreign currency forward contracts (net investment hedge) and interest rate swaps (cash 
ﬂ ow hedge) where movements in fair value are held in equity until such time as the underlying amounts of the contract mature. 
At maturity or disposal of the net investment the amounts held in equity will be recycled to the Income Statement. Changes in 
fair value of any ineffective portion of net investment hedges and interest rate swaps are recognised in the Income Statement 
immediately. The fair values of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are calculated by independent third party valuers.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting the changes in fair value are immediately recognised in the 
Income Statement.
Embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host contract are treated as separate derivatives, with unrealised gains and 
losses reported in the Income Statement.
Retirement beneﬁ t costs
Payments to deﬁ ned contribution retirement beneﬁ t schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. For deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
schemes, the cost of providing beneﬁ ts is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried 
out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside of the proﬁ t or loss and presented in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense (SORIE).
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the beneﬁ ts are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the average period until the beneﬁ ts become vested.
The retirement beneﬁ t obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation 
as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to 
the scheme.
Leased assets
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is 
treated as a ﬁ nance lease. The asset is recorded in the Balance Sheet as property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the 
shorter of the estimated useful economic life and the lease term. Future instalments under such leases, net of ﬁ nance charges, are 
included in creditors. The ﬁ nance element of the instalments is charged to the Income Statement at a constant rate of charge on the 
remaining balance of the obligation.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental charges are taken to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the life of 
the lease.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates equity settled and cash settled share-based compensation schemes.
For grants made under the Group’s share-based compensation schemes, the fair value is calculated at the grant date with changes in 
the fair value recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
the shares that will eventually vest. The valuation of the options utilises a methodology based on the Black-Scholes model.
For equity settled share-based grants, the total amount recognised is based on the fair value of the equity instrument measured at 
the date the award is made. At each balance sheet date the impact of any revision to vesting estimates is recognised in the income 
statement over the vesting period. Proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital 
and share premium.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements
   CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  63
3. Accounting policies continued
For cash settled share-based grants, the total amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability incurred. The fair value 
of the liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value recognised in the Income Statement for 
the period.
Post balance sheet events
Following IAS10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the Group continues to disclose events that it considers material and 
non-disclosure of which can inﬂ uence the economic decisions of users of the ﬁ nancial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
When applying the Group’s accounting policies, management must make assumptions and estimates concerning the future that affect 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenue and expenses recognised during 
the accounting period. Such assumptions and estimates are based upon factors such as historical experience, the observance of 
trends in the industries in which the Group operates, and information available from the Group’s customers and other outside sources.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a 
signiﬁ cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year include:
Goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to determine such assets, to estimate the future cash ﬂ ows 
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and to determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations
Under IFRS3 Business Combinations, it is necessary to separately identify and value any acquired intangible assets. In order to 
ascertain the values of the separate assets it is necessary for management to estimate the future cash ﬂ ows attributable to the asset 
and estimate their useful economic lives.
Pensions
The liability recognised in relation to retirement beneﬁ t obligations is dependent on a number of assumptions, including discount rate, 
mortality rate, salary increases and inﬂ ation. Any change in these assumptions would change the amount recognised (see Note 35).
4. Revenue
All of the Group’s revenue is derived from the sale of goods. The following table provides an analysis of the Group’s revenue

At 31 October 2008     24.1
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, the growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during 
the period for which management have detailed plans. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reﬂ ect current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the CGU being measured (the weighted average cost of 
capital “WACC”). The discount rate used is 10.0% (2007: 10.0%). The growth rates are based on a prudent view of industry growth 
forecasts adjusted for a premium associated with the high technological nature of the businesses. A growth assumption of 2.5% 
(2007: 2.5%) has been used. Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes 
in the market. The Group prepares cash ﬂ ow forecasts derived from the most recent ﬁ nancial budgets approved by management for 
the next ﬁ ve years and extrapolates cash ﬂ ows after that period based on growth as described above.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses for continuing operations have been recognised in the year and no prior impairment 
losses reversed.
* In accordance with IFRS3 fair value adjustments have been made within twelve months of the acquisition dates which has resulted in additional goodwill being recognised in the year

All amounts shown above are due within one year.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods, adjusted for Group revenue had the acquisitions taken place on the ﬁ rst day of the 
ﬁ nancial year, is 77 days (2007: 69 days). No interest is charged on the receivables from the date of invoice to payment.
The Group’s policy is to provide in full for debtors greater than 120 days beyond agreed terms, unless extenuating circumstances 
exist. The Group does not experience signiﬁ cant bad debt write-offs and hence no movement schedule for the allowance for doubtful 
debts has been provided due to its immaterial level, 1% of trade receivables (2007: nil). An ageing analysis has not been shown as all 
signiﬁ cant overdue receivables are covered by the allowance for doubtful debts provision above.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values.
20. Cash and cash equivalents
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.

Bank loans and overdrafts held with Bank of Scotland are secured by a debenture over the assets of certain of the Group’s 
subsidiaries and are also subject to cross guarantees between subsidiaries. Bank loans held with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania (USA) 
are secured on the related assets purchased with these loans by Alloy Surfaces Company, Inc. The security over the US loan notes 
ranks pari passu with that held by Bank of Scotland.
As the loans are re-translated to the year end exchange rates, the directors do not believe the fair value of the Group’s borrowings to 
be materially different to the book values.
There have been no breaches of the terms of the loan agreements or defaults during the current or previous year.

24. Financial instruments and risk management
The Group uses ﬁ nancial instruments to manage ﬁ nancial and commercial risk wherever it is appropriate to do so. The main risks 
addressed by the ﬁ nancial instruments of the Group are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s policies 
in respect of the management of these risks, which remained unchanged throughout the year, were as follows:
Market risk
The Group’s multi-national activities expose it to the ﬁ nancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group enters into a variety of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, 
including:
Forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Group’s investments in overseas 
businesses which have currencies other than sterling as their functional currency.
Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
Forward currency structures to hedge the exchange risk arising on translation of the overseas business proﬁ ts.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate ﬂ uctuations arise. 
Foreign currency exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation risk:
Transactional risk:  The Group policy is to hedge signiﬁ cant transactional currency exposures via the use of forward foreign exchange 
contracts. The measurement and control of this risk is closely monitored on a Group-wide basis.
Translation risk:  The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 3. 
The translation risk on net assets is mitigated by the transfer of currencies between Group companies and the 
appropriate use of foreign currency borrowings.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year end are as follows:
    2008    2007
 US$ Euro NOK AUS$ US$ Euro NOK AUS$
Monetary assets (million) 83.9 55.0 32.6 5.3 62.6 32.3 33.1 3.7
Monetary liabilities (million) 168.2 105.0 45.6 1.1 81.4 101.3 35.0 0.6
Currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings. The borrowings detailed below were designated as 
hedging instruments in net investment hedges.
    2008    2007
 US$ Euro NOK AUS$ US$ Euro NOK AUS$
Borrowings (million)  125.0 66.9 35.0 – 47.9 80.0 35.0 –
The Group uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the year end. 
When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity. The most signiﬁ cant exchange rate to manage as far as the 
Group is concerned is the sterling: US dollar exchange rate.

The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for sales of foreign currencies outstanding as at 31 October:
    Average exchange rate  Expiring within one year

     m m
US dollar    2.04 1.97  9.0 5.0
Euro    1.39 1.43  2.0 4.0
At the year end, there were two US dollar structures in place which were set up to protect the Income Statement from currency 
ﬂ uctuations during 2008 and through to October 2010, and provide an economic hedge.
The structures involve a cap and a collar, which lock in the exchange rates and give the Group the appropriate protection. However, 
these structures do not give linear relationships with the gain or loss from re-translation of future proﬁ ts and hence hedge accounting 
has not been adopted.
At 31 October 2008, an £8.7 million loss is shown as an adjustment to underlying operating proﬁ t and represents the fair value 
of the structures. The signiﬁ cant change arises due to the sudden appreciation of the US dollar in the last month of the year. 
The appreciation of the dollar has locked the structures into a ﬁ xed rate of 1.855 on a currency amount of $66 million in the year 
to October 2009 and $36 million in the year to October 2010.
The principal amounts of the Group’s Euro, NOK and US dollar bank loans and private placement have been accounted as net 
investment hedges on the European, Norwegian and US businesses. These hedges are effective throughout the year and the losses 
arising on translation have been offset against the gains on retranslation of the subsidiaries in reserves.
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash ﬂ ows generated by the underlying operations of the Group. 
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into except for interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risks.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10 cent movement in the relevant foreign currencies against sterling. 10 cent 
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis 
includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10 cent 
change in foreign currency rates. A negative number indicates a decrease in proﬁ t and equity where sterling weakens against the 
relevant currency.
     US dollar impact  Euro impact
   2008 2007 2008 2007
   £m £m £m £m
Loss    (7.8) (0.7) (3.5) (3.8)
Other equity    (7.8) (0.7) (3.5) (3.8)
The Group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the current year mainly due to the growth of the US and European 
subsidiaries. These potential losses arising on the year end foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities would be more than offset 
by future translation and transaction gains.
In the management’s opinion the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year end 
exposure does not reﬂ ect the exposure during the year.
Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁ nances its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁ ts, bank borrowings and leasing lines of credit. The UK 
borrowings are denominated in sterling, Euro, US dollar and Norwegian Kroner and are subject to ﬂ oating rates of interest linked to 
the Bank of Scotland base rate. In order to protect against the risk of higher interest rates, the Group has entered into amortising 
interest rate swaps for the majority of its UK borrowings. The overseas borrowings are denominated in local currency and are 
predominantly subject to ﬁ xed rates of interest.
During the year the Group reﬁ nanced part of its Bank of Scotland borrowing facilities with a private placement of ten year ﬁ xed 
interest loan notes in the US. The new arrangement provides a natural hedge against the Group’s investment structure in its 
US businesses. The US loan notes are repayable in full in 2017.

24. Financial instruments and risk management continued
Euro, NOK and sterling ﬂ oating rate borrowings have interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on the ﬂ oating rate debt 
and are all designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges. The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest 
rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date.

A right of offset exists for currency amounts held within the UK by Bank of Scotland. These are used to offset the interest charged on 
the UK overdraft which bears interest at 1.25% above LIBOR. Cash at bank and in hand consists primarily of overseas funds which are 
used as short term intra-group ﬁ nancing as well as an internal exchange rate hedge.
The weighted average interest rate of ﬁ xed rate ﬁ nancial liabilities at 31 October 2008 was 6.2% (2007: 5.7%) and the weighted 
average period of funding was six years (2007: ﬁ ve years).
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group has three amortising interest rate swaps, from ﬂ oating to ﬁ xed rate; one that expires in 2011 at a rate of 5.41% (sterling), 
one that expires in 2012 at a rate of 4.35% (Euro) and one that expires in 2012 at a rate of 5.495% (NOK). The fair value of interest 
rate swaps recognised on the Balance Sheet at 31 October 2008 was £1.2 million liability (2007: £0.6 million asset). The Group also 
has four forward exchange contracts with a fair value of £1.2 million liability (2007: £0.3 million asset). The total of these ﬁ nancial 
instruments is £2.4 million liability (2007: £0.9 million asset) and is recorded in reserves.

24. Financial instruments and risk management continued
Credit risk
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables, which represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to ﬁ nancial assets. The Group does not have any signiﬁ cant credit risk exposure to any 
single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments is limited because the counterparties are 
banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net 
of allowances for doubtful receivables, based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment. 
Trade receivables consist of a relatively small number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas. Customers are mainly 
multi national organisations or government agencies with whom the Group has long-term business relationships. The majority of 
the Group’s business is with the US Department of Defense and the UK Ministry of Defence and as such the credit risk on debtors 
is considered to be very low. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the ﬁ nancial condition of accounts receivable and when 
appropriate action is taken to minimise the credit risk to the Group.
The Group’s price risk is principally in relation to the cost of raw materials and is not considered signiﬁ cant. Price risk is managed 
through negotiations with suppliers and where appropriate the agreement of ﬁ xed price supply contracts.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁ dence and to sustain 
future development of the business. The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on 
capital, which the Group deﬁ nes as total shareholders’ equity, excluding non-redeemable preference shares and minority interests, 
and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market; the timing of these purchases depends on the market prices. 
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Group’s share-based incentive schemes. Buy and sell 
decisions are made on a speciﬁ c transaction basis by the Board. The Group does not have a deﬁ ned share buy-back plan.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Deferred tax liabilities     17.3 12.1

At the Balance Sheet date the Group had unrecognised tax losses of £8.4 million (2007: £16.8 million) potentially available for offset 
against future proﬁ ts in certain circumstances. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the 
unpredictability of future qualifying proﬁ t streams. These losses can be carried forward indeﬁ nitely.

Outstanding at end of year     310,743 228,096
Subject to vesting at end of year     – –
The Group assumes that all the conditions of the PSP will be met.
As there is no option element the share price is discounted based on the following assumptions:
Dividend growth at 5% per annum (2007: growth at 5% per annum);
weighted average cost of capital 10%.
The weighted average fair value of awards made during the year was 1,813.8p (2007: 1,661.5p)

Adjustments from book value to fair value arise principally from the application of Group accounting policies and the recognition 
of intangible assets under IFRS3 Business Combinations and Fair Value Adjustments to Inventories, Receivables, Property, Plant 
and Equipment. Intangible assets relate principally to customer relationships, order book and trademarks (see Note 14). Fair values 
relating to the acquisition of Titan Dynamics Systems, Inc., Scot, Inc. and Martin Electronics, Inc. are provisional and will be ﬁ nalised 
within one year of the acquisition date.
Costs include those legal and accounting costs incurred in developing the acquisition contracts and performing due diligence activities.

33. Acquisitions continued
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess of total cost over the fair value of net 
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the ﬁ nancial statements. Goodwill represents the value of synergies and assembled 
workforces acquired.
The acquisitions during the year contributed £19.6 million of revenue and £3.2 million to the Group’s proﬁ t before tax for the period 
between the date of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
If the acquisitions had been completed on the ﬁ rst day of the ﬁ nancial year, Group revenues and proﬁ ts before tax for continuing 
activities for the year would have been approximately £381.2 million and £78.4 million respectively. This information is not 
necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, 
nor of the future results of the combined operations.

35. Pensions
Within the UK the Group operates two deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes, the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme (the “Staff Scheme”) 
and the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme (the “Executive Scheme”), as detailed below. In Germany, 
Chemring Defence Germany GmbH operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme (the “Chemring Defence Germany Pension Scheme”) and 
in Norway, Chemring Nobel AS operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme (the “Chemring Nobel Scheme”). The other UK and overseas 
arrangements are all deﬁ ned contribution schemes.
The Staff Scheme and Executive Scheme are funded schemes and the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee 
administered funds. Full actuarial valuations for the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme as at 6 April 2006 have been prepared 
and updated to 31 October 2008 by a qualiﬁ ed actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The Staff Scheme triennial valuation at 6 April 2006 was signed off by the trustees and the Company on 18 February 2008. 
The ongoing contributions were reduced. However the Group agreed to provide a £6.0 million bank guarantee to the Staff Scheme, 
to be drawn upon in certain events of default by the Company. In addition £5.0 million was placed in an escrow account to provide 
additional security to the Trustees in the event of a default (see Note 20).
The Executive Scheme triennial valuation at the same date was signed off by the trustees and Company on 5 October 2007.
The Chemring Defence Germany Pension Scheme is an unfunded scheme. The actuarial liability has been calculated at 31 October 2008 
by a qualiﬁ ed actuary using the projected unit credit method. The main assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.3%, inﬂ ation 
rate of 1.8% and rate of increase in deferred pensions of 0%. The net deﬁ cit of the Chemring Defence Germany Pension Scheme was 
£1.1 million at 31 October 2008 (2007: £0.8 million).
The Chemring Nobel Scheme is an unfunded scheme. The actuarial liability has been calculated at 31 October 2008 by a qualiﬁ ed 
actuary using the projected unit credit method. The main assumptions used were a discount rate of 4.5%, inﬂ ation rate of 2.75% 
and rate of increase in deferred pensions of 1.5%. The net deﬁ cit of the Chemring Nobel Scheme was £1.4 million at 31 October 2008 
(2007: £1.4 million).

Notes to the Group Financial Statements  CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  89
35. Pensions continued
In determining the pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables. 
For both the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme the actuarial table currently used is PA92(YOB)MC+1.
The assumption considered to be the most signiﬁ cant is the discount rate adopted. If the discount rate in the schemes were to 
change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deﬁ cit in the schemes would change by approximately £0.7 million.
The Group anticipates contributions to the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes for the year ending 31 October 2009 will be £1.7 million 
(2007: 1.7 million).
36. Self insurance
The Group is self insured through its captive insurance company CHG Insurance Limited, based in Guernsey. The Group has 
been self insured for the ﬁ rst £2.5 million of material damage and business interruption cover, subject to a maximum liability of 
£3.5 million in any one year since 31 October 2001. Insurance cover in respect of this risk at a level over that disclosed here is 
placed with external insurers.
37. Insurance claim
During the year the case against the Group’s former insurance broker for alleged negligence in relation to an insurance claim 
was settled. At the beginning of the year, the balance of the claim that had not been recovered from the broker was £2.4 million. 
After incurring legal costs in the year of £0.6 million, releasing a speciﬁ c provision of £0.4 million and a related tax reserve of 
£0.8 million, a net write-off of £0.6 million was charged to unallocated head ofﬁ ce costs in Note 5 following settlement.
38. Related party transactions
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are 
not disclosed in this note.
Trading transactions
There are no trading activities between the Group and its associate.
Remuneration of key management personnel
The remuneration of the executive directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is set out below in aggregate 
for each of the categories speciﬁ ed in IAS24 Related Party Disclosures. Further information on the remuneration of individual 
directors is provided in the audited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 46.
The directors of the Company had no material transactions with the Company during the year other than as a result of 
service agreements.
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee having regard to the performance of 
individuals and the market trends.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Chemring Group PLC
We have audited the parent company ﬁ nancial statements of Chemring Group PLC for the year ended 31 October 2008 which comprise 
the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders’ Funds and 
the related Notes 1 to 12. These parent company ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁ nancial statements of Chemring Group PLC for the year ended 31 October 2008 and on 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in the Directors’ Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you 
whether in our opinion the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company ﬁ nancial statements. The information given in the 
Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁ c information presented in the Statement by the Chairman, the Review by the Chief Executive 
and the Review by the Finance Director that is cross referred from the review of the year and results section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is 
consistent with the audited parent company ﬁ nancial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any further information outside the annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the individual company 
ﬁ nancial statements. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the 
preparation of the individual company ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁ nancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy 
of the presentation of information in the parent company ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the parent company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 October 2008;
the parent company ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company ﬁ nancial statements.

1. Chemring Group PLC accounting policies
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The particular 
accounting policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the current and previous year and are described below.
Accounting convention
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁ ed by the revaluation of property, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards (UK GAAP).
Revenue recognition
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the ﬁ nancial asset to its net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established.
Tangible ﬁ xed assets
Other than revalued land and buildings, property, plant and equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
recognised impairment loss. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. On other assets depreciation is provided at rates calculated 
to write down their cost or valuation to their estimated residual values by equal instalments over their estimated economic useful 
lives, which are considered to be:
Freehold buildings  – up to 50 years
Leasehold buildings  – the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – 10 years
Investment in Group undertakings
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Operating leases
Operating lease rental charges are taken to the proﬁ t and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that settlement will be required of an amount that can be reliably estimated. Long term liabilities and provisions are 
discounted when the impact is material.
Current tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided for at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full at the anticipated tax rates on differences arising from the inclusion of items of income and 
expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the ﬁ nancial statements. Deferred tax 
is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of ﬁ xed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Special capital reserve
The special capital reserve was created as part of a capital reduction scheme involving the cancellation of the share premium account 
which was approved by the Court in 1986 and is in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling 
at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated at the rates ruling at that date. These translation differences are dealt with in the proﬁ t and loss account.
Pensions
The Company operates deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes. The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes are multi-employer schemes including 
employees of other Group companies. It is not considered possible to allocate scheme assets and liabilities between the various 
companies and accordingly schemes are accounted for as though they were deﬁ ned contribution schemes. The amount charged to 
the proﬁ t and loss account is the contribution payable in the year. Differences between amounts payable and actually paid are shown 
as accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
Share-based compensation
For grants made under the Company’s share-based remuneration schemes, amounts which reﬂ ect the fair value of options awarded 
at the time of grant are charged to the proﬁ t and loss account. The valuation of the options utilises a methodology based on the 
Black-Scholes model.

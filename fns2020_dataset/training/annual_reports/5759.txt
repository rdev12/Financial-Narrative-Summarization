Realising a vision
Annual Report 2008 Through its data resources and analytical

Experian Annual Report 2008 1 Chairman’s statement
These have been extraordinary times 
for the banking and financial services 
industry. Unprecedented losses, huge 
volatility, the dislocation of the inter-
bank lending market and subsequent 
recapitalisation of major banks have 
characterised the events of recent 
months.  
The extent to which the so-called 
credit crunch will impact beyond the 
financial sector remains to be seen, 
but it is clear that this next year will be 
another challenging one, particularly 
for companies with exposure to the 
US and UK markets, where the banks 
will continue to be cautious lenders.   
Within all sectors though, there 
have been companies that have 
performed well and I am pleased that 
Experian is amongst these. Despite 
the highly unusual conditions, 
Experian delivered a solid financial 
performance and continued to make 
strong strategic progress, which is a 
remarkable achievement.  
Experian’s management was quick to 
identify a range of efficiency measures 
and to restructure certain parts of the 
business so that it could better deal 
with the prevailing conditions. This 
will result in significant cost savings, 
as well as delivering operational 
efficiencies that will benefit us in the 
longer term.  
What this year has really shown is the 
strength of Experian’s portfolio and 
the many opportunities we have to 
drive growth.  
We have, for example, continued to 
extend our global reach into new and 
emerging markets. Our investment in 
Serasa, Brazil’s largest credit bureau, 
has provided us with a commanding 
position in one of the fastest growing 
credit markets in the world.  
We have developed new and 
innovative products for credit 
managers and marketers, as well as 
for consumers wanting to protect 
their credit records. And we have 
continued to expand into new market 
sectors, such as government, energy, 
telecommunications and healthcare.  
In the UK alone, we won four 
significant new contracts in the public 
sector.  
We have also made good progress 
in the management of our corporate 
responsibilities and in learning 
how to embed these within our 
everyday business processes.  
Experian was selected for inclusion 
in the FTSE4Good index of socially 
responsible companies and the Dow 
Jones Sustainability World Index.  
Our carbon emissions continued 
to fall, driven by improved energy 
efficiency and the use of renewable 
energy, and we played a leading role in 
initiatives to reduce the incidence of 
identity theft in the US and UK.  
Experian’s performance this 
year is undoubtedly testimony 
to the underlying strength 
of the business

all their support.
Looking ahead, we are far from 
complacent about conditions in the

actions taken by the management 
team this year give me confidence  
in our ability to continue to steer

weakened by the events of this year, 
and that we can look to the future

store of information, around which 
we have developed a unique range of 
analytical skills and software tools. It 
enables us to provide extraordinary 
insight into everyday decision making.

Chief Executive’s review
Experian performed well during a challenging year. 
We delivered organic revenue growth across all four 
of our regions and all four of our principal activities, 
there were good profit and cash performances 
and we made excellent strategic progress, which 
positions us strongly for future growth. These 
achievements are all the more significant for having 
been secured against one of the most challenging 
market environments for the financial services 
sector in the US and the UK in recent times. Our 
performance attests to the commitment of our 
people, the strength of our market position, the 
global demand for our products and the balance  
and diversity of our portfolio.
Don Robert 
Chief Executive Officer

Business review
Chief Executive’s review
Over the past year we have 
made significant progress to 
enable us to continue to drive 
profitable growth 
Managing our business in  
more challenging times
In January, we took action to ensure 
that we had the right cost structure 
in place for the prevailing business 
environment. We announced a 
programme of cost-efficiency 
measures, to deliver annualised 
savings of US$80m. In response to 
continuing challenging conditions, 
we have since identified additional 
opportunities and have raised 
our estimate for annualised cost 
savings to US$110m. We now 
expect in the region of US$50m to 
be realised in the year ending 31 
March 2009, with the full benefit 
thereafter. One-off restructuring 
costs associated with achieving 
these savings are now expected to 
be in the region of US$140m. 
These additional measures include 
further restructuring of core 
credit and marketing activities and 
infrastructure consolidation.
Evolving our strategy
At Experian, we are fortunate to have 
many opportunities to drive growth, 
underpinned by global expansion in 
demand for credit risk management 
and high RoI marketing. We have 
refined our strategic focus and have 
adopted a framework to:
Focus on data and analytics. l
Drive profitable growth. l
Optimise capital efficiency. l
We have incorporated these three 
elements in the recent execution of 
our strategy.
Focus on data and analytics
Our core expertise is ownership 
and operation of comprehensive 
databases around the world and 
enhancing the value of data through 
the application of proprietary 
analytics and software. Our 
businesses are characterised by 
their market-leading positions, 
high barriers to entry, global reach 
and potential for long-term growth, 
as well as their attractive financial 
characteristics.
We review the composition of our 
portfolio against these criteria 
on a regular basis. As previously 
announced, PriceGrabber and 
Experian’s transaction processing 
activities are under strategic review. 
We have also indicated previously 
that our acquisition strategy will 
focus on opportunities that will bring 
access to new data and analytics.
Drive profitable growth
Over the past year we have made 
significant progress to enable us to 
continue to drive profitable growth. 
We aim to achieve this through 
expansion of our global reach, a 
commitment to innovation and by 
driving operational excellence. 
Action in the year included:
The acquisition of a 70% stake in  l
Serasa, which provides access to 
the emerging credit economy in 
Brazil, with significant opportunity 
to introduce value-added products. 
Expansion of our infrastructure in  l
Asia Pacific, which has contributed 
to the success of our Decision 
Analytics activities in the region.
Further progress in new vertical  l
markets, with exciting new 
opportunities emerging in the UK 
public sector, for example.
Investment in new sources of data,  l
such as Visa transaction data, 
and the acquisition of Hitwise, 
which extends our position in new 
marketing channels.
Development of new products  l
in Consumer Direct for fraud 
prevention and identity protection.
Investment in new analytics  l
activities, for example through  
the acquisition of T allyman,  
which extends our presence in 
collections software.
Investment in low cost development  l
and delivery centres in Chile, India 
and Bulgaria.
In the year ending 31 March 2009, 
we plan to invest through the 
income statement at a rate similar 
to the prior year in new products, 
geographies and our people. 8 Experian Annual Report 2008
Optimise capital efficiency
We remain committed to 
maintaining an efficient balance 
sheet, consistent with a strong 
investment grade credit rating.  
We will be flexible where warranted, 
for example, following the debt-
financed acquisition of Serasa 
in June 2007 our credit ratios 
rose above our target levels. We 
considered this acceptable as a 
temporary position following a 
strategically important acquisition. 
Since then, net debt has reduced 
from US$3.0bn to US$2.7bn as a 
result of strong cash conversion. 
We will continue to reinvest to 
retain competitive advantage and to 
make targeted acquisitions that fit 
our strategy and meet our financial 
hurdles. We will review additional 
opportunities for returning surplus 
cash to shareholders, as credit ratios 
return to levels consistent with a 
strong investment grade credit rating.
Dividend 
For the year ended 31 March 2008, 
we have announced a second 
dividend of 12.0 US cents per share 
to give a full year dividend of 18.5 
US cents per share, in line with our 
objective to have cover (based on 
Benchmark EPS) of at least three 
times on an annual basis. The second 
interim dividend will be paid on  
25 July 2008 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 
27 June 2008.
Strengthening our  
management team
Our achievements are directly 
related to the quality and 
commitment of our people, and the 
strength of our senior leadership 
team. We have created two new 
senior leadership roles to ensure 
that we operate our business more 
globally, in every respect, to meet 
the growing needs of our clients.

Business review
Chief Executive’s review
Chris Callero, who has successfully 
led and expanded our North 
America and Latin America 
businesses, has been promoted 
to the role of President and Chief 
Operating Officer, Experian Group. 
Victor Nichols, who joined Experian 
a year ago from Wells Fargo, has 
become CEO for the combined 
UK and EMEA region.  Victor also 
retains accountability for Marketing 
Services and Interactive globally. 
Financial performance
Despite the market challenges, 
we delivered a good financial 
performance during the year:
We delivered organic revenue  l
growth of 4%.
W e delivered continuing EBIT margin  l
in line with the prior year at 21.8%.
EBIT conversion into operating  l
cash flow was 95%. 
We continued to invest in the 
business through the income 
statement, capital expenditure and 
acquisitions. Capital expenditure 
was US$344m, in line with previous 
guidance. Acquisition expenditure 
was US$1.7bn, including the 70% 
stake in Serasa, Hitwise, Tallyman, 
N4 Solutions and a number of 
smaller infills. Acquisitions in the 
year are currently trading at least 
to plan, and Serasa is on plan for 
revenue and exceeds EBIT buy plan. 
Summary
This has been a challenging year in 
many ways. The major disruption 
that took place in the financial 
services sector was unprecedented, 
impeding our revenue growth 
trajectory, but we delivered good 
profit and cash performances. 
Experian is a strong business 
performing well in difficult markets, 
and while it is still too early to call a 
turn in the US and the UK financial 
services markets, we have taken 
the necessary steps to reduce 
costs and protect margins. We also 
expect strong performances in 
the current year in other Experian 
regions and in key business lines. 
In the meantime, we will keep a tight 
rein on costs, while continuing 
to invest in the long-term growth 
of the business. Experian is a 
business with excellent future 
growth opportunities and we are 
highly confident about our future 
prospects.
Expanding Experian’s data assets with online 
competitive intelligence
In June 2007, Experian acquired Hitwise, a leading online 
competitive intelligence service, operating in the US, 
UK, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong.  
Hitwise enables over 1,400 clients to benchmark their online 
performance against competitors and, most importantly, to 
uncover new business opportunities by understanding how 
people interact daily with over one million websites across 160 
industries. 
Over the next 18 months, Hitwise will be expanding its global 
footprint into new markets and launching a range of new 
online competitive intelligence tools to continue to help clients 
maximise their online marketing spend. 10 Experian Annual Report 2008
North America
North America performed well despite challenging 
market conditions caused by the major disruption 
of the US mortgage market and subsequent global 
credit liquidity issues. While revenue growth slowed, 
there was excellent margin performance as all 
businesses benefited from proactive cost control 
measures taken over the past 18 months.
Credit Services
Includes consumer credit, business 
information and automotive services
Revenue in Credit Services was 
flat year-on-year, reflecting an 
exceptionally challenging market 
for US financial services clients. In 
consumer information, disruption 
of the mortgage market reduced 
demand for credit reports used in 
loan origination. Credit liquidity and 
capital constraints caused major card 
issuers to reduce spend in areas like 
credit marketing (pre-screen) as the 
year progressed. These factors were 
largely balanced by strong demand for 
countercyclical products in portfolio 
management and collections, which 
saw increased volumes and new 
business wins. Business information 
showed good growth, benefiting from 
investment in a new database platform, 
and reflected in new contract wins for 
business credit reports and portfolio 
scoring services. There was also 
continued strong growth in automotive 
information, driven by market share gains 
in the sale of vehicle history reports.
There was good strategic progress 
during the year, with a focus on new 
product development, enhanced data 
quality and increased sales force 
productivity. The previously announced 
partnership with Visa to create more 
predictive bankruptcy scores is in 
testing and validation with key card 
issuers, while VantageScore continues 
to gain traction. Such activities enable 
Experian to realise opportunities even 
during times of uncertainty, as now, 
as well as positioning the business for 
eventual market recovery. 
Decision Analytics
Includes credit analytics, decision 
support software and fraud solutions
Decision Analytics delivered revenue 
growth of 7%, which represented a 
good performance against a strong 
prior year comparable (2007: 29%). 
There was good growth in software 
products used to support account 
management as institutions seek new 
ways to improve risk assessment, 
as well as good progress in vertical 
markets outside financial services, 
particularly in the telecommunications 
and energy sectors. Fraud prevention 
activities also performed well, due to 
greater traction from new products 
and penetration of new channels. This 
offset softness in software products 
used in origination of new credit, as 
financial services institutions deferred 
some spending decisions.

Total revenues at Marketing Services 
grew 8%. Organic revenue growth 
was 2%, benefiting from the mix 
shift towards new media activities 
(data integrity and digital services) 
from traditional direct mail and list 
processing activities. At the end 
of the year, new media activities 
accounted for just under 50% of 
revenues, including the contribution 
from Hitwise, acquired earlier in 
the period. There were excellent 
performances in the year from digital 
services (email), which delivered high 
volumes and new client wins, and data 
integrity services (QAS), which further 
increased its market penetration. 
Hitwise also performed strongly, driven 
by significant new business wins and 
improved retention rates. There was 
some moderation in the rate of decline 
at traditional direct mail activities, with 
good momentum on new business wins.
 
Protecting families from identity theft
Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in 
the US, with criminals using stolen personal 
information to assume another person’s 
identity to commit fraud or theft. More than 
one in ten US adults fell victim to this in 2006; 
but children’s personal information is also 
increasingly being targeted, where crimes may 
go undetected for many years.  
Experian’s new Family Secure protects 
families against identity theft through 
constant monitoring of both their Experian 
credit report and the personal information of 
their children, alerting them to any suspicious 
activity. Fraud Resolution Representatives 
provide expert support in resolving any issues 
and a US$2 million Family Secure guarantee 
provides peace of mind that losses resulting 
from identity theft will be reimbursed.

Interactive
Includes Consumer Direct (online credit 
reports, scores and monitoring services 
sold direct to consumers) and lead 
generation businesses (LowerMyBills, 
online education and PriceGrabber)
Revenue at Interactive grew by 5%  
in the year.
Consumer Direct continued to 
build strongly on its market-leading 
position, delivering growth in excess 
of 20%. This was driven by further 
growth in subscription revenue and 
good progress in development of the 
affinity channel, for example from the 
partnership with American Express. 
Experian also continues to invest in 
new products with broad market appeal 
and which focus on new demographic 
opportunities, for example in the 
area of fraud prevention and identity 
protection.
In lead generation, PriceGrabber 
performed well with growth fuelled by 
higher referral revenue, good growth in 
co-brand partnerships and increased 
media revenue. LowerMyBills was 
impacted by the severe downturn in 
sub-prime mortgage lending, which 
led to a significant decline in revenue, 
as previously disclosed. Strategically, 
the emphasis has been on leveraging 
the LowerMyBills platform, integrating 
it with the education vertical and 
diversifying into new verticals such 
as credit card and insurance. The new 
platform is now referred to as Experian 
Interactive Media and positions 
Experian to expand across multiple 
vertical markets quickly and efficiently.  
Financial review
Revenue from continuing activities 
was US$2,061m, up 4%, with organic 
revenue growth of 3%. The acquisition 
of Hitwise contributed 1% to revenue 
growth.
EBIT from direct businesses was 
US$554m (2007: US$512m), an 
increase of 8% in the year, giving an 
EBIT margin of 26.9% (2007: 25.8%). 
Margins improved in all four areas, 
notwithstanding the difficult market 
environment and while funding 
investment in the Canadian credit 
bureau build.
EBIT from FARES, the 20%-owned 
real estate information associate, 
was US$54m (2007: US$61m). This 
reflected continued cost action, 
which helped offset the very weak 
environment for mortgage origination.

Improving credit decision making 
through a strategic alliance with Visa
Experian formed a ground-breaking, strategic 
alliance with Visa during the year to develop a 
series of new and innovative products that will 
provide financial institutions with enhanced 
intelligence across the credit decision-making 
lifecycle. 
The first product from the alliance is 
BankruptcyPredict, which can better identify 
consumers in financial distress and predict 
bankruptcies up to 24 months in advance.  
BankruptcyPredict combines information from 
Experian’s credit files with transaction data 
from Visa to deliver a bankruptcy risk score.  
By taking a more comprehensive view of a 
consumer’s credit activity, BankruptcyPredict 
and the other products expected to result from 
the alliance will enable financial institutions 
to make more accurate credit management 
decisions.

Latin America
Serasa performed strongly in the first nine months 
since acquisition, delivering revenue on plan and 
EBIT ahead of buy plan. Serasa continues to benefit 
from the expansion of the credit market in Brazil and 
will provide a bridgehead for further expansion in 
Latin America.
Credit Services
Includes consumer credit and 
business information
In the year, Credit Services delivered 
revenue of US$305m, relating entirely 
to Serasa. Serasa benefited from 
positive macro-economic trends 
in Brazil and expansion in demand 
for credit, which has fuelled growth 
in loan products such as credit 
cards. Serasa delivered strong 
performances in both consumer 
and business information, driven by 
increased penetration of existing 
clients, as well as new client wins.
There was good progress in the 
year against the Serasa acquisition 
buy plan. The integration was 
successfully completed in March 
and there was progress on transfer 
of best practice in sales execution. 
Experian value-added products 
suitable to the Brazilian market 
have been identified, with launches 
planned in the year ending 31 March 
2009. In addition, there was continued 
investment in new product innovation 
at Serasa, with a strong product 
pipeline for both consumer and 
business information services.
Decision Analytics
Includes credit analytics and decision 
support software
Decision Analytics performed well 
in Latin America from a modest 
base, with revenue growth of 43%, 
reflecting new business wins in the 
telecommunications and financial 
services sectors. 
Marketing Services
Includes marketing data and analytics
Revenue in Marketing Services was 
US$10m in the year, resulting from 
the acquisition of Informarketing. 
The acquisition has performed 
exceptionally well, reflecting strong 
growth and a number of new client 
wins, for example data and data 
enhancement services for several 
major Brazilian banks.

Financial review
Revenue was US$324m for Latin 
America, reflecting the first time 
contributions from Serasa and 
Informarketing. Organic revenue 
growth was 43%, attributable to 
Decision Analytics only.
EBIT in the year was US$75m, 
delivering an EBIT margin of 23.1%. 
EBIT includes a favourable IFRS 
adjustment of US$9m, principally in 
relation to the differential treatment 
of capitalisation of data assets 
by Serasa under Brazilian GAAP . 
Integration charges in relation to the 
Serasa acquisition of US$11m were 
incurred in the period. 
Establishing a major presence for 
Experian in Brazil
In June 2007, Experian acquired a controlling 
interest in Serasa, the largest credit bureau 
in Brazil and the fourth largest in the world.
Serasa plays an active role in almost 
every consumer and commercial credit 
decision in Brazil. Its clients include many 
of Brazil’s leading companies, as well as 
major multinational organisations, and over 
100,000 small businesses and shopkeepers.  
The acquisition of Serasa has consolidated 
Experian’s global leadership in credit 
services, while providing a commanding 
position in one of the world’s fastest 
growing markets for credit. It has also 
created exciting opportunities for Experian 
to introduce Serasa’s clients to a wide range 
of powerful analytical products.

UK and Ireland
UK and Ireland performed well despite a difficult 
market environment for the financial services sector. 
This reflected the balance and diversity of the 
Experian portfolio. There was significant investment 
in new products, both organically and via acquisition, 
and a focus on enhancing operational efficiency. 
Credit Services
Includes consumer credit and 
business information bureaux and 
automotive and insurance services 
Total revenue for Credit Services 
increased by 4% at constant exchange 
rates, with organic revenue growth 
of 1%. Acquisitions contributed 3% 
to revenue growth, primarily The pH 
Group. There was good progress in 
business information over the year, 
which offset weakness in consumer 
information. This weakness was 
attributable to the unprecedented 
market conditions that affected the 
financial services sector and which 
led to lower transaction volumes 
on consumer credit information 
products. Elsewhere, there were 
good performances in new vertical 
markets; in telecommunications 
Experian continues to gain share, and 
there has been significant progress 
in the UK public sector with four 
substantial multi-year contract wins. 
There was also good progress with 
large financial services customers, 
including a significant multi-year 
renewal with HBOS at increased 
contract value.
Strategically, Experian maintains its 
focus on product innovation and a 
strong new product pipeline has been 
built which will support both business 
and consumer information activities, 
including new services in the trade 
credit sector, as well as in account 
management and collections. During 
the year, there was also further focus 
on enhancing operational efficiency 
with new investment in low-cost 
delivery centres.
Decision Analytics
Includes credit analytics, decision 
support software and fraud solutions
T otal revenue at Decision Analytics 
increased by 8% at constant 
exchange rates, flat on an organic 
basis. Acquisitions contributed 
the growth, namely Tallyman and 
N4 Solutions. Performance was 
affected by the challenging market 
environment for financial services. 
Lower credit origination volumes 
impacted revenue from application 
processing, while capital expenditure 
cutbacks by lenders gave rise to 
delays in pipeline conversion. These 
factors were counterbalanced by 
good growth in fraud prevention 
software where new client wins were 
secured for Experian’s Hunter and 
Probe solutions. 
During the year, Experian 
acquired the Tallyman collections 
management software business and 
N4 Solutions, a mortgage sector and 
financial services software provider. 
Both acquisitions have performed 
very well, benefiting from their 
integration into Experian. Tallyman 
has generated multiple new business 
wins in the financial services, 
telecommunications and utilities 
sectors, while N4 Solutions secured 
new contracts with Norwich Union 
and Nationwide. There was also 
significant organic investment in new 
products to help lenders with default 
and insolvency consultancy, public 
sector scoring, plus further initiatives 
in fraud solutions.

Helping companies to undertake highly targeted 
marketing  campaigns
Experian Fusion is the UK’s first pay-as-you-go, 
integrated marketing database tool, enabling 
companies to execute highly targeted marketing 
campaigns to acquire new customers and maximise 
the value of existing customers. The system combines 
the software technology of ClarityBlue, which Experian 
acquired in 2006, with Experian’s extensive information 
assets.  
Experian Fusion has been designed for companies 
wanting to keep in regular contact with consumers 
through multiple communications channels. It also 
provides access to sophisticated analytical tools for 
gaining greater insight into those individuals’ needs 
and aspirations. Major companies that have invested in 
this system during the year include Abbey, part of the 
Santander Group, Coors Brewers and Zurich, the home 
and car insurance company. 18 Experian Annual Report 2008

Revenue from continuing activities

EBIT from continuing activities was 
US$226m, flat at constant exchange 
rates. The EBIT margin was 23.4% 
(2007: 25.1%). The lower margin 
reflects the negative organic revenue 
trend in Marketing Services and 
adverse acquisition mix.

Expanding our product portfolio with market-
leading collections software
Experian acquired the Tallyman debt management 
system in May 2007. This market-leading collections 
software is used by consumer credit providers 
around the world to manage successfully the debts 
of more than 20 million customers. Tallyman enables 
lenders to employ the most appropriate collections 
strategies for different customers in order to 
maximise the amount of debt collected, while 
reducing write-offs and helping retain customers for 
future business.
In today’s financial environment, where the efficient 
collection of debt is a high priority for lenders, the 
acquisition of Tallyman enhances Experian’s range 
of software solutions to cover all points of the 
customer lifecycle.

There were strong credit bureaux 
performances across both 
consumer and business information, 
particularly in Southern and Eastern

business wins in the year included 
GE Money in Norway. At transaction 
processing in France, business 
process outsourcing performed well 
and secured new business wins, as 
did debit card processing. Cheque 
processing performance was weak  
as usage of cheques declines 
in favour of debit card and other

There was strong demand for credit

Southern and Eastern Europe, Japan, 
Korea, China and Australia. There 
was also good progress for fraud 
solution services, such as Hunter, 
particularly in the emerging markets

US$3,481m to US$4,130m. 
Benchmark profit before tax 
(‘Benchmark PBT’)
Benchmark PBT for continuing 
operations rose by US$105m to 
US$819m, principally as a result of  
the increase in revenue from 
continuing operations including the 
benefit of acquisitions.
T axation 
The Group’s effective rate of tax for 
the year based on Benchmark PBT 
was 23.2% (2007: 22.4%). The Group’s 
cash tax rate (based on tax paid in the 
year and Benchmark PBT) was 11.1% 
(2007: 16.9%).
Earnings and dividends

Basic earnings per share were 43.3 US 
cents in the year ended 31 March 2008.
Bringing new confidence to the buying 
of used cars
Experian’s vehicle history information is a 
vital component in the used car buying and 
selling process. It reveals if a vehicle has 
been stolen or previously salvaged, whether 
it has been water damaged or involved in an 
accident, whether the mileage is correct and 
other valuable insights.  
Interpreting all this information can be time 
consuming though, particularly for people 
wanting to compare different vehicles 
quickly and easily. That’s why Experian has 
developed the AutoCheck Score in the US, 
a world first for the vehicle industry. The 
AutoCheck Score distills all the history 
information Experian holds on a vehicle into 
a single, numeric score and then compares 
it to vehicles of similar age and type. The 
AutoCheck Score is a valuable tool for 
used car buyers and sellers, and has been 
proven to increase confidence in the vehicle 
purchase decision.

The basic earnings per share for 
the prior year of 49.9 US cents 
included 14.8 US cents in respect of 
discontinued operations. Benchmark 
earnings per share increased to 60.3 
US cents from 59.7 US cents last year. 
The board has announced a dividend 
of 12.0 US cents per ordinary share, 
giving a dividend per share of 18.5 US 
cents for the full year which is covered 
3.5 times by benchmark earnings.
Share price and total equity
The share price of Experian ranged 
from a low of 358p to a high of 633.5p 
during the year. On 31 March 2008, the 
mid market price was 367p, giving a 
market capitalisation of US$7.4bn at 
that date.
Total equity at 31 March 2008 
amounted to US$2,117m, equivalent 
to US$2.09 per share, an increase of 
US$10m in the year.
Cash flow and net debt
As indicated in the table opposite, 
the Group’s free cash flow in the year 
ended 31 March 2008 was US$679m 
compared with US$577m in 2007.
Capital expenditure in 2008 was 
US$344m, US$69m higher than last 
year as a result of capital expenditure 
in newly acquired businesses. Such 
expenditure was equivalent to 118% of 
the depreciation charge in 2008. 
Free cash flow, together with existing 
cash resources and draw downs from 
borrowing facilities, was used to 
fund acquisitions of US$1,720m and 
dividends of US$193m. Cash outflow 
from exceptional items amounted to 
US$45m. The net cash outflow for the 
year was US$1,282m. 
Net debt at 31 March 2008 increased 
by US$1,291m to US$2,699m, up from 
US$1,408m at 31 March 2007.
Acquisitions
Acquisition expenditure amounted to 
US$1,720m (2007: US$118m), including 
deferred and contingent consideration 
on prior year acquisitions. During the 
year ended 31 March 2008, acquisition 
expenditure was principally in 
connection with the purchase of 
Hitwise and the majority stake in Serasa.
Liquidity and funding
The Group seeks to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest its 
cash assets safely and profitably.
The maturity, currency and interest 
rate profiles of the Group’s borrowings 
are shown in note 30 to the financial 
statements. The maturity profile is 
spread over the next six years, to avoid 
excessive concentration of refinancing 
needs.  At 31 March 2008 undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities totalled 
US$1,121m.
During the year, the Group redeemed 
the whole of the outstanding balance 
of the 4.125% Euronotes 2007 at their 
par value of €548m.

Financial risk management
The Group seeks to reduce its 
exposures to foreign exchange, 
interest rate and other financial risks. 
Full disclosures in respect of financial 
risks, as required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’ which 
became effective from 1 April 2007, 
are included within the notes to the 
financial statements.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s reported profit can be 
significantly affected by currency 
movements. In the year ended 31 
March 2008 approximately 36% of 
the Group’s EBIT from continuing 
operations was earned in currencies 
other than the US Dollar.
The Group operates internationally 
and is exposed to foreign exchange risk 
from future commercial transactions, 
recognised assets and liabilities and 
investments in, and loans between, 
entities with different functional 
currencies. The Group manages such 
risk, primarily within entities whose 
functional currencies are Sterling, 
by borrowing in the relevant foreign 
currencies and using forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The principal 
transaction exposures are to the US 
Dollar and the Euro.
The Group has investments in entities 
with other functional currencies, 
whose net assets are exposed to 
foreign exchange translation risk.  In 
order to reduce the impact of currency 
fluctuations on the value of such 
entities, the Group has a policy of 
borrowing in US Dollars and Euros, as 
well as in Sterling and of entering into 
forward foreign exchange contracts in 
the relevant currencies.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate exposure 
is managed by the use of fixed and 
floating rate borrowings and by the 
use of interest rate swaps to adjust 
the balance of fixed and floating rate 
liabilities. The Group also mixes 
the duration of its borrowings to 
smooth the impact of interest rate 
fluctuations.
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is 
managed by dealing only with banks 
and financial institutions with strong 
credit ratings, within limits set for 
each organisation. Dealing activity is 
closely controlled and counterparty 
positions are monitored regularly.

Net financing costs
At US$127m, net financing costs 
excluding financing fair value 
remeasurements were US$16m higher 
than last year. The net interest expense 
for the year ended 31 March 2008 reflects 
the funding cost of the significant 
acquisitions in the year.  
That factor together with the changes 
in capital structure resulting from the 
settling of intra-group lending prior to 
the demerger, the demerger itself and the 
IPO mean that the prior year’s interest  
expense is not directly comparable with 
that for the current year. The reported net 
interest expense benefits from a credit to 
interest of US$23m relating to the excess 
of the expected return on pension assets 
over the interest on pension liabilities 
(2007: US$16m).
Exceptional items
In January 2008, the Group 
announced that it was launching 
a programme of significant cost-
efficiency measures. Identified 
efficiencies include offshoring of 
development activity, restructuring of 
core credit and marketing activities 
and infrastructure consolidation. 
Following the identification of 
additional opportunities this 
programme is expected to deliver 
annualised cost savings in the region 
of US$110m, of which approximately 
US$50m is expected to be realised in 
the year ending 31 March 2009. One-off 
restructuring costs associated with 
achieving these cost savings will be in 
the region of US$140m, the majority 
of which will be cash costs. Costs 
of US$60m have been recognised 
in the year in connection with this 
programme with a related cash 
outflow of US$18m. Of this charge, 
US$36m related to redundancy 
costs, US$12m related to asset 
write-offs, and US$12m related to 
other restructuring and infrastructure 
consolidation costs. 
Costs relating to the demerger of 
Experian and Home Retail Group 
comprise legal and professional fees in 
respect of the transaction, together with 
costs in connection with the cessation 
of the corporate functions of GUS plc 
and, in the year ended 31 March 2007, a 
charge of US$23m on the early vesting 
and modification of share awards.
Other exceptional items are those 
arising from the profit or loss on 
disposal of businesses or closure of 
material business units.
Other non-GAAP measures
IFRS requires that, on acquisition, specific 
intangible assets are identified and 
recognised separately from goodwill and 
then amortised over their useful economic 
lives. These include items such as brand 
names and customer lists, to which value 
is first attributed at the time of acquisition. 
The Group has excluded amortisation 
of these acquisition intangibles from its 
definition of Benchmark PBT because 
such a charge is based on uncertain 
judgements about their value and 
economic life.
A goodwill adjustment of US$2m 
arose in accordance with IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’ following 
the recognition of a benefit in respect 
of previously unrecognised tax losses 
relating to prior year acquisitions. The 
corresponding tax benefit reduced the 
tax charge in the year by US$2m. The 
equivalent adjustment in the prior year 
was US$14m.
Charges in respect of demerger-
related equity incentive plans relate 
to one-off grants made to senior 
management and all other staff 
levels at the time of demerger under 
a number of equity incentive plans. 
The cost of these one-off grants is 
being charged to the Group income 
statement over the five years following 
the demerger, but excluded from the 
definition of Benchmark PBT. The cost 
of all other grants is being charged 
to the Group income statement 
and included in the definition of 
Benchmark PBT .

An element of the Group’s derivatives 
is ineligible for hedge accounting 
under IFRS. Gains or losses on 
these derivatives arising from market 
movements are charged or credited 
to the Group income statement. In 
the year ended 31 March 2008 this 
amounted to a charge of US$29m 
(2007: US$35m).
Pensions
At 31 March 2008 the Group has a 
retirement benefit surplus for the 
Experian defined benefit funded 
schemes on an IAS 19 basis of 
US$182m (2007: US$141m) and 
separately reported pension 
obligations of US$50m (2007:US$56m) 
in respect of other schemes. Note 27 
to the financial statements shows the 
assumptions used together with the 
other disclosures required by IAS 19.
Accounting policies and 
standards
The principal accounting policies 
used by the Group are shown in note 2 
to the financial statements.
Use of non-GAAP measures
Experian has identified certain 
measures that it believes provide 
additional useful information on the 
performance of the Group. As the 
measures are not defined under IFRS 
they may not be directly comparable 
with other companies’ adjusted 
measures. The non-GAAP measures 
are not intended to be a substitute 
for, or superior to, any IFRS measures 
of performance. Certain non-GAAP 
measures identified by the Group 
are shown in note 2 to the financial 
statements. Further non-GAAP 
measures and reconciliations of those 
measures are set out below.
Discontinuing activities:  
Experian defines discontinuing 
activities as businesses sold, closed 
or identified for closure during a 
financial year.  These are treated 
as discontinuing activities for 
both revenue and EBIT purposes. 
Comparative information is 
restated to exclude the results 
of discontinuing activities. This 
financial measure differs from the 
definition of discontinued operations 
set out in IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets 
held for sale and discontinued 
operations’.  
Under IFRS 5, a discontinued 
operation is defined as: (i) a 
separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations; 
(ii) part of a single plan to dispose 
of a major line of business or 
geographical area of operations; or 
(iii) a subsidiary acquired exclusively 
with a view to resale.

Continuing activities: Businesses 
trading at 31 March 2008 that have 
not been disclosed as discontinuing 
activities are reported as continuing 
activities.
Organic growth: This is the year-
on-year change in the revenue of 
continuing activities, at constant 
exchange rates, excluding acquisitions 
(other than affiliate credit bureaux) 
until the first anniversary date of 
consolidation.
Direct business: Direct business 
refers to Experian’s business exclusive 
of the financial results of FARES.
Constant currency: In order to 
illustrate its organic performance, 
Experian discusses its results in terms 
of constant exchange rates, unless 
otherwise stated. This represents 
growth calculated as if the exchange 
rates used to determine the results 
had remained unchanged from those 
used in the previous year.
Roundings
Certain financial data have been 
rounded within this report. As a result 
of this rounding, the totals of data 
presented may vary slightly from the 
actual arithmetic totals of such data.
Establishing Experian’s first office  
in South Korea
South Korea is a country that has 
experienced robust economic growth in 
recent years, fuelling demand for consumer 
credit. In September 2007, Experian 
established a new company in South Korea 
with its long-term partner, Mirae Credit 
Information Services (MCI).
Experian Decision Analytics Korea will 
be accelerating the availability of highly 
customised and advanced credit management 
services for the financial services sector 
in South Korea, as well as extending these 
solutions to new market segments, such as 
telecommunications and insurance. Experian 
and MCI already provide support to six of 
South Korea’s top seven retail banks.   28 Experian Annual Report 2008
Experian already delivers many 
benefits to society. On a macro scale 
it helps fuel the world’s economies, 
including those in emerging markets, 
and at an individual level, it provides 
consumers with information to 
enable them to make better financial 
decisions. 
Experian is a business with skilled 
people at its core and with many 
different external stakeholders that 
make success possible, from clients to 
the general public, regulatory bodies 
to NGOs. Aware of its wider social 
responsibilities and taking these 
stakeholders’ views into account, 
Experian plays its part in helping to 
provide solutions to some of society’s 
problems and not only because of 
a sense of altruism. Many of these 
problems, when looked at with the 
insight Experian can provide, create 
new opportunities as well as mitigating 
risks.
Seeing things from a social, 
environmental and ethical stance, with 
many different stakeholders’ interests 
in mind, has enabled the Group to 
successfully revise its approach to 
CR in its first year of independent 
trading. Experian has updated its 
reporting, added depth to the role of 
its CR management team and created 
a forward-looking CR strategy. This 
strategy is helping the company 
embed CR principles in the way it does 
business and is creating innovative 
opportunities to address social needs.
Updated reporting
At the beginning of the year Experian had 
established six strong responsibilities.  
Use and protect data properly,  l
respecting all the relevant laws, 
helping evolve industry guidelines 
and new legislation, and ensuring 
a culture of compliance with the 
highest standards of integrity.
Create social and economic benefit  l
through our products, services and 
capabilities, balancing commercial 
benefit with consumers’ rights and 
needs.
Inform and empower consumers,  l
and ensure that those who interact 
directly with our company receive 
fair and honest treatment.
Be a good employer to all,  l
establishing a set of expected 
behaviours and values, ensuring 
that everyone working for us is 
treated fairly, given the maximum 
opportunity to fulfil their potential 
and that all our workplaces are safe 
and healthy.
Minimise as far as possible the  l
environmental impacts associated 
with our business and enable 
employee participation, with a 
particular concentration on the 
reduction of energy use and its 
effect on global warming.
Play an active part in social and  l
economic regeneration in our 
communities, be they local, national 
or global.
Experian sees these as the main 
indicators that society should use to 
hold the company to account. Three 
relate to what it does in the marketplace 
and three cover its approach to 
environment, community and the 
workplace. 
The Group reported openly on these six 
elements in its first year and has again, 
for consistency and comparability, 
reported on the same elements this 
year, but with greater transparency and 
clarity. The full online report provides 
both an overview of the Group’s CR 
performance and a fully substantiated 
and verified data section. For the first 
time Experian has also created an 
eight-page summary report aimed at 
key stakeholders which, we hope, will 
encourage engagement and initiate 
discussion about the Group’s approach 
to CR.
The role of the management team
The governance structure created in 
March 2007 remains in place; a cross-
regional CR Management Group has 
been strengthened with the addition 
of Victor Nichols, responsible for 
the global Interactive and Marketing 
Services business lines and now 
CEO of UK and EMEA, and T omas 
Carmona, an experienced CR manager 
from Serasa in Brazil.
Report on corporate 
responsibilities
Corporate responsibility (CR) is increasingly seen as 
a way to define how organisations operate with due 
regard for the future of both their business and the 
society and environment they operate in. In its first full 
year of trading as an independent company, Experian 
has made some significant advances in its approach to 
CR and the sustainability of its operations.  29 Experian Annual Report 2008

Report on corporate responsibilities
Improving the quality of customer 
information in healthcare
Successful organisations depend on 
accurate information and there are few 
more fundamental pieces of information 
than a customer’s address. A misspelt 
street name or transposed house number 
can have major implications for future 
communications and for the success of 
the relationship.  
QAS, part of Experian, specialises in 
software that ensures customer data 
accuracy at the point of capture. It has more 
than 10,000 clients in sectors as diverse 
as retailing, education and healthcare. St 
Clare’s Healthcare System, which operates 
four hospitals in New Jersey, chose QAS 
for verifying and standardising address 
information during patient admissions.  
Within just 90 days, the reduction in 
returned clinical correspondence and billing 
documents had paid for the QAS software.
The role this group plays has also 
evolved through the year and now 
engages team members in:
Participating in reviews of key  l
risks and opportunities – looking 
particularly at social, environmental 
and ethical issues.
Championing the embedding of CR  l
in ‘business as usual’ practice.
Advising on the split and allocation  l
of Group central funding for regional 
CR and community projects.
The team has been instrumental in the 
evolution of the CR strategy.
A forward-looking strategy 
to assess risk and identify 
opportunities
The CR strategy has three strands:
i)     Embedding CR in everyday business 
practice, considering social and 
environmental risks and benefits in 
normal decision-making processes.  
ii)    Focusing the community programme 
to concentrate on social issues 
where Experian already has 
some expertise – encouraging 
entrepreneurs and supporting 
better financial management skills, 
especially in deprived sectors of 
society.
iii)  Creating some ‘big ideas’ using a 
social and environmental focus as 
a catalyst for innovation and cross-
disciplinary coordination to create 
ideas that can have a major social 
impact. 30 Experian Annual Report 2008
Looking forward
One of the new roles for the CR 
Management Group is to hold regular 
‘horizon scanning’ meetings looking at 
the risks and opportunities presented 
by a longer-term view around each of 
Experian’s key responsibilities. These 
discussions are the precursor to ‘big 
ideas’ highlighting social issues and 
providing the stimulus for innovative 
thought. Already two ideas have 
presented themselves as a result of 
the four meetings to date; the next 
step will be to hold these discussions 
across the regions through Experian’s 
CR coordinators’ networks.
Link to business strategy
The six responsibilities are also 
intrinsically linked with the Group’s 
business strategy.  Experian’s 
business vision is that its people, data 
and technology become a necessary 
part of every major consumer 
economy around the world. People 
and data are two key resources and 
the associated risks, from a social 
and ethical standpoint, are in part 
addressed by the discussions held in 
the CR Management Group. 
Board involvement
The CR strategy was presented to the 
board and has their input and approval 
and will be used in the year ahead to 
drive progress. The board is given a 
report on CR progress at each meeting 
and directors are fully aware of their 
duties and responsibilities. 
Performance this year
The full report of our performance  
this year is available online at  
www.experiancrreport.com. This gives 
a complete picture of how Experian 
has met its objectives and complied 
with policies. It has been reviewed to 
provide assurance on the quality and 
accuracy of its contents. Headlines 
include:
A fall in carbon emissions from  l
buildings, driven by improved energy 
efficiency and increased purchase of 
renewable energy.
The adoption of a new global  l
environmental policy. 
Findings from Experian’s first global  l
employee survey, based on the 
responses from nearly 10,000 (73%) 
colleagues’ worldwide.
Inclusion in the FTSE4Good and Dow  l
Jones Global Sustainability Indices, 
the latter ranking Experian among the 
top 10% of companies assessed for 
sustainability.
Extended information on the Group’s  l
stance on human rights, and in 
particular the steps being taken 
to ensure they are respected in 
Experian’s supply chain.
Leadership of joint financial services  l
initiatives that have led to a reduction 
in the incidence of identity theft in 
the US.
A wards won in the UK for the best use  l
of data in the public sector .
The development of a report in Latin  l
America that will help assess the 
environmental and social impact of 
organisations alongside financial 
stability .
Community giving, which has  l
increased despite tough trading 
conditions. Even without the effect of 
the Serasa acquisition, community 
giving as a percentage of profit went up

Report on corporate responsibilities
Helping Government to improve the 
payment of child maintenance 
The Child Support Agency (CSA) is a Government 
organisation in the UK whose role is to help 
ensure that parents who live apart from their 
children contribute financially to their upkeep. 
Child maintenance payments can be vital to the 
wellbeing of single-parent families, but frequently 
go unpaid and the CSA currently has £3.7bn of 
debt that remains uncollected.  
As part of a major three-year Operational 
Improvement Plan, the CSA is now working with 
Experian to use the information and analysis 
techniques that have become so familiar within 
the credit industry to improve the payment of child 
maintenance and to ‘get more money flowing 
to more children’. In particular, Experian will be 
helping the CSA to trace absent parents and to 
develop risk and affordability profiles that will 
enable the CSA to develop a more tailored and 
effective approach to individual cases.  32 Experian Annual Report 2008
Organic growth Acquired growth
Key performance indicators
Experian’s strategy is to develop a framework to focus on 
its core data and analytics, drive profitable growth and 
optimise capital efficiency. In accordance with this strategy, 
Experian’s financial objectives are to drive organic growth, 
 to maintain or improve margins and to convert at least 85% 
of EBIT into operating cash flow. The following indicators 
are the key ones used by the board and management team 
to assess Experian’s success in achieving its objectives.
EBIT (US$m) and margin
In the year ended 31 March 2008, 
Experian increased its total EBIT 
by 15% to US$945m. Continuing 
EBIT increased by 13% at constant 
exchange rates. EBIT margin of 
21.8% from continuing activities is 
in line with the prior year during a 
period of increased investment.
Total revenue growth
In the year ended 31 March 2008, 
Experian increased its revenue 
from continuing activities by 
14% at constant exchange rates. 
Acquisitions accounted for 10% 
of the revenue growth, largely 
reflecting the contributions from 
Serasa and Hitwise.

Experian aims to convert at least 
85% of its EBIT into operating cash 
flow each year, even after significant 
investment in growth opportunities.  
In the year ended 31 March 2008, 
Experian converted 95% of EBIT to 
operating cash flow.

countries through a network 
of offices. Additional offices 
were opened during the year in 
Malaysia and South Korea to 
support Experian’s growth in those 
countries. This brought the total

Carbon footprint  
(000’s tonnes)
Experian’s environmental impact is 
largely the result of energy use in 
buildings and travel by road, air and 
train. The Group is taking steps to 
steadily reduce its carbon footprint.
Data given above reflects the Group’s major 
employment units in the USA, UK, France and 
Brazil which constitute over 80% of the Group

Number of consumer  
credit bureaux
Experian’s consumer credit bureaux 
provide the foundation for its Credit 
Services and Decision Analytics 
businesses. During the year, Experian 
acquired a controlling interest in 
Serasa in Brazil, the fourth largest 
credit bureau in the world. Serasa 
provides Experian with a commanding 
position in one of the fastest growing 
credit markets and increases the 
number of consumer credit bureaux 
owned by Experian to 15.

Revenue per employee 
(US$000’s)
In the year ended 31 March 2008, 
revenue per full time equivalent (FTE) 
employee decreased by 5%. This was 
largely the result of the acquisition of 
Serasa, which significantly increased 
the average number of FTE employees.

Employee engagement
Experian’s people are a key resource 
and an employee survey helps 
measure their engagement with the 
business. A fully engaged employee 
is regarded as one with a belief in the 
company and its goals, a pride in the 
way it operates and a willingness to 
go the extra mile.

Risks and uncertainties 
Legislation or government regulations 
may alter what data Experian can 
collect and how it is collected 
To the best of Experian’s knowledge, 
the Group is in compliance with 
data protection requirements 
in the jurisdictions in which 
it operates. Experian actively 
monitors its collection and use of 
personal data, while the Group’s 
legal, regulatory and government 
affairs departments work closely 
with senior management to adopt 
strategies to educate lawmakers and 
influence the public policy debate, 
where appropriate.  
Technology
There could be security breaches of 
Experian’s systems and processes or 
its systems could fail 
Experian’s data centres are protected 
against damage from fire, power 
loss, telecommunications failure, 
natural disaster, hardware or software 
malfunction, computer viruses or 
other purposeful attacks, such as 
physical break-ins or hacking. To 
mitigate the risk from insecure or 
unreliable IT systems, Experian 
maintains off-site copies of all 
information contained in databases 
and runs back-up data centres. 
The Group also has established 
support arrangements with third 
party vendors and strict standards, 
procedures and training schemes 
for technology services, physical 
security, information security and 
business continuity.
People 
Experian is dependent upon highly 
skilled personnel, especially its 
senior management and other 
experienced staff 
Loss of these people could have an 
adverse effect on the company’s 
ability to deliver its corporate 
objectives. Experian aims to provide 
compensation and benefits that 
are competitive with other leading 
companies, as well as fulfilling 
future career opportunities.
Other risks
There may be an economic downturn 
in one or more of Experian’s major 
markets, which impacts the demand 
for consumer credit in particular 
Experian is not immune from 
economic risks in any of its markets.  
However, the breadth of Experian’s 
portfolio by product, by geography, by 
sector and by client partly mitigates 
the impact of this risk.
Experian could face increased 
competition, especially in the credit 
reporting industry 
Experian mitigates this risk through 
continued research and investment 
in people, technology and products 
as prioritised by its strategic plan.
Risks to Experian are anticipated 
and regularly assessed and its 
internal controls are enhanced 
where necessary to ensure that such 
risks are appropriately mitigated.
Experian has identified the following 
major potential risks.
Data
The data that Experian holds  
may be inappropriately used 
Experian has established rigorous 
information security policies, 
standards, procedures, and 
recruitment and training schemes, 
which are embedded throughout its 
business operations. Experian also 
screens new third party partners 
carefully and conducts targeted 
audits on their operations. The 
loss and/or potential misuse of 
consumer data is addressed through 
continued investment in IT security 
infrastructure, including the significant 
use of data and communications 
encryption technology.
Experian’s vision is that its people, data and 
 technology become a necessary part of every 
major consumer economy around the world. The 
main potential risks to achieving this are either 
specific to Experian’s business model, such as 
information security, or more general, such as the 
impact of competition. 35 Experian Annual Report 2008

Risks and uncertainties
Expanding Experian’s email marketing business into 
important new markets
Experian acquired Emailing Solution, a leading French 
permission-based email marketing company, in May 2007.   
The acquisition extended the geographical reach of Experian’s 
existing CheetahMail business into one of the largest and 
fastest growing email markets in Europe.
Emailing Solution was founded in 2001 and provides email 
marketing services in France and Spain to over 500 brands, 
including AXA, Orange and Hewlett Packard. Now part of 
Experian CheetahMail, clients have access to a wider range of 
services and a broader distribution network. 
There may be consolidation among 
Experian’s clients, which may cause 
price compression and a reduction in 
its revenue and profits
No single client accounts for more 
than 2% of Experian’s revenue, 
which reduces the probability of this 
potential risk having a significant 
impact on the business.
Acquisitions may not meet 
expectations 
Experian assesses all acquisitions 
rigorously, using both in-house 
experts and professional advisers. 
In addition, the Group conducts 
extensive post-acquisition reviews 
to ensure performance remains 
consistent with the buy plan.
The outcome of litigation could be 
unfavourable to Experian
Experian carries insurance cover 
against such risks and employs 
expert legal personnel in-house, 
as well as retaining the services of 
several leading legal practices, to 
assist in the effective management 
and disposal of legal proceedings.  
Experian could fail to protect 
adequately its valuable intellectual 
property rights or face claims 
for intellectual property right 
infringement
 
Experian seeks patent protection and 
appropriate agreements regarding 
its intellectual property rights, 
where appropriate and feasible, and 
continues to monitor this situation. 
Experian could fail to protect 
adequately against its exposure to 
financial risks
As described in note 3 to the Group 
financial statements on page 81, 
Experian’s financial risk management 
focuses on the unpredictability 
of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on 
the Group’s financial performance.  36 Experian Annual Report 2008

Markets in which Experian 
operates
Experian has a broad and balanced 
portfolio - by product type, country 
and vertical market.
In the year ended 31 March 2008,  l
47% of sales came from Credit 
Services, 12% from Decision 
Analytics, 20% from Marketing 
Services and 21% from Interactive.
In the year ended 31 March 2008,  l
51% of sales came from North 
America, 8% from Latin America, 
24% from UK and Ireland and 17% 
from EMEA/Asia Pacific.
Financial services clients account  l
for 52% of sales, followed by 17% 
from direct-to-consumer, 10% from 
retail and home shopping, 7% from 
telecommunications, utilities and 
insurance and the balance from 
government, publishing/media and 
automotive.
Experian has over 100,000 clients,   l
of which the top ten account for 
14% of sales and the top 50 clients 
33% of sales.
Following the acquisition of  l
Serasa, Experian employs 
approximately 15,500 people and  
has offices in 38 countries. 
Experian owns and operates  l
consumer credit bureaux in 15 
countries and business credit 
bureaux in nine countries. 
Experian classifies one billion  l
consumers by socio-demographic 
type in over 25 countries around the 
world.
As a result of this diversity, Experian 
is not overly dependent on any 
one geography, client, channel or 
economy. While Experian as a whole 
is clearly dependent on the economic 
environments in which it operates, 
its broad portfolio of products and 
markets served provides some 
resilience when its major markets 
weaken. New products also affect 
Experian’s performance, as does its 
success in gaining share in its chosen 
markets.  
Competitive position
Experian has competitors in each of 
its principal activities, but no single 
competitor offers the same breadth 
of capabilities to domestic and 
multinational clients around the world 
or on such a scale.
There is limited public information 
available on the market share of 
Experian’s competitors and it is 
frequently competing against niche, 
local providers of services in its 
different markets.  
However, there are a number of 
companies that Experian views as 
key competitors, which are identified 
below:
Credit Services
There are two other national 
consumer credit bureaux in the US 
(Equifax and TransUnion). In the UK, 
Experian is the clear market leader in 
consumer credit services with mainly 
local competition elsewhere. 
In Brazil, Serasa is the market leader 
in both consumer and commercial 
credit services, also competing 
against mainly local competition.  
Dun & Bradstreet is the only global 
business credit services competitor.
Decision Analytics 
The market leader in the US is Fair 
Isaac. Experian is the market leader 
elsewhere and faces competition 
from Fair Isaac and other fragmented 
local players.
Marketing Services 
There are some large marketing 
competitors in the US, such as 
Acxiom and Harte-Hanks, but 
competition elsewhere is local, 
fragmented and often specialist.
Interactive 
Consumer Direct is the clear market 
leader in the US and UK, selling 
credit reports and services direct 
to consumers in competition with 
Equifax, TransUnion, Fair Isaac and 
other specialist providers. Experian’s 
sales are more than twice that of any 
of its competitors.   37 Experian Annual Report 2008

Business and market overview
North America International
The online lead generation market is 
fragmented and, despite the recent 
economic downturn in the US and 
UK, Experian has strong market 
positions in its chosen areas of 
operation. 
Growth drivers
Experian is well positioned to benefit 
from a number of key drivers of long-
term growth. 
      
Credit-related activities 
Experian’s credit reporting is a 
fundamental building block for 
stimulating growth in consumer 
economies through the application 
of effective credit management, 
giving rise to safety and soundness in 
banking systems.
Growth in Experian’s credit-related 
activities is underpinned by:
Global growth in the availability of  l
consumer and business credit.
Global expansion of its financial  l
services clients.
Rapidly expanding demand for  l
sophisticated analytics and software 
that help institutions to predict and 
manage risk.
Marketing-related activities 
Emerging channels are fuelling 
growth in Experian’s marketing-
related activities.
Interactive channels like email and 
the internet are information rich and 
operate on a global scale. These new 
channels are stimulating demand 
for more targeted, faster, more 
effective and measurable marketing 
campaigns.
Experian can apply its core data and 
analytics expertise to find and keep 
profitable customers for its clients by:
Targeting relevant audiences  l
through segmentation.
Creating campaign strategies  l
across all channels.
Providing analytics to measure  l
success.
Key resources
Experian has three key resources 
that are viewed as fundamental to 
the successful implementation of its 
strategy. 
People  
Experian employs approximately 15,500 
people, who are central to the delivery 
of its strategy and client experience.  
The Group prides itself on attracting, 
developing and retaining talented, 
ambitious people throughout its 
operations.  
Succession planning is used to ensure 
that appropriate leadership resources 
are in place to grow the business and 
these plans are regularly reviewed by 
the Board.
The management of talent is one of 
Experian’s top priorities and the Group 
invests heavily in ensuring  employees 
have the right environment and skills 
to do their best work. Employees are 
involved in the planning and direction 
of their work, drawing on a wide range 
of communication methods. Employee 
surveys provide valuable insights into 
employees’ views, while opportunities 
to further enhance employee 
engagement are integral to business 
planning.
Data 
At the core of Experian are 
comprehensive databases of credit and 
marketing information on consumers 
and businesses. Experian offers more 
information than any single competitor, 
which helps make it the partner of 
choice for many organisations.
Each year, Experian invests heavily 
in maintaining complete, accurate 
and up-to-date information, while 
continuing to add new data sources 
that further support clients. Experian 
also has a leadership position as the 
trusted steward of much sensitive 
information, which it has an obligation 
to protect - both to clients who are 
the source of much of this data and 
to consumers who are the subjects of 
the data. Experian therefore operates 
very rigorous security and control 
procedures. 
Technology 
Experian’s information technology 
systems are fundamental to its 
success. They are used for the storage, 
processing and delivery of the data 
that is the foundation of its business, 
as well as for the development and 
delivery of the value-added solutions 
provided to clients. 
Much of the technology used by 
Experian and provided to clients 
is developed, maintained and 
supported by in-house teams across 
its various locations. Experian 
operates continual maintenance 
and management of its information 
technology systems, as well 
as continuing to integrate the 
technologies of existing and acquired 
businesses.

Directors’ report
The directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Principal activities and business review
Experian is a global leader in providing information, analytical and marketing services to organisations and consumers 
to help manage the risk and reward of commercial and financial decisions.  Combining its unique information tools and 
deep understanding of individuals, markets and economies, Experian partners with organisations around the world 
to establish and strengthen customer relationships and provide their businesses with competitive advantage.  For 
consumers, Experian delivers critical information that enables them to make financial and purchasing decisions with 
greater control and confidence.  A review of the results for the year and an indication of future developments appear 
on pages 6 to 37.  Research and development investment continues to be a high priority for Experian in driving growth, 
particularly in relation to product development.  Research expenditure totalled US$6m during the year ended 31 March 
2008 and the amount charged to the Group income statement in the year was US$6m (2007: US$5m). 
Profit and dividends
The Group income statement on page 66 shows a profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2008 of US$452m.  The 
directors have announced the payment of a second interim dividend in lieu of a final dividend of 12 US cents per 
ordinary share to be paid on 25 July 2008 to shareholders on the register of members on 27 June 2008.  An interim 
dividend of 6.5 US cents per ordinary share was paid on 1 February 2008 giving a total dividend for the year of 18.5 US 
cents per ordinary share.
Directors
The names and biographical details of the directors are shown on pages 38 and 39. Sean FitzPatrick was appointed as 
a director of the Company with effect from 1 April 2007. Particulars of directors’ remuneration, service contracts and 
their interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are shown in the report on directors’ remuneration on pages 
51 to 63.  There were no changes in the directors’ interests in the Company’s ordinary shares between the end of the 
financial year and 20 May 2008.
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, each director is required to retire at the annual general 
meeting held in the third calendar year following the year in which he or she was elected or last re-elected by the 
Company.  In order to ensure an orderly re-election process Fabiola Arredondo, Paul Brooks and Roger Davis will 
retire at the annual general meeting in July 2008 and, being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election.  The board 
carried out a formal evaluation of its performance and the performance of its committees and individual directors 
during the year ended 31 March 2008 and is satisfied that each of the three directors retiring at the annual general 
meeting contributes effectively and demonstrates commitment to the role.  Further details regarding the evaluation are 
contained in the corporate governance statement on pages 44 to 50.
During the year, the Company maintained liability insurance and third party indemnification provisions for its 
directors.
Acquisitions and disposal
The Group made a number of acquisitions in the year under review, details of which are included in note 34 to the 
financial statements on page 120.
On 28 June 2007, the Group completed the acquisition of an initial 65% stake in Serasa, the market leading credit bureau 
in Brazil and operator of the fourth largest credit bureau in the world for US$1.2 billion. A further 5% of Serasa has been 
acquired since the date of the acquisition, taking Experian’s total holding in Serasa to 70%. On 8 June 2007, the Group 
acquired the whole of the issued share capital of Hitwise, a leading internet market intelligence company. The Company 
announced the acquisitions of The pH Group, the UK market leader in business-to-business marketing analytics, and 
N4 Solutions, a UK-based mortgage sector and financial services software provider, on 20 July 2007 and 25 July 2007 
respectively.  During the year under review, the Company also completed the acquisition of remaining interests in 
Footfall companies in Spain and Italy.  
The Company announced the sale of Loyalty Solutions, a German provider of back office services to loyalty card 
programmes, to easycash, a leading German point-of-sale network provider, on 26 September 2007.   Experian Annual Report 2008

Substantial shareholdings 
Substantial shareholders are required to notify their interests in accordance with the Company’s articles of 
association, which obliges shareholders to comply with the notification obligations to the Company contained in the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules.  As at 20 May 2008, the Company had been notified of the following interests in 
its issued ordinary share capital or voting rights:
Save for the above, no person has notified any interest of 3% or more or any non-material interest equal to or more 
than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital or in the voting rights of the Company.
Share capital
Details of the authorised and issued share capital of the Company and changes to the Company’s share capital in the 
year ended 31 March 2008 are set out in note K to the Company’s financial statements on page 138.
Takeover Directive information
The Group’s banking facilities contain provisions which, in the event of a change of control of the Company, could result 
in a renegotiation or withdrawal of such facilities.
The £350m 6.375% Eurobonds due 2009 and the £334m 5.625% Euronotes due 2013, issued by the Group, provide that 
holders may require repayment of the respective bonds or notes in the event that a rating agency re-rates the bonds or 
notes to below investment grade following a change of control of the Company.
The Group is party to a joint venture (FARES) with The First American Corporation, pursuant to which the Group holds 
a 20% interest in FARES.  The joint venture agreement provides The First American Corporation with a call right to 
purchase the Group’s interest in FARES in the event of a change of control of the Company.
Details of provisions relating to a change of control in directors’ service contracts are described in the report 
on directors’ remuneration. 
The Group is party to a limited number of operational arrangements which can be terminated or altered upon a change 
of control of the Company, but these are not considered to be individually significant to the business of the Group as a 
whole or, in certain cases, it is considered that their disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the Company.
Details of each person with a significant direct or indirect holding of securities in the Company and the size and 
nature of the holding are contained in the substantial shareholdings table above.
Both the Company by ordinary resolution and the directors may elect any person to be a director, but the number 
of directors shall not exceed the maximum number (if any) fixed by the articles of association of the Company.  Any 
person appointed shall only hold office until the next annual general meeting and shall then be eligible for election.  
The office of a director shall be vacated on the occurrence of any of the events listed in article 92 of the articles of 
association of the Company.  The Company may, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991, remove any director from office and elect another person in place of a director so removed.  The articles of 
association of the Company may be amended by the passing of a special resolution.
Some of Experian’s employee share plans include restrictions on transfer of shares while the shares are subject to 
the plan.  As described in the report on directors’ remuneration, non-executive directors receive a proportion of fees 
in shares which may not normally be transferred during a director’s period of office.
All of Experian’s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.

Financial risk management, objectives and policies
Descriptions of the use of financial instruments and Experian’s treasury and risk management objectives and policies 
are set out in the financial review on pages 23 and 24, and also in note 3 to the Group financial statements.
Own shares
The existing authority for the Company to purchase its own shares, which expires at the end of this year’s annual general 
meeting, was given at the annual general meeting held on 18 July 2007 and permitted the Company to purchase, in the 
market, up to 102,000,000 of its own shares.  The Company did not utilise the authority to make any purchases of its own 
shares during the period under review.
Details of the new authority being requested are contained in the circular to shareholders, which accompanies this 
annual report or is available on the Company’s website at www.experiangroup.com.  The Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 (as amended) now permits the Company to hold any shares bought back as treasury shares as an alternative to 
immediately cancelling them and the directors intend to decide whether to cancel shares pursuant to this authority or 
hold them as treasury shares based on the interests of the Company and shareholders as a whole at the relevant time.  
Details of the shares in the Company purchased by and held under the Experian Group Limited Employee Share Trust, 
the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Plan and the GUS plc ESOP Trust are set out in note L to the Company’s 
financial statements on page 139.
Donations
During the year the Group donated US$1.94m (including a full year’s donation of US$0.2m from Serasa, acquired in 
June 2007) to charitable causes. Funds from the GUS Charitable Trust disbursed through Experian during the year 
totalled US$0.14m.
In addition to cash contributions, the Group’s employees are encouraged to give their time and skills for the benefit of a 
variety of charitable causes. 
During the year the Group made no political donations.
Employment of people with disabilities
People with disabilities, whether registered or not, have equal opportunities when applying for vacancies, with due 
regard to their aptitudes and abilities.  In addition to complying with legislative requirements, procedures are in place 
to ensure that disabled employees are fairly treated and that their training and career development needs are carefully 
managed.  For those employees becoming disabled during the course of their employment, the Group is supportive, 
whether through re-training or re-deployment, so as to provide an opportunity for them to remain with the Group.
Employee involvement
The Group is intent on motivating and keeping staff informed on matters that concern them in the context of their 
employment and involves them through local consultative procedures.  Where there are recognition agreements with 
trade unions, the consultation process is established through national and local trade union representatives and through 
joint consultation committees.  Information on matters of concern to employees and about the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Group’s performance is also disseminated through management channels, conferences, meetings, 
publications and internet sites. 
Employees are actively encouraged to become shareholders in Experian through the provision of save as you earn 
and other all-employee share plan arrangements which are intended to align the interests of employees with those of 
shareholders.

Creditor payment
For all trade creditors, it is Group policy to:
Agree and confirm the terms of payment at the commencement of business with that supplier; l
Pay in accordance with any contract agreed with the supplier or as required by law; and l
Review continually the payment procedures and liaise with suppliers as a means of eliminating difficulties and  l
maintaining a good working relationship. 
 
Trade creditors of the Group at 31 March 2008 were 39 days based on the ratio of Group trade creditors at the end of 
the year to the amounts invoiced during the year by trade creditors.  The Company has no trade creditors.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgment at the time of approving the financial statements 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Relevant audit information
As at 20 May 2008, so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being information needed by 
the auditors in connection with preparing their report, of which the auditors are unaware and each director has taken 
all steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Annual general meeting
The second annual general meeting of the Company will be held at the Four Seasons Hotel, Simmonscourt Road, 
Dublin 4, Ireland at 9.30am on Wednesday 16 July 2008.  Shareholders who are unable to attend in person may 
submit questions beforehand via email to agmquestions@experiangroup.com or on the prepaid card sent to 
shareholders with the notice of meeting. The questions will be addressed at the meeting, via the Company’s website 
at www.experiangroup.com or individually as appropriate. The notice of meeting is included in a separate circular 
to shareholders which accompanies this annual report.  It is also available on the Company’s website at www.

they be re-appointed as auditors of the Company will be proposed at the annual general meeting.

Corporate go vernance statement
Combined Code
The board of Experian is responsible for the Group’s system of corporate governance. The board is committed to 
good governance and to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in all the Group’s activities.  This statement 
describes how the Company has applied the main and supporting principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (the ‘Code’).  
Experian complied with the Code’s provisions throughout the year from 1 April 2007 until 31 March 2008, except that 
the board committees did not for the whole period fully comply with the requirements in respect of the number of 
independent non-executive directors. These matters are explained later in this statement. 
The way in which the principles set out in the Code are applied is described below. 
The board
At the date of this annual report, the board consists of a Chairman, a Chief Executive Officer, a Chief Financial Officer 
and seven non-executive directors. The names and biographical details of the directors are shown on pages 38 and 39 of 
this annual report.  
The non-executive directors are considered by the board to be independent in character and judgment with no 
relationships or circumstances which could affect, or appear to affect, their judgment.  However, David Tyler was the group 
finance director of GUS plc and so did not fully meet the independence criteria on his appointment.  The non-executive 
directors are appointed for three-year renewable terms.  Sir Alan Rudge is the senior independent director.  
The board plans to have six scheduled meetings each year and may meet more frequently as required.  Six scheduled 
meetings and one ad-hoc meeting took place during the year ended 31 March 2008 (this includes one meeting that was held 
immediately after the year-end which was originally scheduled to take place during March 2008 but was rescheduled to 
early April 2008 due to the timing of Easter). The latter meeting took place in Washington DC, USA; otherwise the meetings 
were held in Dublin, Ireland.  It is inevitable that there will be occasions when circumstances arise to prevent directors 
from attending meetings.  In such circumstances, the usual practice is for the absent director to review the board papers 
and convey any views on specific issues to the Chairman. The time commitment expected of non-executive directors is 
not restricted to board and committee meetings.  They are available for consultation on specific issues falling within their 
particular fields of expertise and additional time is spent visiting the Group’s businesses and meeting informally with the 
Chairman and executive directors.  The non-executive directors are experienced and influential individuals from a range 
of industries and countries.  Together they bring an objective viewpoint and range of experience to the Company which 
ensures that no individual or group of individuals is able to dominate the board’s decision-making.
There is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to the board for decision.  The board establishes overall 
Group strategy, approves the Group’s operating budget and monitors performance through the receipt of monthly 
reports and management accounts. The approval of significant acquisitions and divestments is a matter reserved for 
the board although it delegates to the boards of the Company’s principal operating subsidiaries the responsibility for 
approving smaller acquisitions and disposals.  The monetary limits of such delegations are formally documented and 
the exercise of such delegated authorities is reported to the board at each of its meetings.  There are also authority 
levels covering capital expenditure which can be exercised by the boards of the Company’s principal operating 
subsidiaries.  Beyond these levels of authority, projects are referred to the board for approval.  Other matters reserved 
for the board include:
Approval of half-yearly financial reports and annual financial statements. l
T reasury policies. l
 Internal controls and risk management. l
Succession planning. l
Corporate responsibility. l
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer is clearly established, set out in 
writing and agreed by the board.  The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for day to day management and performance 
of the Group’s businesses.  The Chairman’s role is to ensure good corporate governance which includes leading the 
board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role and setting its agenda.  For scheduled board meetings, the 
agenda includes reports from the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.  The January meeting focuses 
on strategy, the March meeting deals with the approval of operating budgets for the coming financial year, while the 
May and November meetings cover the approval of the annual financial statements and the half-yearly financial report 
respectively.    45 Experian Annual Report 2008

Governance
Corporate governance statement
Members of senior management below board level are often invited to make presentations to the board and participate 
in certain aspects of the strategy and budget reviews.
The Chairman, with assistance from the Company Secretary, ensures that the board is supplied in a timely manner 
with information in a form and of a quality to enable it to discharge its duties.  The practice is to have the agenda and 
supporting papers circulated to the board one week before each meeting. Additional information is also provided 
to directors including monthly management accounts irrespective of whether or not a board meeting is scheduled 
for that month. Arrangements are made for non-executive directors to visit the Group’s businesses to see their 
operations at first hand and have the opportunity to discuss them with local management.  During the year under 
review, the non-executive directors visited Group business locations in Dublin, London and Nottingham to update 
and develop their knowledge.  Additionally, at board meetings, the directors receive specific business presentations 
from senior management.
All directors received an induction programme on joining the board which took into account their particular 
experience and background. The process included receipt of information on the Group, its activities and operating 
procedures, meetings with senior management and site visits and was continued during the year under review.  
During the year under review, the Chairman and the non-executive directors met as a group without the executive 
directors present.  At the conclusion of that meeting, the Chairman withdrew so that, under the leadership of the senior 
independent director, the non-executive directors had the opportunity to discuss any appropriate issues and appraise 
the Chairman’s performance, taking account of the views expressed by the executive directors. The Chairman and the 
non-executive directors plan to hold these meetings at least annually.    
 
There is in place a procedure under which the directors, in furtherance of their duties, are able to take independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring 
that board procedures are followed and all directors have access to his advice and services.  The Company Secretary 
is also responsible for advising and supporting the Chairman and the board on all corporate governance matters, 
a responsibility he discharges in part through his membership of the corporate governance committee.  The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the board as a whole. 
A formal evaluation of the performance of the board and its committees was conducted during the year ended 31 
March 2008.  The evaluation process involved interviews by independent consultants with all members of the board, 
as well as those senior executives who regularly attend board and committee meetings. The interviews focused on 
the following seven areas: board process and functioning; induction and training; board performance; governance 
and independence of non-executive directors; committee functioning, performance and composition; and the 
Chairman’s role and board composition, including succession planning. The independent consultants presented 
their findings to the board which concluded that appropriate actions had been identified to address areas that could 
be improved and that overall, the board and its committees continued to operate effectively. The Chairman conducted 
an individual evaluation of each director and the senior independent director conducted an individual evaluation 
of the Chairman. The board is satisfied that each director continues to contribute effectively and demonstrates 
commitment to the role.   
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, all the directors retired at the first annual general meeting 
of the Company held in Dublin, Ireland in July 2007.  All of the directors, being eligible and recommended by the board, 
were elected. In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, each director is required to retire at the annual 
general meeting held in the third calendar year following the year in which he or she was elected or last re-elected by 
the Company.  In order to ensure an orderly re-election process Fabiola Arredondo, Paul Brooks and Roger Davis will 
retire at the annual general meeting in July 2008 and, being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. 
The letters of appointment of the non-executive directors, including the Chairman, are available for inspection by any 
person at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours and at the annual general meeting (for 15 minutes 
prior to the meeting and during the meeting).
Board committees
The board has appointed a number of committees including the following principal committees: nomination committee, 
remuneration committee and audit committee.  The terms of reference of each of the principal board committees 
are available on request from the Company Secretary and can also be viewed on the Company’s website at www.
experiangroup.com.  Further details of these committees, including their membership and remits, are set out below.  In 
order to ensure that undue reliance is not placed on particular individuals and so that their understanding of the Group’s 
businesses continues to develop, all of the non-executive directors currently continue to be members of each of the 
principal board committees. 46 Experian Annual Report 2008

*  References throughout this corporate governance statement (including the above table) to board and board committee meetings held during the year under 
review include meetings held immediately after the year-end, which were rescheduled from March 2008 to early April 2008 due to the timing of Easter.
The attendance of directors at meetings of the board and the principal board committees of which they are members 
was as follows for the year ended 31 March 2008:
Nomination committee 
The nomination committee leads the process for board appointments and makes recommendations to the board. The 
members of the nomination committee are the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the seven non-executive 
directors.  The committee is chaired by John Peace except in respect of any matter concerning succession to the 
chairmanship of the Company when the senior independent director takes the chair.  The Company Secretary is the 
secretary to the committee and the Group HR Director and Global Talent Director usually attend meetings.     
The nomination committee has written terms of reference covering the authority delegated to it by the board.  Its 
duties include reviewing regularly the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and experience 
required) of the board and making recommendations to the board with regard to any changes, giving full consideration to 
succession planning for directors and other senior executives taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing 
the Company and identifying and nominating, for the approval of the board, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when 
they arise.  
The process used to appoint new directors of the Company begins with the nomination committee agreeing 
the scope of the role and engaging a specialist search company to identify potential directors.  The committee 
reviews the short list submitted by the search company and interviews prospective candidates, who are, if thought 
suitable, recommended to the board, which makes the appointment.  At the first annual general meeting following the 
appointment, the director appointed must retire in accordance with the articles of association and offer himself or 
herself for election, providing the shareholders with an opportunity to approve the appointment.  
The committee met twice during the year under review (including one meeting that was held immediately after 
the year-end which was originally scheduled to take place during March 2008 but was rescheduled to early April 
2008 due to the timing of Easter) and reviewed the membership of the principal board committees, the process for 
evaluating the performance of the board, committees and individual directors and reviewed the Group Global Talent 
Management process and succession plans. In addition, it reviewed the results of the Global Employee Survey and made 
recommendations to the board following the formal evaluation of the board. No changes to the membership of the board 
or its principal committees were recommended to the board as a result of the work of the committee during the year. 
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the seven non-executive directors including David Tyler who did not fully 
meet the independence criteria on his appointment.  Roger Davis is the chairman of the committee.  The Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer are invited to attend committee meetings and both attended all of the committee meetings 
in the year under review.  In the year under review, the committee met five times (including one meeting that was held 
immediately after the year-end which was originally scheduled to take place during March 2008 but was rescheduled 
to early April 2008 due to the timing of Easter).  The Company Secretary is the secretary to the committee and the 
Group HR Director and Global Head of Reward usually attend.  The application of corporate governance principles in 
relation to directors’ remuneration is described in the report on directors’ remuneration on pages 51 to 63. 47 Experian Annual Report 2008

Audit committee
The audit committee comprises the seven non-executive directors including David Tyler who did not fully meet the 
independence criteria on his appointment.  Alan Jebson is the chairman of the committee.  Following a review of 
principal board committee membership during the year, it remains the opinion of the nomination committee and the 
board that David Tyler’s membership of the committee remains in the best interests of shareholders and provides 
significant recent and relevant financial experience and an in-depth knowledge of Experian’s business, with him 
having been the group finance director of GUS plc from February 1997 until the demerger in October 2006.  No questions 
or concerns regarding the independence of audit committee members were raised during the performance evaluation 
process performed during the year under review and the board considers David to be independent in character and 
judgement.  The other members of the committee bring a wide range of international business experience from positions at 
the highest level worldwide (the directors’ biographical details appear on pages 38 and 39).  The Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer are normally invited to attend committee meetings.  The external auditors, the Executive 
Vice President, Risk Management and the Head of Global Internal Audit generally also attend committee meetings. 
In addition, the committee meets the external auditors and the Head of Global Internal Audit separately without 
management present.  The Company Secretary is the secretary to the committee.
The main role and responsibilities of the committee are set out in written terms of reference which are reviewed 
annually.  The committee’s principal oversight responsibilities include financial reporting, internal controls and risk 
management systems, whistleblowing and fraud, internal audit and external audit (including auditor independence).
The committee will meet not less than three times a year.  During the year under review, it met four times (including one 
meeting that was held immediately after the year-end which was originally scheduled to take place during March 2008 
but was rescheduled to early April 2008 due to the timing of Easter).  
The audit committee has a structured programme linked to the Group’s financial calendar.  During the year under 
review, the committee undertook the following activities: 
Reviewed the preliminary results announcement and the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2007 and considered  l
reports from the external auditors identifying any significant financial reporting issues or judgemental issues requiring its 
attention;
Monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function and its terms of reference;  l
Monitored and reviewed the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process  l
covering all aspects of the audit service provided;
Reviewed the Group treasury policy; l
Reviewed the annual financial statements of the Group pension scheme;  l
Reviewed its own performance, constitution, training needs and terms of reference to ensure it is operating at maximum  l
effectiveness; 
Reviewed the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 September 2007 and considered reports from the  l
external auditors identifying any significant financial reporting or judgmental issues requiring its attention;
Reviewed and approved audit plans for the external and internal auditors; l
Considered risk management and assurance reports and internal audit reports on the results of internal audit reviews,  l
significant findings, management action plans and timeliness of resolution;
Reviewed reports on the Group’s risk management process and major potential risks and controls; l
Reviewed, at each scheduled meeting, a report on any material litigation involving Group companies; and l
Reviewed arrangements by which Group employees may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in  l
financial reporting or other matters. 48 Experian Annual Report 2008
Corporate go vernance statement continued
One of the primary responsibilities of the audit committee is to make recommendations to the board in relation to the 
appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditors. A number of factors were taken into account by 
the committee in assessing whether to recommend the external auditors for re-appointment. These included:
The quality of reports provided to the audit committee and the board and the quality of advice given; l
The level of understanding demonstrated of the Group’s businesses and its sectors; and l
The objectivity of the external auditors’ views on the controls around the Group and their ability to co-ordinate a global  l
audit working to tight deadlines.
As part of this review, the committee reviewed a report on the external auditors’ own quality control procedures.
The committee recognises that auditor independence is an essential part of the audit framework and the assurance 
it provides and the committee has established control processes to safeguard the objectivity and independence of 
the external auditors and to ensure that the independence of the audit work undertaken by the external auditors is not 
compromised.
The committee has established a policy covering the type of non-audit work that can be assigned to the external 
auditors. The auditors may only carry out such services provided that such advice does not conflict with their statutory 
responsibilities and ethical guidance. These services are:
 Further assurance services – where the external auditors’ deep knowledge of the Group’s affairs means that they may be  l
best placed to carry out such work. This may include, but is not restricted to, shareholder and other circulars, regulatory 
reports and work in connection with acquisitions and divestments.
T axation services – where the external auditors’ knowledge of the Group’s affairs may provide significant advantages which  l
other parties would not have. Where this is not the case, the work is put out to tender.
General – in other circumstances, the external auditors may provide services, provided that proposed assignments are put out  l
to tender and decisions to award work are taken on the basis of demonstrable competence and cost effectiveness. However, 
certain areas of work are specifically prohibited including work related to accounting records and financial statements that will 
ultimately be subject to external audit; management of, or significant involvement in, internal audit services; any work that could 
compromise the independence of the external auditors; and any other work that is prohibited by UK ethical guidance.
The audit committee chairman’s pre-approval is required before the Group uses non-audit services that exceed 
financial limits set out in the policy.
The committee receives half-yearly reports providing details of assignments and related fees carried out by the 
external auditors in addition to their normal work. Fees in respect of such assignments carried out in the year under 
review are set out in note 7 to the financial statements on page 90.
Corporate governance committee 
In addition to the principal board committees, the board has established a number of other committees including a 
corporate governance committee with written terms of reference to assist in its monitoring of corporate governance 
issues.  The committee’s responsibilities include keeping under review all legislative, regulatory and corporate 
governance developments that might affect the Company’s operations and making recommendations to the board 
in relation to them. The members of the corporate governance committee are the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer, the senior independent director and the Company Secretary.  The committee met during the year and 
made recommendations to the board on a number of matters resulting from the changing regulatory and legislative 
environment. 
Accountability and audit 
The board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The board 
reviews annually the effectiveness of the key procedures which have been established to provide internal control. 49 Experian Annual Report 2008

Corporate governance statement
The board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group, including those risks relating to social, environmental and ethical matters. This process was in 
place throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and meets the requirements 
of the Code. For certain joint arrangements, the board places reliance upon the systems of internal control operating 
within the partners’ infrastructure and the obligations upon partners’ boards relating to the effectiveness of their own 
systems. In the board’s view, the information it received was sufficient to enable it to review the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control in accordance with the ‘Internal Control Revised Guidance for Directors’ contained 
in the Code. The audit committee has kept under review the effectiveness of this system of internal control and has 
reported regularly to the board.
The key procedures, which operated throughout the year, were as follows:
Risk assessment:
The Group set out its objectives clearly as part of its planning process and organisation design. These objectives  l
were then incorporated as part of the planning cycle and supported by the use of both financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators.
Risks were methodically anticipated, identified, assessed and appropriately mitigated as part of an enterprise-wide risk  l
management process operating throughout the Group on an ongoing basis and headed by an Executive Risk Management 
Committee.
Senior management made presentations on risk to the audit committee, which reported regularly to the board on the risks  l
facing the Group’s business.
The audit committee has delegated responsibility from the board for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s  l
internal controls and received its annual report on the controls over these risks. This included risks arising from social, 
environmental and ethical matters.
Control environment and control activities:
The Group has established procedures for delegated authority which ensure that decisions that are significant, either  l
because of their value or the inherent degree of risk, are taken at an appropriate level.
The Group has implemented appropriate strategies to deal with each significant risk that has been identified. These  l
strategies include internal controls, insurance and specialised treasury instruments.
The Group sets out principles, policies and standards to be adhered to throughout its business. These include risk  l
identification, management and reporting standards, ethical principles and practice, accounting policies, treasury policy, 
information security policy and policy on fraud and whistleblowing. 
Information and communication:
The Group has a comprehensive system of budgetary control, including monthly performance reviews for each major  l
business. These reviews are at a detailed level within each region and global business line and at a high level for the board.
On a monthly basis, the achievement of business objectives, both financial and non-financial, was assessed using a range  l
of performance indicators. These indicators were regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant and reliable.
The Group had whistleblowing procedures in place for employees to report suspected improprieties. l
Monitoring:
A range of procedures were used to monitor the effective application of internal control in the Group, including  l
management assurance, through the ongoing risk management process, and independent assurance, through internal 
audit reviews and reviews by specialist third parties.
The internal audit department’s responsibilities include reporting to the audit committee on the effectiveness of internal control  l
systems, focusing on those areas considered to be of greatest risk to the Group.
Follow-up processes were used to ensure there was an appropriate response to changes and developments in risks and  l
the control environment. 50 Experian Annual Report 2008
Corporate go vernance statement continued
Relations with shareholders
The Company gives high priority to communicating with its shareholders and does this through its annual and half-
yearly reports, at the annual general meeting and through the processes described below.
Although most shareholder contact is with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, supported 
by management specialising in investor relations, it is the responsibility of the board as a whole to ensure that a 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place.
The Chairman’s statement on page 2 and the business review on pages 6 to 37 include a detailed review of the business 
and future developments in relation to the business. A full annual report is sent to all shareholders who so elect.  For those 
shareholders who do not elect to receive a full annual report, notification is sent of the availability of the annual report 
on the Company’s website at www.experiangroup.com.  The Company’s website also contains up to date information on 
Group activities, published financial results, information on dividends and a financial calendar.
At each of its scheduled board meetings, the board reviews a report of important or relevant issues raised by 
shareholders during the course of meetings and discussions with them. Additionally, the board (and in particular, 
the non-executive directors) obtains an independent insight into the views of major shareholders through research 
commissioned with a third party adviser across a balanced sample of Experian’s shareholders. The latter typically 
control some 20 to 30% of the Company’s issued share capital. The findings of the research are presented to the 
board by the third party adviser.
There is a direct line of communication to the Chairman available to shareholders, particularly if there are issues of 
concern, whether about performance, strategy or governance.  Sir Alan Rudge, the senior independent director, is also 
available should shareholders have concerns which contact through the normal channels of the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer fails to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.  Shareholders are 
also offered the opportunity to meet the Company’s non-executive directors.
Shareholders who do not support a particular annual general meeting resolution do not always seek engagement 
with companies to explain their actions or request further information. Where appropriate, the Company is keen to 
understand the reasons for any lack of support and to have a dialogue with shareholders on these issues. Its policy, 
therefore, insofar as is practicable, is to seek engagement with shareholders on such issues.
All directors, including the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees, attend the annual general 
meeting and are available to answer shareholders’ questions.  Shareholders have the opportunity to send in questions prior 
to the annual general meeting and Experian responds to those shareholders who do.  
Voting at the annual general meeting takes place by way of poll.  The results of voting at the annual general meeting 
are announced and details of the votes are also added to the Company’s website, www.experiangroup.com, as soon 
as possible after the meeting. 51 Experian Annual Report 2008

Role of the remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has responsibility for the governance of Experian’s remuneration strategy, in particular: 
recommending Experian’s senior management remuneration policy and that of the Chairman of the board; l
determining individual remuneration packages for executive directors and those of certain senior managers; l
communicating to shareholders on remuneration policy and the committee’s work on behalf of the board;  l
reviewing and recommending the design of the Group’s share schemes; and  l
overseeing the Group’s executive pension arrangements. l
The remuneration of non-executive directors is a matter reserved for the board as a whole.  No director is involved in any 
discussions as to his or her own remuneration.
The remuneration committee has written terms of reference which are available on request from the Company Secretary and are 
also published on the Company’s website www.experiangroup.com.
Committee membership and meetings
The remuneration committee comprises the following non-executive directors: 
Roger Davis (Chairman)
Fabiola Arredondo 
Laurence Danon 
Sean FitzPatrick
Alan Jebson 
Sir Alan Rudge 
David Tyler
All members of the committee are provided with an induction in the role of the committee and the operation of its 
terms of reference on first appointment.  
In the year under review the committee has met five times (including one meeting which was held immediately after the 
year-end which was originally scheduled to take place during March 2008 but was rescheduled to early April 2008 due 
to the timing of Easter).  Attendance at these meetings is set out in the corporate governance statement on page 46.  
 
Advisers
In making its decisions, the committee consults with the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Group 
HR Director and the Global Head of Reward who are invited to attend meetings of the committee as and when 
appropriate.  They are not permitted to participate in discussions or decisions relating to their own remuneration.
The committee has access to independent consultants to ensure that it receives independent advice. During the 
year under review Deloitte and Touche LLP (‘Deloitte’) were appointed as advisers to the committee.  Deloitte also 
provided unrelated advisory and tax services to the Company during the year.  Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’) were 
re-appointed to provide valuation data for Experian’s long-term incentive plans and to provide independent advice 
on target calibration for the Annual Bonus Plan.  Linklaters LLP were re-appointed to provide legal and general 
remuneration advice.   52 Experian Annual Report 2008
Remuneration policy 
Experian’s policy is to use reward to drive business performance. The remuneration committee has determined that 
the policy set out in last year’s remuneration report remains appropriate for the coming year.  The remuneration 
policy will be regularly reviewed by the committee.
The remuneration committee aims to have in place a remuneration policy for Experian which is consistent with its 
business objectives, and which can:
pay market-competitive base salary levels but no higher than this; l
provide competitive performance-related compensation which influences performance, and helps attract and retain  l
executives by providing the opportunity to earn substantial rewards for outstanding performance leading to long-term 
shareholder value creation;
apply demanding performance conditions to deliver sustained profitable growth in all our businesses, thereby aligning  l
incentives with shareholders’ interests;
provide a balanced portfolio of incentives - bonus, options and shares which align both short term (one year) and longer  l
term (three years plus) performance such that sustainable growth and value are delivered for our shareholders;
drive accountability and transparency and align remuneration to the interests of shareholders; and l
deliver competitive benefits to underpin the other components of the remuneration package. l
Consistent with the policy, the committee reviews the elements of the remuneration package relative to other 
comparable organisations and other companies of similar size and scope to Experian.  Performance-related 
incentives are calibrated at upper quartile levels for outstanding performance to produce a highly leveraged package 
if the Group’s growth objectives are attained.  Experian is committed to performance-related pay at all levels within 
the organisation.  All employees are encouraged to become shareholders in the Company.
Service contracts
Each executive director has a rolling service contract which can be terminated by the Group giving twelve months’ 
notice.  In the event of termination of the director’s contract, any compensation payment is calculated in accordance 
with normal legal principles, including the application of mitigation to the extent appropriate in the circumstances of 
the case.  Further details can be found on page 62.
Remuneration of executive directors
Each element of reward is important and has a specific role in achieving the aims of the remuneration policy.  The 
combined potential remuneration from annual bonus and share awards outweighs the other elements and is subject 
to performance conditions, thereby placing the majority of the package at risk.
The remuneration package is weighted towards the performance-related elements of the package.  In fair value terms, 
the proportion of total remuneration (excluding pension and benefits) which is shown as variable is approximately 
71% as illustrated.

Fixed remuneration
Base salary and benefits
T o ascertain a job’s market value, external remuneration consultants annually review and provide data on market salary 
levels and advise the remuneration committee.  Executive directors’ salaries are benchmarked against a mid-market level 
of main board executive directors from the comparator companies in the FTSE 100 Index and other global comparators 
which reflects the market in which Experian recruits talent.  Before making a final decision on individual salary awards, 
the committee assesses each director’s contribution to the business, to reflect individual performance and experience.  
When setting base salary levels for executive directors, the committee considers pay levels and increases throughout the 
organisation.
In addition to base salary, executive directors receive certain benefits in kind including a car or car allowance, private 
health cover and life assurance.
Pensions
The retirement age for directors is 60 under arrangements which broadly provide a pension of two thirds of final 
salary, life assurance and ill health and dependants’ pensions.  Incentive payments (such as annual bonuses) are not 
pensionable.
The Company has had arrangements in place for a number of years which were designed to ensure that UK directors 
who were affected by the 1989 HM Revenue and Customs earnings cap were placed in broadly the same position as those 
who were not.  With the agreement of the trustees of the scheme, the Company decided to retain a notional earnings cap 
for its existing and future employees, with the exception of new senior executives who are pensioned on full base salary 
up to the Lifetime Allowance.
The Company has put security in place for the unfunded pension entitlements of UK executives affected by the earnings 
cap, by establishing Secured Unfunded Retirement Benefits Schemes (‘SURBS’).  Further details are provided under 
the disclosure of the arrangements for each director.
Variable remuneration
Annual Bonus Plan and Co-investment Plan
Annual bonuses are awarded for achieving profit growth targets. The committee believes that linking incentives to profit 
growth helps to reinforce Experian’s growth objectives. Targets are calibrated by Kepler using benchmarks that reflect 
stretching internal and external expectations.  Benchmarks include: broker earnings estimates; earnings estimates for 
competitors; straight-line profit growth consistent with median/upper quartile shareholder returns over the next three to 
five years; latest projections for the current year; budget; strategic plan; and long-term financial goals
2007/08 bonus
As disclosed at the time of the GUS demerger, it was agreed that for annual bonuses paid in respect of the year 
ending 31 March 2008 and subsequently, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors would be 200% of 
base salary.  This level of annual bonus would only be paid if Experian’s financial performance surpassed stretching 
financial targets and hence would only be payable if exceptional results were delivered to shareholders.  The 
enhancement to the bonus opportunity for the executive directors was intended to recognise the global market 
in which Experian operates and accompanied the reduction of the matching opportunity under the Experian Co-
investment Plan to 1:1 (previously 2:1 under the GUS Co-investment Plan).  Executive directors will not participate 
in the Experian Co-investment Plan in respect of the 2007/08 fiscal year and bonus payments will be made in cash. 
Experian performed strongly in 2007/08 in a particularly difficult trading environment and the bonuses payable to 
executive directors in respect of this financial year disclosed on page 58 are representative of this strong performance 
in uncertain market conditions in which global targets were met and annual bonuses were paid at target levels.

2008/09 bonus
For annual bonus earned in respect of the 2008/09 fiscal year, which may be up to 200% of base salary, executive directors 
will be offered their first opportunity since the GUS demerger to defer receipt of their bonus and invest it in Experian 
Group Limited shares (‘invested shares’) under the Experian Co-investment Plan. The release of the invested shares will 
be deferred for three years.  The number of invested shares acquired on behalf of the executive will be matched with an 
additional award of shares (‘matching shares’) on a 1:1 basis.  The release of these matching shares to participants will 
be subject to the achievement of a performance condition, details of which will be disclosed in next year’s remuneration 
report.  The release of these shares will be deferred for three years including the original bonus deferral.  If an executive 
resigns during the three-year period he/she will forfeit the right to the matching shares and the associated dividends.  The 
executive would be entitled to retain any invested shares. 
With respect to Responsible Investment Disclosure, the committee has ensured that environmental, social and 
governance risks are not raised by the incentive structure for senior management inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour.
Experian Performance Share Plan
The Experian Performance Share Plan was approved by GUS shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting 
(‘EGM’) on 29 August 2006.  An initial award was made to participants, including the executive directors, on 11 October 
2006.  There will be no further awards to executive directors under this plan until June 2009.  Performance shares are 
‘free’ Experian shares for which no exercise price is payable.  Shares are allocated subject to a performance condition 
which is measured over a three-year performance period with a five-year vesting period for demerger awards and a 
three-year vesting period for subsequent awards.  Dividend equivalents will accrue on these awards.
For the demerger awards granted in October 2006, the performance condition is in two separate parts; 50% of the 
award will be subject to achievement against a sliding scale of growth in profit before tax (‘PBT’) which the Company 
considers to be an appropriate measure as this represents one of the key strategic drivers of the business.  The 
threshold for vesting will be growth in PBT of 7% per year at which 25% of this part of the award will vest rising, on a 
straight-line basis, to 100% of this part of the award vesting if PBT grows at a rate of 14% per year.
The remaining 50% of the award will vest according to the performance of Experian’s Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) (defined as share price movement plus reinvested dividends) relative to the following group of peer 
companies:  
Acxiom Fair Isaac Harte-Hanks
Alliance Data Systems Fidelity National Financial IAC/Interactive Corp
Bisys Group Fimalac  Moodys
Capita Group First American Reuters Group
Choicepoint First Data Thomson
Dun & Bradstreet Fiserv  T otal System Services
Equifax Global Payments
.
    56 Experian Annual Report 2008
This bespoke comparator group consists of Experian’s main competitors in the business areas and countries in which the 
Group operates.  This part of the award will not vest if Experian’s TSR is below the median return for the comparator group.  
Once Experian achieves median performance, 25% of this portion of the award may vest rising on a straight-line basis to 100% 
of this part of the award vesting for upper quartile performance or better.  This can be summarised as follows:
 
Performance conditions for future awards under the Experian Performance Share Plan will be decided in advance of grant.
Experian Share Option Plan
The Experian Share Option Plan was approved by GUS shareholders at the EGM on 29 August 2006.  It is intended to 
align shareholder and participant interests through share price growth.  Options will vest subject to the satisfaction 
of a stretching target which will be set prior to options being granted.  No options will be granted to executive 
directors under the plan until June 2009. 
For each of the long term incentive plans, external consultants will be used to calculate whether, and the extent to 
which, the performance conditions have been met.
Experian Sharesave
All executive directors and employees of Experian and any participating subsidiaries are eligible to participate in 
Sharesave if they have been employed by Experian for a qualifying period.  Sharesave provides an opportunity for 
employees to save a regular monthly amount which at the end of the savings period may be used to purchase Experian 
Group Limited shares under option at a discount of up to 20% on the market value.

Performance graph
The committee has chosen to illustrate TSR  for GUS plc until demerger and Experian Group Limited against the 
FTSE 100 Index for the period since listing on 11 October 2006 to 31 March 2008.  The FTSE 100 Index is the most 
appropriate index against which TSR should be measured, as it is a widely used and understood index of leading UK 
companies.  
The above graphs show that, at 31 March 2008, a hypothetical £100 invested in GUS and subsequently, Experian would 
have generated a total return of £198 compared with a return of £120 if invested in the FTSE 100 Index on 31 March 
2000 and a total return of £153 compared with a return of £192 if invested in the FTSE 100 Index on 31 March 2003.
 
Shareholding guideline
The committee believes that it is important that executives build a significant shareholding to align their interests 
with those of shareholders.  Therefore the committee has established guidelines under which the Chief Executive 
Officer should hold the equivalent of two times his base salary in Experian Group Limited shares and other executive 
directors, one times their base salary, including shares held under the Co-investment and Reinvestment plans.  Each 
of the executive directors meets these guidelines.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration policy
The board’s policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration is that:
Fees should reflect individual responsibilities and membership of board committees. l
Remuneration should be in line with recognised best practice and sufficient to attract, motivate and retain high calibre non- l
executives.
Remuneration should be a combination of cash fees (paid quarterly) and Experian Group Limited shares (bought annually in  l
the first quarter of the financial year).
Non-executive directors are obliged to comply with a shareholding requirement explained below.  Any tax liability connected  l
to these arrangements is the responsibility of the individual director.
T he use of Experian Gro u p Limited shares in the package helps align the interests of n o n-executive directors with th ose of shareh olders . l
Non-executive directors do not receive any benefits in kind.  The Chairman has the use of a company car and private  l
healthcare.
The fees of non-executive directors were reviewed in 2008 and will next be reviewed in 2009.  Fees are reviewed in the light 
of market practice in FTSE 100 companies and anticipated number of days worked, tasks and responsibilities.   
Base fee €106,154
Senior independent director €19,437
Chair of audit committee  €31,398
Chair of remuneration committee  €23,922
Experian requires its non-executive directors to build up a holding in the Company’s shares equal to one times their annual 
fee.  One quarter of their annual fee is used to purchase shares in the Company each year until they reach this holding.  
Such shares are included in the table of directors’ interests on page 63.  Non-executive directors do not participate in 
executive share schemes or other employee share scheme arrangements.  Non-executives do not have service contracts 
but each has a letter of appointment.  No non-executive director’s letter of appointment provides for any termination 
payment.  Each appointment is for a renewable three-year term but may be terminated by either party on one month’s

Notes:  
1.  Non-executive directors receive an additional fee of €5,981 per trip to attend board meetings where such attendance involves inter-continental travel from their 
home location.  This results in disparities between their fee levels relative to those fees listed on page 57.
2.  Benefits to executive directors include life insurance, private health care, company car and fuel allowance where applicable. Don Robert relocated to the UK in 
the period under review.  The figures for him include a one-off disturbance allowance of £100,000.  In addition, he will receive an annual expatriate allowance of 
£550,000 for the duration of his assignment; a pro-rata payment in respect of the financial year under review is included above. Benefits to Paul Brooks include a 
one-off payment in respect of his relocation back to the UK.
3.  John Peace is not eligible for a performance bonus, pension contributions or further long term incentive awards but will continue to receive a company car 
benefit and coverage under the Company’s private healthcare arrangements.
4.  Don Robert and Paul Brooks were appointed to the board of Experian Group Limited on 6 July 2006.  Experian Group Limited pays directors’ fees to Don Robert 
and Paul Brooks of €106,154 per annum in respect of their services as directors of Experian Group Limited.  Such fees form part of, and are not additional to, the 
remuneration set out in the table.  
5. During the year under review, Don Robert served as a non-executive director of First Advantage Corporation for which he received a fee of US$53,000 
 (2007: $51,000).  
6.  Figures for the prior period for Paul Brooks have been restated in sterling to allow a like for like comparison.
7.  Fees for the non-executive directors represent their fees for the period under review. For the prior period, and as is permissible under Jersey law, the Company 
met the cost of the tax payment on their taxable travel expenses where applicable. Experian has since gained agreement from the Irish tax authorities that these 
expenses are non-taxable and thus for the period under review these expenses are not reported.  Fees in respect of the previous period for the non-executive 
directors were for the period since appointment which for some individuals was three months or less.  Fees in respect of 2007 for Sir Alan Rudge and David T yler 
were paid by Experian Finance plc (formerly GUS plc).  David T yler was previously an executive director of GUS plc and Sir Alan Rudge was a non-executive 
director.  With effect from 1 April 2007, David T yler ceased to be a director of Experian Finance plc by reason of redundancy; his contract provided for a notice 
period of 12 months or contractual pay in lieu of notice for 12 months.  Contractual pay on redundancy includes base salary (£545,000), car and fuel allowance 
(£18,200) and is included above.  These payments were made in April 2007 and are in addition to the non-executive director’s fee of €106,154. Figures for the prior 
period for David T yler have been restated in euros to allow a like for like comparison.

Notes:
1.  John Peace ceased to be an employee of the Group on 31 March 2007.  Under the GUS Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme rules, he has six months from 
this date to exercise his options, excluding any periods during which he is restricted from dealing in the Company’s shares.  Disclosures will be made in respect of 
the exercise of these options at the appropriate time.
2.  Options granted to Don Robert prior to his date of appointment to the board of GUS plc in April 2005 were granted under the GUS North America Stock Option Plan. 
The 2005 and 2006 grants were made under the GUS Executive Share Option Scheme.
3.  Options were granted to David T yler in respect of his role as an executive director of GUS plc.  On the demerger of GUS plc, he was eligible to exchange his options 
for equivalent options over Experian shares on the same basis as other participants in the relevant GUS plans except that he was not eligible to participate in the 
Experian Reinvestment Plan.  T o the extent that his options were rolled over, the new options did not vest or lapse in connection with his termination of employment.  
In respect of such options, David T yler is treated as a good leaver for the purposes of the relevant plan rules if he ceases to be a non-executive director of the 
Company except as a result of voluntary resignation or actions which would constitute gross misconduct.  The relevant performance conditions apply.
4.  No options were granted to executive directors on the GUS demerger.
All options in the above table were originally granted under the GUS Executive Share Option Schemes.  Options which were 
granted before 2005 were exchanged for equivalent options over Experian shares on demerger of GUS plc.  Unvested options 
granted in 2005 and 2006 (other than options granted under the GUS 1998 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme) were 
automatically exchanged for equivalent options over Experian shares.  The performance condition for options granted in 
2005 and 2006 is based on the growth of Experian’s Earnings per Share in excess of the UK Retail Price Index from the date of 
demerger. 
The market price of Experian Group Limited shares at the end of the financial year was 367.0p; the highest and lowest prices 
during the financial year were 633.5p and 358.0p respectively. 60 Experian Annual Report 2008

Performance Share Plans  
In May 2005 and June 2006, executive directors received a share award under the GUS Performance Share Plan with a 
face value of one times salary.  On the GUS demerger, these awards were automatically rolled over into Experian shares.  
As approved by GUS shareholders at the EGM on 29 August 2006, awards equivalent to two times salary were made to 
executive directors on demerger in October 2006 under the Experian Performance Share Plan.  Both awards are outlined 
below.  For awards granted under the rolled over GUS Performance Share Plan, the performance condition is based on 
Total Shareholder Return against the comparator group adopted by Experian (see page 55) since the demerger. Rolled 
over awards will not vest if Experian’s Total Shareholder Return (defined as share price movement plus reinvested 
dividends) is below the median return for the comparator group.  For these rolled over awards only, once Experian 
achieves median performance, 40% of the award may vest rising on a straight-line basis to 100% of the award vesting for 
upper quartile performance or better.

Notes:
1.  On demerger, GUS Performance Share Plan awards made in 2005 and 2006 were replaced with equivalent awards over Experian shares.    
2.  As John Peace’s employment with Experian Finance plc (formerly GUS plc) ended on 31 March 2007, under the rules of the GUS Performance Share Plan, 
all outstanding awards will vest subject to the performance condition on the vesting date specified in the table, and will be time pro-rated to 31 March 2007.  
Disclosures will be made in respect of vesting at the appropriate time.
3.  David T yler’s awards were rolled over on the basis described in footnote 3 to the Share Options table on page 59.

GUS Co-investment Plans and Experian Reinvestment Plans
Awards to directors under the 2004 and 2005 cycles of the GUS Co-investment Plan and North America 
Co-investment  Plan were reinvested in awards under the Experian Reinvestment Plan and North America Reinvestment 
Plan at demerger.  Awards under the 2006 cycle were automatically rolled over into equivalent awards over Experian 
shares under the rules of the GUS Co-investment Plan.  Release of matching shares under the Experian Reinvestment 
Plan is subject to the achievement of performance conditions (see note 3 to the table below), the retention of reinvested 
awards and continued employment.  No further awards will be made under the Reinvestment Plan.  Matching shares 
awarded under the GUS Co-investment Plans will be released subject to continued employment.

Notes:  
1.  Invested shares for John Peace and David T yler were purchased with their bonus net of tax.  The matching share awards are made on a gross basis and are taxed 
at the point of vesting.  Invested shares for Don Robert and Paul Brooks were calculated by reference to the bonus gross of tax.  
2.  John Peace was not eligible to participate in the Reinvestment Plan. He was granted a special reinvestment award over Experian Group Limited shares which will 
vest after three years if he continues to be Chairman of Experian Group Limited, subject to the good leaver reasons included in the rules.  Details of this award 
were disclosed in the circular to GUS shareholders dated 26 July 2006.  Invested shares in respect of the 2006 GUS Co-investment Plan award for John Peace 
were released following the end of his employment with Experian Finance plc on 31 March 2007 in accordance with the plan rules.  The matching share option 
in respect of this award also became exercisable in full on this date.  Under the Plan rules, participants are entitled to dividend equivalents on exercise of this 
matching share option. John Peace received £9,019 in respect of dividend equivalents payable on his matching share options.
3.  The first 50% of a matching award under the Experian Reinvestment Plan will vest subject to satisfaction of a performance condition relative to a sliding scale 
of growth in Experian Group’s PBT over a three year period.  The threshold for vesting will be growth in PBT of 7% per annum at which 30% of this part of the 
matching award will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% of this part of the award vesting at growth in PBT of 14% per annum.  This part of the matching 
award will vest in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.  The remaining 50% of the matching award will be time-based and will vest as 
to 50% of this part of the matching award on the third anniversary of grant and as to 25% on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
4.  David T yler’s 2004 and 2005 GUS Co-investment Plan awards vested at the time of the GUS plc demerger, and he did not reinvest these awards. David T yler’s 2006 
GUS Co-investment Plan awards were rolled over on the basis described in footnote 3 to the Share Options table on page 59. 62 Experian Annual Report 2008
Executive directors’ annual pension  
Don Robert is provided with benefits through a Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan (‘SERP’) which is a defined 
benefit arrangement in the US. The figures below are in respect of his SERP entitlement.  He also participates in a US 
defined contribution arrangement and the employer contributions to this arrangement during the year were $3,692 (2007: 
$9,423).
Paul Brooks is a member of the registered Experian Pension Scheme.  His benefits within the Scheme are restricted by an 
earnings cap.  However, benefits in excess of this cap are provided for through the Experian Limited SURBS.  The pension 
figures below reflect both his registered and non-registered entitlement.    
The table below provides the disclosure of the above directors’ defined benefit pension entitlements in respect

Six former directors of Experian Finance plc (formerly GUS plc) have been receiving unfunded pensions from the Company for 
a number of years. The pensions of two of these former directors were transferred into the registered scheme in October 2006. 
Three of the former directors are now members of the SURBS that provides security for the unfunded pensions of executives 
affected by the HMRC earnings cap.  In addition, one former director, who retired with effect from 31 March 2007, is now receiving 
an unfunded pension through the SURBS.  The total unfunded pensions paid to the former directors was £539,644  (2007: 
£445,646).
Notes:
Columns (1) and (2) represent the deferred pension to which the director would have been entitled had they left the Group at 31 March 2008 and 2007 respectively.
Column (3) is the transfer value of the pension in column (1) calculated as at 31 March 2008 based on factors supplied by the actuary of the relevant group pension 
scheme in accordance with UK actuarial guidance note GN11.  
Column (4) is the equivalent transfer value, but calculated as at 31 March 2007 on the assumption that the director left service at that date.

Directors’ service contracts
In accordance with Don Robert’s service agreement with Experian Services Corporation (‘ESC’) dated 7 August 2006, 
if his employment is terminated by ESC without cause he is entitled to the following severance payments: continued 
payment of monthly salary for 12 months from the termination date; 12 months’ participation in welfare benefit plans in 
which he participated during his employment; and an annual bonus based on a 100% achievement of objectives payable in 
equal monthly instalments for 12 months.  The same amounts are payable by ESC if Don Robert terminates the contract: 
(i) following material breach by ESC; or (ii) for Good Reason following a change of control of ESC.  Good Reason means, 
during the six month period following a change of control, a material and substantial adverse reduction or change in Don 
Robert’s position.  
Don Robert’s service agreement also provides for the following payments to be made if the agreement terminates in the 
event of Don Robert’s death (in addition to payments due but unpaid before death): a pro rata annual bonus for the bonus 
year to the termination date based on ESC’s performance in that bonus year; and a lump sum equal to 12 months’ base salary 
to be paid no later than 90 days after the date of death.  If the employment is terminated due to Don Robert’s disability he is 
entitled to the bonus as described immediately above (in addition to payments due but unpaid before the termination).  Any

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Experian Group Limited
W e have audited the Group financial statements of Experian Group Limited for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise 
the Group income statement, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the Group statement of recognised 
income and expense and the related notes. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies 
set out therein.
 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Experian Group Limited for the year ended 31 
March 2008 and on the information in the report on directors’ remuneration that is described as having been audited. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
statement of directors’ responsibilities.
 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with 
the Group financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report includes that specific information presented in 
the business review that is cross referred from the directors’ report.
 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, 
and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal controls cover all 
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
 
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
Group financial statements. The other information comprises only the Group financial highlights, the directors’ report, 
the chairman’s statement, the business review, the board of directors, the unaudited part of the report on directors’ 
remuneration, the corporate governance statement and the other items as referred to on the contents listing. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors 
in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we have also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,   l
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and   l
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements. l

1. Corporate information
Experian Group Limited (the ‘Company’), which is the ultimate parent company of the Experian Group, is incorporated and 
registered in Jersey under Jersey Companies Law as a public company limited by shares. The Company’s shares are listed on 
the London Stock Exchange. Experian is a business services group.  
The consolidated financial statements of Experian Group Limited and its subsidiary undertakings (‘Experian’ or ‘the Group’) 
were approved by the Board on 20 May 2008. 
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements are presented in US Dollars as this is the most representative currency of the Group’s 
operations. The financial statements are rounded to the nearest million. They are prepared on the historical cost basis 
modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. The principal exchange rates used in preparing the Group 
financial statements are set out in note 6.
In compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the financial 
statements of the Company are included within the Group annual report and they are set out on pages 132 to 141. These 
are presented in Sterling as that is the functional currency of the Company. In determining its functional currency, the 
directors have taken account of the fact that the assets and liabilities and cash flows of Experian Group Limited are primarily 
denominated in Sterling. The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements under UK accounting standards.
The Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted 
for use in the European Union (the ‘EU’) and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’).  These are those 
standards, subsequent amendments and related interpretations issued and adopted by the IASB that have been endorsed by the 
EU. Although the Company is incorporated and registered in Jersey, the Group financial statements include disclosures sufficient 
to comply with those parts of the UK Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
As indicated below, during the year ended 31 March 2008, there have been a number of new accounting standards, amendments 
and interpretations effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2007. None of these has had a material impact 
on the results or financial position of the Group for the year under review although, in accordance with the requirement of 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, gains and losses on fair value hedges are now reported on a gross basis in the 
Group income statement. Comparative figures have been restated and the effect is to increase financing income and financing 
expense for the year ended 31 March 2007 by US$55m. In addition pension assets and liabilities are now reported separately in 
the Group balance sheet where there is no right of offset and accordingly liabilities of US$50m are now reported as retirement 
benefit obligations at 31 March 2008. Comparative figures have been restated and the effect is to increase non-current assets 
and non-current liabilities at 31 March 2007 by US$56m. With these exceptions, the financial information has accordingly been 
prepared on a consistent basis with that reported for the year ended 31 March 2007 although, following the acquisition of a 
70% stake in Serasa during the year, the segmental information presented in respect of the Americas in note 5 is now further 
analysed to show North and Latin America as separate segments.
In connection with the acquisition of the 70% stake in Serasa, the Group entered into a put/call option agreement over the 
remaining shares held by the minority shareholders. In accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ the put element is shown as a liability stated at the net present value of the expected future payments and in 
accordance with IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ this liability is shown as a non-current financial liability. The 
net present value of the put option was reassessed at 31 March 2008 and the change since the date of acquisition has been 
recognised in the Group income statement within finance income.
 
On 10 October 2006, the separation of Experian and Home Retail Group was completed by way of demerger . As part of the 
demerger , the Company became the ultimate holding company of GUS plc (now Experian Finance plc) and related subsidiaries 
and shares in GUS plc ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange on 6 October 2006. T rading of shares in the Company on 
the London Stock Exchange commenced on 11 October 2006. As reported last year, the demerger transaction was accounted for 
using the principles of merger accounting set out in FRS 6 ‘Acquisitions and Mergers’ and UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (‘UK GAAP’). This policy, which does not conflict with IFRS, reflected the economic substance of the transaction.  
The distribution to GUS plc shareholders of shares in Home Retail Group plc was accounted for as a dividend in specie.
Recent accounting developments
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and the complementary amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial 
Statements – Capital Disclosures’ are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 and accordingly 
have been adopted by the Group during the year. Their effect is to revise and enhance previous disclosures required by IAS 
32 and IAS 30 ‘Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institutions’ but they have no material 
effect on the results and net assets of the Group. As indicated above, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 7, gains 
and losses on fair value hedges are now reported on a gross basis in the Group income statement and comparative figures 
have been restated. Revised and enhanced disclosures have been given in these financial statements in respect of the year 
ended 31 March 2008 and comparative information has been restated as appropriate.  The qualitative analysis required to be 
given in connection with IFRS 7 is set out in note 3 to the financial statements.

Introduction

Financial statements
Group financial statements
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
The adoption of IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, IFRIC 9 ‘Re-assessment of embedded derivatives’, IFRIC 10 ‘Interim financial 
reporting and impairment’ and IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’ which became effective during the 
year has had no material effect on the results and net assets of the Group. 
Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They cease to be consolidated 
from the date that the Group no longer has control. As required by IFRS 3 all business combinations are accounted for using 
the purchase method.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation.  Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the  
asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group for the purposes of the Group’s 
consolidation. The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings for the financial year ended 31 March 2008.
A list of the principal subsidiaries is given in note Q to the parent company financial statements.
Equity minority interests  
The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with minority interests as transactions with parties external to the Group. 
Disposals to minority interests result in gains and losses for the Group that are recorded in the Group income statement. 
Purchases from minority interests result in goodwill, being the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant 
share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary.
Associates 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally achieved by a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The equity method is used to account for investments in associates and 
investments are initially recognised at cost.
The Group’s share of net assets of its associates and loans made to associates are included in the Group balance sheet. The 
Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition after tax profits or losses is recognised in the Group income statement, 
and its share of post-acquisition movements in equity is recognised in the Group’s equity. The cumulative post-acquisition 
movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. The carrying amount of an investment in an associate 
is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount to its carrying amount whenever there is an indication that the 
investment may be impaired.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax and other 
sales taxes, rebates and discounts, including the provision and processing of data, subscriptions to services, software and 
database customisation and development and the sale of software licences, maintenance and related consulting services.
Revenue in respect of the provision and processing of data is recognised in the year in which the service is provided. 
Subscription revenues, and revenues in respect of services to be provided by an indeterminate number of acts over a specified 
period of time, are recognised on a straight line basis over those periods. Customisation, development and consulting revenues 
are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the work. Revenue from software licences is recognised upon delivery. 
Revenue from maintenance agreements is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance period.
Where a single arrangement comprises a number of individual elements which are capable of operating independently of 
one another, the total revenues are allocated amongst the individual elements based on an estimate of the fair value of each 
element. Where the elements are not capable of operating independently, or reasonable measures of fair value for each 
element are not available, total revenues are recognised on a straight line basis over the contract period.

The Group’s financial statements are presented in US Dollars.  72 Experian Annual Report 2008
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued) 
T ransactions and balances
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency of the relevant Group entity at the exchange rate 
prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. T ranslation differences on monetary items 
are taken to net financing costs in the Group income statement except when deferred in equity , as qualifying net investment hedges 
or cash flow hedges.
T ranslation differences on non-monetary available for sale financial assets are reported as part of the fair value gain or 
loss in equity.
Group undertakings
The results and financial position of Group undertakings whose functional currencies are not US Dollars are translated into 
US Dollars as follows:
Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date; l
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year (unless this average is not a reasonable  l
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses 
are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. l
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in entities whose functional 
currency is not the US Dollar, and of borrowings and other currency instruments, primarily foreign exchange contracts, 
designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. T ax charges and credits attributable to those exchange 
differences are taken directly to equity. When such an entity is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the Group 
income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of such 
entities are treated as assets and liabilities of the entities and are translated at the closing rate.
Share-based payments
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ applies to equity instruments, such as share options, granted since 7 November 2002.  The 
Group elected to adopt full retrospective application of the standard on all share options and awards granted to employees 
before 7 November 2002 but not vested at the date of transition to IFRS (1 April 2004). 
The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based compensation plans. These include awards in respect of shares in the 
Company made at or after demerger together with awards previously made in respect of shares in GUS plc which were rolled 
over into awards in respect of shares in the Company at demerger. The fair value of options and shares granted is recognised 
as an expense in the Group income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period after taking into account the 
Group’s best estimate of the number of awards expected to vest. The Group revises the vesting estimate at each balance 
sheet date. Non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimates. Expenses are incurred over the vesting 
period. Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo model and 
closing market price is most appropriate to the award. Market based performance conditions are included in the fair value 
measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual performance.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of identifiable net assets of a subsidiary or associate acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair values are attributed to the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that 
date. Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those 
of the Group.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is separately recognised in the balance sheet. Goodwill on acquisitions of 
associates is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill 
is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the 
carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and monitored for internal management purposes by geographical 
segment. The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, 
including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the Group income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated 
where necessary on the basis of relative fair value.

Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets 
are identifiable, separable or arise from legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired 
separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost. Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of 
an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria are satisfied. These criteria include 
the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate resources to 
complete the development and to use or sell the asset and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit. 
The cost of other intangible assets with finite useful economic or contractual lives is amortised over those lives. The carrying 
values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values 
may not be recoverable. If impaired the carrying values are written down to the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and value-in-
use, which is determined by reference to projected future income streams using assumptions in respect of profitability and growth.
Research expenditure is charged in the Group income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Databases and computer software
Databases
Capitalised databases comprise the fair value of databases acquired as part of a business combination or the data purchase 
and data capture costs of internally developed databases. 
Databases are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over three to seven years. 
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the 
specific software. Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the 
Group, and that will generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software 
development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over three to five years.
Other costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as 
incurred.
Acquisition intangibles
T rademarks and licences 
T rademarks and licences are carried at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over their contractual lives, up to a 
maximum period of 20 years.
T rade names
Legally protected or otherwise separable trade names acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair 
value on acquisition and amortised on a straight line basis over three to fourteen years based on management’s expectations 
to retain trade names within the business.
Customer relationships
Contractual and non-contractual customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair 
value on acquisition and amortised on a straight line basis over three to eighteen years based on management’s estimates of 
the average lives of customer relationships.
Completed technology
Completed technology acquired as part of a business combination is capitalised at fair value on acquisition and amortised 
on a straight line basis over three to eight years based on the expected life of the asset. 74 Experian Annual Report 2008
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Land is not depreciated.
Equipment on hire or lease is depreciated over the lower of the useful life and period of the lease. 
Depreciation is provided on other property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to depreciate the cost, less estimated 
residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years; l
Leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease; and l
Plant, vehicles and equipment are depreciated over two to ten years according to the estimated life of the asset. l
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in four categories: loans and receivables, derivatives used for hedging, assets at 
fair value through the profit and loss account and available for sale. The classification is determined at initial recognition and 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets are acquired.
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities more than 12 months after the balance sheet date 
which are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash 
and cash equivalents.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or not 
classified in the other financial asset categories.
Available for sale financial assets are carried at fair value and are included in non-current assets unless management 
intends to dispose of the assets within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Purchases and disposals of such assets are 
accounted for at settlement date. Unrealised gains and losses on available for sale financial assets are recognised directly in 
equity. On disposal or impairment of such assets, the gains and losses in equity are recycled through the income statement. 
Gains and losses recognised on disposal exclude dividend and interest income. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence to suggest that available for sale 
financial assets are impaired. In the case of equity securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
security below its cost is considered in determining whether the security is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the 
cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Group income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the 
Group income statement on equity instruments are not subsequently reversed through the Group income statement.
T rade receivables
T rade receivables are initially recognised at fair value (original invoice amount) and subsequently measured at this value less 
any provision for impairment. Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Such evidence is based primarily on the 
pattern of cash received compared to the terms upon which the trade receivable is contracted. The amount of the provision is 
the difference between the carrying amount and the value of estimated future cash flows. Any charge or credit in respect of 
such provisions is recognised in the Group income statement within administrative expenses. The cost of any irrecoverable 
trade receivables is recognised in the Group income statement immediately within administrative expenses. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in the Group income statement within administrative expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, term and call deposits held with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities on the Group balance sheet. For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as 
defined above, net of bank overdrafts.

Borrowings and borrowing costs
Borrowings are measured at amortised cost except where they are hedged by an effective fair value hedge, in which case the 
carrying value is adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risk.
Borrowings are classified as non-current to the extent that the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Incremental borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the issue of debt are capitalised and amortised over the expected 
life of the borrowing using the effective interest rate method. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the year in which they 
are incurred.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, 
interest rates and certain obligations, including social security obligations, in respect of share-based payments. Derivative 
instruments utilised by the Group include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, foreign exchange contracts and equity 
swaps. These are recognised as assets or liabilities as appropriate.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at cost, being the fair value at the date a contract is entered into, and are 
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. Depending on the type of derivative financial instrument, fair value calculation 
techniques include, but are not limited to, quoted market value, present value of estimated future cash flows (of which 
the valuation of interest rate swaps is an example) and exchange rates at the balance sheet date (of which the valuation 
of foreign exchange contracts is an example). The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain 
derivatives as:
Fair value hedges – hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment; or l
Cash flow hedges – hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly  l
probable forecast transaction; or
Net investment hedges – hedges of net investments in operations whose functional currency is not the US Dollar. l
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well 
as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents 
its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging 
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items. This effectiveness testing is 
performed at every reporting date throughout the life of the hedge to confirm that the hedge has remained and will 
continue to remain highly effective. Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are shown in the Group statement of 
recognised income and expense.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting.
Derivative assets and liabilities are classified as non-current unless they mature within 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are taken to net financing costs over the period of the contract 
together with the interest differential reflected in foreign exchange contracts.
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded 
in the Group income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The ineffective portion of a fair value hedge is recognised in net financing costs in the 
Group income statement. 76 Experian Annual Report 2008
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued) 
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately within cost of sales or 
operating expenses, as appropriate, in the Group income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the Group income statement in the period when the hedged item will impact 
the Group income statement. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-
financial asset or liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity 
and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Group income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is transferred immediately 
to the Group income statement. 
Net investment hedges
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge of a net investment in an entity 
whose functional currency is not the US Dollar is recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in net financing costs in the Group income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are 
included in the Group income statement when the entity is disposed of.
Non-hedging derivatives
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately 
in the Group income statement. Costs in respect of derivatives entered into in connection with social security obligations on 
employee share incentive schemes are charged as an employment cost; other changes are charged within financing fair value 
remeasurements in the Group income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value 
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the Group income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities is determined by using market data 
and established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are not subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation 
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, and value-in-use.  
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows which are CGUs.
T rade payables
T rade payables are recognised initially at fair value. Where the time value of money is material, payables are carried at 
amortised cost.
Contingent consideration
Where part or all of the amount of purchase consideration is contingent on future events, the cost of the acquisition initially 
recorded includes a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the contingent amounts expected to be payable in the future. The 
cost of the acquisition is adjusted when revised estimates are made, with corresponding adjustments made to goodwill until 
the ultimate outcome is known.
Where part or all of the amount of disposal consideration is contingent on future events, the disposal proceeds initially 
recorded include a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the contingent amounts expected to be receivable in the future. 
The proceeds are adjusted when revised estimates are made, with corresponding adjustments made to debtors, and profit 
and loss on disposal, until the ultimate outcome is known.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the Group financial statements.  However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
The Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; and l
It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and l
The amount has been reliably estimated.  l
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows 
at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as 
an interest expense.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the 
reimbursement is certain.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased 
asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and 
finance charges. The rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other payables. The interest element of the 
lease payments is charged in the Group income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. 
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged in the Group income statement on a straight line basis over the period of 
the lease. Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the period of the lease.
Employee benefits
Defined benefit pension arrangements – funded schemes
The retirement benefit assets recognised in the Group balance sheet comprise the fair value of plan assets of funded 
schemes less the present value of the related defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, together with adjustments 
for past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent qualified actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market 
yields available at the assessment date on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits 
will be paid, and that have terms to maturity consistent with the estimated average term of the related pension liability .
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised 
immediately in the Group statement of recognised income and expense.  78 Experian Annual Report 2008
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued) 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Group income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are 
conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past 
service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period. 
The pension cost recognised in the Group income statement comprises the cost of benefits accrued plus interest on the 
defined benefit obligation less the expected return on the plan assets over the year.
Defined benefit pension arrangements – unfunded schemes 
Unfunded pension obligations are determined in accordance with the principles used In respect of the funded arrangements 
but are disclosed in the Group balance sheet within retirement benefit obligations. 
Defined contribution pension arrangements
The assets of defined contribution schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The 
pension cost recognised in the Group income statement represents the contributions paid by the Group to these funds in respect 
of the year .
Post-retirement healthcare obligations
The Group operates schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain retired employees and their dependent 
relatives. The principal scheme relates to former employees in the UK and, under this scheme, the Group has undertaken to 
meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare insurance for all eligible former employees who retired prior to 1 April 1994 and their 
dependants. Such obligations are disclosed in the Group balance sheet within retirement benefit obligations.
The expected cost of these benefits is calculated using an actuarial methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension 
arrangements. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised 
in the Group statement of recognised income and expense. The obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
Minority interests in equity 
The minority interests in equity in the Group balance sheet represent the share of net assets of subsidiary undertakings held 
outside the Group. The movement in the year comprises the profit attributable to such interests together with any dividends 
paid, movements in respect of corporate transactions and related exchange differences. 
Where put/call option agreements are in place in respect of shares held by the minority shareholders, the put element of the 
liability is measured in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and 
is stated at the net present value of the expected future payments. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 32 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ this liability is shown as a non-current financial liability in the Group balance sheet. The 
change in the net present value of such options in the year is recognised in the Group income statement within finance expense.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
In preparing the Group financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The resulting 
accounting estimates, which are based on management’s best judgment at the date of the Group financial statements, will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.  The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Taxes
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision 
for income taxes as there are transactions in the ordinary course of business and calculations for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain.  The Group recognises liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the 
final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact on the 
results for the year and the respective income tax and deferred tax provisions in the year in which such determination is made.
Pension benefits
The present value of the defined benefit obligations depends on factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a 
number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the defined benefit obligations and net pension costs include 
the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets and the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions may 
impact on the amounts disclosed in the Group balance sheet and the Group income statement.

2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
The expected return on plan assets is calculated by reference to the plan investments at the balance sheet date and is a 
weighted average of the expected returns on each main asset type based on market yields available on these asset types at 
the balance sheet date.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate used to calculate 
the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the defined benefit obligations. In 
determining the discount rate, the Group has considered the prevailing market yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity consistent with the estimated 
average term of the related pension liability.
Other key assumptions for defined benefit obligations and pension costs are based in part on market conditions at the 
relevant balance sheet dates and additional information is disclosed in note 27.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is 
determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and makes assumptions 
that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. 
The assumptions in respect of the valuation of the put option associated with the remaining 30% stake of Serasa are set out 
in note 29(d).
Goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs and monitored for internal management purposes by geographical segment. The allocation is made 
to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. 
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
goodwill may be impaired. The recoverable amount of each CGU is generally determined based on value-in-use calculations, 
which require the use of cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management, looking forward up to 
five years. Cash flows are extrapolated using estimated growth rates beyond a five year period. The growth rates used do not 
exceed the long-term average growth rate for the businesses in which the segment operates.
In view of the significance of the Serasa acquisition on the Latin American segment goodwill, the impairment review was 
based on the fair value evidenced by that transaction. Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations for all other 
CGUs are:
Budgeted gross margin; l
Weighted average real growth rate of 2.25% used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period; and l
Pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% applied to the pre-tax cash flow projections. l
Management determines budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for the market 
development. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.  The 
discount rates used reflect the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%.
Share-based payments
The Group has a number of equity settled share-based payment arrangements in existence. The assumptions used in 
determining the amounts charged in the Group income statement include judgements in respect of performance conditions 
and length of service together with future share prices, dividend and interest yields and exercise patterns. 
Critical judgements
Management has made certain judgements in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies set out above that 
have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group financial statements. These include the classification of 
transactions between the Group income statement and the Group balance sheet. These accounting policy descriptions 
indicate where judgement needs exercising.
                                                                                                                              
The most significant of these judgements is in respect of intangible assets where certain costs incurred in the developmental 
phase of an internal project are capitalised if a number of criteria are met. Management has made certain judgements and 
assumptions when assessing whether a project meets these criteria, and on measuring the costs and the economic life 
attributed to such projects. On acquisition, specific intangible assets are identified and recognised separately from goodwill 
and then amortised over their estimated useful lives. These include such items as brand names and customer lists, to which 
value is first attributed at the time of acquisition. The capitalisation of these assets and the related amortisation charges are 
based on uncertain judgements about the value and economic life of such items. The economic lives for intangible assets 
are estimated at between three and seven years for internal projects, which include databases, internal use software and 
internally generated software, and between two and 20 years for acquisition intangibles. 80 Experian Annual Report 2008

Recent accounting developments
The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the Group’s accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 April 2008:
IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ (*);  l
IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’;  l
IAS 23 ‘Amendment to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’’ (*); l
IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate’ (*); l
IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’ (*); l
IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ (*); l
IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’ (*). l
(*) These standards are still subject to adoption by the EU.
IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ proposes amendments to accounting for business combinations and the 
treatment of associated transaction costs and accordingly will impact on the treatment of future acquisitions in the financial 
statements. With that exception, these accounting standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a 
material effect on the results and net assets of the Group. A number of the developments will lead to additional disclosures.
Use of non-GAAP measures
The Group has identified certain measures that it believes will assist understanding of the performance of the business. The 
measures are not defined under IFRS and they may not be directly comparable with other companies’ adjusted measures. 
The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but 
management has included them as they consider them to be important comparables and key measures used within the 
business for assessing performance. 
The following are the key non-GAAP measures identified by the Group:
Benchmark profit before tax (‘Benchmark PBT’) 
Benchmark PBT is defined as profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairments, charges in respect 
of the demerger-related equity incentive plans, exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements and taxation.  It 
includes the Group’s share of associates’ pre-tax profit.
Earnings before interest and tax (‘EBIT’)
EBIT is defined as profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairments, charges in respect of the 
demerger-related equity incentive plans, exceptional items, net financing costs and taxation.  It includes the Group’s share of 
associates’ pre-tax profit.
Benchmark earnings per share (‘Benchmark EPS’)
Benchmark EPS represents Benchmark PBT less attributable taxation and minority interests divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue, and is disclosed to indicate the underlying profitability of the Group.
Exceptional items
The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items gives an indication of the Group’s underlying performance. 
Exceptional items are those arising from the profit or loss on disposal of businesses, closure costs of major business units 
or costs of significant restructuring programmes.  All other restructuring costs are charged against EBIT in the segments in 
which they are incurred.
Net debt
Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. T otal debt includes loans and borrowings (and the fair 
value of derivatives hedging loans and borrowings), overdrafts and obligations under finance leases. Interest payable on 
borrowings is excluded from net debt.

3. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate 
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s financial risk management focuses on the unpredictability of 
financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group seeks to 
reduce its exposure to financial risks and uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.The Group 
also ensures surplus funds are managed and controlled in a prudent manner which will protect capital sums invested and 
ensure adequate short-term liquidity, whist maximising returns. 
Prior to the demerger in October 2006, the Group transacted primarily in Sterling. The hedging and risk management 
strategies pursued for the years then ended reflected this. Policies adopted since demerger reflect the increased significance 
of the Group’s US Dollar operations. 
Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk from future commercial transactions, recognised 
assets and liabilities and investments in, and loans between, entities with different functional currencies. The Group 
manages such risk, primarily within entities whose functional currencies are Sterling, by borrowing in the relevant foreign 
currencies and using forward foreign exchange contracts. The principal transaction exposures are to the US Dollar and  
the Euro.
The Group has investments in entities with other functional currencies, whose net assets are exposed to foreign exchange 
translation risk.  In order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on the value of such entities, the Group has a policy 
of borrowing in US Dollars and Euros, as well as in Sterling and of entering into forward foreign exchange contracts in the 
relevant currencies.
At 31 March 2008, if the US Dollar had strengthened/weakened by 6% (2007: 8%) against Sterling, with all other variables held 
constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$1m (2007: n/a) higher/lower, and other components of equity would 
have been unchanged.
At 31 March 2008, if the Euro had strengthened/weakened by 3% (2007: 2%) against Sterling, with all other variables held 
constant, profit for the financial year would have been unchanged (2007: US$1m higher/lower), and other components of 
equity would have been unchanged.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises principally from its net debt and the portions thereof at variable rates which expose the 
Group to such risk. 
The Group has a policy of normally maintaining between 30% and 70% of net debt at rates that are fixed for more than one 
year. The Group’s interest rate exposure is managed by the use of fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest 
rate swaps to adjust the balance of fixed and floating rate liabilities. The Group also mixes the duration of its borrowings to 
smooth the impact of interest rate fluctuations. 
At 31 March 2008, if interest rates on US Dollar denominated net debt had been 1.4% (2007: 1.4%) higher/lower with all other 
variables held constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$8m (2007: US$12m) lower/higher, mainly as a result 
of higher/lower interest on deposits and floating rate borrowings. 
At 31 March 2008, if interest rates on Sterling denominated net debt had been 0.4% (2007: 0.4%) higher/lower with all other 
variables held constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$8m (2007: US$8m) lower/higher, mainly as a result of 
higher/lower interest on deposits and floating rate borrowings. 
At 31 March 2008, if interest rates on Brazilian Real denominated net debt had been 2.4% (2007: 1.2%) higher/lower, with all 
other variables held constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$1m (2007: n/a) lower/higher, mainly as a result 
of higher/lower interest on deposits and floating rate borrowings.
At 31 March 2008, if interest rates on Euro denominated net debt had been 0.7% (2007: 0.4%) higher/lower with all other 
variables held constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$3m (2007: US$1m) lower/higher, mainly as a result of 
higher/lower interest on deposits and floating rate borrowings. 82 Experian Annual Report 2008
3. Financial risk management (continued)
Price risk
The Group is exposed to price risk in connection with investments classified on the balance sheet as available for sale financial 
assets. Such investments are primarily held to provide security in connection with unfunded pension obligations and are 
managed by independent fund managers who seek to mitigate such risk by diversification of the portfolio.
At 31 March 2008, if the relevant stock market and other indices had been 10% higher/lower with all other variables held 
constant, no further gains/losses would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense.
Credit risk
In the case of derivative financial instruments, deposits and trade receivables, the Group is exposed to credit risk, which 
results from the non-performance of contractual agreements on the part of the contract party. 
This credit risk is minimised by a policy under which the Group only enters into such contracts with banks and financial 
institutions with strong credit ratings, within limits set for each organisation. Dealing activity is closely controlled and 
counterparty positions are monitored regularly. The general credit risk on derivative financial instruments utilised by the 
Group is therefore not considered to be significant. No credit limits were exceeded during the year and the Group does not 
anticipate that any losses will arise from non-performance by these counterparties.
At the balance sheet date trade receivables with financial institutions accounted for some 41% (2007: 40%) of total trade 
receivables in the UK and some 38% (2007: 39%) of total trade receivables in the US. The remaining balances are distributed 
across multiple industries and geographies. The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on 
potential customers before granting credit. The maximum credit risk of such financial assets is represented by the carrying 
value of the asset net of any applicable provision for impairment.
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains long-term committed facilities that are managed to ensure it has sufficient available funds for 
operations and planned expansions. The Group monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s net debt including projected cash 
flows and the level of committed facilities necessary to meet these.
Details of the facilities available to the Group and their utilisation at the balance sheet date are given in note 24. Maturity 
analyses for financial liabilities are given in note 30. 
 4. Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives in managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure and cost of capital. 
    
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce net debt. As part of its internal reporting processes 
the Group monitors capital employed by geographical segment. For this purpose, capital employed excludes net debt and 
taxation balances. The Group manages its working capital in order to meet its target for the conversion of EBIT into operating 
cash flow. 
 
5. Segmental information
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks 
and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing 
products or services within a particular economic environment and is subject to risks and returns that are different from 
those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Inter-segment transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available 
to unrelated third parties. There is no material impact from inter-segment transactions on the Group’s results.

5. Segmental information (continued) 
T otal segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets including goodwill, inventories, 
derivatives designated as hedges of future commercial transactions, and receivables. They exclude tax assets, cash, 
investments and derivatives designated as hedges of borrowings which are reported at a Group level only.
T otal segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities, including derivatives designated as hedges of future commercial 
transactions. They exclude tax liabilities, borrowings and related hedging derivatives and the net present value of the put option in 
respect of the Serasa minority which are reported at a Group level only .
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, excluding additions 
resulting from acquisitions through business combinations.
The primary and secondary segmental reporting formats for Experian are outlined below. In addition the segmental 
information in respect of the year ended 31 March 2007 included Home Retail Group as a discontinued operation. 
Additional information in respect of discontinued operations is shown in note 12.
Primary reporting format for Experian – geographical segments
At 31 March 2008, Experian is organised on a worldwide basis into four core geographies:
North America;  l
Latin America; l
UK & Ireland; and l
Europe, Middle East and Africa (‘EMEA’)/Asia Pacific. l
In addition unallocated corporate head office costs, which include costs arising from finance, treasury and other global 
functions, are reported as Central activities.
Secondary reporting format for Experian – business segments
Experian operates across four key business segments:
Credit Services;  l
Decision Analytics; l
Marketing Services; and  l
Interactive. l
Credit Services acquires, processes and manages large and complex databases containing the credit histories of consumers 
and businesses and also operates business processing outsourcing services, mainly in France, helping banks and other 
clients with back office functions.
Decision Analytics builds on the Credit Services database information and helps clients by applying analytical tools and 
software to convert data held internally and other data into usable business information.
Marketing Services helps clients to acquire new customers and to manage their relationships with existing customers. By 
appending hundreds of characteristics to the credit and marketing data held in databases, Marketing Services provides clients 
with information designed to assist them in matching the right offer or product to the relevant customer using the most appropriate 
communication channels.
Interactive helps customers to understand and manage their own financial information and assets as well as to make 
more informed purchasing decisions in areas such as financial services, shopping and education and to connect them with 
companies over the Internet. 84 Experian Annual Report 2008

Assets and liabilities of undertakings whose functional currency is not the US Dollar are translated into US Dollars at 
the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated into US Dollars at average 
rates of exchange (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on 
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions). An 
indication of the sensitivity of the Group’s results to foreign exchange risk is given in note 3.

Exceptional items
In January 2008, the Group announced that it was launching a programme of significant cost-efficiency measures. Identified 
efficiencies include offshoring of development activity, restructuring of core credit and marketing activities and infrastructure 
consolidation. Following the identification of additional opportunities this programme is expected to deliver annualised cost 
savings of approximately US$110m, of which an estimated US$50m is expected to be realised in the year ending 31 March 2009. 
One-off restructuring costs associated with achieving these cost savings will be in the region of US$140m, the majority of 
which will be cash costs. Costs of US$60m have been recognised in the year in connection with this programme with a related 
cash outflow of US$18m. Of this charge, US$36m related to redundancy costs, US$12m related to asset write offs and US$12m 
related to other restructuring and infrastructure consolidation costs.
 
Other costs relating to the  demerger of Experian and Home Retail Group comprise legal and professional fees in respect of 
the transaction, together with costs in connection with the cessation of the corporate functions of GUS plc. 
 
In April 2006, Experian announced the phased withdrawal from large scale credit card and loan account processing in the UK. 
The anticipated cost of withdrawal of US$26m was charged in the year ended 31 March 2007, and was made up of a cost in cash of 
US$28m less the benefit of a US$2m pension curtailment credit. During the year ended 31 March 2008, an exceptional credit has 
arisen in this connection following the successful transfer of certain employees and obligations of this business to a third party .
The loss on disposal of businesses in the year ended 31 March 2008 primarily related to the sale of Loyalty Solutions in 
Germany and that in the year ended 31 March 2007 primarily related to the sale of a minority stake in Experian’s South African 
business.
In the year ended 31 March 2007, First American Real Estate Solutions LLC (‘FARES’) recognised a gain of US$77m on the 
partial disposal of its Real Estate Solutions division as part of the consideration for the acquisition of 82% of CoreLogic 
Solutions, Inc. The Group recognised US$15m, its 20% share of the gain.  A deferred tax charge of US$6m was included in 
the FARES result for that year in respect of this gain. A further gain of US$3m has arisen in the year ended 31 March 2008 in 
respect of a number of less significant disposals by FARES.
Cash outflows in respect of exceptional items of US$45m (2007: US$98m) comprise total exceptional items of US$63m (2007: 
US$162m) adjusted for working capital movements of US$9m (2007: US$46m), asset write offs of US$12m (2007: US$3m), 
share based payment add backs of US$nil (2007: US$30m) and gains in associates of US$3m (2007: US$15m).

9. Exceptional and other non-GAAP measures (continued)
Other non-GAAP measures          
IFRS requires that, on acquisition, specific intangible assets are identified and recognised separately from goodwill and then 
amortised over their useful economic lives. These include items such as brand names and customer lists, to which value 
is first attributed at the time of acquisition. The Group has excluded amortisation of these acquisition intangibles from its 
definition of Benchmark PBT because such a charge is based on uncertain judgements about their value and economic life.
A goodwill adjustment of US$2m (2007: US$14m) arose under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ on the recognition of 
previously unrecognised tax losses on prior years’ acquisitions. The corresponding tax benefit reduced the tax charge for the 
year by US$2m (2007: US$14m).
Charges in respect of demerger-related equity incentive plans relate to one-off grants made to senior management and at 
all staff levels at the time of the demerger, under a number of equity incentive plans. The cost of these one-off grants is being 
charged to the Group income statement over the five years from flotation in October 2006 but excluded from the definition of 
Benchmark PBT . The cost of all other grants is being charged to the Group income statement and included in the definition of 
Benchmark PBT .
An element of the Group’s derivatives is ineligible for hedge accounting under IFRS. Gains or losses on these derivatives 
arising from market movements are credited or charged to financing fair value remeasurements within finance income and 
finance expense in the Group income statement.

The effective rate of tax based on Benchmark PBT of US$819m (2007: US$714m) is 23.2% (2007: 22.4%).
(d) T ax on items charged to equity
In addition to the amount charged to the Group income statement tax amounting to US$16m (2007: US$7m) has been charged 
directly to equity, relating mainly to share schemes, actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit assets and foreign 
exchange. This includes US$nil (2007: a credit of US$11m) in respect of current taxation and a charge of US$16m (2007: US$18m) 
in respect of deferred taxation.
(e)  Factors that may affect future tax charges 
In the foreseeable future, the Group’s tax charge will continue to be influenced by the profile of profits earned in the different 
countries in which the Group’s businesses operate and could be affected by changes in tax law.

13. Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by a 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year (excluding own shares held in T reasury in the period  
prior to the demerger and own shares held in ESOP trusts, which are treated as cancelled).  
The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilutive effect of employee share incentive schemes. The 
earnings figures used in the calculations are unchanged for diluted earnings per share.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year ended 31 March 2007 includes ordinary shares of GUS 
plc in issue to the date of the demerger and the ordinary shares of the Company in issue thereafter (excluding own shares held 
in T reasury in the period prior to the demerger and own shares held in ESOP trusts, which are treated as cancelled).

A dividend of 12 US cents per ordinary share will be paid on 25 July 2008 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 27 June 2008 and is not included as a liability in these financial statements. This dividend, together with the first 
interim dividend of 6.5 US cents per ordinary share paid in February 2008, comprises the full year dividend for the year ended 
31 March 2008 of 18.5 US cents.
Unless shareholders elect by 27 June 2008 to receive US Dollars, their dividends will be paid in Sterling at a rate per share 
calculated on the basis of the exchange rate from US Dollars to Sterling on 4 July 2008. 
Pursuant to the Income Access Share arrangements put in place as part of the demerger, shareholders in the Company 
are able to elect to receive their dividends from a UK source (the ‘IAS election’). Shareholders who held 50,000 or fewer 
Experian shares (i) on the date of admission of the Company’s shares to the London Stock Exchange and (ii) in the case of 
shareholders who did not own shares at that time, on the first dividend record date after they become shareholders in the 
Company, unless they elect otherwise, will be deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the IAS arrangements. 
Shareholders who hold more than 50,000 shares and who wish to receive their dividends from a UK source must make an IAS 
election. All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked. Unless shareholders have made an IAS election, or are 
deemed to have made an IAS election, dividends will be received from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.
The Experian Group Limited Employee Share T rust and the GUS ESOP T rust have waived their entitlements to dividends in 
the amount of US$2m (2007: US$4m). In the year ended 31 March 2007, the GUS ESOP T rust did not waive its entitlement to 
the dividend in specie relating to the demerger of Home Retail Group.
The final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2006, which was paid in August 2006, was received by shareholders of 
GUS plc. The dividend in specie, which represented the net assets of Home Retail Group as at the date of the demerger, was 
also received by shareholders of GUS plc.  98 Experian Annual Report 2008

The restructuring provision at 31 March 2007 of US$9m disclosed within current liabilities included the full cost of the 
restructuring of UK Marketing Services, which was utilised in full in the year ended 31 March 2008.
The restructuring provision at 31 March 2007 of US$30m disclosed within non-current liabilities comprised the anticipated 
future costs of the withdrawal by Experian from large scale credit card and loan account processing in the UK, in respect of 
which there was a charge of US$28m in the year then ended. This provision comprised the estimated costs of redundancy and 
certain contractual obligations in respect of this business and was determined by reference to projections of the timing of 
withdrawal. It was anticipated that this portion of the provision would be utilised in the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2010. 
As indicated in note 9, during the year ended 31 March 2008 the Group entered into an agreement to transfer certain of these 
activities to a third party and this gave rise to an exceptional credit of US$2m. At 31 March 2008,  the remaining provision in 
respect of obligations for the Group relating to the withdrawal from this business was US$20m of which US$8m is disclosed 
within non-current liabilities and US$12m is disclosed within current liabilities.
As indicated in note 9, there has been an exceptional charge in the year ended 31 March 2008 of US$60m in connection with a 
programme of cost-efficiency measures. At the balance sheet date there is a related provision of US$31m which is disclosed 
within current liabilities.           
            
Contingent and other liabilities at 31 March 2008 comprise liabilities of Serasa, in connection with local legal and taxation 
issues, which were primarily recognised on the acquisition of that company under the fair value accounting policy on 
acquisition. Subsequent adjustments to the fair value are made as the exposures are concluded.
            
Fair values of provisions do not materially differ from the recognised book values.

27. Retirement benefit assets/obligations
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution plans in a number of countries around the world and 
provides post-retirement healthcare insurance benefits to certain former employees. A defined benefit plan is a pension 
plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or 
more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan that defines the 
amount of contributions that are paid by the Group into an independently administered fund.
   
Pension arrangements for the Group’s UK employees are operated principally through the Experian Pension Scheme which 
is a defined benefit scheme and the Experian Money Purchase Pension Plan which is a defined contribution scheme. In 
North and Latin America, benefits are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided 
accordingly. There are no other material pension arrangements.
  
Following the demerger of Home Retail Group, the Argos Pension Scheme, a defined  benefit scheme for Home Retail 
Group employees, continued to be operated by that business. On demerger the pension rights of certain Home Retail Group 
employees, who had been members of the then GUS Pension Scheme, were transferred to the Argos Pension Scheme. 
Certain Home Retail Group employees who had been members of the then GUS Money Purchase Pension Plan were 
transferred to the Home Retail Group Stakeholder Pension Plan during the year.
 
(a) Defined benefit schemes           
The  Experian Pension Scheme has rules which specify the benefits to be paid and is financed accordingly with assets being 
held in independently administered funds. A full actuarial funding valuation of this scheme is carried out every three years 
with interim reviews in the intervening years. The latest full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2007 by independent, 
qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt Limited, using the projected unit credit method. Under this method of valuation the current 
service cost will increase as members approach retirement due to the ageing active membership of the scheme.
Whilst IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’ is not 
effective for the current financial year, the Group has reviewed its provisions and is satisfied that these would have no effect 
on the retirement benefit asset recognised in the Group balance sheet.
As reported last year , following changes introduced by the Finance Act 2004 which took effect from 6 A pril 2006 (A-Day), the Experian 
Pension Scheme implemented revised terms for members exchanging pension at retirement date for a tax-free lump sum. The impact 
of the consequent update in assumptions reduced the charge to the Group income statement for the year ended 31 March 2007 by 
US$2m and increased the actuarial gain recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense in that year by US$6m.
The disclosures required by IAS 19, which relate to the Group’s UK defined benefit pension arrangements only, are as follows:

As indicated in note 2, retirement benefit obligations are now separately reported in the Group balance sheet as this is a 
more appropriate presentation of the nature of those obligations. The Group balance sheet at 31 March 2008 accordingly 
includes a net retirement benefit asset of US$132m (2007: US$85m) made up of total plan assets of US$1,045m (2007: US$1,069m) 
and total defined benefit obligations of US$913m (2007: US$984m).
As reported last year the Group has in place arrangements which secure unfunded pension benefit arrangements for 
certain directors and senior managers by granting charges to an independent trustee over independently managed 
portfolios of marketable securities owned by the Group. The amount of assets charged in this way is adjusted annually to 
keep the ratio of assets charged to the discounted value of the accrued benefits secured in this way as close as possible to 
the corresponding ratio in the Experian Pension Scheme. The total value of the assets charged in this way at 31 March 2008 
was US$34m (2007: US$29m). Further details of the unfunded pension arrangements for directors appear in the report on 
directors’ remuneration on page 62. 108 Experian Annual Report 2008

The curtailment gain in the year ended 31 March 2008 of US$8m arises principally from the restructuring of continuing 
businesses in the UK. The curtailment gain in the year ended 31 March 2007 arose from the restructuring of the UK Account 
Processing and the UK Marketing Services businesses, as well as the cessation of certain corporate functions in GUS plc.
The charge to the  Group profit and loss account reserve in the year ended 31 March 2007 in respect of the Argos Pension

27. Retirement benefit assets/obligations (continued)
Actuarial assumptions
The valuations used for 31 March 2008 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated by  
Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19. The principal actuarial assumptions used  
to calculate the present value of the defined benefit obligations were as follows:
  2008 2007
  % %
Rate of inflation 3.6  3.1 
Rate of increase for salaries 5.4  4.9 
Rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.6  3.1 
Rate of increase for medical costs 6.5  6.5 
Discount rate   6.9  5.4 
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, i.e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation. If this 
assumption increased/decreased by 0.1%, the defined benefit obligation would decrease/increase by approximately US$15m 
and the annual current service cost would decrease/increase by approximately US$1m. The discount rate is based on the 
market yields on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term to the defined benefit obligations.
The IAS 19 valuation assumes that mortality will be in line with the PA92 series year of use tables with medium cohort 
mortality improvement projections and an age rating of +1 year.  This includes an explicit allowance for anticipated future 
improvements in life expectancy (medium cohort projections).
   
The average expectation of life on retirement in normal health is assumed to be:
    2008 2007
    years years
At age 65 for a male currently aged 65   21.2 19.1 
At age 65 for a female currently aged 65   24.1 22.2 
At age 65 for a male currently aged 50   22.2 19.8 
At age 65 for a female currently aged 50   25.0 23.1 
An increase in assumed life expectancy of 0.1 years would increase the defined benefit obligation at 31 March 2008 by 
approximately US$3m.
     
The assumptions in respect of discount rate, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 
accounting valuation. Changes to these assumptions in the light of prevailing conditions may have a significant impact on 
future valuations.
    
The IAS 19 valuation, in respect of post-retirement healthcare insurance benefits provided to certain former Group 
employees, additionally assumes a rate of increase for medical costs. If this assumption increased/decreased by 1.0% per 
annum then the obligation would increase/decrease by US$1m and the current service cost would remain unchanged.

The expected return on plan assets has been determined by considering the mix of returns anticipated on the assets held 
in accordance with the current investment policy. Expected yields on fixed interest investments and securities are based on 
gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date. Expected returns on equity and other investments reflect the long-term 
real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.

29. Other financial assets and liabilities (continued) 
(d) Fair values of other financial assets and liabilities
Fair values of derivative instruments are set out in note (a) opposite.
The fair value of foreign currency contracts is based on a comparison of the contractual and year end exchange rates. The fair 
values of other derivative financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using 
appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
The put option associated with the remaining 30% stake of Serasa is recognised as a liability of US$583m at 31 March 2008 
under IAS 39. The put element is valued at the higher of 95% of the equity value of Serasa or the value of Serasa based on the 
P/E ratio of Experian and the latest earnings of Serasa. A Monte Carlo simulation has been used to calculate the liability. The 
key assumptions in arriving at the value of the put are the equity value of Serasa, the future P/E ratio of Experian at the date of 
exercise, the respective volatilities of Experian and Serasa and the risk free rate in Brazil. 
The method of valuation has been updated since the initial recognition of the liability as it is now assumed that the put may be 
exercised in June 2012 and thereafter recorded as a current liability. Previously an average assumed exercise date of June 2015 
had been applied. This change in method resulted in an increase of US$117m to the initial liability recognised at the date of the 
written put on acquisition of Serasa and has no impact on the results previously reported at 30 September 2007. The gain since 
acquisition of US$69m, which is recorded as a financing fair value remeasurement, primarily relates to a fall of 7 in the expected 
future Experian P/E ratio during the period since acquisition and an increase in the risk free rate in Brazil from 10.4% to 13.2%.
(e) Amounts recognised in the Group income statement in connection with the Group’s hedging instruments are disclosed in note 10.

Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences to the extent that 
the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of US$32m (2007: US$19m) in respect of losses that can be carried forward 
against future taxable income. In addition the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of US$25m (2007: US$22m) in 
respect of capital losses that can be carried forward against future taxable gains. These losses are available indefinitely.
Deferred tax liabilities of US$2,004m (2007: US$2,187m) have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that 
would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, 
no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
At the balance sheet date there were deferred tax assets recoverable within the next twelve months of US$47m (2007: 
US$120m) and deferred tax liabilities payable within the next twelve months of US$1m (2007: US$10m).

The balance classified as share capital is the nominal value of the Company’s issued share capital. Further details relating 
to the authorised and issued share capital of Experian Group Limited at the balance sheet dates, together with details of 
ordinary shares issued since the balance sheet date, are contained in note K to the parent company financial statements.
On 10 October 2006, the separation of Experian and Home Retail Group was completed by way of demerger. As part of the 
demerger, Experian Group Limited became the ultimate holding company of GUS plc and related subsidiaries and shares  
in GUS plc ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange on 6 October 2006. T rading of shares in Experian on the  
London Stock Exchange commenced on 11 October 2006. This transaction was accounted for using the principles of  
merger accounting and the distribution to GUS plc shareholders of shares in Home Retail Group plc was accounted for  
as a dividend in specie. In accordance with the requirements of merger accounting, the nominal values of the issued share 
capital at 1 April 2005 and subsequent movements to the date of demerger were amended to reflect the capital structure of  
Experian Group Limited. These movements included the recognition of a share premium balance in Experian Group Limited 
on a reorganisation prior to the demerger and the subsequent reduction of share capital and the transfer of the associated 
share premium account to retained earnings.
On 11 October 2006, the Group raised US$1,441m, net of US$43m expenses, by way of a share offer. The amount received 
in excess of the nominal value of shares issued is reported as part of the share premium account and the balance on this 
account is not available for distribution.
Retained earnings comprise net profits retained in the Group after the payment of dividends. The composition of and 
movements on other reserves are explained below. There are no significant statutory, contractual or exchange control 
restrictions on distributions by Group undertakings.        118 Experian Annual Report 2008

At 31 March 2008, the balance on the own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in the Company held by the Experian 
Group Limited Employee Share T rust and the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Plan T rust, including shares purchased by 
the GUS ESOP T rust to satisfy certain of the Group’s obligations under its share incentive plans. During the year these trusts 
purchased 509,518 (2007: 7,775,076) shares at a cost of US$6m (2007: US$75m). 
The merger reserve arose on the demerger in October 2006 and represents the difference between the share capital and 
share premium of GUS plc and the nominal value of the share capital of the Company before the global offer and subsequent 
share issues.
Movements on the hedging reserve and the position at the balance sheet date reflect hedging transactions which are not 
charged or credited to the Group income statement, net of related taxation.
Movements on the translation reserve and the position at the balance sheet date reflect foreign currency translations since  
1 April 2004 which are not charged or credited to the Group income statement, net of related taxation.

Other than those obligations acquired in connection with the purchase of Serasa, the Group did not enter into any new finance lease 
arrangements during the year (2007: US$nil). Finance lease obligations of Serasa at the date of acquisition in June 2007 were US$19m. 120 Experian Annual Report 2008
34. Acquisitions
On 28 June 2007, the Group acquired an initial 65% stake in Serasa, the market-leading credit bureau in Brazil, from a consortium of 
Brazilian banks for US$1.2bn inclusive of transaction costs and net of cash and cash equivalents held by that business. Under the 
terms of the purchase agreement a further 5% of Serasa has been acquired since the date of the acquisition and, at 31 March 2008,  
the Group’s interest in Serasa was 70%. There are put and call options associated with the shares held by the remaining principal 
shareholders of Serasa and these are exercisable for a period of five years from June 2012. As indicated in note 2, the net present 
value of the put option has been recognised as a non-current financial liability . At 31 March 2008 this liability was US$583m.
In addition the Group acquired the whole of the issued share capital of Hitwise, a leading internet market intelligence company, 
for US$260m on 8 June 2007 and made a number of other acquisitions, none of which is considered individually material. The 
other acquisitions comprise the purchase of an additional interest in an entity previously classified as an associate together with 
purchases of 100% interests in a number of other entities.
In aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed revenues of US$411m to the Group, consisting of revenues from Serasa 
US$305m, Hitwise US$45m and other acquisitions US$61m, from the date of their acquisition to 31 March 2008. The acquisitions 
contributed aggregate profit after tax of US$54m to the Group, consisting of the profit after tax of Serasa US$44m, Hitwise US$4m 
and other acquisitions US$6m, for the periods from their respective acquisition dates to 31 March 2008. If these acquisitions had 
been completed on 1 April 2007, further revenues of US$132m would have been reported. It has been impracticable to estimate 
the impact on Group profit after tax had the acquired entities been owned from 1 April 2007, due to the acquired entities having 
different accounting policies prior to acquisition, previously reporting to different period ends and, in the case of certain of the 
individually immaterial acquisitions, preparing financial information on a cash basis prior to acquisition.

The book values above are the carrying amounts of each class of asset and liability, determined in accordance with IFRS, 
immediately before the acquisition.
The fair values set out above contain certain provisional amounts which will be finalised no later than one year after the date 
of acquisition. Provisional amounts have been included at 31 March 2008 as a consequence of the timing and complexity of the 
acquisitions. Fair value adjustments in respect of acquisitions made during the year resulted in an increase in book value of 
US$466m and arose principally in respect of acquisition intangibles. Goodwill represents the synergies, assembled workforce 
and future growth potential of the businesses acquired.
Deferred consideration is primarily payable in cash up to three years after the date of acquisition and in some cases is 
contingent on the businesses acquired achieving revenue and profit targets. The deferred consideration settled during the 
year on acquisitions made in previous years was US$53m.
There have been no material gains, losses, error corrections or other adjustments recognised in the year ended 31 March 
2008, that relate to acquisitions that were effected in the current or previous years.

35. Share-based payment arrangements 
The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based incentive plans. These include options and awards in respect of shares 
in Experian Group Limited made at or after demerger together with options and awards previously made in respect of shares in 
GUS plc which were rolled over into options and awards in respect of shares in Experian Group Limited at demerger.
Prior to the demerger, Experian employees participated in share-based incentive plans in respect of ordinary shares in  
GUS plc. On demerger, certain GUS options and awards vested early with the majority of Experian participants’ outstanding 
GUS options and awards rolled over into the Experian equivalent share-based incentive plans. Accordingly the following 
information relates to options and awards held by the Group’s employees including details in respect of Experian share-based 
incentive plans and, where appropriate, GUS share-based incentive plans. Option, award and share prices are disclosed in 
Sterling as this is the currency in which ordinary shares in Experian Group Limited are quoted and ordinary shares in GUS plc 
were quoted prior to the demerger.

the average growth in the general index of UK retail prices by at least 4% p.a. over a 2 year period. The period of assessment commenced at the date of 
demerger. This is not a market based performance condition as defined by IFRS 2.
2.   The stated values for expected departures include participants who did not meet the saving requirement of the scheme.
3.   Three day averages were calculated by taking middle market quotations of a GUS plc share from the London Stock Exchange daily official list. At roll-over, the 
quantity and exercise price of grants were modified to adjust for the difference between the GUS and Experian share prices.
4.   At demerger, a limited number of options and awards remained as GUS options and awards and participants had entitlement to one Home Retail Group share 
and one Experian share in lieu of each GUS share allocated. T o the extent that these share options did not vest in accordance with their conditions, they lapsed 
during the year ended 31 March 2007 or the year ended 31 March 2008.

(iii) Information relating to option valuation techniques 
For the above plans the Black-Scholes model is used to determine an appropriate value of the option grants and inputs into 
the model are calculated as follows: 
Expected volatility: Experian Share Option Plan – As shares in Experian Group Limited were newly listed during the 
year ended 31 March 2007, there was insufficient share price history in order to calculate historical volatility in that year. 
Accordingly to arrive at a reasonable volatility assumption an analysis of the share price volatility of comparable companies 
was performed in that year. Subsequently volatility has been calculated as an average over the expected life with an 
assumption made for volatility in each year of the expected life. V olatility in the first year is now assumed to be the same as 
implied volatility on grant date. Volatility for year 4 and beyond is assumed to remain at the long run historic volatility. Linear 
interpolation is assumed for years 2 and 3.
Expected volatility: Experian Sharesave Plans – Calculated as an average over the expected life with an assumption made for 
volatility in each year of the expected life. V olatility in the first year is assumed to be the same as implied volatility on grant 
date. V olatility for year 4 and beyond is assumed to remain at the long run historic volatility. Linear interpolation is assumed 
for years 2 and 3.
Expected volatility: former GUS plans – Calculated as an average over the expected life with an assumption made for 
volatility in each year of the expected life. Volatility in the first year was assumed to be the same as implied volatility on grant 
date. V olatility for year 4 and beyond was assumed to remain at the long run (10 year observed) historic volatility. Linear 
interpolation was assumed for years 2 and 3.
Expected dividend yield – Yields are based on the current consensus analyst forecast figures at the time of grant.  
The inputs utilised are an average of the forecast over the next three financial years.
Risk-free rate – Rates are obtained from the UK Government Debt Management Office website which details historical 
prices and yields for gilt strips.
Expected option life to exercise: Experian Share Option Plan – Options under the Experian Share Option Plan vest 50% after 
3 years and 50% after 4 years. The expected life is 4 years for the 50% that vest after 3 years and 4.85 years for the 50% that 
vest after 4 years.
Expected option life to exercise: Experian Sharesave Plans – Options under these plans have expected lives of either 3 or 5 
years.
Expected option life to exercise: former GUS plans – Options under The 1998 Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share 
Option Schemes had expected lives of 4 years, The North America Stock Option Plan had an expected life of 3.75 years and 
the savings related share option schemes had expected lives of either 3 or 5 years.
Share price on grant date: Experian Share Option Plan – The majority of the grants made in the year ended 31 March 2007 
were made on 11 October 2006. As this was Experian’s first trading day, the weighted average price of trades was used. For 
subsequent grants, the closing price on the day of grant was used.
Share price on grant date: Experian Sharesave Plans – The closing price on the day the options were granted.  
       
Share price on grant date: former GUS plans – The closing price on the day the options were granted.
Option exercise price – Exercise price as stated in the terms of each award. 124 Experian Annual Report 2008

1.  The grant date is the start of the financial year in which performance is assessed. This is before the quantity of the shares award is determined but the 
underlying value of the award is known at the grant date, subject to the outcome of the performance condition. The value of awarded shares reflects the 
performance outcome at the date of their issue to participants. These shares are a nil consideration option but have been classified as an award of shares 
because of their nature. 
2.  The Benchmark profit performance condition for the Experian Co-investment Plan requires Benchmark profit before tax growth to exceed 6% over a 3 year 
period. The period of assessment commences at the beginning of the financial year of grant. This is not a ‘market-based’ performance condition as defined 
by IFRS 2. 
3.  The Benchmark profit performance condition for the Experian Reinvestment Plan and Experian Performance Share Plan requires Benchmark profit before 
tax growth at least to exceed 7% over a 3 year period with the condition fully satisfied if Benchmark profit before tax growth is 14%. The period of assessment 
commences at the beginning of the financial year of grant. This is not a ‘market-based’ performance condition as defined by IFRS 2. The condition is applied to 
half of the awarded shares.
4.  The Experian Performance Share Plan ‘T otal Shareholder Return’ is considered a ‘market-based’ performance condition as defined by IFRS 2. It has been 
valued using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations for comparator companies measured over the 3 year period preceding 
valuation and an implied volatility for Experian Group Limited. The condition is applied to half of the awarded shares.

1.  The matching shares are a nil consideration option but have been classified as an award of shares because of their nature. The grant date is the start of the 
financial year in which performance is assessed. This is before the quantity of the shares award is determined but the underlying value of the award is known 
at the grant date, subject to the outcome of the performance condition. The value of awarded shares reflects the performance outcome at the date of their 
issue to participants. 
2.  This condition is considered a ‘market-based’ performance condition as defined by IFRS 2. The awards were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation with 
historic volatilities and correlations measured over the three year period preceding valuation.  
(ii) Information relating to share grant valuation techniques
The majority of the grants under the Experian share award plans were made on the first day of trading for Experian Group 
Limited shares and trading was particularly volatile on that day. The weighted average share price for that day’s trading  
was used to determine the value of demerger share awards. For the former GUS plans the value of awards is determined  
as the market closing price on the date awarded grants are issued to participants. For the Experian Reinvestment Plan  
and the former GUS Co-Investment Plan, this occurs after the first year of performance is assessed. Where appropriate 
market-based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for  
actual performance.
Participants in the share award plans have an entitlement to dividend distributions on awarded shares from the issue date 
until the date of vesting. The market price on the day of valuation is considered inclusive of such future dividend distributions 
and no modifications are made for dividend distributions or other factors. 128 Experian Annual Report 2008

2,814,465 shares granted in the year ended 31 March 2007, with a weighted average award fair value of £6.74.
(c) Modification of GUS awards to Experian participants
(i) Details of modification
Prior to demerger, Experian participants held share incentive grants with entitlement to GUS share distributions. On demerger, 
the majority of outstanding options and awards were rolled over into plans with entitlement to Experian Group Limited 
share distributions. As detailed below, the quantity and exercise price of options and awards were modified to maintain a 
compensation equivalent to that of the original GUS grants. The incremental fair value of the modification, recognised in 
the year ended 31 March 2007, was US$8m which was reported as an exceptional charge. The incremental fair value results 
primarily from an assumption in respect of the higher volatility of the Experian share price.
(ii) Information relating to modified share options and awards
In the year ended 31 March 2007, a total of 16.9m GUS options were rolled over into 30.0m Experian Group Limited options.  
A Black-Scholes model was used to determine the fair value of GUS and Experian Group Limited options for modified grants 
and the weighted average estimated fair values and the inputs into these models were as follows:
   GUS Experian 
   awards awards
Share price on modification date (£)  9.90 5.62

Fair value (£)   2.71 1.64
In the year ended 31 March 2007, awards in respect of 4.9m GUS shares with a weighted average fair value of £8.14 per share 
were rolled over into 8.7m Experian shares with a weighted average fair value of £4.67 per share.

(d) Other share awards
During the year ended 31 March 2007, Experian Group Limited issued put options to a small number of employees who 
owned an equity interest in a subsidiary. Under the terms of the associated agreement, these options vested on 31 March 
2008 assuming the employees remained with the Group and they are exercisable from that date onwards. These options are 
accounted for under IFRS 2 as performance conditions are linked to employment with the subsidiary. The options will be 
exercisable at a value based on 20% of the prevailing market value of the subsidiary for which these employees work and this 
value is capped at US$50m. The options will be settled in Experian Group Limited shares and at the time of the agreement the 
expected number of shares was 122,000. The options were purchased for US$0.7m by the employees at fair value as calculated 
by third party valuation specialists based on the revenue forecast model of the subsidiary. No cost will arise over the vesting 
period as the purchase price of the option was its market value.        
      
During the year ended 31 March 2008 107,000 shares with a fair value of US$1m were released in connection with this 
arrangement. At 31 March 2008 the expected number of shares still to be released was 98,000.

38. Contingencies
In North America and Latin America, there are a number of pending and threatened litigation claims involving Experian which are 
being vigorously defended. The directors do not believe that the outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation will have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. However, as is inherent in legal proceedings, there is a risk of outcomes 
unfavourable to the Group. In the case of unfavourable outcomes the Group would benefit from applicable insurance recoveries.
39. Related parties
The ultimate parent company of the Group is Experian Group Limited which is incorporated in Jersey. The principal 
subsidiary and associate undertakings at 31 March 2008 are shown in note Q to the financial statements of that company.
The following transactions were carried out with related parties of Experian:
Associates
During the year the Group made net sales and recharges, under normal commercial terms and conditions that would be 
available to third parties, to FARES and its associate First Advantage Corporation of US$28m (2007: US$29m). Amounts 
receivable from FARES are shown within note 21. These amounts outstanding are unsecured and will be settled in cash.  
No guarantees have been given or received in the year in connection with the Group’s trading with these entities.  
No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by associates.
Subsidiaries             
T ransactions between the ultimate parent company and its subsidiaries, and between subsidiaries, have been eliminated  
on consolidation.
Home Retail Group            
Home Retail Group is no longer a related party of the Group and there has been no charge in the year (2007: US$0.3m) in 
respect of services provided under the terms of the demerger agreement. At 31 March 2007, there was an amount owed by the 
Group to Home Retail Group of US$20m in respect of corporation tax liabilities at demerger and this balance was settled 
during the year ended 31 March 2008. Other transactions with Home Retail Group are made on normal commercial terms and 
conditions available to third parties.     
Key management personnel
Remuneration of key management personnel is disclosed in note 8. Other than remuneration, there were no material 
transactions or balances between the Group and its key management personnel or members of their close families in either 
the current or previous year.
Other related parties

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Experian Group Limited
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Experian Group Limited for the year ended 31 March 2008 which 
comprise the parent company balance sheet, the parent company profit and loss account and the related notes and those 
parts of the report on directors’ remuneration described as being audited.  These parent company financial statements have 
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.  
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Experian Group Limited for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the report on directors’ remuneration and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  This report, including the opinion, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.  We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report 
includes that specific information presented in the business review that is cross referred from the directors’ report.  
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records or if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We read the other information contained in the annual report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
parent company financial statements. This other information comprises only the Group financial highlights, the directors’ 
report, the chairman’s statement, the business review, the board of directors, the unaudited part of the report on directors’ 
remuneration, the corporate governance statement and the other items as referred to on the contents listing. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent 
company financial statements.  Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
We also review whether the report on directors’ remuneration complies with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
United Kingdom Financial Services Authority and report to you any non compliance.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
parent company financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by 
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted  l
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of the loss for the year then ended;
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991; and l
the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. l

Notes to th e parent co m pan y finan cial statements
 for the year ended 31 March 2008
A. Corporate information
Experian Group Limited (the ‘Company’) is incorporated and registered in Jersey as a public company limited by shares. The 
principal legislation under which the Company operates is Jersey Companies Law and regulations made thereunder.
The principal activity of the Company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the Experian Group (the ‘Group’), whose 
principal activity is business services.
 
The shares of the Company are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
B. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose 
shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The comparative figures cover the period from incorporation on 30 June 
2006 to 31 March 2007. The financial statements are presented in Sterling as that is the functional currency of the Company. In 
determining its functional currency the directors have determined the primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified 
by the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’). 
These separately presented Company financial statements comprise the profit and loss account, balance sheet and related 
notes. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 
‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing 
transactions with other members of the Group. 
The Experian Group Limited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008 contain financial instrument 
disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and these would also comply with the 
disclosures required by FRS 29  ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’. Accordingly, the Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 and has not presented separate financial instrument disclosures.
Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies of the Company are noted below.
T angible fixed assets
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset and the remaining life of the lease.
Leases
Gross rental income receivable and payable in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the 
periods of the leases.
Investments in group undertakings
Investments in group undertakings are stated at cost less provision considered necessary for any impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets
Where there is an indication of impairment, fixed assets are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 
‘Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill’.  Any impairment is recognised in the year in which it occurs.
Debtors and creditors
Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and carried at the lower of cost and recoverable amount.  Where the time value 
of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost.  Creditors are initially recognised at fair value and carried at 
amortised cost if the time value of money is material.
Cash
Cash includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments. 
Accounting for derivative financial instruments 
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  135 Experian Annual Report 2008
Introduction
2 – 5
Business review
6 – 37
Governance
38 – 64
Financial statements
Company financial statements
B. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
The interest differential reflected in forward foreign exchange contracts is taken to interest expense. Forward foreign 
exchange contracts are recognised at fair value, based on forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. 
Gains or losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are taken directly to net foreign exchange gains or losses in the profit 
and loss account.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and 
is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable. 
Own shares
The Experian Group Limited Employee Share T rust, the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan and the GUS plc 
ESOP T rust are separately administered trusts. Liabilities of these trusts are guaranteed by the Company and the assets 
of the trusts mainly comprise shares in the Company. The assets, liabilities and expenses of the trusts are included in the 
Company’s financial statements as if they were the Company’s own. Such shares held by the trusts are shown as a deduction 
from total equity shareholders’ funds at cost.
Share-based payments
The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based compensation plans. These include options and awards in respect of 
shares in the Company made at or after demerger together with options and awards previously granted in respect of shares 
in GUS plc which were rolled over into options and awards in respect of shares in the Company at demerger. 
The fair value of such options and awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised after taking into account the 
Company’s best estimate of the number of options and awards expected to vest. The Company revises the vesting estimate 
at each balance sheet date and non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimates.  Amounts are 
recognised over the vesting period. Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes model, 
Monte Carlo model and closing market price is most appropriate to the award. Market based performance conditions are 
included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual performance.
The issuance by the Company of share incentives to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions 
and the fair value of such options and awards is therefore recognised as an increase in the Company’s investment in group 
undertakings with a corresponding increase in total equity shareholders’ funds.
C. Operating loss
The operating loss is stated after charging:

(iii) T ax effect of exceptional items
The exceptional items included within the Company’s administrative expenses in the year ended 31 March 2007 were not 
deductible for tax purposes.
F . Dividend
During the year the Company paid interim equity dividends of £30.9m (2007: £20.4m) to ordinary shareholders. The directors 
propose a further dividend of 12 US cents per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2008. This dividend is not included as 
a liability in the current year financial statements as it was not announced before 31 March 2008. For further details of payment 
arrangements see note 14 in the Experian Group financial statements. Additionally, in the period ended 31 March 2007, there was 
a dividend in specie of £3,497.5m relating to the demerger of Home Retail Group.

K. Share capital and share premium (continued)
At 31 March 2008, 1,023,419,769 (2007: 1,022,281,806) ordinary shares and 20 (2007: 20) deferred shares each had been allotted, called 
up and fully paid. During the year ended 31 March 2008, 1,137,963 ordinary shares were allotted on the exercise of share options. 
Since 31 March 2008, 31,636 ordinary shares in the Company have been issued in connection with the exercise of share options.
On 10 October 2006, the Company issued 877,444,999 ordinary shares in connection with the transfer of GUS plc and its 
subsidiaries to the Company as part of the demerger process at a fair value of £8,675.6m. On 11 October 2006 the Company 
issued a further 142,857,143 ordinary shares of 10 US cents each by way of a Global Offer. A further 1,979,664 ordinary shares 
were allotted between 11 October 2006 and 31 March 2007 on the exercise of share options.
Share premium
Share premium of £3.7m was created in the year ended 31 March 2008 when ordinary shares were allotted under share  
option schemes.
Share premium of £8,628.7m arose in the period ended 31 March 2007, in connection with the issue of 877,444,999 ordinary shares 
as part of the demerger process, and comprised the excess of the fair value of the net assets of £8,675.6m acquired over the 
nominal value of the shares issued of £46.9m.
On 10 October 2006, following the approval of the Jersey Court under Article 63 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, the 
Company reduced its share capital. This gave rise to a reduction of £8,628.7m in the share premium account and a corresponding 
increase in the profit and loss account reserve.
As a result of the Company issuing 142,857,143 ordinary shares, by way of Global Offer, at a price of £5.60 per share, additional 
share premium of £792.3m was created being the excess of the proceeds of the shares issued over their nominal value. Related 
issue costs of £22.8m were charged against the share premium account. Additional share premium of £4.3m was created in the 
balance of that period when ordinary shares were allotted under share option schemes. 
The share premium account is not available for distribution.

Shareholder information
Capital Gains T ax (‘CGT’) base cost for UK shareholders 
On 10 October 2006, GUS plc separated its Experian business from its Home Retail Group business by way of demerger. 
Following the demerger, GUS shareholders at 4.30pm on Friday, 6 October 2006 were entitled to receive one share in Experian 
Group Limited and one share in Home Retail Group plc for every share they held in GUS plc at that time.
The previous base cost of any GUS plc shares held at 4.30pm on 6 October 2006 is apportioned for UK CGT purposes in 
the following ratio: 58.235% to Experian Group Limited shares and 41.765% to Home Retail Group plc shares (based on the 
closing prices of the respective shares on their first day of trading after their admission to the Official List of the London 
Stock Exchange on 11 October 2006).
For GUS plc shares acquired prior to the demerger of Burberry on 13 December 2005 which are affected by both the Burberry 
demerger and the subsequent separation of Experian and Home Retail Group, the original CGT base cost is apportioned 
50.604% to Experian Group Limited shares, 36.293% to Home Retail Group plc shares and 13.103% to Burberry Group plc shares.

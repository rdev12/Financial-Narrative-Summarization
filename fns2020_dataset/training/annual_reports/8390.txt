Overview
Today’s world and our markets 
are changing. 
Many challenges, however, remain 
consistent across almost all industries and 
markets. Demand for energy, particularly 
from emerging economies, continues to 
increase and regulatory requirements are 
increasing as safety considerations remain 
paramount. The need to act responsibly 
and sustainably continues to be a priority 
and a focus remains on improving efficiency 
and reducing environmental impact. 
Invensys develops and applies advanced 
technologies that enable the world’s 
manufacturing and energy-generating 
facilities, mainline and mass transit rail 
networks, and appliances to operate 
safely and in an energy-efficient manner. 
In all three of our divisions, our products 
and systems enable our customers to 
make the best decisions at the right time 
and to optimise their operations and 
business value.

Overview
Invensys Operations Management is 
a leading global technology, software 
and consulting business that creates 
and applies advanced technologies to 
enable the safe and efficient operation 
of industrial and commercial operations 
such as oil refineries, fossil fuel and 
nuclear power plants, petrochemical 
works and other manufacturing sites.
We offer a holistic and cost-effective way 
to optimise our customers’ operational 
performance and overall profitability 
by improving the performance of key 
resources (including people, equipment, 
energy and materials) in real time and with 
measurable results. We do so at the same 
time as maintaining our absolute 
commitment to safety.
We have a large global installed base. 
Our customers are principally large, 
global industrial companies with complex 
processes and activities. Our solutions are 
used by more than 40,000 customers in 
over 200,000 plants and facilities around 
the world. We enable the generation of 
20% of the world’s electricity, the refining 
of 17% of the world’s crude oil, 36% of the 
world’s nuclear energy generation, and the 
production of 64% of the world’s liquefied 
natural gas.
Our products and solutions are divided 
into the following categories:
Control and safety
Our Foxboro® I/A Series® distributed 
control system (DCS), is a world leader in 
meeting the automation needs of complex 
integrated systems that control critical or 
hazardous operations and require non-
stop operation. We have a top three 
position in the world’s DCS market based 
on the strength of this core brand. Our 
Triconex® system is the world’s leading 
safety system and is used extensively in 
nuclear power stations, petrochemical 
plants and oil refineries. The Triconex 
system will automatically take over the 
plant in the event of a problem and bring 
it back quickly to a safe state.
Our team of experienced systems 
integrators is fundamental to our success 
in project delivery and in meeting the 
needs of our customers, in particular 
those with the largest and most 
complex projects.
Advanced applications
Our advanced applications use industry-
leading software, technology and 
engineering solutions to help our 
customers to improve and optimise 
their performance. Our SimSci-Esscor® 
simulation software allows existing and 
new operators to practice dealing with 
different scenarios without affecting the 
plant, and our Avantis® asset management 
software monitors equipment in a plant 
to enable predictive maintenance and 
replacement to prevent unexpected 
downtime. Our Wonderware® offerings 
provide the platform for open connectivity 
to plant floor systems. A key factor of many 
of our advanced applications is that they 
can operate within plants that use our 
competitors’ systems.
Equipment
Invensys Operations Management sells 
a broad range of equipment used in 
industrial plants, including measurement 
and instrumentation products from our 
leading Foxboro brand and our 
Eurotherm® recorders and controllers.
Enterprise Control System
In a changing world, profit management 
is becoming increasingly challenging. It is 
often made all the more so by the different 
needs and priorities of the various user 
groups within a plant or site: maintenance 
personnel focussed on improving asset 
effectiveness, operators looking to 
maximise production, and executives 
looking to achieve visibility across the 
enterprise. As a consequence, our 
customers are experiencing a growing 
need to manage their operations 
holistically and in real time.
To address these dynamics we are 
combining all our technologies into a 
single Enterprise Control System (ECS). 
This industry-first system integrates all 
aspects of plant operations, spanning 
DCS, safety systems, decision-support, 
execution and visibility, in much the same 
way that Enterprise Resource Planning 
(ERP) platforms have done for back office 
systems. It enables the linking of strategy 
with execution in ways that lead to an 
improvement in business performance.
Our InFusion™ ECS, based on our 
world-leading Wonderware operations 
management software and over 20 years 
of experience in applying it, leverages an 
open architecture to seamlessly integrate 
the Invensys Operations Management 
portfolio, as well as new and legacy 
third-party offerings.
How do we generate revenue?
Our revenue can be broken down as 
follows: 60% control and safety, including 
our systems integration capabilities; 
20% advanced applications; and 20% 
equipment. Our ECS offering is spread 
across all three product categories.
In recent years, we have been particularly 
successful in winning large greenfield 
contracts in the oil and gas, petrochemicals 
and power industries. The proportion of 
our revenue from large contracts, defined 
by us as in excess of £10 million, has been 
increasing. During the year 16% of the 
division’s revenue was from large contracts 
compared with 3% in 2010.
Our route to market varies by product: 
our control and safety solution sales are 
direct; equipment sales are direct or 
indirect; and our advanced applications 
sales are direct, indirect, or, for our 
Wonderware software, often via 
systems integrators.

What is our strategy?
Invensys Operations Management’s 
strategy is to support its existing 
customers, expand its customer base and 
to broaden the geographic profile of the 
division by focussing on high-growth 
economies. We will focus on our world-
class control and safety systems and on 
high-margin and faster-growing segments 
of the market such as advanced 
applications and in leading the industry 
in the rapidly developing market for ECS. 
The ECS provides the platform to integrate 
the real-time plant floor into the enterprise 
systems and is a unique differentiator 
for our business.
Support existing customers
Continuing to ensure that our installed 
base of existing customers receives 
outstanding service and solutions will be 
an important source of future revenue. 
There will be significant opportunities to 
replace or upgrade controls and safety 
systems, as well as up-sale opportunities 
to provide advanced applications and 
ECS-based solutions.
Expand customer base
A key tenet of our strategy is to secure 
new greenfield contracts that expand our 
installed base and provide opportunities 
to sell additional solutions. Currently 77% 
of Invensys Operations Management’s 
revenue derives from the oil and gas, 
petrochemicals, utilities and power, and 
general industries sectors. Our aim is to 
expand the reach of the division into a 
broader range of adjacent industries.
Expand geographically
Invensys Operations Management is 
targeting a greater proportion of revenue 
from the faster-growing economies of Asia 
Pacific, the Middle East and South America. 
As at 31 March 2011, 60% of the Invensys 
Operations Management order book was 
to emerging markets.
Leading technology
The development of world-class 
technology remains core to our strategy. 
During the year, Invensys Operations 
Management spent 6% of revenue on 
research and development in areas 
including enhancements to our DCS and 
safety platforms, advanced applications 
and our ECS.
Our network of technology and 
distribution partners increases our ability 
to develop and deliver value-adding 
technology to our customers.
Realise synergies within Invensys
It is a strategic aim of the Group to 
capitalise on the technologies within 
Invensys Operations Management to 
broaden our rail capability further.
Acquisitions
We will continue to make bolt-on 
acquisitions to deliver unique technologies 
that increase the breadth of our offerings, 
particularly in the areas of control and safety, 
advanced applications and applications 
supporting our ECS platform.

Overview
Invensys Rail is a multinational 
technology leader, providing state- 
of-the-art software-based signalling, 
communication and control systems that 
enable the safe and efficient operation 
of trains in mainline and mass transit 
networks across the world.
Our systems and solutions enable our 
customers to control rail networks safely, 
increasing capacity at the same time as 
lowering their cost of ownership.
We operate in a highly regional rail 
industry, where different geographies 
frequently have their own operational 
and signalling requirements. Within our 
traditional core markets of the UK, Iberia, 
North America and Australia we are a 
major supplier of rail signalling systems.
In recent years, we have successfully 
expanded our business into new markets, 
including Brazil, Venezuela, Singapore, 
Malaysia, China, India, New Zealand and 
Turkey. Our technology is now in use by 
over 100 rail and mass transit operators 
in over 30 countries, including 10 of 
the world’s 20 busiest metropolitan 
rail systems.
Our broad systems offering ranges from 
highly complex integrated control centres 
that supervise and control complete 
railways, to leading-edge systems for mass 
transit (for example Communication Based 
Train Control (CBTC)), and systems for 
mainline and high-speed lines (for example 
European Rail Traffic Management System 
(ERTMS)) that automate train operation 
and protection, to the latest generation 
interlockings that ensure safe running 
across a network. We also provide a 
complete range of trackside products, 
including crossings, point machines, 
relays and track circuits.
Our core strengths lie in the breadth and 
sophistication of our technology, our 
domain knowledge and our record for 
commissioning and delivery of projects.
How do we generate revenue?
Rail control is a specialist market within the 
rail product business as a whole and is a 
higher-margin segment compared with 
rolling stock and infrastructure. In the 
majority of cases, the business is project-
based and involves long-term contracts 
spread over a number of years. Contracts 
are bid directly with customers, either 
independently or through consortia.
Invensys Rail’s revenue can be broken 
down as follows: 47% mainline engineering 
and contracting; 31% mass transit 
engineering and contracting; and 22% 
products. During the year, 56% of the 
division’s revenue was generated from 
contracts in excess of £10 million.
What is our strategy?
Invensys Rail has established a leadership 
position through sustained investment 
in the research and development of 
state-of-the-art technology solutions and 
a commitment to the highest standards 
of project execution. This dual approach 
remains at the heart of our strategy. We 
will also continue to expand geographically 
and realise synergies within Invensys.
Expand geographically
Our four traditional core markets of the 
UK, Iberia, North America and Australia 
account for 78% of the division’s revenue; 
this compares with 90% in 2010.
Developing countries continue to 
accelerate rail investment and over 
the coming years we expect to increase 
significantly the contribution from other, 
faster-growing markets. 44% of the 
division’s order book at 31 March 2011 
related to projects outside our core 
markets (2010: 44%).
Technology development
With signalling and rail control having 
an increasing role in meeting the 
growing demands for rail resulting from 
urbanisation and a need for a reduced 
carbon footprint, new technology 
implementation remains critical for 
the industry.
The success of Invensys Rail will 
increasingly be judged on the operational 
value we provide to our customers by 
managing the whole railway system: 
driving up capacity and reducing journey 
times, energy usage and operational costs, 
while maintaining an absolute commitment 
to safety.
We continue to invest in state-of-the-art 
technology and spent 7% of the division’s 
revenue on research and development 
during the year.
Realise synergies within Invensys
We will continue to leverage Invensys 
Operations Management’s technology. 
Examples to date include safety systems 
for interlockings, asset management 
for trains and track, and the use of 
Wonderware technology for control 
room displays and passenger 
information systems.
Acquisitions
Invensys Rail will seek to make bolt-
on acquisitions that deliver unique 
technologies and/or improved 
market access.

addressable market by continuing to 
provide a cutting-edge product range. 
During the year, approximately 10% of the 
division’s revenue was derived from new 
product introductions, up from 9% in 2010. 
Working closely with our customers, 
we will increase our investment and focus 
on the higher-margin commercial and 
wholesale segments, while also continuing 
to invest in the appliance segment.
Our successful restructuring and 
productivity programme has enabled us 
to price competitively by increasing our 
efficiency and lowering cost.

Dear shareholder
I am pleased to report that Invensys 
produced another improvement in 
performance during the year ended 
31 March 2011. We increased revenue 
by 9% at CER to £2,486 million and 
operating profit before exceptional 
items by 5% at CER to £262 million.
Invensys Operations Management 
produced record results, clearly benefiting 
from its success in winning large greenfield 
projects in emerging markets, executing 
on its advanced applications strategy, and 
a strong recovery in industrial capital 
expenditure in developed countries. The 
global rail infrastructure markets remained 
strong; however, Invensys Rail experienced 
a small decline in profitability due to cost 
overruns on three mass transit contracts 
and its order intake was affected by the 
timing of the award of large contracts. 
Invensys Controls produced a performance 
broadly in line with last year despite 
revenue being held back by weaker than 
expected consumer markets, particularly 
in North America.
At Invensys, we have three world class 
divisions and a management team to 
match. Our task for the future is to take 
our strong market positions, our excellent 
technology, our committed people and 
our financial strength, and create an 
even better future for Invensys and its 
shareholders. As our new Chief Executive, 
Wayne Edmunds, elaborates upon in 
his statement on page 14, we have the 
businesses and plans to achieve this; 
it is now all about execution.
Dividend and dividend policy
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 2.5 pence per share, which 
brings the total dividends payable in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2011 
to 4.0 pence per share, an increase of one 
third over the payments of 3.0 pence per 
share in respect of last year. Subject to 
approval by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting on 28 July 2011, the final 
dividend will be paid on 5 August 2011 
to shareholders on the register at 
24 June 2011. We have decided to 
introduce a dividend reinvestment plan 
(DRIP), beginning with this final dividend, 
which will enable shareholders to reinvest 
their dividends directly into Invensys 
shares. Details of the DRIP are contained 
in separate documentation mailed 
to shareholders. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 13
Overview
The Board’s dividend policy seeks to 
balance the income needs of shareholders 
with the needs of the Group to retain the 
resources and flexibility to enhance further 
our growth prospects. 
Accordingly, we remain committed to our 
progressive dividend policy with future 
dividend growth reflecting more closely 
the long-term sustainable trend in 
underlying earnings per share and free 
cash flow.
The Board
On 24 March 2011, the Board announced 
that Ulf Henriksson had stepped down as 
Chief Executive and as a director and that 
Wayne Edmunds, who had been Chief 
Financial Officer since 2009, had been 
appointed Chief Executive. David Thomas, 
who has held senior financial roles within 
the Group since 2002, was appointed 
Acting Chief Financial Officer and a 
permanent appointment will be made 
in due course after consideration of 
internal and external candidates.
With effect from 19 May 2011, Deena 
Mattar has been appointed to the Board 
as an additional non-executive director. 
She was formerly Group Finance Director 
of Kier Group plc. Deena joined Kier Group 
in 1998 as Finance Director of Kier National, 
having previously held senior positions at 
KPMG, and was appointed to the board 
as Group Finance Director in 2001. She is 
a chartered accountant and will join the 
Audit Committee.
Outlook
Invensys Operations Management 
continues to see improved demand across 
all regions, with increased industrial capital 
expenditure in North America and Europe 
and further building of new capacity 
elsewhere, especially in the oil and gas and 
power sectors in the Middle East and Asia. 
The global rail infrastructure market remains 
strong with several large projects, both 
greenfield and brownfield, currently being 
bid for by Invensys Rail across the world. 
Revenue growth will be supported by 
the large order book and margins are 
expected to remain in line with FY 2010/11’s 
reported outcome, reflecting ongoing 
bidding and development costs and further 
investment in developing a presence in 
emerging markets; in the medium term, we 
expect margins to be in the range of 15–17%. 
Invensys Controls’ major appliance 
customers are expecting modest growth 
in our major markets in North America and 
Europe and we expect to outperform the 
market due to new product introductions 
and market share increases. We will also be 
putting a greater focus upon higher-margin 
sectors such as wholesale and commercial. 
On a constant currency basis, we expect 
a year of further progress.
Sir Nigel Rudd 
Chairman  Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
I am delighted to be leading Invensys in 
the next stage of its development.
Having worked closely with our businesses 
over the past two years as Chief Financial 
Officer, it is clear to me that we have three 
strong divisions, each with management 
strength in depth and the ability to create 
significant growth and value. We are a 
global company operating in end markets 
which each have strong growth prospects.
We need to create a common theme 
for execution across the Group. Execution 
means having a discipline for linking 
people, strategy and operations to create 
sustainable value. To that end, we have 
decided to move away from an integrated 
operating model, with centralised 
functions and matrix management, towards 
a holding company model where divisional 
management has greater control and 
responsibility for their operations. 
We will be concentrating upon a number 
of important areas:
• Continuing to win further greenfield 
projects in emerging markets to 
enlarge our installed base and provide 
opportunities for additional sales. We 
have demonstrated that our technology 
is well-suited for large, complex solutions 
and our unique ability to team with 
global partners offers our customers 
distinctive value.
• Building a larger footprint in regions 
and industries with higher growth 
expectations such as Asia and the 
nuclear power generating industry.
• Continuing to invest in the development 
of our key technology platforms to our 
competitive advantage in key areas.
• Using our strong balance sheet to 
add new capabilities to our portfolio 
or additional market presence in 
strategically important regions 
or sectors.
• Having reached provisional agreement 
on the triennial review with the trustees 
of our UK Main Pension Scheme that 
there is no change to the deficit funding 
contribution schedule, either in terms of 
duration or amount of payments, we will 
continue to keep our legacy pension 
issues under review.
Chief Executive’s Statement
“ I like to describe our strategy in simple terms as being based upon 
using our distinctive technologies and delivery capabilities to build 
global market share and increase shareholder value.”

Overview
Performance highlights
Overall, the Group produced another good 
performance with revenue and operating 
profit up 9% and 5% respectively at CER 
and underlying earnings per share up 48% 
to 19.8 pence per share (2010: 13.4 pence 
per share).
Invensys Operations Management had a 
strong order intake driven by a recovery in 
industrial capital expenditure in developed 
markets and the winning of further 
contracts to supply our control and safety 
systems for four additional Chinese nuclear 
reactors. Revenue growth was also strong 
mainly due to the ramp-up of activity on 
many of the large greenfield projects that 
we have won over the past two years. 
Operating margins returned to double 
digits for the year and our cash conversion 
was in line with our targets.
Invensys Rail reported a lower than 
expected order intake, which reflects 
the uneven nature of order intake in the 
industry and in particular the unexpected 
delay in the award of some larger contracts. 
However, the strength of its order book 
helped it to increase revenue by 9% at CER. 
Operating margins for the year reflected 
some provisions for additional costs on 
three mass transit contracts in the first half, 
partially offset by the benefit of risk register 
releases on contract completions in the 
second half. Cash conversion was adversely 
affected by the phasing of receipts from 
some customers.
Invensys Controls improved both revenue 
and operating profit despite some weaker 
than expected markets in the second half 
of the year, particularly for US appliances. 
It is clearly benefiting from the significant 
restructuring that has been implemented 
in recent years and it continues to reduce 
its cost base to ensure that this will drive 
profit growth as revenue recovers.
Our strategy
Our overall strategy remains unchanged 
but we will have an increased focus upon 
execution. I like to describe our strategy in 
simple terms as being based upon using 
our distinctive technologies and delivery 
capabilities to build global market share 
and increase shareholder value.
Across our businesses we have a number 
of core attributes that should enable us 
to grow faster than the competition:
• Distinctive technologies, including 
software and advanced applications.
• Strong delivery skills, in particular for 
large systems integration projects, 
which can be applied globally.
• A large installed base and exceptional 
customer relationships.
• A proven ability to be effective at 
business development, teaming and 
partnering, the combination of which 
enables us to take advantage of our 
market position.
• A strong balance sheet.
Our core markets remain robust
Each of our divisions is operating in 
industry verticals which have strong 
growth prospects:
• At Invensys Operations Management, 
our core markets of oil, gas and power 
have long-term structural growth due 
to the need for greenfield capacity in the 
developing world, especially India and 
China, and the potential for optimisation 
and efficiency of plant operations, 
particularly at brownfield sites in the 
developed world.
• At Invensys Rail, the global rail 
infrastructure market has long-term 
structural growth due to industrialisation 
and urbanisation in the developing world 
together with capacity needs and 
pressure to reduce carbon footprints in 
the developed world.
• At Invensys Controls, our core markets 
of appliance, commercial and wholesale 
should grow due to the expected 
recovery in Europe and North America 
and consumer aspirations in the 
developing world.
In particular, China and India will 
be important markets for each of 
our divisions and we will be using our 
combined knowledge and experience 
from operating in these countries to 
improve our capabilities and to capture 
growth opportunities.
Mid-term growth catalysts
As part of linking our strategy to our 
execution capabilities, each of our divisions 
has identified mid-term growth catalysts 
on which they intend to focus:
• At Invensys Operations Management, 
the focus will continue to be on 
responding to the significant number 
of large contracts in emerging markets, 
including nuclear power. Advanced 
applications market demand also 
remains strong.
• At Invensys Rail, the global order 
pipeline for large complex rail schemes 
remains robust.
• At Invensys Controls, the opportunity 
to expand the commercial and wholesale 
businesses will allow growth and margin 
expansion.
• Each of the divisions has identified 
suitable bolt-on acquisitions to 
supplement their organic growth.
• We continue to invest in research 
and development to ensure we are 
at the technological forefront of each 
of our industries. 16 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
I intend to reinforce our commitment to 
supporting the principles of economic 
success, environmental stewardship, 
diversity and social responsibility. We have 
programmes in place across the Group to 
ensure that we act as a responsible global 
citizen and these are supported by our 
Code of Conduct which defines how each 
of us acts in our business life.
Our CSR report, which starts on page 28, 
contains a summary of our achievements 
and these are explained in more detail in 
our third Sustainability Report, which 
will be available for download from our 
website. I am especially pleased by the very 
low incidence of injuries to our employees; 
their health and safety remains the highest 
priority. During the year, there were a 
number of incidents of natural disasters 
and civil unrest around the world and our 
teams ensured that all Invensys people 
and their families who were affected 
were helped where needed.
Invensys people
I have inherited a very talented and 
committed group of professionals who 
drive our business on a day-to-day basis. 
We also have the strength in depth that 
will provide us with the flexibility and 
capability to deal effectively with inevitable 
challenges that will arise going forward. 
All of our people have contributed to our 
resilience through the worst recession 
in generations and together they have 
created the strong divisions and corporate 
centre that will drive future growth.
I would like to pay tribute to each of them 
for their efforts and thank them for helping 
to make Invensys what it is today. I look 
forward to working with them to create 
an even better Invensys.

Introduction and summary
The investments made in the businesses 
in recent years, including new product 
development, expanding sales and 
marketing and restructuring programmes, 
have begun to benefit the profit 
performance of the Group. 
We maintained good cash and cost 
management discipline and continued 
to strengthen our financial position. Our 
achievements in this financial year include:
• Cash conversion of 81%, free cash flow 
of £83 million and net cash at 31 March 
2011 of £348 million. The Group remains 
debt free.
• We invested in technology by continued 
spending in research and development 
and, including amortisation, this 
represented 6% of Group revenue.
• Investment continues in new sales and 
project delivery capabilities, particularly 
in emerging markets, to drive future 
growth.
• We continue to manage our UK Main 
Pension Scheme in a way that minimises 
the level of volatility within it. The IAS 19 
accounting measurement has seen a 
reduction in the net liability to 
£467 million (2010: £581 million); our 
cash flows are based on the funding 
valuation and we have reached a 
provisional agreement on the triennial 
review with the trustees that there is 
no change to the deficit funding 
contribution schedule.
• Our earnings and free cash flow have 
allowed us to raise the total dividends 
for the year from 3.0 pence per share 
last year to 4.0 pence per share.
• Underlying earnings per share of 
19.8 pence represents a 48% 
improvement compared with the 
prior year.
• We continue to focus on large 
infrastructure projects in emerging 
markets: 48% of the Group order 
book is now made up of orders to 
emerging markets.
A detailed look at our financial 
performance for the year and financial 
position at the year end is set out in the 
sections that follow.

Exceptional items
The exceptional charge for the year totalled 
£21 million (2010: £25 million). This included 
restructuring costs of £21 million, £10 million 
of asset impairments (intangible assets 
£6 million and property, plant and 
equipment £4 million), offset by a £10 million 
credit of other operating exceptionals. These 
credits comprise a £20 million past service 
credit arising as a result of amendments 
made to the benefits payable under the 
terms of the US Healthcare Plan and a net 
£10 million of costs to settle a legal case.
Restructuring costs comprise the 
integration of the North American and 
European Invensys Controls businesses, 
the global Human Resources Service 
Delivery project, and other rationalisation 
projects across the Group.
The comparative period included 
restructuring costs of £43 million, 
£10 million of asset impairments 
(predominantly property, plant and 
equipment) and a £5 million loss on the 
sale of property, plant and equipment, 
offset by £33 million of other operating 
exceptionals, which comprised £3 million 
of surplus property costs and a gain arising 
from the curtailment of the US defined 
benefit pension plans of £36 million.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs decreased to £5 million 
in the year (2010: £7 million), reflecting 
improved liquidity management.
Taxation
The tax charge for continuing operations 
was £37 million (2010: £26 million), which 
comprises a current year income tax 
charge of £44 million (2010: £39 million), 
offset by prior year credits of £6 million 
(2010: £14 million) and a deferred tax 
credit of £1 million (2010: £1 million 
charge). The Group is subject to several 
factors which affect the tax charge, 
including the levels and mix of profitability 
in different jurisdictions and the availability 
of tax losses.
Discontinued operations
The loss from discontinued operations 
of £7 million (2010: £2 million) relates 
to a net £7 million (2010: £3 million) of 
further provisions in respect of prior 
year disposals, offset by £nil tax 
(2010: £1 million credit).
Net profit
Net profit increased to £178 million 
(2010: £151 million), due to an increase 
in operating profit of £14 million and a 
decrease in the IAS 19 finance charge of 
£23 million, partially offset by an increase 
in the tax charge for the year of £11 million.
Earnings per share
Basic EPS from continuing operations were 
22.4 pence per share (2010: 18.5 pence per 
share). Underlying EPS, which excludes the 
£20 million exceptional past service credit 
on the US Healthcare Plan, were 19.8 pence 
per share (2010: 13.4 pence per share).
Free cash flow
Free cash flow for the year was £83 million 
(2010: £100 million). The reduced free cash 
flow was mainly driven by lower operating 
cash flow, partially offset by lower 
restructuring and taxation payments.

The operating profit increase at Invensys Operations Management and Invensys Controls is mainly due to increased volume, close 
control of overheads and the benefits of restructuring projects.
The results in Invensys Rail were adversely impacted by provisions on three mass transit projects in the first half, but margins recovered 
in the latter part of the year reflecting favourable mix and the closure of contracts.

Total capital (equals total equity) 549 420
Comprising:

— Non-controlling interests 35 80
549 420
Capital is managed under the Group’s 
treasury policy. The policy sets out a 
strategy for the long-term funding of the 
Group, with the objective of ensuring the 
Group has access to appropriate sources 
of funding to support its businesses, as 
and when required. The current capital 
structure supports this approach. The 
Group is currently debt free, but has credit 
facilities in place that provide liquidity for 
the Group until July 2013. The facilities 
are available for utilisation as loans or 
bank guarantees. As at 31 March 2011, 
£254 million was drawn for the provision 
of bank guarantees (2010: £240 million). 
In addition, the Group has £219 million 
(2010: £245 million) of guarantees issued 
under local uncommitted facilities. 
The Group’s cash balances supported 
by the availability of credit facilities allow 
access to adequate capital resources.
Further explanation of the way in which 
the Group manages its capital resources 
is set out in the Financial Policies on 
page 22 and in Note 22 to the Group 
Financial Statements.
Total equity
Total equity increased by £129 million, 
with net profit of £178 million and an IAS 19 
actuarial gain of £30 million, partially 
offset by the £41 million interim distribution 
made to the non-controlling shareholders 
of Baan Company NV (in liquidation) (Baan), 
dividends paid of £28 million and foreign 
exchange translation losses of £20 million.
Non-controlling interests
The balance of non-controlling interests 
was £35 million (2010: £80 million); the 
majority of the opening balance related 
to the interests of the minority in Baan to 
whom there was an interim distribution in 
the year of £41 million.
Net cash
Net cash was £348 million (2010: 
£363 million), with a slightly lower free 
cash flow, an increase in dividends paid 
and the amounts paid for the interim 
distribution to the non-controlling 
shareholders of Baan.
Capital employed
Capital employed increased by 
£144 million to £201 million in the year, 
mainly attributable to the decrease in 
the IAS 19 pension liability in the year 
of £114 million. Capital employed 
includes operating capital of £390 million 
(2010: £366 million), generating a return 
of 49.9% (2010: 48.6%).
Pension liabilities and funding
The IAS 19 net pension liability at 31 March 
2011 was £467 million (2010: £581 million), 
a reduction of £114 million driven by 
employer contributions of £80 million and 
an actuarial gain of £30 million. The latter 
includes an actuarial gain of £88 million 
arising from the change in pension 
indexation from RPI to CPI following 
the change in rules announced by the 
UK Government.
The provisional agreement reached with 
the trustees of the UK Main Pension 
Scheme has produced a funding deficit 
of around £230 million, compared with 
£285 million at 31 March 2008, despite 
slightly more conservative assumptions. 
More importantly, there will be no change 
to the previous deficit funding contribution 
schedule that was agreed with the trustees 
three years ago, which requires us to pay 
£39 million per annum (increasing by 
inflation) to 2017. 
There will be an increase in the funding 
of the US plans to meet the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 
requirements.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 2.5 pence per share (2010: 
2.0 pence per share), resulting in total 
dividends for the year of 4.0 pence per 
share (2010: 3.0 pence per share). 
Summary and conclusions
Performance in the businesses has 
reflected our recent success in expanding 
outside our core markets and we begin 
the new financial year from a position 
of financial strength. We will continue 
to invest in our global growth strategy. 
With increasing activity arising from 
major projects we will remain focussed 
on execution.

Statement of accounting policies
The Group’s Financial Statements 
have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) in issue that are endorsed by the 
European Commission and effective at 
31 March 2011. The Group’s accounting 
policies under IFRSs are set out in the 
accounting policies section in the Group 
Financial Statements on pages 73 to 80. 
The Parent Company Financial Statements 
have been prepared in accordance with 
UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (UK GAAP) and include details 
of the Company’s accounting policies.
Treasury policy
The Group’s treasury policy is approved 
by the Board and seeks to ensure that:
• appropriate financial resources are 
available for the maintenance and 
development of the Group’s divisions;
• the financial risk of currency, interest 
rate and counterparty credit exposure 
is understood, measured and managed 
appropriately; and 
• the Treasury department operates as 
a cost centre and that no speculative 
transactions are undertaken. 
Funding, liquidity and treasury 
management
Operating within the strict controls of 
the Group’s treasury policy, the Treasury 
department manages this financial risk, 
ensuring that sufficient funding and 
liquidity are available to meet the expected 
needs of the Group together with a 
prudent level of headroom to allow for 
cash flow and bank guarantee variability. 
In addition to the free cash flow of the 
Group, Invensys adopts a flexible approach 
to liquidity management using a mixture 
of long-term debt facilities and short-term 
cash deposits. Funding is provided by bank 
facilities which mature in July 2013. The 
undrawn level of these facilities together 
with the Group’s cash balances are the key 
measures of the Group’s liquidity.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to risk arising from 
the effect of changes in floating interest 
rates on the level of interest it receives on 
its cash deposits.
As at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010, 
in line with the Group having a net cash 
position, Invensys had no significant 
borrowings.
Currency risk
Transaction exposure
Currency transaction exposure arises when 
the units face revenue or costs in a currency 
other than their own. The incidence of this 
risk varies across the Group and is subject 
to change. However, the majority of 
revenue and costs will usually be in 
the functional currency of the business 
undertaking the transaction. Where this is 
not the case and the exposure is significant, 
it is the Group’s policy for the units to hedge 
their exposure. The Group predominantly 
uses forward currency contracts to manage 
transaction exposure. The Group is also 
subject to exchange risk when making bids, 
particularly on major contracts, where 
movements against the specific exchange 
rate assumed within a bid would lead to a 
change in the anticipated margin on the 
contract should the bid be successful. 
This exposure to contract risk is hedged 
if significant.
Translation exposure
The majority of the Group’s operating 
capital is employed in overseas locations 
and is denominated in foreign currencies, 
particularly US dollars. As a consequence, 
changes in exchange rates affect both net 
asset values and reported results. This risk 
is not hedged directly but, to the extent 
that the Group has debt, any that is held 
in foreign currencies would reduce the 
level of net assets exposed to currency 
fluctuations. The interest expense related 
to such debt would also reduce the level 
of earnings exposed to exchange rate 
movements.
Credit risk
The Group monitors the identity of the 
counterparties with whom it deposits cash 
and transacts other financial instruments 
so as to control exposure to any territory or 
institution. As far as it is both feasible and 
practical to do so, cash is held centrally by 
the Treasury department. Risk is assessed 
using ratings from major credit rating 
agencies. 
Further information on the risks arising 
from financial instruments is included in 
Note 22 to the Group Financial Statements.

Business Review
Markets
After two difficult years during which 
industrial capital expenditure showed 
significant declines due to the recession, 
some markets have shown a good recovery 
during the year helping to drive a strong 
improvement in divisional performance.
In North America, the market rebounded 
with increased demand in particular 
from the oil and gas sector for services 
and maintenance, measurement and 
instrumentation equipment and brownfield 
upgrades of control and safety systems. 
Our markets in South America and the 
Middle East were strong driven by large 
greenfield projects in the oil and gas 
sector; we have not been significantly 
affected by the current unrest in parts 
of the Middle East.
The Asia Pacific region remained strong 
as countries, in particular India and China, 
continue to expand their power generation 
capacity to meet the demands arising from 
economic growth and urbanisation. The 
large programme of new nuclear power 
station construction in China, where we 
have captured a significant market share 
during the past two years in supplying 
control and safety systems, has not been 
affected by the events at the Fukushima 
nuclear plants in Japan; we continue to 
monitor closely the effect of these events 
upon the expansion and station upgrade 
work in the nuclear sector in China and 
elsewhere.
Our European markets have not yet shown 
the level of recovery seen elsewhere, 
though we do expect some improvement 
in the current year.
Developments
We continue to be recognised by our 
customers for our advanced applications 
technologies and our ability to execute 
the largest and most complex projects 
in our industry.
Advanced applications including 
our Enterprise Control System (ECS)
• We successfully implemented an 
InFusion™ ECS for ExxonMobil 
Lubricants & Specialties Company. 
Installed at ExxonMobil’s lubricants 
plant in Beaumont, Texas, the InFusion 
ECS will help manage the operating 
facility, controlling major processes and 
integrating the existing SAP enterprise 
resource planning, batch process and 
final packaging and shipping systems.
• We signed a five-year contract to deliver 
a comprehensive refinery-wide 
optimisation solution for Thai Oil 
Public Company Limited, one 
of Asia Pacific’s leading refining and 
petrochemical companies. Under 
the terms of the agreement, we will 
implement our SimSci-Esscor ROMeo® 
optimisation software to improve the 
real-time performance of Thai Oil’s 
refinery operations.

Projects featuring control and safety 
systems
• During the year, we signed two project-
based agreements with China Nuclear 
Power Engineering Co. LTD (CNPE) to 
provide safety and distributed control 
systems (DCS) and solutions for four 
nuclear reactors: units 3 and 4 at Fujian 
Fuqing Nuclear Power Plant, two 
1,000MW nuclear power units 
under construction in Fujian province 
in South East China; and two reactors 
at the Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant 
under construction on Hainan Island.
• Invensys Operations Management 
signed a US$12.4 million contract to 
upgrade and modernise a DCS for 
Malaysia Liquefied Natural Gas Sdn. Bhd. 
(MLNG). The major upgrade will provide 
a continuously current DCS and sustain 
the productivity and safety of MLNG’s 
liquefied natural gas operations in 
Bintulu, Sarawak, Malaysia.
• We entered into a contract with 
Bluewater (Glas Dowr) NV, a company 
specialising in the design, development, 
lease and operation of tanker-based 
production and storage systems. 
Invensys Operations Management will 
update the legacy DCS and safety 
systems aboard the Glas Dowr floating 
production, storage and offloading unit, 
which will be operating approximately 
170 kilometres south of the Timor-Leste 
coast in the Timor Sea. We will supply our 
Foxboro® I/A Series® distributed control 
and Triconex® critical control solutions, 
as well as fire and gas detection systems, 
instrumentation, smoke detection 
systems, cabinets and consoles.
In April 2010, we announced the acquisition 
of Skelta Software, a privately held software 
company headquartered in Bangalore, 
India. Skelta Software provides business 
process management and advanced 
workflow software solutions.
Performance
Invensys Operations Management 
produced a strong performance driven 
by a recovery in capital expenditure, 
including the North American oil and 
gas sector, and the ramp-up of work on 
recently won large greenfield projects 
in emerging markets.
Order intake was £1,340 million 
(2010: £1,096 million), up 19% at CER 
with the improvement in industrial 
capital expenditure driving Eurotherm 
and measurement and instrumentation 
equipment and also services and 
maintenance upgrades. In addition, 
we continued to win nuclear projects in 
China and received orders for the control 
and safety systems for four more nuclear 
reactors. The order book at 31 March 2011 
was at record levels at £1,124 million 
(2010: £972 million) with around 60% 
represented by emerging markets 
(2010: 47%). The order pipeline to 
31 March 2014 was £3.9 billion.
Revenue for the year grew strongly 
and was up 12% at CER at £1,147 million 
(2010: £1,000 million), reflecting the benefit 
of the shorter-cycle equipment orders and 
the initial revenue flowing from the recent 
large greenfield orders; revenue from these 
large orders of over £10 million amounted 
to 16% of the division’s revenue in the year 
(2010: 3%). The focus upon advanced 
applications and the maintenance annuity 
revenue during the year also drove 
performance with both revenue streams 
showing strong double-digit growth and 
contributing to margin expansion.
As a result of the increased revenue and 
control of overheads, operating profit 
was up 31% at CER to £123 million (2010: 
£92 million) and operating margin was 
10.7% (2010: 9.2%). Post restructuring 
charges, operating profits were up 84% 
at CER at £123 million (2010: £66 million), 
reflecting the completion of the integration 
of the businesses to form the division.
Operating cash flow was £110 million 
(2010: £147 million) resulting in cash 
conversion of 89% (2010: 160%), in 
line with our medium-term targets 
for the division.

Business Review
Markets
Across the world, the market for rail 
signalling and control systems remained 
strong during the year, with a number 
of drivers across both the developed 
and developing worlds including 
industrialisation, urbanisation, increasing 
capacity needs, and the recognition of 
rail as an environmentally sustainable 
and efficient means of transport and 
a means to reduce carbon footprints.
In the UK, the government announced its 
plans for continued investment in mainline 
and London Underground upgrades, as 
well as committing to finance the Crossrail 
project in London and giving a longer-term 
commitment to high-speed rail. On 
mainline, we won a number of large 
contract awards from Network Rail during 
the year. On the London Underground, we 
have continued to successfully deliver the 
signalling upgrades on the Sub-Surface 
Lines, allowing new rolling stock to enter 
passenger service, and on the Victoria Line. 
When the upgrade to the Victoria Line is 
completed in 2012, it will have delivered 
significantly improved line capacity and 
reduced journey times. While we were 
disappointed not to be selected by 
London Underground as preferred bidder 
for the Sub-Surface Railway resignalling 
project, we continue to focus upon 
international opportunities.
In Spain, we saw an expected slowdown 
in orders as the government implemented 
austerity measures. However, the market 
remains satisfactory with investment in 
metro and light railway declining but with 
Spain remaining committed to finishing its 
world leading high-speed line network.
In Australia, the market remains robust in 
spite of the natural disasters that the 
country has experienced in recent months.
The North American market remains strong 
with rail traffic continuing to grow and an 
increase in US railroad activity expected 
in 2011. In the short to medium term, we 
continue to see significant potential 
opportunities from the introduction of 
positive train control (PTC) systems. 
Whilst we also continue to see significant 
opportunities from proposed North 
American high-speed lines, we do not 
expect this to impact revenue in the 
medium term.
Outside our traditional core markets, 
we are seeing increasing demand in many 
countries, particularly South America, the 
Middle East and Asia, including India and 
China. During the year we entered into 
agreements with a division of CSR, the 
leading Chinese manufacturer of rolling 
stock, and we expect to see this 
relationship produce significant revenue 
over the next few years. In India, we are 
starting to see the benefits from prior 
years’ investment and have begun winning 
an encouraging level of new business.
We expect the rail control market to 
continue to grow with demand driven by a 
satisfactory investment in our core markets 
and significant investment in new markets 
in both mainline, including high-speed 
lines, and mass transit.

Developments
James Drummond will be stepping down 
as Chief Executive of Invensys Rail and 
leaving the Group at the end of June 2011. 
Kevin Riddett, who has been Chief 
Operating Officer of the division since 
November 2010 and was formerly 
President of its US operations, will 
take over as its Chief Executive.
Our strategy of increasing the proportion 
of our revenue outside our traditional 
core markets continues and revenue from 
new markets rose to 22% in 2011 from 
10% in 2010.
Our leading technologies and excellent 
commissioning record are reflected in our 
continued success in gaining new and 
replacement signalling contracts in both 
our core and new markets. The table below 
shows our order intake during the year for 
orders in excess of £10 million. 
Performance
Order intake during the period was 
£558 million (2010: £817 million), down 
32% at CER due primarily to the increasing 
effects of the uneven intake of large orders 
in the industry. However, the order book 
at 31 March 2011 remains robust at 
£1,021 million, with around 44% 
represented by contracts outside our 
traditional core markets. In addition, the 
pipeline of order prospects for the next 
three years remains large at £8.6 billion.
Revenue was up 9% at CER at £772 million 
(2010: £700 million) with growth of around 
150% in new markets offset, as expected, 
by a small decline in revenue in our 
traditional core markets. 
Operating profit fell to £129 million 
(2010: £141 million), a decrease of 8% 
at CER, and operating margin, although 
lower than the prior year which benefited 
from favourable contract commissioning 
in Spain, remained healthy at 16.7% 
(2010: 20.1%). Operating margin for the year 
reflected some provisions for additional 
costs on three mass transit contracts in the 
first half partially offset by the benefit of 
contract completions in the second half.
Operating cash flow was £71 million 
(2010: £98 million), and cash conversion 
was 55% (2010: 70%) as a result of some 
delays in progress payments in Spain 
and South America.

Business Review
Markets
For the past four years, Invensys Controls 
has been successful in managing its 
business despite significant reductions 
in production volumes in the global 
appliance and other markets. During the 
year, we have not seen the major declines 
of recent years; indeed, we have seen some 
stabilisation in demand overall, although 
demand patterns remain unpredictable 
across several segments and geographies.
The North American appliance and 
wholesale markets showed significant 
improvement in the first half of the year 
but this was followed by a decline in the 
second half as a fall in consumer 
confidence was exacerbated by some 
customers reducing inventory in their 
supply chains. However, the North 
American commercial market remained 
robust throughout the year. In Europe, 
the appliance market was broadly flat but 
we saw some good improvements in the 
commercial and wholesale segments. 
South America was down slightly mainly 
due to the ending of tax incentives in Brazil. 
Asia Pacific was also broadly flat.
Developments
The division’s focus upon applying its 
value-engineered solutions to help its 
customers produce the most advanced, 
efficient and consumer-friendly appliances 
and products has been reinforced by the 
creation of a global engineering team. 
This team is working to create common 
global platforms for certain product 
lines, capturing the best technology 
from each of its regions. For example, 
the Hydra Water Valve for the global 
residential washing machine market 
has been launched and has been well 
received by several customers. Other 
product lines, such as refrigerator controls 
and electric range controls, are now being 
developed as global platforms. In another 
segment, we have launched a series of 
environmentally-optimised electronic 
controllers and monitoring system for 
the refrigerated cabinets that are used 
extensively by supermarkets. New 
products accounted for 10% of revenue 
in the year.
As well as capturing the benefits of the 
restructuring activities that have taken 
place over the past three years, the division 
has been working with suppliers to alleviate 
some component shortages, some arising 
as a consequence of the recent earthquake 
in Japan, and actively managing raw 
material supply costs, particularly for 
metals and plastics.
The division recently opened a new 
research and development centre and Asia 
Pacific regional head office in Shanghai. 
This new centre will help drive our value-
engineering strategy and will support 
regional customer design centres.
During the year, we disposed of a 
small European business that produced 
pumps for coffee-making machines 
for a consideration of £5 million. The 
business produced annual revenue and 
operating profit of around £15 million 
and £1 million respectively.
Performance
Invensys Controls produced a resilient 
performance against a backdrop of 
weaker than expected consumer markets 
in the second half of the year. Order 
intake was down 3% at CER at £554 million 
(2010: £560 million), resulting from a higher 
order book at the start of the year in what 
is mainly a short-cycle business. Revenue 
was up 2% at CER at £567 million (2010: 
£543 million), reflecting a strong start 
to the year, a good performance in 
commercial and wholesale, and the 
benefit of a high level of new product 
introductions. This was primarily offset 
by a weaker than expected second 
half of the year, particularly evident in 
North America, as customers adjusted 
their demand as a result of a slowdown 
in consumer demand in the appliance 
segment in the second half.
Operating profit was £56 million 
(2010: £53 million), up 3% at CER with the 
effect of increased revenue and savings 
from restructuring being partially offset 
by raw material price inflation. Operating 
margin was 9.9% (2010: 9.8%).
Again this year, Invensys Controls 
produced strong operating cash flow of 
£74 million (2010: £63 million) as a result 
of tight management of working capital. 
This resulted in a further improvement 
in cash conversion for the year to 132% 
(2010: 119%).

The Invensys Code of Conduct 
and compliance training
The Invensys Code of Conduct both 
describes and represents our commitment 
to responsible business and is the 
foundation of our broader Compliance 
Programme. Under the terms of the Code 
of Conduct, our employees undertake to 
work with integrity as representatives of 
Invensys and in accordance with both local 
law and our own standards of ethical 
behaviour: where the Code of Conduct is 
more exacting than local laws or standards, 
the Code of Conduct must be followed.
The Board is given regular updates 
on compliance issues by the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary. 
The Chief Executive and Group Human 
Resources Director receive regular 
briefings from the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary where any 
concerns can be raised. Legal and ethical 
compliance is recognised as a priority 
for Invensys.
As stated in last year’s Annual Report and 
Accounts, the Code of Conduct is available 
on the Invensys website and can be read by 
any customer, shareholder or member of 
the public. This year Invensys has adopted 
a Supplier Code of Conduct based on our 
Code of Conduct and is having suppliers 
agree to the same (or have in place a similar 
Code of Conduct of their own) as a 
condition for doing business with us.
The Code of Conduct is supported by 
periodic training for all employees and the 
Board. All new employees must complete 
Code of Conduct training within the first 
month of employment. As part of our effort 
to promote the Code of Conduct and our 
Helpline, Invensys has produced a range 
of supporting materials including Helpline 
posters, abridged versions of the Code of 
Conduct and other presentation materials 
which are displayed at Invensys facilities 
and are available on the Invensys intranet.
The Code of Conduct, supporting policies 
and associated training are the core 
elements in the latest iteration of the 
Compliance Programme. During the year, 
we released further training on specific 
areas of compliance, targeted to relevant 
audiences, and also offered refresher 
courses in our Learning Management 
System training in critical areas of the 
Code of Conduct, such as Anti-Bribery 
and Competition Law.
Our sustainability strategy
Sustainability is intrinsic to our operations 
and value propositions: it is important to 
our customers, communities, employees 
and shareholders. We have continued to 
implement our strategy of embedding 
sustainability into our operations. We 
have made progress in reducing our 
environmental footprint, minimising 
waste and increasing efficiency even 
as our business has grown over the 
last year. We updated our supplier 
assessment procedures, and 
communicated our expectations of 
suppliers to conduct business in an 
ethical and responsible manner.
In the UK, Invensys was again listed on 
the FTSE4Good Index Series, which lists 
companies that meet recognised standards 
of corporate responsibility. For the second 
consecutive year, Invensys was listed on 
the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes 
(DJSI) in recognition of our economic, 
environmental and social performance. 
Invensys renewed its participation in 
the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC) and we again reported our 
greenhouse emissions on the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP). More detail 
can be found in our Sustainability Report, 
which will be available on our website.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Invensys is committed to supporting the principles of economic 
success, environmental stewardship, diversity and social 
responsibility. We believe that by acting as a responsible global 
citizen, we will not only help minimise business risk but also 
enhance our reputation as a business partner.

Business Review
Management responsibility, commitment 
and continuous improvement are the keys 
to the success of the Invensys long-term 
strategy. The Invensys Environmental, 
Health, Safety & Sustainability (EHS&S) 
management system consists of defined 
goals and objectives, programmes, 
standards and assessments as well as 
management support and involvement. 
It is designed to be consistent with 
internationally recognised management 
systems standards and is intended to 
define and establish expectations, 
and provide a common base for 
implementation and planning at all of 
our global locations and operations. The 
system enables the Group to anticipate 
and respond to constantly changing 
regulations and risks. Each manager is 
responsible for ensuring that these 
standards are being met or exceeded 
within his or her area of responsibility.
Additionally, we continue to encourage 
our site and regional operations to seek 
external management system certification. 
Presently, six of our operations are 
ISO 14001 certified.
Environmental performance
For the past year, we set a 3% absolute 
reduction target for the environmental KPIs 
at our manufacturing locations: energy use, 
CO2 emissions, water use, non-hazardous 
waste and hazardous waste. Energy use 
and CO2 emissions within our 
manufacturing locations increased by 
7% and 2% respectively, as a result of 
increased production levels across all 
divisions. However, these KPIs increased at 
a rate lower than the rate of overall revenue 
growth. Water consumption decreased 
by 6%, non-hazardous waste generation 
decreased by 2%, and hazardous waste 
generation decreased by 14% due to 
successful efficiency projects and the 
rationalisation of facilities. For the current 
year, we have set a 2% absolute reduction 
target for each of the KPIs.
The Board continues to be briefed on 
Group environmental performance and 
receives monthly reports on any violations 
or environmental releases. In the past year, 
there were no environmental releases. 
During inspections by government 
officials, we received two environmental- 
or compliance-related violations in the 
Americas. One issue required the posting 
of efficiency results near large gas-fired 
boilers and was corrected immediately. 
The other issue required the installation of 
noise abatement measures and corrective 
actions are in progress. In both cases, no 
fines or further notices have been received.
Health and safety in the workplace
Health and safety are intrinsic to our 
operations and our value proposition. 
We are pleased to report continued 
improvements in our health and safety 
performance, as reflected in decreased 
injury/illness incident frequency rates. 
From April 2010 to the end of March 2011, 
our Total Recordable Case Incident Rate 
(TRCIR) fell 14% from 0.21 to 0.18 and our 
Lost Workday Case Incident Rate (LWCIR)
1
 
fell 25% from 0.08 to 0.06. This continues a 
five-year trend in which our TRCIR has fallen 
76% and our LWCIR has fallen 86%. We 
continue to look for ways to improve our 
safety performance and record.

Our Safety and Sustainability Awareness 
Metric (SSAM) is the model we use to drive 
and measure several leading activities at 
an operational level. The SSAM, which is 
measured and reported monthly, includes 
on-time closure of corrective actions, 
near misses, completion of safety training, 
safety tours/inspections and environmental 
KPI improvements. This past year, the 
SSAM was expanded to include a measure 
of the implementation of new EHS&S 
management system standards across 
the business and operations.
Our Chief Executive reviews the health 
and safety performance data, including 
any major incidents, on a monthly basis 
and presents it to the Board. In addition,  
site leaders and management teams 
review each recordable incident to fully 
understand the root causes of accidents 
and ensure adequate corrective actions 
are implemented. We are pleased to 
report that there were no major incidents 
or work-related fatalities during the year. 
During inspections by government officials, 
we received two safety- or compliance-
related citations at locations in the Americas. 
Our location in Marion, US received a 
citation from the US Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (OSHA) and a 
fine of US$4,175 concerning a lack of stop 
controls/guarding on a piece of equipment. 
The other issue was related to fire-fighting 
systems and procedures at a location in 
Brazil. In both cases, corrective actions were 
instituted and no further notices or fines 
have been issued. We are continuing our 
compliance and assurance efforts across the 
organisation and look forward to reporting 
on improved progress in this area next year.
Community and charitable investment
We continue to encourage our divisions 
and employees to engage with good 
causes to build relationships in the 
community and enhance workplace 
morale and cohesiveness. Our businesses 
provide a variety of programmes such as 
matching gifts, sponsorship of activities 
and paid volunteer time to allow our 
employees to participate actively in 
community events.
Invensys Values and leadership 
competencies
We continue to embed the Invensys Values 
of: Innovation, Agility, Integrity, Courage 
and Meritocracy into our organisation. 
Alignment with the Values is considered 
integral to the performance of our 
employees, and the Values are built into 
our performance management processes. 
The key messages of the Invensys brand 
and its values have been clarified and 
made relevant to current and potential 
Invensys employees through an employer 
branding initiative. This is intended to 
create an “I want to work here” culture, and 
retain and attract confident, competent 
and ambitious people to Invensys who are 
drawn to a high-performance work culture.
We have also launched a new set of 
Invensys competencies following 
extensive external benchmarking and 
internal research drawing on inputs from 
over 200 of our own high-performing 
leaders. These new competencies are 
designed to guide behaviours at every 
level of the organisation.
Diversity in the workforce
As a global company with employees 
across the world, Invensys seeks to recruit 
the best individual for every position 
regardless of gender, ethnic or national 
origin, religion, sexual orientation or any 
personal characteristic not relevant to their 
work. Invensys fosters an inclusive culture 
where anyone with the skills and abilities to 
perform is treated fairly. We embrace the 
diversity of our employees, and the greater 
effectiveness a diverse workforce allows 
us to offer our customers. We continue to 
respect and support the principles of the 
European Convention on Human Rights 
and the UNGC by ensuring we comply 
with the labour laws of the countries in 
which we operate and by creating an 
inclusive and respectful culture for our 
diverse workforce. The Group seeks to 
ensure that fair consideration is given 
to applications for employment received 
from people with disabilities and we 
offer continued employment, training 
and advancement where possible to 
employees who are or become 
temporarily or permanently disabled.

Business Review
Dialogue with employee 
representatives and employees
The Invensys European Employees 
Forum (IEEF) promotes dialogue between 
elected employee representatives and 
senior management. The annual meeting 
between IEEF representatives and 
senior management has been running 
for 12 years.
Members of the leadership team 
communicate regularly with employees 
through global activities and local 
communications networks, including 
site-level briefings, smaller, face-to-face 
meetings and employee newsletters.
Invensys has established the use 
of blogging and is exploring social 
networking technologies to facilitate 
fast and open communication between 
employees and to realise the performance 
advantages of sharing knowledge and 
best practices across our divisions.
Developing talent
We continue to focus on growing internal 
capability and enabling internal career 
moves through our Organisational 
Capability Review (OCR) process. This 
process takes place across Invensys, and 
over the past year at a corporate level, has 
led to the creation of robust succession 
plans for over 60 leadership roles. OCR has 
also enabled the identification of nearly 40 
“High Potential” and “High Professionals” 
in our leadership population and over 80 
considered to be “Rising Talent” across the 
Group. Each of these employees has an 
individual development plan and is actively 
supported to achieve their potential.
Aligning individuals with the Group 
to safeguard our future
During the year we used our goal 
deployment and performance 
management tools and processes to 
help our employees to understand the 
organisational goals and objectives of 
Invensys and align them with their own. 
Line managers are required to hold annual 
performance reviews with all employees 
who report to them, where they can discuss 
their performance, set personal objectives 
for the coming year and create personal 
development plans. Approximately 
11,000 employees are participating in 
our online performance management 
processes with goals for 2011/12 on our 
integrated system. Other employees, 
such as those in manufacturing, are 
participating in local performance 
management processes.
Investing for the future with training
Our Learning and Development Centre 
of Expertise (CoE) has become well-
established and, utilising seven languages, 
has this year delivered over 55,000 hours 
of online training across 4,000 learning 
modules. Whilst nearly 300 leaders have 
participated in advanced management and 
leadership training, the CoE has focussed 
increasingly on core Invensys capabilities 
with the launch of a new project 
management curriculum containing over 
60 learning programmes and with over 
400 participants to date. The development 
of success profiles for engineers and sales 
professionals has enabled us to assess the 
competence and development needs of 
over 3,000 of our people.
Employee engagement
We conducted an Invensys-wide Employee 
Engagement Survey in November 2010 
which achieved a response rate of 83%, 
up from 78% in 2008, and pleasingly high 
compared to other similar surveys. The 
results enable us to track improvements 
from prior years and to compare with 
external norms. We are pleased to see our 
employee engagement levels compare 
positively with our global external 
benchmarks. Our business and functional 
teams are now implementing action plans 
created in response to survey feedback.
We continue to strive to make Invensys 
a place where high-performing people 
choose to be, where they can enhance 
their lives and careers and are motivated 
to perform at their best. 32 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Risks and Uncertainties
Each division and global function is 
required to undertake a formal review 
of risks which could impact its area of 
business. Risk registers are maintained and 
reviewed formally on a quarterly basis by 
each division and these are consolidated 
on a Group basis.
The Risk Committee has accountability 
for overseeing the risk management 
processes and procedures, and reports to 
the Board through the Audit Committee 
on the key risks facing the Group.
It also monitors the mitigating actions put in 
place by the relevant operational managers 
to address the identified risks. The risk 
management process is outlined below.

Business Review
Responsibilities and actions
Board
• Responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the significant 
risks it is willing to take in achieving the strategic objectives. This risk 
appetite is largely promulgated across the Group through the Board 
Delegated Authorities.
• Ultimate responsibility for the system of internal control and reviewing 
its effectiveness.
• Approval of the formal review of the risk management framework 
and underlying processes which take account of changes to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
• Consideration of the key risks and their disclosure in the annual report 
and accounts.
Audit Committee
• Receives regular reports on the results of internal and external audits.
• Conducts annual assessment of the Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control.
• Reviews risk management activities and processes.
Risk Committee
•  Formulates strategy and policy based on risk appetite and risk 
exposure.
•  Receives reports from divisions, reviews risk management structures 
and compiles the Group risk register.
•  Prepares reports and recommendations for the Board through the 
Audit Committee.
• Monitors actions to address key risks.
The Risk Committee has introduced improvements to the oversight of 
certain key risks for Invensys including those relating to the management 
of major projects.
Business operations
• Consider existing short-term and long-term risk.
• Consider potential low-frequency, high-impact events.
• Consider new and emerging risks.
• Establish priorities to address and manage risk.
• Regularly prepare and update the divisions’ risk registers.
The crisis response capability has been updated — its importance 
emphasised by different external world events. These plans have worked 
successfully in addressing potential risks to our employees and business 
operations in the Middle East, arising from the recent political events, and 
in Japan following the tragic earthquake and tsunami. 
Risk review process 
Identification
• Key risks are recorded in the risk registers, their likelihood and impact 
assessed, mitigation strategies established and risk owners identified.
• Risks are considered against seven broad categories: strategic; 
people; financial; operational; reputational; environmental; and 
compliance.
Analysis
• Risks are analysed for likelihood and impact to determine exposure 
of the business.
Evaluation
• Risks are reviewed and prioritised against the achievement of 
short-term and long-term business objectives.
Mitigation
•  Actions are identified to minimise, manage or respond to the risks.
Monitoring and control
• Risk action plans are reviewed by the divisions at least quarterly.
•  Serious emerging issues are notified immediately to the Group 
crisis management team.
•  Key risks are reviewed at each Risk Committee meeting.
•  The Audit Committee and the Board review risk on a regular basis.
The Invensys approach has been updated to be consistent with 
ISO 31000, the international risk management standard. 
Risk appetite 
The Board has approved the acceptance of strategy risks which are considered appropriate to achieve the Group’s strategic 
objectives. The degree of risk to be accepted within the business is managed on a day-to-day basis through the Board 
Delegated Authority levels. These provide the framework for informed risk taking within the businesses and the route for 
escalating decision making up to the Board. 
The Board also identifies risks which are inconsistent with the Invensys Code of Conduct and such risks are avoided. 34 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Risks and Uncertainties continued
Description of risk 
Failure to maintain a competitive and technologically advanced product 
range could reduce margins and revenue growth
Invensys operates in highly competitive markets and the Group’s products 
and services are characterised by continually evolving industry standards 
and rapidly changing technology, driven by the demands of the Group’s 
customers. As illustrations of this, Invensys Rail continues to invest in the 
development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) 
and Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) to evolve the capabilities 
to meet the needs of the “Railway of Tomorrow”. Invensys Operations 
Management continues to invest in enhancements to its control and safety 
systems, advanced applications and Enterprise Control System to optimise 
plant performance for our global customers.
Impact
Failure to keep pace with technological 
changes and system or application 
requirements in the industrial sectors may 
result in loss of market share and lower 
margins. Furthermore, delays to development 
programmes may adversely impact the 
delivery of major projects.
Mitigation
The Group invests in research and 
development to develop new technologies and 
products to sustain or improve its competitive 
position. However, all new technologies and 
products involve business risk in terms of 
possible abortive expenditure including asset 
impairments, reputational risk and customer 
claims. The Group reviews its portfolio of 
technologies as part of the strategic planning 
process. In addition, the divisions control 
individual development programmes through 
a regular review process.
The timing and frequency of substantial contract awards are uneven
The revenue of Invensys Rail depends on a small number of large railway 
operators, both in our traditional core markets in the UK, Iberia, North 
America and Australia and in new markets. New contract awards are often 
associated with major transport infrastructure upgrades, and as a result 
are by nature large and infrequent. Invensys Operations Management is 
associated with the supply of technology, software and consulting to the oil 
and gas, chemical and nuclear industries. Capital expenditure requirements 
from customers in these industries are often highly cyclical and linked to the 
international supply, demand and pricing of hydrocarbons. Also the timing 
of new contract awards in the nuclear industry may be impacted if certain 
nuclear programmes are subject to delay or cancellation. 
Impact
The timing of contract awards is uncertain 
and delays in awards may result in volatility in 
the order book and the results. Major projects 
may also impact the business mix because a 
substantial element of the contract may be 
supplied by third parties. In addition, the 
opportunity to develop control and safety 
systems for the nuclear industry may lead 
to an increased dependence on a small 
number of major customers for Invensys 
Operations Management. 
Mitigation
The Group monitors sales activity, sales cover 
in its order book, expected margins and the 
impact of potential delays on the expected 
results to allow appropriate mitigating actions 
to be considered. 
Principal risks
Invensys operates globally in varied 
markets and is affected by a number of 
risks inherent in its activities, not all of 
which are within its control. Some of these 
risks and uncertainties are common to 
other companies, for example: changes in 
economic conditions including currency 
and interest rate fluctuations; changes in 
taxation legislation; the cost of materials; 
the recruitment and retention of skilled 
personnel; the impact of competition; and 
political stability in the countries where we 
operate or undertake contracts. Some of 
these common risks and uncertainties are 
subject to significant change, the impact of 
which may be difficult to predict. This is 
particularly relevant to Invensys with the 
economic and political uncertainty which 
exists in many countries.
The principal risks which are specific to and 
may impact the Group are outlined below. 
In addition, there may be other risks and 
uncertainties which are unknown to the 
Group or which could become material in 
the future. These risks may cause the 
Group’s results to vary materially from 
historic and expected results. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 35
Business Review
Description of risk 
Undertaking large, long-term projects exposes the Group to risk of loss
A significant amount of the Group’s business involves long-term projects 
that can take many months or even years to complete. These projects 
may be subject to delays and cost overruns due to delays in equipment 
deliveries, engineering problems, work stoppages, unanticipated cost 
increases, shortages of materials or skilled labour or other unforeseen 
problems inherent in the nature of such projects. An increasing number 
of projects have been secured in new markets including Asia, South 
America and the Middle East where the execution risks may be greater.
Impact
The Group’s failure to anticipate technical 
problems, estimate costs accurately or control 
delivery may reduce the profitability of such a 
contract or result in a loss.
Mitigation
The Group has established a process with 
clear delegated authorities for the approval 
of major contracts, which includes a review 
system for the approval of bids submitted to 
customers. Contracts with a large monetary 
value or onerous contractual terms require 
Board approval. During the year certain 
execution issues were identified in an export 
contract for Invensys Rail. This has prompted an 
internal review with the result that systems have 
been improved and key risk metrics have been 
established to monitor the execution of all the 
major projects. These are subject to regular 
reporting to the Board. 
The Group may be subject to liability as a result of product liability 
claims
Errors and defects in the Group’s products, systems or applications, which 
may be used in safety-critical applications, could cause injury to persons or 
damage to property and equipment or be the subject of product recalls.
Impact
These occurrences could result in claims, loss 
of revenue, warranty costs, costs and damages 
associated with product recalls, litigation, 
delays in market acceptance or harm to the 
Group’s reputation for safety and quality. 
Mitigation
Each division has an established quality 
control function and, if an event occurs, 
there are processes to investigate and 
manage the occurrence. 
The Group may be exposed to liability through the actions of 
consortium partners, cosource partners or its supply chain
The business activities of the Group are often conducted in conjunction 
with consortium, codevelopment or cosource partners whose day-to-day 
management actions are outside of the control of the Group. A significant 
element of the Group’s risk profile is the delivery performance of its supply 
chain. These partnerships exist across our businesses. The Invensys Rail 
high-speed line contracts are often undertaken with consortium partners 
and the development of wireless solutions for all divisions often rely on 
local or global partnerships.
Impact
Given the nature of the Group’s business mix, 
a quality or other failure in the supply chain 
could present a risk to safety and delivery 
which could have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s business, financial performance 
and/or reputation.
Mitigation
Assessment, mitigation and management of 
these risks are addressed by the divisions in 
conjunction with the Legal, Supply Chain and 
Risk functions. 36 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Risks and Uncertainties continued
Description of risk 
The Group may be exposed to additional liabilities with respect to its UK 
and US pension plans
The UK Main Pension Scheme has a high proportion of pensioners relative 
to its active workforce.
Impact
With respect to both the Group pension plans 
for its UK and US operations, any decline in 
the equity market, improvements in life 
expectancy, changes in expected morbidity 
rates, long periods of low inflation or deflation 
or future decreases in interest rates could 
increase the funding deficit and require 
additional funding contributions in excess 
of those currently expected.
Mitigation
The investment policy has been established 
to address the need to match the scheme 
assets and liabilities as far as is realistically 
possible. The current UK Main Pension Scheme 
deficit funding contribution schedule was 
agreed on the basis of a valuation undertaken 
at 31 March 2008, and anticipates deficit 
recovery contributions being made on a 
six-monthly basis until March 2017. This UK 
deficit funding contribution schedule is likely 
to be unchanged following the valuation 
undertaken at 31 March 2011. There will be an 
increase in the funding of the US plans to meet 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
(ERISA) requirements. In addition to regular 
financial reporting under IAS 19, the Group 
regularly monitors the performance of the 
principal UK and US plans. 
The Group is subject to ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities
As a consequence of the past disposal of a significant number of 
businesses, the Group has certain liabilities in relation to environmental 
claims (including the cost associated with the remediation of contaminated 
sites no longer owned by the Group), disputed taxes, litigation (including 
personal injury claims arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and 
silica), indemnity claims and other disposal costs relating to the disposed 
businesses. These risks have receded over time as warranties and 
indemnities in relation to past disposals have expired, existing disputes 
have been settled and remediation work on contaminated sites has been 
completed. The Group also has environmental liabilities in relation to the 
remediation of vacant sites which it owns.
Impact
All of the aforementioned liabilities are subject 
to a number of uncertainties, assumptions and 
contingencies, and there can be no assurance 
that the liabilities will not be substantially 
higher or become payable sooner than 
anticipated, or that the provisions in the 
Group’s accounts in respect of any such 
liabilities will be sufficient.
Mitigation
The Group continually monitors the remaining 
liabilities and has established key performance 
indicators to support monthly reporting to the 
Board. The indicators include cash spend, 
provisions, insurance recoveries and estimated 
exposures. The Group regularly reviews the 
related provisions and aims in negotiations to 
limit the risk of future liabilities or disputes.  Governance

Respect of the Preparation of the Accounts
Compliance
The Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act), 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the Listing Rules of the 
UK Listing Authority. Ernst & Young LLP has audited the contents of 
the Remuneration Report to the extent required by the Companies 
Act (the tabular information on pages 57 to 60 relating to directors’ 
remuneration and directors’ interests in shares and all share incentive 
plans). The Corporate Governance Report has been prepared in 
accordance with section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in June 
2008 (the Combined Code). The Corporate Governance Report, 
together with the Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 60, describes 
how the principles set out in the Combined Code have been applied. 
The information required to be disclosed by sub-section 2.6 of rule 7 
of the UK Listing Authority Disclosure and Transparency Rules is shown 
in the Directors’ Report on pages 61 and 62 and is incorporated into 
the Corporate Governance Report by reference.
The Board has also considered, in advance of the commencement date, 
the principles and provisions of the new UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the new UK Code) published by the FRC in May 2010. The Board 
has decided to implement certain recommendations under the new 
UK Code for the year under review.
The Invensys Code of Conduct (which is part of the broader 
Compliance Programme) aims to ensure the business acts with 
integrity and complies with all laws.
A printed copy of the Combined Code and the new UK Code can

The Company is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance 
and believes that effective practices 
are essential to business integrity, 
performance and accountability to 
shareholders. The Board recognises 
that governance should be enhanced by 
better interaction between boards and 
shareholders and that to do this, boards 
must think deeply, thoroughly and on a 
continuing basis about their role and 
overall tasks. Key to this is the leadership 
of the Chairman, the support to and from 
the Chief Executive and the culture of 
the Board. 
This section of the Annual Report 
and Accounts sets out the governance 
framework for the Company and, in the 
following pages, we introduce the Board 
of directors, corporate governance 
procedures and Board practices, 
and remuneration policy.

The Company is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance 
and the Board is pleased to confirm 
that during the year the Company has 
been fully compliant with the provisions 
of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the Combined Code) and 
has decided to implement certain 
recommendations under the new UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the new 
UK Code) for the year under review. 
The Board
Role
The Board is collectively responsible for 
promoting the success of the Company by 
directing and supervising the Company’s 
affairs to create shareholder value. The 
Board provides leadership and sets the 
Company’s strategic aims.
Its duties are set out in a formal schedule 
of matters specifically reserved for decision 
by the Board, as summarised below.
Schedule of matters reserved for 
the Board
• Overall management of the Group and 
its long-term objectives, commercial 
strategy and operational planning
• Acquisitions, disposals and other 
transactions outside of delegated limits
• Material changes to the Group’s 
corporate structure
• Approval of financial results and 
dividend policy, and declaration of 
interim and final dividends
• Changes to the Group’s capital structure
• Changes to the Board and other senior 
executive leaders
• Appointment of the Group’s principal 
advisers
• Any major changes to the Group’s 
pension plans
• Approval of the Code of Conduct and 
other Group policies
The governance framework for the Group 
is shown on page 39. Certain decision 
making is delegated through structured 
procedures to committees (as described 
on page 42) and, for operational matters, 
to senior management.
Directors: composition and 
independence
The Board has been chaired by Sir Nigel 
Rudd since 17 July 2009. Ulf Henriksson 
left the Company on 24 March 2011 and 
was succeeded by Wayne Edmunds 
(who had been Chief Financial Officer 
of the Group since 1 June 2009) as Chief 
Executive. David Thomas, who has held 
senior financial roles within the Group 
since 2002, was appointed on 24 March 
2011 as Acting Chief Financial Officer; a 
permanent appointment is to be made in 
due course after consideration of internal 
and external candidates. Mr Thomas has 
not been appointed a statutory director 
but is invited to attend Board meetings 
and committee meetings as appropriate. 
At the date of this report, the Board 
consisted of one executive director and 
six non-executive directors, in addition 
to the Chairman. It has been agreed that 
Deena Mattar will join the Board as a 
non-executive director with effect from 
19 May 2011. The permanent appointment 
to the Chief Financial Officer position will 
also join the Board.
The Board
The Board considers that all of the current 
non-executive directors are independent. 
The non-executive directors are drawn 
from diverse international businesses and, 
as illustrated on pages 38 and 39, bring a 
range of skills and experience to enable 
them to constructively challenge and 
develop the Group’s strategy and 
direction.
Although all the directors have an equal 
responsibility for the operations of 
Invensys, the role of the non-executive 
directors is particularly important in 
ensuring that the strategy and business 
proposals of the executive management 
team are fully debated, to ensure that 
they meet the long-term interests of 
shareholders and also take account of 
issues affecting employees, customers, 
suppliers and the many communities 
with which Invensys interacts.
The Senior Independent Director is 
Michael Parker, who has held this role 
since December 2006. Mr Parker, as the 
Senior Independent Director, is available 
for shareholders to contact and is also 
responsible for leading the Chairman’s 
annual performance evaluation.
Executive directors are not permitted to 
hold more than one external non-executive 
directorship, which is in line with the 
Combined Code requirement and assists 
in broadening their experience for the 
benefit of the Company. The new Chief 
Executive, Mr Edmunds, does not hold 
any external non-executive directorships.

Governance
Chairman and Chief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive, which is defined in writing and 
approved by the Board. The Chairman is 
responsible for leadership of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness. He facilitates the 
contribution of the non-executive directors 
and effective communication with 
shareholders. He ensures that constructive 
relations exist between the executive and 
non-executive directors. The Chief Executive 
is responsible for executing the strategy 
approved by the Board for leadership of the 
Group and management of the business; he 
is supported by the Group Leadership Team, 
as detailed in the governance framework on 
page 39.
Meetings
There is an agreed schedule of Board and 
committee meetings. The table on page 40 
sets out the attendance by directors at 
Board and committee meetings. This 
analysis only includes the committee 
members’ attendance at meetings; in 
addition to members, other directors 
frequently attend meetings of committees 
at the invitation of the respective 
committee chairman. There were also 
informal meetings of the Chairman and 
the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors being present.
To increase the interaction of business 
leaders with the Board, the Chairman 
agreed with the directors that the divisional 
CEOs should be invited to join Board 
meetings on a rotational basis.
Election and re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association 
require that any director appointed during 
the year should stand for election at the 
first Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
following their appointment. In addition, 
the Articles of Association require that 
one third of all directors shall retire at each 
AGM and that all directors must seek 
re-election at least once every three years. 
The new UK Code, applicable in respect 
of the Company’s financial year beginning 
1 April 2011, recommends that all directors 
should seek re-election by shareholders 
annually. The Board has agreed to 
implement this provision with immediate 
effect and following the evaluation of 
performance of each director, it is 
proposing that all directors stand for 
re-election at the AGM on 28 July 2011. 
In addition, Deena Mattar, who will join 
the Board on 19 May 2011, will stand for 
election at the AGM.
Bay Green, non-executive director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee has 
now completed a six-year term. In line 
with the Combined Code, the Nominating 
Committee undertook a rigorous review 
and concluded that Mr Green has a range 
of skills which adds value to the Board. As 
a result, they recommended to the Board 
that his appointment be extended and 
that he continue as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee.
The biographies of all directors are set out 
on pages 38 and 39.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is Victoria Hull, 
who is also Group General Counsel. She 
was appointed as Company Secretary 
on 1 January 2006 and acts as secretary 
to all of the committees of the Board. 
The Company Secretary is accountable 
to the Board and advises on corporate 
governance matters. She ensures that the 
Board receives briefings on changes in 
regulation and law, and that procedures are 
followed. To enable the Board to perform 
its duties, all directors have full and timely 
access to all relevant information and to the 
services of the Company Secretary. The 
appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is decided upon by the Board as 
a whole.
Performance evaluation
The Board has a formal review process that 
covers an evaluation of the performance 
of the Board and its committees, and an 
appraisal of the performance of individual 
directors (including the Chairman). In 
respect of the individual evaluations, all 
members of the Board are asked to assess 
themselves and provide feedback on 
other directors. The evaluations are led 
as indicated below.

Chairman Senior Independent

Chairman and

The individual evaluations focussed on 
the effectiveness of the contributions 
made by individual directors and reviewed 
directors’ training and development needs. 
The Board is satisfied that each director is 
committed to his role.
For the evaluation of the Board and 
its committees, directors are required 
to complete a questionnaire and 
provide comments on procedures 
and effectiveness. The process involves 
assessment by reference to the relevant 
roles and responsibilities under review, 
the terms of reference of the committees, 
and best practice. Results of the evaluation 
provide a basis for the continuing 
improvement in the Board’s procedures, 
action plans and objectives for the 
subsequent year.
The results of the evaluation were 
presented to the Board and, in summary, 
it is satisfied that the Board and its 
committees remain effective. The Board 
agreed for the following year to develop 
further a number of processes to enhance 
effectiveness.
In light of the provision in the new UK 
Code which recommends that FTSE 350 
companies have externally-facilitated 
board evaluations at least every three 
years, the Board recognises the value this 
may add and has agreed that an external 
evaluation will be conducted in 2012.
Induction and development
On appointment, new directors receive 
an induction programme tailored to their 
specific requirements based on their 
experience. The objective is to provide 
directors with a combination of selected 
written information and the opportunity 
to visit business sites and meet with key 
leaders of the Group. Accordingly, an 
induction programme is being developed 
for Deena Mattar.
The continuing development of the 
directors, collectively and individually, is 
effected through a number of channels. 
Directors receive regular briefings at Board 
meetings which are relevant to their role. 
These include developments in governance 
matters, regulatory updates and legislative 
changes, for example, the UK Bribery Act 
and the new UK Code. 42 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
As part of the Board programme at least 
one meeting is held offsite at a Group 
business location so that directors can 
increase their understanding of the 
business activity. During 2010/11, the 
Board visited the Invensys Engineering 
Excellence Centre in Egypt, a key part of 
the Invensys strategy for the Middle East 
and global engineering efforts.
Independent professional advisers are 
made available in order for directors to 
discuss matters of significance to the 
Group, and directors are encouraged 
to attend external briefings. The Board 
ensures that directors have access to 
independent professional advice on 
how to discharge their responsibilities 
as directors of the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
In line with the Companies Act 2006, 
directors are required to avoid any 
situation in which they have or can have 
a direct or indirect interest that conflicts 
or may possibly conflict with the interests 
of the Company, unless authorised by 
the Board. The Company’s Articles of 
Association allow the Board to authorise 
such conflicts and to impose such limits 
or conditions as it deems necessary. There 
is no breach of duty if the relevant matter 
has been authorised in advance.
The Company has established a procedure 
whereby actual and potential conflicts of 
interest are reviewed regularly and in any 
event annually. Appropriate authorisation 
is required prior to the appointment of any 
new director and when any new conflict 
arises for a director or there is a change 
in circumstances that may affect an 
authorisation previously given. 
Authorisations are granted by those 
directors who have no interest in the 
matter being considered and are recorded 
by the Company Secretary in the Register 
of Directors’ Conflicts. Where there is a 
conflict, the Board will confirm whether any 
conditions should be imposed under the 
terms of the authorisation.
During the year the Board considers the 
procedure was operated effectively.
Board committees
The Board delegates specific authorities 
to its Audit Committee, Remuneration 
Committee, Nominating Committee and 
Contracts Committee, all of which operate 
within defined terms of reference. Board 
committees are authorised to engage 
the services of external advisers as 
circumstances require, at the Company’s 
expense. Reports of the Board committees 
are set out from this page to page 45. 
Directors receive copies of all committee 
minutes and the chairman of each 
committee provides an update on matters 
of significance at the Board meeting 
following the committee meeting.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is 
at all times given a high priority, and a 
number of means are used to promote 
greater understanding and dialogue with 
the investment community. The Board 
receives regular reports from the Chief 
Executive and the Group’s Investor 
Relations team. The Chairman and the 
Senior Independent Director are available 
to meet with major shareholders on 
request. During the year, the Chairman 
spoke with a number of major shareholders 
regarding corporate governance and 
remuneration matters. In addition, the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
met with major shareholders to discuss 
matters relating to the Company’s 
remuneration policy.
Shareholders are kept informed of the 
progress of the Group during the course 
of the year through half-year and full-year 
results, statements and presentations, 
interim management statements, capital 
markets days and other announcements of 
material developments that are released 
through the London Stock Exchange and 
other news services. The results 
presentations made to the investment 
community are webcast and copies of 
supporting materials are made available 
on the Group’s website. The executive 
director(s) maintain regular dialogue with 
the major institutional shareholders and 
participate in sector conferences. 
Shareholders can also raise questions 
directly with the Company at any time by 
contacting the Investor Relations team, 
whose contact details are listed on the 
Group’s website.
The annual report and accounts are 
made available to shareholders at least 
20 working days prior to the AGM. 
Directors are available at the AGM to 
answer questions, which provides a useful 
interface with private shareholders. 
Shareholders also have an opportunity 
to meet informally with directors after 
the meeting. Resolutions are proposed 
separately and voting is conducted by polls 
at general meetings, and voting results 
are announced through the London Stock 
Exchange. The results and proxy levels are 
also available on the Group’s website and 
on request from the Company Secretary. 
The Company is permitted under its 
Articles of Association to send or supply 
communications to shareholders 
electronically, and the Company now 
supplies information such as notices of

Responsibilities of the Audit Committee Activities during the year
Monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
Financial Statements and reviewing 
significant financial reporting issues 
and accounting policies
The Audit Committee reviewed the financial disclosures in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts 
and half-year financial report prior to their publication. This included a review of the accounting 
policies and financial reporting judgements. It also reviewed the contents of the interim 
management statements issued by the Company.
Reviewing the Group’s systems of 
internal control and risk management, 
and monitoring the effectiveness of 
the internal audit function
In accordance with the Combined Code, Turnbull 2005 guidance and on behalf of the Board, the 
Audit Committee undertook an annual assessment of the Group’s system of risk management 
and internal control. Included in the assessment were:
•  consideration of the key risks facing the divisions as part of the review of the Group’s strategic 
planning and annual operating planning processes, and the review of reports from the 
Risk Committee;
•  review of the enhancements to the overall control environment;
•  consideration of the key elements of the Group’s control processes, including organisational 
structure, the application of governance rules and systems, information management (including 
monthly reporting routines) and risk management activities;
•  reports received from both internal and external audit during the course of the year;
•  review of the operations and effectiveness of internal audit and receipt of regular reports 
on projects undertaken; and
•  the findings from the annual self-assessment questionnaire, which requires all senior managers, 
from reporting unit level upwards, to certify compliance with the Group’s financial and 
operational procedures and controls, including environmental, health and safety matters and the 
Invensys Code of Conduct.
The Audit Committee monitored the Group’s whistle-blowing programme as set out on page 47.
Making recommendations to the Board on 
the appointment, remuneration and terms 
of engagement (including non-audit 
services) of the external auditor
The Audit Committee recommended to the Board the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP at the 
2011 AGM. The basis of recommendation to the Board for the reappointment is described below.
The external audit plan and fee proposal were approved, along with the terms of engagement 
for the year.
The Audit Committee also agreed the policy on auditor independence and provision of 
non-audit services.
Review annually its terms of reference The terms of reference were revised to reflect the recommendations in the new UK Code.

performance of the Audit Committee

Governance
Other activities of the Audit Committee
In addition to carrying out the activities 
necessary to discharge its standing 
responsibilities, the Audit Committee also 
received reports from management and 
the internal and external auditors on a 
number of other matters during the year. 
These included the findings of a detailed 
review of major contracts; an assessment of 
the Group’s structure and its legal entities 
leading to development of a three-year 
rationalisation programme; and a review 
of the application of the Group’s policy 
on the use of agents.
External auditor
Appointment
Ernst & Young LLP has been the 
Company’s auditor since October 1999, 
following the merger of Siebe and BTR 
in February 1999. The Audit Committee 
assesses annually the qualification, 
expertise, resources and independence 
of the auditor and the effectiveness of 
the audit process. The assessment as to 
effectiveness is conducted through an 
external audit questionnaire with senior 
finance management. The Audit 
Committee remains satisfied with 
these aspects of the audit service.
Consistent with market practice, Ernst & 
Young LLP’s audit services to the Group 
are provided annually through terms of 
engagement which are reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. These terms do not 
include any contractual obligations under 
which the directors would be prevented 
from appointing a different firm.
Following consideration of these matters at 
a meeting of the Audit Committee in May 
2011, a unanimous recommendation was 
made to the Board for the reappointment 
of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s 
external auditor to be proposed to 
shareholders at the 2011 AGM. The Audit 
Committee makes an assessment from 
time-to-time on whether there would be 
any benefit from a change in auditor 
or a competitive tendering process. Taking 
into account also the disruption to the 
finance team in organising a tender 
process, the last assessment concluded 
that the Audit Committee remained 
satisfied with the services provided by 
Ernst & Young LLP and could not see any 
cost benefit of retendering at this time.
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee has guidelines to 
ensure that the independence of Ernst & 
Young LLP , as the auditor of the Group’s 
Financial Statements, is not impaired by 
providing non-audit services. They identify 
the non-audit services for which the use 
of the external auditor is permitted and 
those from which the external auditor 
is prohibited from providing. The 
engagements for non-audit services that 
are not prohibited are subject to formal 
approval based on the level of fees involved, 
with some services being covered by a 
pre-approval process with a quarterly 
monetary cap.
During the year ended 31 March 2011, 
these guidelines have been consistent with 
those recommended in the FRC’s Guidance 
on Audit Committees 2008. In December 
2010, the FRC issued an updated version 
of its Guidance which contained revised 
recommendations in relation to non-audit 
services. The following disclosures reflect 
the recommendations contained in the 
revised Guidance to the extent that they 
have already been applied by the Audit 
Committee in the year ended 31 March 
2011. The Audit Committee’s guidelines 
are fully aligned with the revised Guidance. 
The Audit Committee keeps these 
guidelines under review.
In respect of such non-audit services, the 
Audit Committee takes into account the 
cost-effectiveness of the firm and their 
knowledge of the Group. Ernst & Young 
LLP are engaged to provide a non-audit 
service only when they are a suitable 
supplier of the service. The services and 
fees are reported to the Audit Committee 
on a regular basis.
Non-audit services that are pre-approved 
are either routine in nature with a fee that 
is not significant in the context of the audit 
or are audit related services. Audit related 
services typically include reviews of interim 
financial information, reporting on 
regulatory returns and extended work on 
financial information or financial controls.
Non-audit services that require specific 
approval from the Audit Committee before 
they are contracted to Ernst & Young LLP 
are those that are either not audit related 
services, or for which the fee is significant 
in the context of the audit or for which the 
terms and conditions are unusual.
Principal non-audit services approved by 
the Audit Committee in 2010/11 were:
• Global tax compliance
  Ernst & Young LLP has been appointed 
to provide global tax compliance 
services for a three-year period from 
1 April 2010. This covers most countries 
in which Invensys operates. These 
services were previously provided by 
various major global accounting firms 
and local accounting firms or the 
in-house finance functions. A global 
arrangement with a single major firm was 
considered to provide consistent quality 
across the Group, improved coordination 
and oversight, increased focus on risk 
management and additional value-
added services as part of the compliance 
process. While other suppliers were 
considered, no formal tender process 
was undertaken. A decision was taken 
to appoint Ernst & Young LLP due to 
several factors including their extensive 
knowledge of the Group and, as a result, 
the low level of risk on transition from the 
existing service providers.
• Legal entity rationalisation programme
  Ernst & Young LLP has provided services 
in support of a programme to reduce the 
number of legal entities in the Group in 
order to simplify the Group’s structure 
and reduce operating costs. Other 
potential suppliers of these services were 
also considered. Ernst & Young LLP was 
selected because of their knowledge 
of the Group which, it was concluded, 
would minimise duplication of effort 
and cost. 46 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Corporate Governance continued
The services provided by Ernst & Young 
LLP in connection with this project 
include analysing the entities targeted 
for elimination; providing advice and 
recommendations on the steps required 
to implement the elimination; and where 
necessary, providing detailed local country 
advice on the tax consequences for each 
jurisdiction. Once advice on elimination 
has been provided, Ernst & Young LLP may 
(where possible) advise on the execution 
of the elimination of the entities, which 
may involve them acting as liquidators.
The provision of these services is not 
considered to impair Ernst & Young LLP’s 
objectivity or independence as external 
auditor.
Ernst & Young LLP has policies and 
procedures in place to ensure that 
the highest standards of objectivity, 
independence and integrity are 
maintained and these comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. The audit 
engagement partner must approve any 
non-audit services offered to the Group. 
This ensures that the objectives of the 
proposed engagement are not inconsistent 
with the objectives of the audit; allows the 
identification and assessment of any 
related threats to Ernst & Young LLP’s 
objectivity; and assesses the effectiveness 
of available safeguards to eliminate such 
threats or reduce them to an acceptable 
level. Ernst & Young LLP do not carry out 
non-audit services where no satisfactory 
safeguards exist.
Ernst & Young LLP is excluded from 
undertaking any work that is considered to 
threaten its independence or objectivity in 
its role as external auditor. In identifying 
such work, the Audit Committee takes 
account of the guidance in APB Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. Most commonly 
this includes any work that would involve 
Ernst & Young LLP in preparing financial 
information that is included or disclosed 
in the audited financial statements, or in 
making judgments or taking decisions on 
behalf of management.
Details of the amounts paid to Ernst & 
Young LLP as external auditor during 
the year for audit and other services are 
set out in Note 5 to the Group Financial 
Statements.
It is recognised that the level of fees 
for non-audit services is relatively high 
compared to audit fees. However, the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that its policies and 
procedures as explained above ensure 
that the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to 
provide these services is appropriate and 
does not impair their independence or 
objectivity as external auditor.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Group has comprehensive planning 
and financial reporting procedures. 
Management prepares detailed 
operational budgets for the year ahead 
and a three-year strategic plan, which are 
reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Performance is monitored through the 
monthly reporting of financial results and 
regular updating of forecasts for the year. 
The Group Accounting Policies Manual is 
used by all businesses in the Group to 
ensure that transactions and balances are 
recognised and measured in accordance 
with the Group’s prescribed accounting 
policies. All businesses submit their results 
using the Group’s consolidation system, 
which ensures that information is gathered 
and presented in a consistent way that 
facilitates the production of the 
consolidated financial statements.
Internal control
The directors are responsible for the 
establishment and maintenance of an 
effective system of internal control. Each 
of the Group’s divisions is accountable to 
the Chief Executive and is managed by 
executive leadership, which provides 
day-to-day control over the divisions’ 
operations within the strategic guidelines 
and delegated authorities determined by 
the Board. The internal control system is 
designed to meet the Group’s particular 
needs and the risks to which it is exposed, 
but it should be appreciated that, however 
effective a system of internal control is, 
it can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The findings of the annual assessment 
of the Group’s system of internal controls 
undertaken by the Audit Committee, as 
detailed on page 44, were presented to 
the Board. Where weaknesses in the 
operation of internal controls were 
identified, the Audit Committee considered 
management’s response to them. The Audit 
Committee paid particular consideration to 
the management of customer contracts 
and received detailed reports on major 
contracts from management and the 
external auditor. Areas for improvement 
were identified and actions are in hand to 
improve the relevant control procedures. 
The Board is satisfied that the information 
that it received throughout the year on 
internal controls and the information from 
the annual assessment on internal controls 
was sufficient to enable it to review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls.
Risk management
The Board has responsibility for 
determining the nature and extent of 
the significant risks it is willing to take in 
achieving the strategic objectives and 
has established a structured approach 
to identifying, evaluating, managing, 
monitoring, and reporting on key risks 
facing the Group.
The Risk Committee has accountability 
for overseeing the risk management 
processes and procedures, and provides 
written reports to the Board and the Audit 
Committee on the key risks facing the 
Group. It formulates strategy and policy 
based on risk appetite and risk exposure. 
It also monitors the mitigating actions 
put in place by the relevant operational 
managers to address the identified risks. 
The role of the Risk Committee is more 
fully described on pages 32 and 33 and 
the risk management process is outlined 
on page 32. The Board reviews annually the 
risk management process and periodically 
conducts external reviews. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 47
Governance
During the year, the Risk Committee 
recommended the adoption of a risk 
management policy which codified some 
existing practices across the Group and 
also proposed enhancements to recognise 
the desire of the Board to be progressive in 
developing its risk management strategy. 
This policy was approved by the Audit 
Committee and has created a framework to 
allow management to take business risks in 
pursuit of shareholder value in a systematic 
and controlled manner.
The Risk Committee has also introduced 
improvements to the oversight of certain 
key risks for Invensys, including that relating 
to the management of major projects. 
Risk Committee meetings are minuted 
and disclosed to the Audit Committee.
A summary of the principal risks facing the 
Group is presented on pages 34 to 36.
Internal audit
Internal Audit has a direct reporting line 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
and its responsibilities include the 
examination and evaluation of the scope 
and effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control. The audit plan is 
constructed to cover Invensys globally over 
a four–year cycle, with a degree of tailoring 
to address specific risk concerns. During 
the year, Internal Audit reported regularly 
to the Audit Committee on its assessment 
of internal control issues arising in the 
course of its internal audit reviews of the 
Group’s operations. As detailed earlier in 
this report, the Audit Committee provides 
a consolidated review to assist the Board 
in undertaking its own annual review of 
internal control.
In light of the changing nature of the 
Group’s business, the geographic spread 
of operations and the need for certain 
specialist audit resources (e.g. IT), the 
majority of internal audit work is 
outsourced to Deloitte LLP. A small Internal 
Audit function, reporting to the Acting 
Chief Financial Officer, has been retained 
to manage the outsourcing contract and 
undertake certain ad hoc assignments.
Whistle-blowing
The Audit Committee reviews 
arrangements under which employees 
can, on a confidential basis, raise concerns 
about potential irregularities, and the 
arrangements for follow-up actions. The 
Helpline is operated by Global Compliance 
Services Inc, an independent company, 
and is publicised to employees through the 
Invensys Code of Conduct. There has been 
increased communication of the Helpline 
during the year to ensure employees are 
aware of the facility.
Any investigations are initiated at 
the direction of the Vice President of 
Compliance and any material investigations 
are brought to the immediate attention of 
the Board. A regular report of allegations 
is presented to the Board at each meeting 
and follow-up actions are reviewed. 
Statistics on the volume and general nature 
of calls are reported annually to the Audit 
Committee and the Board. In addition, 
employees can raise concerns through 
other means such as electronic or postal 
mail sent to the Board or management, 
which correspondence is investigated 
in the same manner as concerns raised 
through the Helpline.
The Board receives formal written updates 
on compliance issues regularly at Board 
meetings from the Group General Counsel. 
No material issues were reported through 
these processes during the year.

2 Remuneration strategy and policy
Strategy
The	 Company’s	 remuneration	 strategy	 is	 to	
provide	 packages	 that:
•	 	a lign	 executive	 remuneration	 with	
shareholders’	 interests;
•	 	r emunerate	 the	 executive	 directors	
and senior	 managers	 at	 a	 level	 and	 in	
a manner	 that	 is	 capable	 of	 attracting,	
retaining	 and	 motivating	 high-calibre	
people;
•	 	en courage	 a	 high-performance	 culture	
that	 links	 executive	 remuneration	 to	 the	
performance	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 the	
individual;	 and
•	 	a ppropriately	 balance	 risk	 and	 reward.
Policy
The	 Committee’s	 policy	 is	 to	 provide	
competitive	 remuneration	 for	 the	 delivery	
of	 target	 performance,	 while	 rewarding	
exceptional	 personal	 and	 Company	
performance	 with	 upper	 quartile	 levels	 	
of	 remuneration.	 The	 Committee	 believes	
that	 the	 total	 reward	 package	 provides	 a	
good	 balance	 between	 the	 achievement	 	
of	 annual	 and	 long-term	 targets.	
In	 setting	 the	 remuneration	 policy,	 the	
Committee	 is	 cognisant	 of	 the	 need	 to	
balance	 risk	 with	 reward,	 and	 during	
2009/10	 conducted	 an	 internal	 review	 of	
the	 risk	 considerations	 in	 reward	 practices.	
The	 Committee	 remains	 satisfied	 that	 the	
balance	 between	 risk	 and	 executive	 reward	
across	 the	 Group	 is	 appropriate.	 The	
Committee	 will	 consider	 risk	 each	 year	 and	
has	 discretion	 to	 adjust	 any	 financial	
outturns	 for	 incentive	 purposes	 if	 it	
considers	 that	 disproportionate	 risk	 has	
been	 taken	 to	 deliver	 performance	 targets.
The	 key	 elements	 of	 the	 Company’s	
remuneration	 policy	 are	 described	 in	
detail below.	 A	 high	 proportion	 of	
executive	 director	 total	 reward	 is	
performance-related	 variable	
remuneration,	 as	 indicated	 in	 the	
chart below.

Base salary
The	 Committee	 determines	 the	 level	 of	
base	 salary	 for	 each	 executive	 director	
annually.	 For	 2010/11,	 base	 salaries	 were	
set	 within	 a	 market-competitive	 range	
based	 on	 analysis	 of	 salaries	 paid	 in	 FTSE	
350	 companies	 and	 taking	 into	 account	 the	
relative	 complexity,	 international	 scope	
and	 size	 of	 comparator	 companies.	 For	
2011/12,	 the	 Committee	 commissioned	
a full	 total	 remuneration	 benchmarking	
report	 from	 Kepler	 Associates	 which	
provided	 relevant	 comparator	 pay	 analyses	
across	 a	 range	 of	 international	 companies	
which	 compete	 with	 the	 Group	 and	 also	
benchmarked	 pay	 against	 FTSE	 companies	
of	 similar	 market	 capitalisation	 and/or	
revenue.	 The	 Committee	 additionally	
considers	 specific	 factors	 relating	 to	
the individual	 (including	 personal	
performance),	 internal	 relativities,	 wage	
inflation	 elsewhere	 in	 the	 Group,	 and	
overall	 affordability.	 In	 determining	 base	
salary,	 the	 Committee	 is	 mindful	 of	 the	 pay	
and	 conditions	 of	 employees	 in	 the	 rest	 of	
the	 Group	 and	 has	 received	 relevant	 data	
from	 the	 Head	 of	 Human	 Resources	 to	
support	 its	 decisions.	 In	 establishing	
individual	 salary	 levels,	 the	 Committee	 is	
conscious	 that	 it	 should	 pay	 no	 more	 than	
is necessary	 to	 retain	 and	 motivate	 the	
executive,	 while	 ensuring	 business	
objectives	 are	 fulfilled.	 There	 is	 no	
automatic	 annual	 base	 salary	 adjustment	
in respect	 of inflation.
The	 Committee	 took	 into	 account	 the	
factors	 above	 in	 determining	 the	 salary	 of	
the	 new	 Chief	 Executive	 (Wayne	 Edmunds).	
With	 effect	 from	 24	 March	 2011	 (his	 date	 of	
appointment	 which	 superseded	 the normal	
review	 date	 of	 1	 April),	 his	 base	 salary	 was	
set	 at	 £650,000	 (for	 2010/11,	 as Chief	
Financial	 Officer,	 his	 base	 salary	 was	
£425,000).	 The	 Committee	 considers	
this base	 salary	 level	 necessary	 and	
appropriate	 to	 meet	 its objective	 of	
incentivising	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 and	
maintaining	 competitive	 pay	 levels.	 The	
next	 review	 date	 for	 the	 Chief	 Executive’s	
base	 salary	 will	 be 1 April	 2012.

Annual incentive arrangements
Performance-related	 bonuses	 may	 be	 paid	
to	 executive	 directors	 and	 senior	 leaders	
under	 the	 Executive	 Bonus	 Plan.	 This	 plan	
provides	 annual	 incentives	 to	 encourage	
the	 achievement	 of	 pre-defined	 annual	
financial	 objectives	 and	 personal	 targets	
(commencing	 2011/12	 for executive	
directors)	 to	 focus	 on	 the	 most	 critical	
measures	 of	 business	 success,	 while	
rewarding	 them	 for	 outstanding	
performance.	 In	 this	 way,	 the Executive	
Bonus	 Plan	 seeks	 to	 align	 the interests	 of	
shareholders	 and	 those	 participating	 in	 it.
For	 2010/11	 and	 2011/12,	 the	 Committee	
approved	 the	 following	 performance	
calibration	 for	 the	 Executive	 Bonus	 Plan:
Threshold
10%	 of
target	
payout	
Target
100%	 of
target	
payout
Stretch
150%	 of
target	
payout
Super-stretch
200%	 of
target	
payout
The	 executive	 directors’	 bonus	 payment	 for	
target	 performance	 is	 100%	 of	 base	 salary,	
resulting	 in	 a	 maximum	 bonus	 opportunity	
for	 the	 achievement	 of	 super-stretch	
performance	 of	 200%	 of	 base	 salary	 for	
2010/11	 and	 2011/12.
Executive Bonus Plan 2010/11
The	 targets	 for	 executive	 directors	 for	
2010/11	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 table	 below:	
Underlying EPS
50%	
Free cash flow
50%
The	 bonuses	 paid	 to	 the	 executive	
directors	 (including	 the	 former	 Chief	
Executive)	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 year	 under	
review	 are	 set	 out	 on	 page	 57.	 In	 line	 with	
the	 Executive	 Bonus	 Plan	 rules,	 the	 salary	
used	 for	 bonus	 calculation	 purposes	 is	
the salary	 effective	 from	 1	 April	 2010	
(adjusted	 for	 any	 promotion	 increases).	
In respect	 of	 2010/11	 actual	 performance,	
the bonus	 payments	 reflect	 the	 fact	 that	
the underlying	 EPS	 as	 measured	 fell	
between	 the	 target	 and	 the	 stretch	 levels	
of performance	 and	 free	 cash	 flow	
performance	 was	 between	 stretch	 and	
super-stretch	 levels.	 Taking	 account	 of	 the	
impact	 of	 certain	 exceptional	 items,	 the	
Committee	 determined	 that	 the	 aggregate	
outturn	 was	 a	 bonus	 payment	 of 159.4%	 of	
the	 target.	
Bonus	 in	 excess	 of	 100%	 of	 target	
(i.e. 100% of	 base	 salary	 for	 executive	
directors)	 for	 members	 of	 the	 GLT	 is	 paid	
in deferred	 shares	 (in	 accordance	 with	 the	
Deferred	 Share	 Plan),	 which	 are	 transferred	
to	 the	 individual	 after	 three	 years	 (executive	
directors)	 or	 two	 years	 (other	 relevant	
executives).	 The	 deferred	 shares	 to	 be	
awarded	 to	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 for	 2010/11	
will	 be	 equivalent	 to	 59.4%	 of	 target.	
Having	 rigorously	 reviewed	 the	 results	
achieved	 against	 the	 performance	 targets	
set	 for	 2010/11,	 the	 Committee	 is	 satisfied	
that	 the	 targets	 set	 were	 challenging	 and	
that	 the	 bonuses	 awarded	 reflected	 the	
level	 of	 financial	 performance	 in	 the	 current	
economic	 environment.	
Executive Bonus Plan 2011/12
The	 Committee	 reviewed	 the	 structure	 of	
the	 executive	 directors’	 Executive	 Bonus	
Plan	 for	 2011/12	 and	 decided	 to introduce	
a personal	 element	 of	 performance.	 The	
tables	 below	 set	 out	 the	 performance	
measure	 structures	 for	 the	 prior	 year	
comparator	 and	 2011/12.

The	 Committee	 Chairman	 informed	 the	
Company’s	 major	 shareholders	 of	 the	
introduction	 of	 the	 personal	 performance	
element	 for	 2011/12.	 The	 Committee	 will	
determine	 any	 payment	 under	 the	 personal	
performance	 element	 after	 a	 robust	 review	
of	 individual	 and	 business	 performance	
against	 pre-determined	 objectives.	 The	
Committee	 believes	 that	 this	 change	 will	
improve	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Executive	
Bonus	 Plan	 and	 further	 improve	 the	 link	
between	 pay	 and	 performance	 for	
executive	 directors.
The	 Committee	 has	 carefully	 reviewed	
the financial	 targets	 to	 be	 applied	 for	 the	
Executive	 Bonus	 Plan	 for	 2011/12	 and	
is of the	 opinion	 that	 they	 are	 set	 at	 an	
appropriately	 stretching	 level.	 Bonus	
payments	 may	 also	 be	 influenced	 through	
the	 exercise	 of	 discretion	 by	 the	 Committee.	
As	 in	 the	 prior	 year,	 any	 bonus	 earned	 in	
excess	 of	 target	 by	 the	 GLT	 will	 be	 paid	 in	
deferred	 shares	 as	 set	 out	 above.	 Deferred	
shares	 are	 only	 forfeitable	 in	 the	 event	 of	
dismissal	 for	 cause.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The	 2007	 LTIP	 was	 approved	 by	
shareholders	 at	 the	 2007	 AGM	 and	 since	
then	 the	 Company	 has	 made	 annual	
awards	 under	 this	 plan.	 A	 separate	 award	
was	 implemented	 for	 the	 former	 Chief	
Executive	 in	 2007	 as	 outlined	 on	 page	 60.	
The	 maximum	 annual	 award	 level	 for	
executive	 directors	 and	 other	 participants	
is	 normally	 200%	 of	 base	 salary,	 although	
the	 Committee	 has	 discretion	 to	 make	
awards	 in	 excess	 of	 this	 level	 in	 exceptional	
circumstances.	 The	 Committee	 elected	
to make	 an	 award	 of	 300%	 of	 base	 salary	
to Wayne	 Edmunds	 in	 relation	 to	 his	
appointment	 as	 Chief	 Executive	 as	
detailed on	 page	 52.
Vesting	 of	 awards	 is	 based	 on	 meeting	
stretching	 performance	 targets	 over	 a	
three-year	 performance	 period	 and,	
subject	 to	 meeting	 all	 relevant	 conditions,	
shares	 will	 normally	 be	 released	 to	
participants	 as	 soon	 as	 possible	 following	
the	 third	 anniversary	 of	 the	 award.	 The	
satisfaction	 of	 all	 performance	 targets	
is subject	 to	 external	 verification.	
Performance	 targets	 for	 2010/11	 and	
2011/12	 are	 set	 out	 on	 the	 opposite	 page.	
For	 2011/12	 a	 new	 TSR	 vesting	 schedule	
was adopted.	 The	 advantage	 of	 the	 new	
TSR	 vesting	 schedule	 is	 that	 the	 outturn	
is based	 on	 determination	 of	 actual	
median and	 upper	 quartile	 performance.	
The	 proposed	 new	 TSR	 calibration	
methodology	 is	 no	 more	 beneficial	 to	
participants	 than	 the	 former	 approach	 but	
the	 Committee	 believes	 that	 calculating	
TSR	 on	 this	 basis	 is simpler	 and	 more	
transparent.	 The	 Committee	 Chairman	
informed	 the	 Company’s	 major	
shareholders	 of	 this	 change.
For	 the	 2011/12	 award,	 the	 Committee	
again	 considered	 all	 relevant	 factors	 and	
determined	 that	 the	 EPS	 part	 of	 the	 award	
continued	 to	 provide	 a	 focus	 on	 delivering	
stretching	 internal	 financial	 targets.	 In	 the	
opinion	 of	 the	 Committee	 these	 targets	
are appropriately	 stretching.

The	 Committee	 will	 in	 all	 cases	 retain	
discretion	 to	 ensure	 that,	 as	 a	 condition	 for	
the	 vesting	 of	 shares,	 the	 underlying	 overall	
performance	 of	 the	 Company	 has	 been	
satisfactory.	 Factors	 that	 will	 be	 taken	 into	
account	 will	 include	 EPS	 growth	 and	 the	
Group’s	 cash	 position.	 Vested	 awards	 will	
include	 an	 additional	 number	 of	 shares	
representing	 the	 value	 of	 any	 dividends	
that	 would	 have	 been	 paid	 on	 those	 vested	
shares	 had	 they	 been	 held	 throughout	 the	
vesting	 period.	 The	 performance	
conditions	 do	 not	 apply	 to	 30%	 of	 an	 award	
for	 participants	 below	 executive	 director	
level.	 This	 is	 to	 address	 specific	 recruitment	
and	 retention	 issues	 facing	 the	 Group.	
If	 a	 participant	 is	 dismissed	 for	 cause	
before	 shares	 are	 released,	 they	 will	 be	
forfeited.	 If	 a	 participant’s	 employment	
ceases	 due	 to	 ill-health,	 disability	 or	 any	
other	 reason	 determined	 at	 the	 discretion	
of	 the	 Committee,	 other	 than	 dismissal	 for	
cause,	 performance	 will	 be	 measured	 at	
the	 normal	 vesting	 date.	 The	 award	 will	
then	 be	 pro	 rated	 based	 on	 the	 period	
of service,	 save	 that	 the	 Committee	 may	
moderate	 the	 application	 of	 the	 pro	 rata	
reduction	 if	 it	 considers	 that	 the	
participant’s	 contribution	 to	 the	 business	
would	 not	 be	 properly	 recognised	 if	 the	
award	 was	 scaled	 down.	 The	 Committee	
has	 discretion	 to	 accelerate	 vesting	 in	
compassionate	 circumstances.	
In	 the	 event	 of	 a	 change	 of	 control	 during	
the	 performance	 period,	 performance	 will	
be	 measured	 at	 the	 latest	 possible	 date	
before	 the	 change	 of	 control	 takes	 place	 to	
determine	 the	 proportion	 vesting	 based	 on	
performance.	 The	 proportion	 of	 the	 award	
that	 may	 be	 released	 will	 then	 be	 time	 pro	
rated.	 Subject	 to	 performance	 conditions,	
the	 Committee	 has	 discretion	 to	 disapply	
the	 impact	 of	 time	 pro	 rating	 and	 to	 permit	
up	 to	 100%	 of	 awards	 to	 vest	 on	 a	 change	
of	 control	 if,	 due	 to	 exceptional	 business	
circumstances	 (to	 be	 assessed	 by	 the	
Committee),	 returns	 to	 shareholders	 are	
considered	 to	 be	 at	 a	 superior	 level.
2011 Award to Chief Executive
Related	 to	 his	 appointment	 as	 Chief	
Executive,	 Mr	 Edmunds	 will	 be	 granted	
an exceptional	 LTIP	 award	 in	 2011	 of	 an	
additional	 100%	 of	 base	 salary	 (i.e. 300%	 in	
total)	 as	 permitted	 by	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 2007	
LTIP	 (reverting	 to	 the	 normal	 award	 level	
of 200%	 of	 base	 salary	 in	 later	 years).	 This	
exceptional	 2007	 LTIP	 award	 was	 agreed	 by	
the	 Committee	 after	 careful	 consideration	
of	 the	 lock-in	 provided	 by	 existing	 2007	
LTIP	 awards	 and	 the	 need	 to	 incentivise	
the new	 Chief	 Executive	 to	 lead	 Invensys	
through	 the	 next	 stage	 of	 its	 development.
2008 Award under the 2007 LTIP
For	 awards	 granted	 under	 the	 2007	 LTIP	
in 2008	 (2008	 Award)	 the	 performance	
condition	 was	 measured	 over	 the	 three-
year	 period	 to	 31	 March	 2011.	 While	 the	
2008	 Award	 will	 not	 vest	 until	 the	 third	
anniversary	 of	 the	 date	 of	 grant,	 the	
Committee	 has	 considered	 the	 extent	
to which	 the	 criteria	 have	 been	 achieved.	
For executive	 directors,	 with	 regard	 to	
the TSR	 part	 of	 the	 2008	 Award	 (50%),	 the	
Committee	 has	 considered	 the	 Company’s	
comparative	 TSR	 performance	 analysis	
(provided	 by	 an	 independent	 third	 party)	
and	 determined	 that	 all	 of	 the	 shares	 will	
be available	 to	 vest	 on	 the	 third	 anniversary	
of	 the	 date	 of	 grant.	 With	 regard	 to	 the	
EPS part	 of	 the	 2008	 Award	 (50%),	 after	
considering	 the	 2010/11	 audited	 financial	
results,	 the	 Committee	 has	 determined	
that	 the	 threshold	 level	 of	 underlying	
EPS CAGR	 required	 for	 vesting	 was	 not	
achieved.	 Such shares	 subject	 to	 the	
underlying	 EPS performance	 condition	 will	
lapse.	 Therefore,	 in	 aggregate,	 50%	 of	 the	
2008	 Award	 to	 executive	 directors	 will	 vest.	
It	 should	 be	 noted	 that	 the	 2008	 Award	 to	
Wayne	 Edmunds	 was	 made	 at	 a	 time	 when	
he	 was	 CFO	 of	 Invensys	 Process	 Systems,	
before	 his	 promotion	 to	 Chief	 Financial	
Officer	 in	 June	 2009.	 Therefore,	
performance	 conditions	 do	 not	 apply	
to 30%	 of	 his	 2008	 Award	 and	 the	
aggregate	 vesting	 is	 65%.

Other benefits
Other	 benefits	 provided	 for	 executive

certain	 third-party	 fees	 incurred	 for	 UK	
and US	 tax	 filings	 and	 relevant	 immigration	
matters.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The	 Company	 operates	 its	 RSP	 to	 grant	
executive	 leaders	 (other	 than	 executive	
directors)	 restricted	 share	 awards,	 	
nominal/nil	 price	 options	 or	 cash	 awards	
over	 Invensys	 shares.	 Release	 of	 shares	
is generally	 subject	 to	 continued	
employment	 at	 the	 relevant	 date,	 although	
shares	 may	 be	 released	 early	 in	 defined	
good	 leaver	 cases	 or	 for	 any	 other	 reason	
at	 the	 discretion	 of	 the	 Committee.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme
The	 Company	 operates	 its	 Savings	 Related	
Share	 Option	 Scheme	 in	 the	 UK	 and	 certain	
other	 countries.	 Participants	 are	 granted	
an option	 to	 purchase	 Invensys	 shares	 at	
a discounted	 price	 set	 at	 the	 date	 of	
invitation,	 using	 the	 proceeds	 of	 a savings	
account	 to which	 they	 make	 monthly	
contributions	 (of up	 to	 £250)	 for	 a	 three-year	
period.	 Executive	 directors	 are	 eligible	 to	
participate	 in	 the	 Scheme,	 which operates	
in	 the	 UK	 within	 specific	 tax	 legislation.	
The Scheme	 is	 not	 subject	 to	 performance	
conditions.	 A	 grant	 was	 made	 under	 the	
Scheme	 in	 2009/10	 and	 a	 further	 invitation	
will	 be	 extended	 to	 employees	 in	 2011/12.
Dilution limits
The	 Company	 has	 at	 all	 times	 complied	
with	 the	 dilution	 limits	 set	 out	 in	 the	 rules	
of its	 share	 plans	 (principally	 a	 limit	 of	
10% in	 10	 years).	 In	 the	 10-year	 period	 to	
31 March	 2011,	 awards	 made	 under	 the	
Company’s	 share	 schemes	 represented	
3.9%	 (2010:	 3.8%)	 of	 the	 Company’s	 issued	
ordinary	 share	 capital.	 Shares	 to	 satisfy	 the	
deferred	 share	 element	 of	 the	 Executive	
Bonus	 Plan	 and	 the	 RSP	 are	 purchased	
in the	 market	 and	 therefore	 do	 not	 count	
towards	 the	 dilution	 limits.
Share Ownership Guidelines
Executives	 are	 required	 to	 build	 up	 and	
maintain	 a	 shareholding	 over	 time	 under	
the	 Share	 Ownership	 Guidelines.	 Under	
the	 guidelines,	 executives	 should	 retain	 at	
least	 50%	 of	 the	 shares	 (100%	 of	 shares	 for	
executive	 directors)	 vesting	 under	 any	 of	
the	 executive	 share	 incentive	 plans	 or	 the	
payment	 of	 annual	 incentives	 in	 shares

External directorships
The	 executive	 directors	 are	 permitted	
to hold	 not	 more	 than	 one	 external	
non-executive	 directorship	 in	 order	 to	
broaden	 their	 experience	 for	 the	 benefit	
of the	 Company.	 Such	 appointments	 are	
subject	 to	 approval	 by	 the	 Board,	 and	 the	
director	 may	 retain	 any	 fees	 paid	 in	 respect	
of	 such	 a	 directorship.	 Mr	 Henriksson,	 the	
former	 Chief	 Executive,	 joined	 the	 board	
of Hexagon	 AB	 as	 a	 non-executive	 director	
in	 2007,	 from	 which	 he	 retained	 the	 fees	
payable	 of	 SEK	 350,000	 (approximately	
£34,000)	 for	 the	 period	 1	 April	 2010	 to

Service contracts
Policy
The	 new	 UK	 Code	 and	 guidelines	 issued	
by institutional	 investors	 recommend	 that	
notice	 periods	 of	 no	 more	 than	 12	 months	
be	 set	 as	 an	 objective	 for	 executive	
directors	 and	 that	 any	 payments	 to	 a	
departing	 executive	 director	 should	 be	
determined	 having	 full	 regard	 to	 the	 duty	
of	 mitigation,	 other	 than	 in	 the	 case	 of	
termination	 for	 cause	 or	 where	 a	 contract	
contains	 specific	 termination	 payment	
provisons.	 It	 is	 the	 Company’s	 policy	 to	
achieve	 these	 objectives	 wherever	
possible.	 It	 is	 the	 Company’s	 intention	 that	
new	 executive	 service	 contracts	 contain	
provisions	 allowing	 the	 Company	 to	
terminate	 employment	 by	 making	 a	
payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	 and	 allowing	
contractual	 offset	 for	 future	 earnings.

Specific contracts
Set	 out	 below	 is	 a	 summary	 of	 the	 main	
provisions	 of	 the	 service	 contract	 of	 the	
Chief	 Executive:
Director Wayne	 Edmunds
Date of contract 17	 May	 2011
Notice period 12	 months
Other	 than	 in	 the	 case	 of	 summary	 termination,	
the	 Company	 may	 terminate	 Mr	 Edmunds’	
service	 contract	 by	 making	 a	 payment	 in	 lieu	
of notice	 equal	 to	 the	 value	 of	 the	 base	 salary	
and	 contractual	 benefits	 Mr	 Edmunds	 would	
have	 received	 during	 his	 notice	 period.	 Any	
payment	 due	 under	 those	 provisions	 may	 be	
made	 to	 him	 in	 equal	 monthly	 instalments	 and	
the	 Company	 may	 reduce	 the	 payment	 by	 50%	
if	 Mr	 Edmunds	 obtains	 alternative	 employment.	
Mr	 Edmunds’	 service	 contract	 entitles	 him,	 in	
the	 event	 of	 a	 material	 adverse	 change	 to	 his	
title,	 responsibilities	 or	 status	 following	 a	
change	 of	 control	 of	 the	 Company,	 to	 terminate	
his	 employment	 and	 receive	 a	 payment	 equal	
to	 the	 payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice.
Payments to a former director
Mr	 Henriksson,	 who	 left	 the	 Company	
on 24 March	 2011,	 was	 engaged	 under	 a	
service	 contract	 dated	 28	 April	 2004,	 which	
contained	 a	 12-month	 notice	 period.	 Other	
than	 in	 the	 case	 of	 summary	 termination,	
the Company	 had	 the	 right	 to	 terminate	
Mr Henriksson’s	 service	 contract	 by	 making	
a	 payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	 equal	 to	 the	 value	
of	 his	 base	 salary	 and	 contractual	 benefits	
during	 his	 notice	 period.	 On	 termination	
of his	 employment	 the	 Company	 made	 a	
payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	 of	 £1,154,000	 in	
accordance	 with	 his	 service	 contract,	
and agreed	 to	 reimburse	 relocation	 costs	
of up to	 £50,000	 (plus	 tax	 thereon)	 if	
Mr Henriksson	 relocates	 to	 the	 US	 within	
12 months	 of	 leaving	 the	 Group.	 The	
Company	 had	 the	 right	 either	 to	 pay	 the	
amount	 due	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	 as	 a	 single	
lump sum	 or	 to	 pay	 the	 first	 six	 months’	
worth	 on	 departure	 and	 then	 on	 a	
phased basis	 at	 six-monthly	 intervals	 with	
appropriate	 reduction	 in	 the	 event	 that	 he	
found	 alternative	 employment.	 Payment	
was	 made	 to	 Mr Henriksson	 as	 a	 single	 lump	
sum.	 Under	 the	 terms	 of	 his	 service	 contract,	
Mr Henriksson	 was	 also	 entitled,	 in	 the	 event	
of	 a	 material	 adverse	 change	 to	 his	 title,	
responsibilities	 or	 status	 following	 a	 change	
of	 control	 of	 the	 Company,	 to	 terminate	 his	
employment	 and	 receive	 a	 payment	 equal	
to	 the	 payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice.	
Mr	 Henriksson	 was	 eligible	 for	 a	 full-year	
bonus	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 2010/11	 financial	
year.	 The	 Committee	 agreed	 to	 the	
preservation	 of	 certain	 share	 awards	 and	
options	 held	 by Mr	 Henriksson	 as	 set	 out	
in the	 tables	 on	 pages	 58	 to	 60.	 	
During	 Mr	 Henriksson’s	 employment,	
as a result	 of	 the	 Company	 recharging	
a proportion	 of	 his	 employment	 costs	 to	
the US	 businesses,	 Mr	 Henriksson	 incurred	
both US	 and	 UK	 tax	 liabilities	 in	 respect	 of	
his	 employment	 duties	 undertaken	 in	 the	
US	 in	 2008.	 Deloitte	 LLP	 advised	 Invensys	
that	 the	 UK	 tax	 liabilities	 paid	 by	
Mr Henriksson	 in	 respect	 of	 such	 duties	
should	 be	 refunded	 to	 him	 by	 HM	 Revenue	
and	 Customs	 (HMRC).	 However,	 such	 refund	
was	 delayed	 pending	 a	 determination	 by	
the	 US	 and	 UK tax	 authorities	 of	 the	 relevant	
treaty	 provisions.	 In	 view	 of	 the	 material	
prejudice	 suffered	 by	 Mr	 Henriksson	 as	 a	
result	 of	 this temporary	 double	 taxation,	
Invensys	 Systems	 Inc	 advanced	 £546,000	
to Mr Henriksson	 in	 2009/10,	 being	 an	
amount equal	 to	 the	 refund	 due	 from	
HMRC.	 The refund	 was	 released	 by	 HMRC in	
June	 2010	 and	 subsequently	 Mr Henriksson	
repaid	 his	 loan	 to	 Invensys	 Systems	 Inc.
A	 similar	 situation	 arose	 in	 2009/10,	 as	
Mr Henriksson	 incurred	 both	 US	 and	 UK	
tax liabilities	 in	 respect	 of	 his	 employment	
duties	 undertaken	 for	 the	 Company	 in	 the	
US	 in	 2009.	 The	 amount	 of	 temporary	
double	 taxation	 suffered	 by	 Mr	 Henriksson	
and	 paid	 by	 him	 was	 £312,691	 in	 relation	
to 2009/10,	 and	 Invensys	 Systems	 Inc	
advanced	 a	 subsequent	 loan	 to	
Mr Henriksson	 equal	 to	 this	 amount.	
The loan	 will	 be	 repayable	 to	 Invensys	
Systems	 Inc	 on	 HMRC	 refunding	 the	
amount to	 Mr Henriksson.	 Mr Henriksson’s	
repayment	 obligations	 are not	 affected	
by the	 termination	 of	 his	 employment	
with the Company.
3 Chairman and non-executive directors
Chairman’s appointment, terms and fee
Sir	 Nigel	 Rudd,	 who	 was	 appointed	 a	
non-executive	 director	 and	 Deputy	
Chairman	 on	 1	 January	 2009,	 was	
appointed	 Chairman	 on	 17	 July	 2009.	 The	
terms	 of	 Sir	 Nigel	 Rudd’s	 appointment	 are	
set	 out	 in	 a	 contract	 dated	 3	 December	
2008	 which	 requires,	 except	 in	 the	 case	 of	
dismissal	 for	 cause,	 12	 months’	 notice	 by	
either	 party.	 On	 early	 termination,	 at	 the	
request	 of	 the	 Company,	 any	 compensation	
will	 be	 subject	 to	 mitigation.
Sir	 Nigel	 Rudd	 spends,	 on	 average,	 two	
days	 per	 week	 in	 his	 role	 as	 Chairman.	
From	 the	 commencement	 of	 the	
chairmanship,	 the	 Company	 agreed	 to	
fund	 the	 cost	 of	 a	 car	 and	 driver	 based	
on two	 fifths	 of	 the	 annualised	 cost	 of	
the provision	 of	 such	 services.	
On	 appointment	 as	 Chairman,	 Sir	 Nigel	
Rudd’s	 fee	 increased	 from	 £150,000	 per	
annum	 to	 £270,000	 per	 annum.	 He	 also	
elected	 to	 participate	 in	 the	 same	
arrangement	 as	 the	 other	 non-executive	
directors,	 whereby	 £8,000	 of	 his	 fee	 per	
annum	 is	 paid	 in	 shares.
The	 Committee	 is	 responsible	 for	
reviewing	 the	 Chairman’s	 fee.	 The	
Chairman	 is	 not	 involved	 in	 any	 decision	
on his	 own	 remuneration.	 The	 fees	
currently	 paid	 to	 the	 Chairman	 and	 the	
other	 non-executive	 directors	 are	 subject

Non-executive directors’ appointments, 
terms and fees
Non-executive	 directors	 serve	 the	
Company	 under	 letters	 of	 appointment	
that	 do	 not	 contain	 any	 notice	 period.	 All	
non-executive	 directors	 (including	 the	
Chairman)	 are	 appointed	 under	 the	
Company’s	 Articles	 of	 Association,	 which	
require	 that	 one	 third	 of	 all	 directors	
(including	 executive	 directors)	 shall	 retire	 at	
each	 AGM	 but	 that	 all	 directors	 must	 seek	
re-election	 at	 least	 once	 every	 three	 years.	
The	 new	 UK	 Code,	 applicable	 in	 respect	 of	
the	 Company’s	 financial	 year	 beginning	
1 April	 2011,	 recommends	 that	 all	 directors	
should	 seek	 re-election	 by	 shareholders	
annually.	 The	 Board	 has	 agreed	 to	
implement	 this	 provision	 with	 effect	 from	
the	 AGM	 to	 be	 held	 on	 28	 July	 2011.
Non-executive	 directors	 do	 not	 participate	
in	 any	 bonus	 or	 performance-related	 plans	
or	 any	 of	 the	 Group’s	 share	 incentive,	 plans	
or	 pension	 schemes.	 Appointments	 of	
non-executive	 directors	 are	 terminable	
without	 payment	 or	 compensation	 by	
either	 the	 Company	 or	 director	 giving	
written	 notice.
Fees	 for	 non-executive	 directors	 other	
than the	 Chairman	 are	 determined	 by	 a	
committee	 of	 the	 Board	 comprising	 the	
Chairman	 and	 the	 executive	 directors.	
They are	 subject	 to	 the	 limits	 set	 out	 in	 the	
Articles	 of	 Association	 and	 are	 determined	
taking	 account	 of	 time	 commitments	 and	
responsibilities,	 together	 with	 comparative	
market	 rates	 and	 benchmarking	 data.	
During	 the	 year	 the	 fee	 structure	 for	 the	
non-executive	 directors	 was	 a	 basic	 fee	
of £52,000	 per	 annum,	 inclusive	 of	 £8,000	
paid	 in	 shares	 to	 help	 align	 the	 interests	 of	
the	 non-executive	 directors	 with	 those	 of	
shareholders.	 Each	 non-executive	 director	
commits	 to	 retain	 their	 shares	 for	 the	
period	 of	 their	 directorship.	 The	
remuneration	 table	 on	 page	 57	 includes	
that	 part	 of	 the	 fee	 used	 to	 purchase	
shares,	 and	 the	 shares	 are	 included	 in	
Directors’	 Interests,	 also	 on page	 57.
Additional	 payments	 of	 £14,000	 and	
£10,000	 are	 paid	 to	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	
Audit	 Committee	 and	 to	 the	 Chairman	 of	
the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 respectively.	
An	 additional	 fee	 of	 £10,000	 is	 paid	 to	 the	
Senior	 Independent	 Director	 to	 recognise	
the	 responsibilities	 that	 he	 undertakes.

Notes
1	 	 Sir 	 Nigel	 Rudd	 was	 appointed	 on	 1	 January	 2009	 as	 Deputy	 Chairman	 and	 became	 Chairman	 on	 17	 July	 2009.	 His	 emoluments	 for	 2009/10	 combine	 the	 relevant	 pro	 rata	
fees	 at	 the	 Deputy	 Chairman	 and	 Chairman	 level.
2	 	 Mr 	 Edmunds	 was	 appointed	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer	 on	 1	 June	 2009	 and	 his	 director’s	 emoluments	 for	 2009/10	 relate	 to	 the	 period	 from	 this	 date	 to	 31	 March	 2010.	 On	
24 March	 2011	 he	 was	 appointed	 Chief	 Executive	 and	 his	 emoluments	 for	 2010/11	 combine	 the	 relevant	 pro	 rata	 payments	 as	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer	 and	 Chief	 Executive.
3	 	 Mr 	 Henriksson	 stepped	 down	 as	 Chief	 Executive	 and	 as	 a	 director	 of	 the	 Company	 on	 24	 March	 2011	 and	 therefore	 his	 emoluments	 for	 2010/11	 relate	 to	 the	 period	
from	 1 April	 2010	 to	 this	 date	 (other	 than	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 bonus	 payment	 which	 has	 been	 paid	 in	 full	 for	 the	 year).	 The	 Company	 made	 a	 payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	
of	 £1,154,000	 in	 accordance	 with	 his	 service	 contract.	 In	 addition,	 the	 Company	 has	 agreed	 to reimburse	 relocation	 costs	 of	 up	 to	 £50,000	 (plus	 tax	 thereon)	 if	
Mr Henriksson	 relocates	 to	 the	 US	 within	 12	 months	 of	 leaving	 the	 Group.
4	 	 The 	 emoluments	 of	 the	 highest-paid	 director,	 Mr	 Henriksson,	 were	 £3,726,222	 relating	 to	 the	 period	 1	 April	 2010	 until	 he	 left	 the	 Company	 (2010:	 £2,464,365).
5	 	 The 	 fee	 structure	 for	 the	 non-executive	 directors	 (including	 the	 Chairman)	 includes	 £8,000	 per	 annum	 which,	 after	 tax,	 is	 used	 to	 buy	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	
for each	 non-executive	 director	 as	 described	 on	 pages	 55	 and	 56.	 The	 shares	 purchased	 on	 their	 behalf	 are	 included	 in	 Directors’	 Interests	 set	 out	 below.
6	 	 Taxable 	 and	 other	 benefits	 comprise	 items	 such	 as	 cash	 allowances	 in	 lieu	 of	 a	 company	 car,	 life	 assurance/permanent	 health	 insurance	 and	 private	 medical	 insurance.	
All	 executive	 directors	 are	 entitled	 to	 such	 benefits.	 In	 relation	 to	 Mr	 Henriksson,	 for	 2010/11	 the	 Company	 paid,	 on	 a	 grossed-up	 basis,	 certain	 third-party	 fees	 incurred	
for	 UK	 and	 US	 tax	 filings,	 and	 a	 notional	 interest	 charge	 on	 the	 loan	 made	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 US	 and	 UK	 temporary	 double	 taxation.	 The	 benefits	 stated	 for	 Mr Henriksson	
include	 £60,000	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 estimated	 value	 of	 non-business	 use	 of	 a	 company	 driver	 and	 car/fuel	 benefits.	 Any	 such	 usage	 potentially	 gives	 rise	 to	 a	 taxable	
benefit	 and,	 pending	 agreement	 with	 HM	 Revenue	 &	 Customs	 as	 to	 the	 basis	 of	 an	 apportionment,	 it	 is	 not	 possible	 to	 quantify	 this	 benefit	 with	 precision	 in	 respect	 of	
the	 current	 year	 and	 potentially	 prior	 periods.	 Appropriate	 disclosure	 will	 be	 made	 in	 next	 year’s	 remuneration	 report	 as	 to	 the	 amount	 of	 any	 benefit	 that	 is	 determined	
to	 arise,	 and	 the	 Board	 will	 in	 due	 course	 consider	 how	 any	 tax	 liability	 arising	 should	 be	 settled.	 In	 respect	 of	 Mr Edmunds,	 the	 benefits	 for	 2010/11	 included	 £3,705	
relating	 to	 fees	 incurred	 for	 UK	 and	 US	 tax	 filings.
7	 	 For 	 2010/11	 an	 amount	 of	 £255,020	 will	 be	 awarded	 as	 deferred	 shares	 to	 Mr	 Edmunds	 being	 the	 amount	 due	 in	 excess	 of	 target	 bonus,	 the	 vesting	 of	 which	 is	 deferred	
for	 a period	 of	 three	 years.	 All	 of	 Mr	 Henriksson’s	 payment	 will	 be	 made	 in	 cash	 (net	 of	 tax)	 rather	 than	 any	 element	 being	 awarded	 in	 deferred	 shares.	 Details	 of deferred	
shares	 awarded	 in	 prior	 years	 are	 set	 out	 on	 page	 59.

Notes
1	 The 	 conditional	 awards	 shown	 in	 the	 table	 are	 the	 maximum	 number	 (excluding	 shares	 representing	 accrued	 dividends)	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 that	 can	 vest	 subject	 to	
satisfaction	 of	 the	 relevant	 financial	 performance	 conditions.
2	 Following 	 consideration	 of	 the	 performance	 conditions,	 the	 Committee	 has	 determined	 that	 the	 TSR	 portion	 of	 the	 2008	 Awards	 were	 met	 in	 full;	 the	 EPS	 portion	
of the 2008	 Awards	 did	 not	 meet	 target	 performance	 and	 therefore	 lapsed.	 Accordingly,	 Mr	 Henriksson’s	 2008	 Award	 will	 vest	 at	 50%.	 In	 respect	 of	 Mr	 Edmunds,	
his 2008	 Award	 was	 granted	 when	 he	 was	 CFO	 of	 Invensys	 Process	 Systems	 and	 30%	 of	 his	 award	 is	 not	 subject	 to	 performance	 conditions;	 therefore,	 in	 aggregate,	
Mr Edmunds’	 2008	 Award	 will	 vest	 at	 65%.	
3	 Mr 	 Henriksson	 left	 the	 Company	 on	 24	 March	 2011.	 On	 leaving	 the	 Company,	 the	 Committee	 permitted	 the	 preservation	 in	 full	 of	 the	 2007	 LTIP	 award	 made	 to	
Mr Henriksson	 in	 2008	 (subject	 to	 the	 performance	 requirements	 as	 set	 out	 in	 Note	 2).	 The	 2007	 LTIP	 awards	 made	 to	 him	 in	 2009	 and	 2010	 lapsed.	
4	 The 	 TSR	 performance	 condition	 of	 the	 2007	 Award	 vested	 at	 50%,	 but	 the	 EPS	 portion	 of	 the	 2007	 Award	 did	 not	 meet	 its	 target	 performance	 and	 therefore	 lapsed.	
The shares	 were	 released	 on	 10	 August	 2010	 and	 a	 further	 4,298	 shares	 were	 issued	 representing	 accrued	 dividends.	
5	 Award 	 granted	 as	 nominal	 price	 option	 and,	 as	 such,	 can	 be	 exercised	 during	 a	 three-month	 period	 following	 the	 vesting	 date.
Restricted Share Plan 
Restricted	 Share	 Plan	 (RSP)	 awards	 are	 satisfied	 by	 the	 transfer	 of	 existing	 issued	 shares.	 The	 vesting	 period	 for	 awards	 normally	
falls	 between	 one	 to	 three	 years.	 These	 are	 normally	 granted	 to	 executive	 leaders	 excluding	 executive	 directors.	 The	 2008	 RSP	
Award	 listed	 below	 was	 granted	 to	 Mr	 Edmunds	 while	 he	 was	 employed	 as	 CFO	 of	 Invensys	 Process	 Systems	 and	 prior	 to	 his	
appointment	 as	 an	 executive	 director.	 Further	 information	 about	 the	 RSP	 can	 be	 found	 on	 page	 54	 of	 this	 Report	 and	 at	 Note	 29

Governance
The directors submit their report and 
the audited accounts for the year ended 
31 March 2011 as set out on pages 66 to 
152 and page 157. This report should be 
read in conjunction with the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 40 to 47.
Principal activities
The principal activities for the year are 
contained in the Business Review on pages 
17 to 36. The principal subsidiaries which 
contributed to the Group’s profit or net 
assets in the year are listed on page 157.
Business Review
The Company is required by the 
Companies Act 2006 to set out in this 
report a fair review of the business of the 
Group during the financial year ended 
31 March 2011 and the position of the 
Group at the end of the year. This review is 
contained in the Business Review section 
of the Annual Report and Accounts (pages 
17 to 36), with further commentary on the 
Group’s strategy, performance and future 
development in the Chairman’s Statement 
(pages 12 and 13) and the Chief Executive’s 
Statement (pages 14 to 16). The Business 
Review includes a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group (pages 32 to 36), a discussion of 
key financial performance measures (pages 
18 to 21), information on our use of financial 
instruments and a description of our 
financial risk management objectives and 
policies (page 22). The Business Review 
contains the information required for a 
management report as set out in the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTRs).
Dividend
The Board has recommended the payment 
of a final dividend for the year of 2.5 pence 
per share which, subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM on 28 July 2011, 
will be paid on 5 August 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at 24 June 2011. 
With an interim dividend of 1.5 pence per 
share paid during the year, the total 
dividends payable in respect of the year 
ended 31 March 2011 are 4.0 pence per 
share (2010: 3.0 pence per share).
We have decided to introduce a dividend 
reinvestment plan (DRIP), beginning with 
the final dividend, which will enable 
shareholders to reinvest their dividends 
directly into Invensys shares. Details of 
the DRIP are contained in separate 
documentation mailed to shareholders.
Board of directors
The current directors of the Company 
and their biographical details are given 
on pages 38 and 39. A statement of their 
remuneration and interests in the ordinary 
shares of the Company are set out in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 60.
As previously announced, Ulf Henriksson 
stepped down as Chief Executive and as a 
director of the Company on 24 March 2011. 
Wayne Edmunds, who had been Chief 
Financial Officer and director of the 
Company since 1 June 2009, succeeded 
Mr Henriksson as Chief Executive. David 
Thomas was appointed as Acting Chief 
Financial Officer on 24 March 2011, but 
he has not been appointed a statutory 
director of the Company.
Deena Mattar will join the Board as a 
non‑executive director and member of 
the Audit Committee on 19 May 2011.
The rules governing the appointment and 
retirement of directors are contained in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, which 
provides that any director appointed 
during the year holds office only until the 
next year’s AGM and is then eligible for 
election by the shareholders and that, in 
any case, one third of the directors (or if 
their number is not a multiple of three the 
number nearest to one third) shall retire 
from office and, if they wish, put themselves 
up for re‑ election by the shareholders. 
The new UK Code, applicable in respect 
of the Company’s financial year beginning 
1 April 2011, recommends that all directors 
should seek re‑ election by shareholders 
annually. The Board intends to implement 
this provision with effect from the AGM 
to be held on 28 July 2011. Further 
information can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 41 and 43.
The Chairman’s Letter and Notice 
of AGM explains the Board’s reasons 
for and recommendations regarding 
the re‑election of all directors.
The powers of the directors are 
determined by UK legislation and the 
Articles of Association of the Company, 
together with any specific authorities 
that may be given to the directors by 
shareholders from time‑ to‑ time, such as 
the power to allot shares and the power to 
make market purchases of the Company’s 
shares. Further information regarding 
matters reserved for the Board is set out 
in the Corporate Governance Report on 
page 40.
Directors’ indemnity and insurance
In accordance with its Articles of 
Association, the Company has provided 
to all the directors an indemnity (to the 
extent permitted by the Companies Act 
2006) in respect of liabilities incurred as a 
result of their office, and the Company has 
taken out an insurance policy in respect of 
those liabilities. Neither the indemnity nor 
the insurance provides cover in the event 
that a director is proved to have acted 
dishonestly or fraudulently.
Acquisitions and disposals
On 21 April 2010, the Group acquired 
100% of the share capital of Skelta 
Software, a privately held software 
company headquartered in Bangalore, 
India, for a cash consideration of 
£6.4 million. On 31 December 2010, 
the Group disposed of a small European 
business that produced pumps for 
coffee‑ making machines for a cash 
consideration of £5.0 million.
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital, 
together with details of movements in 
the issued share capital of the Company 
during the year, are shown in Note 27 
on pages 118 and 119.
The Company has one class of ordinary 
shares which carry no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at 
general meetings of the Company. 
Whether or not a shareholder intends to 
attend the AGM, votes on the resolutions 
are to be lodged by no later than 48 hours 
before the meeting takes place. There are 
no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares (save 
as detailed on page 62), both of which are 
governed by the general provisions of the 
Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation.
The Company operates an employee 
benefit trust in Jersey called the Invensys 
No.2 Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) which 
may be used to deliver ordinary shares 
in the Company under certain executive 
share schemes, as appropriate. The EBT 
has an independent trustee which waives 
its rights to dividends and to vote on the 
shareholding. Details of executive share 
schemes and shares held by the EBT are 
set out in Notes 27 and 29 on pages 
118 to 119 and 120 to 130 respectively.
Directors’ Report 62 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors’ Report continued
Shares acquired through the Company’s 
executive share plans rank pari passu with 
other shares in issue and have no special 
rights or restrictions, save that certain 
share awards involve retention periods 
after vesting. Further information is set 
out in Note 29 on pages 120 to 130. The 
non‑ executive directors use a proportion  
of their fees to purchase shares in  
the Company which may not normally 
be transferred during a director’s  
period of office.
At the 2010 AGM, the directors were 
authorised to issue relevant securities 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£26.7 million (approximately one third 
of the issued ordinary share capital as at 
27 May 2010). In addition, the directors 
were authorised to allot an extra third of 
the issued share capital in respect of a fully 
pre‑ emptive rights issue. Renewal was also 
sought for the directors’ authorisation to 
allot relevant securities and to allot equity 
securities for cash (up to a maximum 
aggregate nominal amount of £4.0 million) 
on a pre‑ emptive basis. The directors did 
not use this authority during the year under 
review, other than to issue shares to satisfy 
awards under the Company’s share 
incentive plans. The directors will seek to 
renew allotment authorities at the 2011 
AGM in line with revised guidelines issued 
by the Association of British Insurers.
Substantial shareholders
At the date of this Report, the Company has 
been notified, in accordance with the DTRs, 
of the following interests in the ordinary 
share capital of the Company:
Name % interest in issued 
share capital

Supplier payment policy
It is the policy of the Group that subsidiary 
companies should develop long‑ term 
relationships with suppliers and establish 
terms of trade consistent with established 
practice in their country of operation, and 
to ensure that suppliers are aware of the 
terms of payment and that such terms are 
followed. The Company is a holding 
company and has no trade creditors.
Employee policy and development
Invensys has active policies of equal 
opportunity ranging from selection and 
recruitment to training and development 
which meet the needs of its operations 
around the world. If necessary, reasonable 
adjustments will be made for the benefit 
of disabled employees. Disabled people 
are given full and fair consideration for 
employment and subsequent training 
(including, if needed, retraining for 
alternative work where employees have 
become temporarily or permanently 
disabled), career development and 
promotion on the basis of their 
aptitudes and abilities.
The Group recognises the need to consult 
and systematically provide information on 
matters of concern to employees. To satisfy 
that need, the Group provides employees 
with published financial and economic 
information through its consultative 
procedures. Invensys encourages 
employees’ involvement in the Company’s 
performance through the Invensys Savings 
Related Share Option Scheme. Invensys also 
encourages the involvement of professional 
and managerial level employees in the 
Group’s performance through the Invensys 
Performance Management System, which 
reinforces the links between the Group’s 
business goals, the employee’s contribution 
and his/her remuneration. Elaboration on 
these topics and further information 
concerning employees is set out in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report, 
which begins on page 28.
Charitable and political contributions
During the year, Group donations to 
charities and community causes worldwide 
were £0.3 million (2010: £0.2 million), 
with UK charities receiving £nil (2010: £nil). 
The Board is of the view that it is not 
appropriate for the Company to make 
charitable donations given that the 
Company only resumed the payment of 
dividends in recent years. However, many 
of the Group’s subsidiaries are influential 
companies and important employers in 
their own countries or localities, and it 
is therefore believed to be in the best 
interests of the Group for those companies’ 
community involvement to be maintained 
at reasonable levels. 
At the 2010 AGM, shareholders passed 
a resolution, on a precautionary basis, 
to authorise the Company to make 
political donations and/or incur political 
expenditure (as such terms are defined 
in sections 362 to 379 of the Companies 
Act 2006), in each case in amounts not 
exceeding £25,000 in aggregate. The 
definitions used in the Companies Act 
2006 are broad in nature and this authority 
was sought to ensure that any activities 
undertaken throughout the Group, which 
could otherwise be construed to fall within 
these provisions, could be undertaken 
without inadvertently infringing them. 
During the year the Company granted 
paid leave in the amount of £8,000 to one 
of its employees who, during the course 
of that leave, campaigned for election 
as a candidate for the UK Labour Party.
Research and development
The Group carries out research and 
development in support of its activities. 
During the year, expenditure on the 
research and development of new 
products and processes amounted 
to £150 million (2010: £130 million). Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 63
Governance
Significant agreements
The Company is required to disclose any 
contractual or other arrangements which 
it considers are essential to its business. 
Invensys’ critical relationships are with 
its major customers and its suppliers of 
services, components and raw materials, 
as discussed in the Business Review on 
pages 17 to 36. Whilst the loss of or 
disruption to certain of these arrangements 
could temporarily affect the operations of 
the Group, none of these arrangements 
are considered to be essential. 
The Company is also required to disclose 
any significant agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate on a change of control 
of the Company. Pursuant to section 992 
of the Companies Act 2006, the directors 
disclose that in the event of a change of 
control in the Company: (i) the banking 
facilities described in Note 21, totalling 
£425 million at 31 March 2011, could cease 
to be available to the Group; (ii) a Master 
Service Agreement dated 15 May 2007, 
made with Genpact International, Inc for 
the provision of outsourced business 
services in relation to certain finance 
and related functions, would become 
terminable at the option of the Company; 
and (iii) a Master Service Agreement 
dated 3 July 2009, made with Cognizant 
Technology Solutions U.S. Corporation 
for the provision of certain research and 
development services to the Invensys 
Operations Management division (and 
also to Invensys Rail from December 2009), 
would become terminable at the option 
of the Company.
Wayne Edmunds’ service contract contains 
provisions which would take effect in the 
event of a change of control. In the event 
of a material adverse change to his title, 
responsibilities or status following a change 
of control of the Company, he would be 
entitled to terminate his employment and 
receive a payment equal to the termination 
payment set out in the Remuneration Report 
on page 55. The service contracts of a small 
number of other key employees also contain 
provisions entitling them to terminate 
employment and receive compensation 
in the event of a change of control.
Auditor
In accordance with section 418(2) of the 
Companies Act 2006, each of the directors 
at the date of approval of this Report 
confirms that, so far as they are aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware, and that 
the directors have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as directors in 
order to make themselves aware of, and 
to establish that the auditor is aware of, any 
relevant audit information. Ernst & Young 
LLP has expressed willingness to continue 
in office as auditor and, in accordance 
with the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, resolutions proposing its 
reappointment and to authorise the 
directors to determine its remuneration 
will be proposed at the 2011 AGM.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held 
on Thursday, 28 July 2011 at 11.00am at 
The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, 
Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London 
SW1P 3EE. The Chairman’s Letter and 
Notice of AGM gives full details of the 
meeting and the resolutions to  
be proposed.

Invensys plc

The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and 
those International Financial Reporting 
Standards adopted by the European 
Union or, in the case of the Company’s 
Financial Statements, UK GAAP.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Company and Group Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, the directors must not approve 
the Financial Statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and 
Group and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing the Company and 
Group Financial Statements, the directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in applicable accounting 
standards is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• state that the Company and the Group 
have complied with applicable 
accounting standards, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the transactions of the Company and of 
the Group and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group, and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the Business Review on 
pages 17 to 36. The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in 
the Financial Review on pages 18 to 21. 
Note 22 to the Financial Statements 
includes: the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposure to 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group, 
along with mitigating actions, are set out 
on pages 34 to 36.
The Group remains generally in a sound 
financial position with net cash, £425 million 
of banking facilities in place until 2013, and 
well‑ established relationships with key 
customers and suppliers.
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and Group 
have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the annual Financial Statements.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
a)  the Financial Statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2011, prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted for use 
in the European Union, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation as a whole; and
b)  the Business Review includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Invensys plc 
for the year ended 31 March 2011 which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement 
of changes in equity, consolidated cash flow statement and the 
related Notes 1 to 36. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 64, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group Financial Statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Group Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the Group Financial Statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Group Financial Statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the Group Financial Statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on Group Financial Statements
In our opinion the Group Financial Statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the Financial Statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group Financial Statements; and
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement 
set out on pages 40 to 47 with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting 
processes and about share capital structures is consistent 
with the Group Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by 
the Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 64, in relation to 
going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial 
Statements of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 and 
on the information in the Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.

Group Financial Statements
Statement of compliance
The Group’s consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out the policies and 
measurement bases that have been applied in preparing the 
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2011. The 
consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling 
and all amounts are rounded to the nearest million (£m) unless 
otherwise indicated.
The Group’s date of transition to IFRSs was 1 April 2004.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Financial Statements comprise Invensys plc 
and its subsidiaries for the financial year to 31 March each year. 
The Group does not currently have any material associates. 
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the 
same reporting year as the Parent Company, using consistent 
accounting policies.
All intragroup balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are 
consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes.
Business combinations completed on or after 1 April 2010
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of the business combination is measured as 
the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at 
acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree is measured either at fair 
value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. Consideration transferred includes any contingent 
consideration measured at its acquisition date fair value. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be 
recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a 
change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration 
that qualifies for classification as equity is not remeasured until it is 
finally settled. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.
Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net identifiable 
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the balance sheet. 
If the cost is lower than the net identifiable assets acquired, the 
difference is recognised in profit or loss.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss 
of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group 
loses control over a subsidiary, it:
• Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities 
of the subsidiary;
• Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling 
interest;
• Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded 
in equity;
• Recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
• Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
• Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; and
• Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss 
or retained earnings, as appropriate.
If a subsidiary with a non-controlling interest incurs losses, 
the non-controlling interest’s share in those losses is attributed 
to non-controlling interests in equity even if that results in 
a deficit balance.
Business combinations completed prior to 1 April 2010
In comparison to the approach explained above, the following 
differences apply to the accounting for business combinations 
completed prior to 1 April 2010.
Non-controlling interests (formerly known as minority interests) 
were measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets and costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition formed part of the cost of the business combination. 
Contingent consideration was included in the cost of the business 
combination if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the 
economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable estimate 
could be determined. Subsequent adjustments to the contingent 
consideration were recognised as part of goodwill.
On loss of control, the Group accounted for the investment 
retained at its proportionate share of net asset value at the 
date control was lost. The carrying value of such investments 
at 1 April 2010 has not been restated.
A non-controlling interest’s share in losses was attributed to 
non-controlling interests in equity until the balance was reduced 
to nil. Any further excess losses were attributed to the parent 
unless the non-controlling interest had a binding obligation to 
cover them. Any such losses prior to 1 April 2010 have not been 
reallocated between the non-controlling interest and the parent.
In accordance with the exemption permitted by IFRS 1, First-time 
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, applied 
by the Group on transition to IFRS, business combinations prior 
to IFRS transition were not restated to comply with IFRS 3, 
Business Combinations.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the 
previous financial year except as follows:
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRSs 
and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC) interpretations during the year. All have been endorsed 
for use in the EU.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised)
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements (amended)
Amendments to IFRS 1 Additional Exemptions for First-time 
Adopters
Amendments to IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based 
Payment Transactions
Amendment to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues
Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items
Improvements to IFRS Annual improvements April 2009
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets 
to Owners
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers
Accounting policies 74 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Accounting policies continued
The principal effects of these changes are as follows:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 27 Consolidated 
and Separate Financial Statements (amended)
IFRS 3 (revised) applies to business combinations completed on 
or after 1 April 2010, and so has been applied to the acquisition of 
Skelta Software Private Limited (Skelta) (see Note 32). The revised 
standard continues to require the purchase method of accounting 
(now referred to as the acquisition method) to be applied to 
business combinations but introduces some changes to the 
accounting treatment, including the recognition of acquisition-
related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are 
incurred and the services are received rather than as part of the 
cost of the acquisition. The revised standard also contains new 
guidance on how to determine what constitutes consideration 
transferred for the acquiree. Among other things, this helps to 
clarify whether contingent payments to selling shareholders are 
contingent consideration in the business combination or are 
separate transactions, the distinction depending on the nature 
of the particular arrangements in place. In the case of Skelta, 
the amounts treated in accordance with this guidance as separate 
transactions rather than contingent consideration are disclosed in 
Note 32. The accounting for business combinations that occurred 
before 1 April 2010 was not required to be restated, so there is no 
effect on the Group’s reported income or net assets on adoption.
The basis of consolidation applied under IAS 27 has been 
amended to reflect the revised approach to business 
combinations. In addition, the accounting for a change in the 
ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a loss 
of control has been amended so that the transaction is accounted 
for as an equity transaction which does give rise to goodwill or 
result in any gain or loss; and losses arising in subsidiaries in 
which there is a non-controlling interest are allocated to the 
non-controlling interest even if they result in a deficit in the 
balance of non-controlling interests in equity. The changes apply 
only to losses of control of subsidiaries and transactions with 
non-controlling interests that occur after 1 April 2010. Their 
application has had no material effect on the reported income 
or net assets of the Group in year ended 31 March 2011.
The descriptions of the accounting policies applicable to business 
combinations, the basis of consolidation and goodwill with effect 
from 1 April 2010 have been amended to reflect these changes.
Improvements to IFRS — Annual improvements April 2009
Among changes to several IFRSs, the Improvements to IFRS 
adopted for the first time this year has clarified that IFRS 8, 
Operating Segments, requires the separate disclosure of total 
segment assets only if such an amount is regularly provided 
to the chief operating decision maker. As a result, with effect 
from 31 March 2011, Invensys will present in Note 2, Operating 
segment information, a single measure of segment net assets/
(liabilities), rather than separate measures of segment assets 
and segment liabilities, as this disclosure better reflects the 
measure of segment assets and liabilities used in practice. 
The comparative disclosure for the year ended 31 March 2010 
has been re-presented accordingly.
Other than the changes noted above, adoption of these standards 
and interpretations has not had any material effect on the Financial 
Statements of the Group.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material items of income and expense 
that should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding 
of the Group’s financial performance and in making projections of 
future results. Such items may be operating or non-operating in 
nature. Exceptional items are presented separately on the face 
of the income statement and analysed in the Notes to the 
Financial Statements.
Foreign currencies
The presentational currency of the Group and functional currency 
of Invensys plc is sterling.
The Financial Statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries are 
prepared using their functional currency. The functional currency 
is generally the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which an entity operates.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the income 
statement unless:
a) the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form the 
hedging instrument in a cash flow hedging relationship that 
qualifies for hedge accounting; or
b) the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form part 
of a net investment in a foreign operation;
in which case they are recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at 
the date of the initial transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
in foreign currency are translated at the rates prevailing when 
the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on 
retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, 
except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets 
and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity.
Financial statements of foreign operations
The trading results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into 
sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year. 
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, including goodwill, 
are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date. All resulting exchange differences are 
recognised directly in a separate component of equity. On disposal 
of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held 
in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement, as 
part of the profit or loss on sale.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to 
IFRS were deemed to be zero at that date. As a result, if a foreign 
operation is sold, there is no exchange difference recognised in 
the income statement relating to the period prior to that date.
Revenue
Composition of revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services 
supplied by the Group excluding intragroup transactions and 
sales taxes. Revenue relating to construction contracts, including 
long-term service provision contracts, represents the value of work 
performed during the year determined by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contract. Discounts given to customers against 
list prices, such as trade or volume discounts, are deducted in 
arriving at the value of revenue. Settlement discounts are reported 
as an expense in the income statement.
Recognition of revenue and profits
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. The specific methods used to recognise the 
different forms of revenue earned by the Group are set out below. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 75
Group Financial Statements
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the 
buyer and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. For 
sales of software solutions, revenue is recognised when a signed 
contract exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, no 
significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the sales 
proceeds is considered probable. A contract to deliver goods, 
including software solutions, that requires significant production, 
modification, customisation or integration of the goods, is 
accounted for in its entirety as a construction contract.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
Construction contracts and rendering of services
Revenue from construction contracts and long-term service 
provision contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This 
is normally determined by the proportion that contract costs 
incurred to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except 
where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. 
If the nature of a particular contract means that costs incurred 
do not accurately reflect the progress of contract activity, an 
alternative approach is used such as the achievement of 
pre-determined contract milestones.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are 
included in revenue from construction contracts when certain 
criteria are met. Variations are included when the customer has 
agreed to the variation or acknowledged liability for the variation 
in principle. Claims are included when negotiations with the 
customer have reached an advanced stage such that the customer 
is certain to accept the claim. Incentive payments are included 
when a contract is sufficiently advanced that it is probable that the 
performance standards triggering the incentive will be achieved.
Profit attributable to contract activity is recognised if the final 
outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed. On all 
contracts, full provision is made for any losses in the year in 
which they are first foreseen.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term or one-off basis 
is recognised when the service is complete.
When a transaction combines a supply of goods with the provision 
of a significant service, revenue from the provision of the service is 
recognised separately from the revenue from the sale of goods 
by reference to the stage of completion of the service unless the 
service is essential to the functionality of the goods supplied, in 
which case the whole transaction is treated as a construction 
contract. Revenue from a service that is incidental to the supply 
of goods is recognised at the same time as the revenue from the 
supply of goods.
Research and development
All research expenditure is expensed as incurred. Development 
expenditure is expensed as incurred unless it meets the criteria for 
recognition as an intangible asset (see policy on Other intangible 
assets).
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing retirement 
benefits to employees during the year is charged to operating 
profit or loss in the year. The cost of providing benefits under the 
defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using 
the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The full cost 
of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service 
that vests immediately is also charged to operating profit or loss in 
the year. The expected return on the assets of the schemes during 
the year based on the market value of scheme assets at the start of 
the financial year is included within Other finance charges — IAS 19. 
This also includes a charge representing the expected increase in 
liabilities of the schemes during the year, arising from the liabilities 
of the scheme being one year closer to payment. Differences 
between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year, 
together with differences from changes in assumptions. The net 
surplus or deficit on defined benefit pension schemes is reported 
on the balance sheet within the pension asset or liability.
The value of any defined benefit asset recognised is restricted to 
the present value of any economic benefits available in the form 
of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions 
to the plan. When the Group is committed to making minimum 
funding payments to a defined benefit plan, and the present value 
of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of 
the plan as measured under IFRS, a provision is recognised for any 
part of the resulting surplus that would not be recoverable.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the 
income statement in respect of pension costs is the contributions 
payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable 
in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as 
accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Goodwill
On a business combination the net identifiable assets are 
assessed and adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies of the business acquired into alignment with those of the 
Group. For a business combination with an acquisition date on or 
after 1 April 2010, the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition 
date fair value of consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree over 
the identifiable net assets acquired is included in intangible assets 
as goodwill. For a business combination with an acquisition date 
before 1 April 2010, goodwill was determined as the excess of the 
price paid over the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable 
net assets acquired.
Any costs of integrating the acquired business are taken to the 
income statement.
Goodwill arising on business combinations before 1 April 2004 has 
been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves 
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired, and it is subsequently carried 
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The Group’s policy on 
testing assets for impairment is set out under ‘Impairment of 
non-financial assets’ on page 76.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the business sold. 76 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair 
value at acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired 
intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the 
purchase price and any directly attributable costs of preparing the 
asset for use. Amortisation begins when an asset is available for 
use and is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost 
less residual value of assets over their estimated useful lives using 
the following annual rates or useful lives:
Development costs 10 to 25%
Computer software costs 10 to 25%
Patents, trademarks and licences Shorter of period of the 
agreement or 15 years
Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments 
where applicable are made on a prospective basis. No intangible 
assets other than goodwill are considered to have indefinite 
useful lives.
Expenditure incurred on development projects is capitalised as 
an intangible asset if it meets the recognition criteria set out in 
IAS 38, Intangible Assets. These require it to be probable that the 
expenditure will generate future economic benefits and can be 
measured reliably. To meet these criteria, it is necessary to be able 
to demonstrate, among other things, the technical feasibility of 
completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use 
or sale.
Costs incurred in the preliminary stage of a development project 
are considered to be research costs, and are recognised in the 
income statement as incurred. These costs are incurred to 
determine the product concepts and alternatives, evaluate the 
alternatives and related risks, assess the technical feasibility of 
concepts, make the final selection from the possible alternatives 
and prepare the high level design and project planning. The costs 
incurred in the following development stage for substantially new 
or improved products are assessed against the IAS 38 criteria and 
considered for recognition as an asset when they meet those 
criteria. These costs are generally incurred in developing the 
detailed product design, software configuration and software 
interfaces; the coding of software, building of prototypes and 
integration of the software with hardware; and testing and 
releasing the product to manufacture and pilot production.
Development expenditure directed towards incremental 
improvements in existing products does not qualify for 
recognition as an intangible asset.
In general the costs of developing software products that are sold 
in packaged form and not integrated and sold with hardware are 
not recognised as intangible assets. The uncertainties associated 
with the functionality of these products mean that technical 
feasibility is achieved only immediately prior to or after field 
trial tests at customer sites. As a result minimal or no costs are 
considered to meet the IAS 38 criteria for recognition.
An intangible asset acquired in a business combination is 
recognised separately from the goodwill arising on the business 
combination if the asset’s fair value can be measured reliably, 
regardless of whether the asset had been recognised previously 
by the acquiree.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase 
price and directly attributable costs.
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated to their 
residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives at the following rates applied to original cost:
Freehold land nil
Freehold buildings 2 to 2.5%
Leasehold properties Over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment 7 to 35%
Useful lives and residual values are examined on an annual basis 
and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective 
basis.
Impairment of non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any 
indication that any non-financial asset (excluding goodwill) may 
be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually whether 
or not there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill was also 
tested for impairment at the date of transition to IFRS. If there is 
an indication of impairment, the Group makes an estimate of the 
asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an 
asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is written down 
to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less 
costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual 
asset. If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs is determined.
The calculation of an asset’s value in use uses a discount rate that 
reflects the asset specific risks and the time value of money.
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in 
property, plant and equipment at fair value or, if lower, the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. Capitalised leased assets 
are subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
or the asset’s useful life. Obligations related to finance leases, net 
of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as 
appropriate within liabilities. Lease payments are apportioned 
between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so 
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Other leases are classified as operating leases. Lease payments, 
including any premium paid at the outset of the lease, made under 
operating leases are recognised as an expense over the lease term 
on a straight-line basis.
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains 
a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement at its 
inception date and an assessment of whether the fulfilment of 
the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset 
or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 77
Group Financial Statements
A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of 
the following applies:
a) there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or 
extension of the arrangement;
b) a renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the 
term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the 
lease term;
c) there is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment 
is dependent on a specified asset; or
d) there is a substantial change to the asset.
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or 
ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise 
to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of 
renewal or extension period for scenario b).
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net 
realisable value. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving 
items. Cost comprises the cost of raw materials, determined on a 
first-in, first-out cost basis, and an appropriate proportion of 
labour and manufacturing overheads based on normal operating 
capacity, to reflect the costs incurred in bringing the product to 
its present location and condition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, call deposits 
and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.
Cash and short-term deposits at the balance sheet date are offset 
against bank loans and overdrafts where formal rights of set-off 
exist and there is an intention to settle on a net basis.
Taxation
Income tax on profit or loss
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it 
is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year and 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxable 
profit differs from profit reported in the income statement as it 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible, or which are 
taxable or deductible in other years. The Group’s current tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method, providing for temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding amounts used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred income tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of 
temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 
where the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the 
temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Such assets 
and liabilities are also not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of assets other than goodwill or liabilities in 
a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit. A deferred income tax asset is recognised on 
the initial recognition of goodwill arising in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is less than its tax base and 
the deferred income tax asset qualifies for recognition. No 
deferred income tax liability is recognised as a result of the initial 
recognition of goodwill.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at 
each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally 
enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority, and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments
The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts to 
manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
These instruments are accounted for as hedges when they are 
designated as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Group 
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial 
trading purposes.
All derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value 
in the balance sheet. The fair values of forward foreign exchange 
contracts are calculated by reference to forward exchange rates 
for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The designation of derivative financial instruments as hedges is 
carried out according to the Group’s risk management policies. 
Hedges fall into three categories:
a) Fair value hedges, which hedge the exposure to changes in the 
fair value of a recognised asset or liability;
b) Cash flow hedges, which hedge exposure to variability in cash 
flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction, or the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment; 
and
c) Net investment hedges, which hedge exposure to changes in 
the value of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations 
due to changes in exchange rates.
The accounting treatment for these categories is outlined below:
Fair value hedges
When a hedging instrument is remeasured at fair value, any 
resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Any 
gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged 
risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item 
and similarly recognised in the income statement. 78 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Accounting policies continued
Cash flow and net investment hedges
The portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument that is 
determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity. Any 
ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement. When a hedged cash flow related to a hedged item 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the 
associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are 
included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all 
other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in 
equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period 
in which the hedged item affects the income statement. In the case 
of a net investment hedge, this takes place on disposal.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Group’s net investment 
in foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the 
borrowings that is determined to be an effective hedge, in 
accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement, is recognised in equity. Any gains or losses arising 
from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that 
do not qualify as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
Derivative instruments held by the Group’s pension and post-
retirement benefit schemes are accounted for within the schemes 
themselves and are reflected in the Group Financial Statements 
within the amounts reported for those schemes.
Other financial assets
The Group’s other financial assets are classified as either available-
for-sale, at fair value through profit or loss, or held-to-maturity. 
These financial assets are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured as follows: (a) at fair value for available-
for-sale financial assets. Gains and losses are recognised in equity 
except for impairment losses, interest and dividends arising from 
these assets which are recognised in the income statement; (b) at 
fair value for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
Net gains or losses are based on changes in fair value; and (c) 
at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, for 
held-to-maturity financial assets. Changes to the carrying amount 
of held-to-maturity assets are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less 
any provision for impairment. Trade and other receivables are 
discounted when the time value of money is considered material. 
Any change in their value is recognised in the income statement.
Debt instruments
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of 
the consideration received less directly attributable issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. This cost is computed as the amount initially 
recognised minus principal repayments, plus or minus the 
cumulative amortisation of any difference between the initially 
recognised amount and the maturity amount. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount 
or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement through 
the amortisation process and when the liabilities are derecognised.
Financial guarantee contracts
A financial guarantee contract is a contract issued by the Group 
that requires the Group to make specified payments to reimburse 
the holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs because a specified 
debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the 
original or modified terms of a debt instrument. In a very limited 
number of cases, the Group has issued such contracts to 
guarantee certain borrowings by third parties.
Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at 
fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of (a) 
the estimated outflow of resources required to meet any 
present obligation under the contract (in accordance with 
IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets); 
and (b) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, 
cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with 
IAS 18, Revenue.
Derecognition of financial instruments
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the 
contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of 
an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange 
or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income 
statement.
Impairment of financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial 
asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
Assets carried at amortised cost, such as loans and receivables, 
are impaired if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss 
has been incurred. The loss is measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that 
have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at 
initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced 
through use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss 
is recognised in the income statement.
The assessment considers whether objective evidence of 
impairment exists individually for financial assets that are 
individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial 
assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that 
no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually 
assessed financial asset, the asset is included in a group of financial 
assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of 
financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets 
that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an 
impairment loss is recognised are not included in a collective 
assessment of impairment.
If the amount of a recognised impairment loss decreases in a 
subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. The reversal 
is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the 
carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost 
at the reversal date.
For trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when 
there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency 
or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will 
not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original 
terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is 
reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts 
are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 79
Group Financial Statements
Available-for-sale financial investments
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising 
the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and 
amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss 
previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from 
equity to the income statement. Reversals in respect of equity 
instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in 
the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on debt 
instruments are reversed through the income statement, if the 
increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related 
to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised 
in the income statement.
Share-based payment
The Group operates various equity-settled and cash-settled 
share schemes.
For equity-settled share options, the services received 
from employees are measured by reference to the fair value 
of the share options. The fair value is calculated at grant date 
using a valuation model and recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, together with a corresponding increase in 
shareholders’ equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on an estimate of the number of options that 
will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market 
conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the 
fair value. Market conditions are those conditions that are 
linked to the share price of the Company.
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is 
calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, where 
applicable, any market vesting conditions, and expensed over the 
vesting period based on the number of shares expected to vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition; which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance or service conditions 
are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if 
the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award 
are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification 
that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment 
transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if 
it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes 
any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of 
either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new 
award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as 
a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled 
and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of 
the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are 
treated equally.
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from 
employees are measured at fair value and recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as an expense over the vesting 
period with recognition of a corresponding liability. The fair 
value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and 
at the date of settlement, with changes in fair value recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.
In accordance with the exemption permitted by IFRS 1, 
First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards, applied by the Group on transition to IFRSs, 
the requirements of IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, have not 
been applied to equity instruments granted on or before 
7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (treasury shares) 
are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit 
or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s 
own equity instruments. Treasury shares are purchased and held 
by the Employee Share Trust to meet future distributions of shares 
to employees under the Group’s various share option and share 
award schemes.

Accounting policies continued
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management is 
required to make judgements and assumptions concerning 
the future in a number of areas. Actual results may be different 
from those estimated using these judgements and assumptions. 
The key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting 
judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on 
an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the ‘value in use’ 
of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. 
Estimating a value in use amount requires management to make 
an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash 
generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in 
order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The 
carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2011 was £291 million 
(2010: £301 million). Details of the key assumptions used in 
testing for impairment and the sensitivity of the calculations 
to any reasonably possible change in those assumptions are 
given in Note 13.
Pension and post-retirement benefits
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post 
employment medical benefits is determined using actuarial 
valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions 
about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future 
salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. 
Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are 
subject to significant uncertainty. The net pension liability at 
31 March 2011 is £467 million (2010: £581 million). Further 
details, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the UK Main 
Pension Scheme to changes in the principal assumptions, 
are given in Note 25.
Development costs
Costs incurred in developing new products are capitalised 
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for other 
intangible assets. These costs arise mainly in the Invensys 
Operations Management and Invensys Rail divisions. Determining 
the amounts to be capitalised requires management to make 
assumptions and estimates regarding the expected future cash 
generation of new products and the expected period of benefits. 
At 31 March 2011, the carrying amount of capitalised development 
costs was £150 million (2010: £123 million). Further details, 
including an explanation of impairment losses recognised, 
are given in Note 14.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group currently recognises provisions for a number of 
liabilities, including environmental claims and onerous lease 
rentals. The amounts recognised for provisions represent the 
best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits that will be required to settle these liabilities. 
No provisions are recognised for contingent liabilities. Contingent 
liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be 
confirmed only by uncertain future events, or current obligations 
that are not recognised because it is not probable that they will 
result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured 
with sufficient reliability.
The determination of whether a liability should be disclosed 
as a contingent liability or recognised as a provision requires 
judgements to be made on the existence of a present obligation 
and the probability of future events. When a provision is required, 
the amount recognised is determined using judgements and 
assumptions, based on current knowledge, to estimate the 
amount and timing of future cash outflows arising from the 
liabilities. At 31 March 2011, the estimated amount of liabilities 
requiring provisions was £173 million (2010: £179 million). 
Further details are given in Note 24. Details of the Group’s 
contingent liabilities are set out in Note 30.
Construction and long-term service provision contracts
Invensys Operations Management and Invensys Rail undertake 
projects that frequently span more than one accounting period 
and are accounted for as construction or long-term service 
provision contracts. The Group’s accounting policies for these 
projects require revenues and costs to be allocated to individual 
accounting periods and the consequent recognition at period 
end of contract assets or liabilities for projects still in progress. 
The application of these policies requires management to 
apply judgement in estimating the total revenue and total costs 
expected on each project. Such estimates are revised as a project 
progresses to reflect the current status of the project and the 
latest information available to management. Project management 
teams perform regular reviews to ensure the latest estimates 
are appropriate.
The amount of revenue relating to projects accounted for 
as construction or long-term service provision contracts 
recognised in the year ended 31 March 2011 was £1,193 million 
(2010: £1,048 million). The net amount due from contract 
customers on projects in progress at 31 March 2011 was 
£19 million (2010: £18 million due to contract customers). 
Further details of amounts due from and to contract 
customers are included in Note 18. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 81
Group Financial Statements
1 General information
The Group Financial Statements of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 were authorised for issue in accordance 
with a resolution of the directors on 18 May 2011 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Sir Nigel Rudd 
and Wayne Edmunds. Invensys plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales whose shares are 
publicly traded.
Invensys Group comprises continuing operations and discontinued operations. No new operations have been discontinued in 
the current year. During the year the Group disposed of a small European business from within the Invensys Controls division. 
Additional costs have been incurred relating to prior year disposals. Operations presented as discontinued are explained 
in Note 10.
Continuing operations consist of the following divisions: Invensys Operations Management, Invensys Rail and Invensys Controls. 
The principal activities of each of the continuing operations divisions are as follows:
• Invensys Operations Management — is a technology, software and consulting business that creates and applies technologies 
to facilitate the safe and efficient operation of industrial and commercial operations such as oil refineries, fossil fuel and 
nuclear power plants, petrochemical works and other manufacturing sites.
• Invensys Rail — provides signalling, communication and control systems that facilitate the safe and efficient operation of trains 
in mainline and mass transit networks across the world.
• Invensys Controls — designs, engineers and manufactures products, components, systems and services used in appliances, 
heating, air conditioning/cooling and refrigeration products across a wide range of industries in residential and commercial 
markets.
Further details on the activities of each of the above continuing operations are given in the Business Review. This is the basis 
on which the Group is managed. 
2 Operating segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into divisions based on their products and services and has three 
reportable operating segments as explained in the Business Review: Invensys Operations Management, Invensys Rail and 
Invensys Controls. There have been no changes to the composition of these operating segments during the year. Descriptions 
of the products and services provided by these divisions are set out in Note 1. Operations presented as discontinued are 
explained in Note 10.
Management monitors the operating results of each of these divisions separately for the purpose of making decisions about 
resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated primarily on operating profit or loss 
before exceptional items as identified in the consolidated income statement. Restructuring costs and impairment losses on 
operating assets, which are reported in the consolidated income statement as exceptional items, are also monitored at the 
segment level. Other exceptional items together with foreign exchange gains or losses, finance costs, finance income, finance 
charges relating to pension arrangements under IAS 19, Employee Benefits and income tax are managed on a Group basis and 
are not allocated to operating segments.
Segment net assets/(liabilities) are determined based on the net operating assets/(liabilities) monitored by the divisional 
chief executives on a segment basis. At 31 March 2010 the totals of segment assets and liabilities were disclosed separately, 
but ‘Improvements to IFRS’ (April 2009), which has been adopted for the year ended 31 March 2011, has clarified that IFRS 8, 
Operating Segments, requires the separate disclosure of total segment assets only if such an amount is regularly provided 
to the chief operating decision maker. As a result it is considered that the disclosure of segment net assets/(liabilities) is more 
appropriate as it better reflects the measure of segment assets and liabilities used in practice. The comparative disclosure for 
the year ended 31 March 2010 has been re-presented accordingly.

(iv) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Group is subject to several factors which affect the tax charge including the levels and mix of profitability in different 
jurisdictions and the availability of tax losses.
(v) Franked investment income group litigation order
In December 2006 Invensys filed a claim in the High Court for compensation arising from the payment of advance corporation 
tax and from satisfying liabilities to corporation tax arising from the receipt of dividends from non-UK resident subsidiaries. 
Invensys contends that these tax liabilities were incurred in breach of its EU community law rights. Invensys is part of a Group 
Litigation Order with 24 other corporates from whom two test cases were selected to proceed to trial on a representative basis.
In December 2006 the European Court of Justice issued its guidance to the UK High Court on the compatibility of certain UK tax 
provisions within EU community law. The test cases returned to the UK High Court for the full hearing in July 2008, with the UK 
High Court issuing its judgment on 27 November 2008.
The UK High Court judgement in November 2008 found in favour of the claimants on certain key aspects of the claim. The 
judgment concluded, inter alia, that dividends received from EU subsidiaries should be, and should have been, effectively 
exempt from UK taxation. It also concluded that certain dividends received from EU subsidiaries before 5 April 1999 and, in 
some limited circumstances, after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been treated as franked investment income, with 
the consequence that advance corporation tax need not have been paid.
The case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2009 and the judgment was handed down on 23 February 2010. The 
Court of Appeal has determined that various questions should be referred back to the European Court of Justice for further 
clarification. In addition, the Court determined that the claim should be restricted to six years and not cover claims dating back 
to 1973. The principal test claimant has sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in the UK on the time limits although no 
date has yet been set for the hearing. It is expected that the overall process may take several years to complete.
Given the complexity and uncertainty over the issues raised it is not possible to predict the amounts and final outcome with 
any reasonable certainty. Therefore no contingent asset has been recognised in the Group Financial Statements.
10 Discontinued operations
No operations have been discontinued in the year to 31 March 2011 or 31 March 2010. In the year ended 31 March 2011, net 
£7 million (2010: £3 million) of additional costs were incurred in respect of prior year disposals against which there was £nil tax 
(2010: £1 million credit). 90 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

1 Includes £nil (2010: £5 million) for the reversal of the exceptional tax charge that arose from the recognition of the PPP settlement credit.
The basic earnings/(loss) per share for the year has been calculated using 808 million shares (2010: 805 million), being the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held as Treasury shares which are treated as 
cancelled, and the profit after taxation and non-controlling interests for continuing operations, discontinued operations 
and total Group as shown above.
An additional earnings per share calculation for continuing operations has been included since the directors consider that this 
gives useful additional indications of underlying performance. 
The diluted earnings/(loss) per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share without reference to 
adjustments in respect of certain share options which are considered to be anti-dilutive.
There have been no significant transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date 
and the date of completion of these Financial Statements.

restructuring project undertaken in Invensys Controls and £3 million for the write-down of property, plant and equipment; 
£2 million in Invensys Operations Management and £1 million in Invensys Controls). The recoverable amounts of these assets 
were estimated based on their fair value less costs to sell. Fair values were determined based on an assessment of the current 
market values of the assets and past experience of sales of similar assets. 92 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Notes to the Financial Statements continued Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 93
Group Financial Statements
Annual impairment test
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
Goodwill is tested separately for each CGU or group of CGUs that represent the lowest level within the Group at which the 
goodwill is allocated and monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined 
from ‘value in use’ calculations using cash flow projections over a five-year period.
The key assumptions for the ‘value in use’ calculations are:
• revenue volumes;
• revenue prices;
• operating costs;
• growth rate assumptions for years four and five of the cash flow projections;
• growth in perpetuity applied to calculate the terminal value; and
• discount rate.
Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are those included in the most recent financial annual operating 
plans and three-year strategic plans approved by the Board. Annual operating plans are detailed financial forecasts covering 
the first year of the Group’s three-year strategic plan. The key assumptions underlying the forecasts for the CGUs over the 
period of the annual operating and strategic plans are order growth, taking account of the level of historic growth, and 
expected future developments in markets and operations, and macroeconomic forecasts for the territories and industries in 
which they operate.
Cash flows for years four and five are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGUs. These growth rates take 
into consideration forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions 
and the levels of growth achieved historically by the CGUs and forecast in the periods covered by the three-year strategic plan. 
Lower growth rates are applied in perpetuity to calculate the terminal values of the CGUs. These rates do not exceed the 
average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. A long-term discount rate is derived for the CGUs by adjusting 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital to reflect the relative level of risk associated with the cash flow projections. 
The discount rate is a pre-tax rate. These discount rates and growth rates are as follows:

1 In perpetuity.
In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year 
(2010: £nil).
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With respect to the assessment of ‘value in use’ of all CGUs, management believes that no reasonable possible change in any 
of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.  94 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been offset where a legal right of offset exists. The following is the 
analysis of the deferred income tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:

Deferred income tax assets 46 27
Deferred income tax liabilities (18) (12)

As a result of changes to tax legislation, dividends received from subsidiaries on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from 
UK tax but may be subject to dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries 
operate. The gross temporary differences of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such potential taxes is £13 million 
(2010: £22 million). No deferred income tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able 
to control the timing of reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The Group has unrecognised income tax losses of £1,183 million with a tax value of £370 million (2010: £1,229 million with a tax 
value of £396 million) available for offset against future profits. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £40 million 
(2010: £48 million) that will expire within four years.
The Group has unrecognised capital losses of £6,247 million (2010: £1,341 million) that are only available for offset against 
future capital gains. Included in capital losses are losses of £19 million (2010: £170 million) that will expire within four years. 
Other capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of £668 million with a tax value of £212 million 
(2010: £823 million with a tax value of £272 million) in respect of pension and other retirement benefit obligations and other 
deductible temporary differences.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax will reduce to 26% from 1 April 2011 and will continue to fall by 1% each year to 23% in 
2014. The impact of the rate change to 23% would reduce the total unrecognised deferred income tax assets by £196 million.

Trade receivables are recorded net of an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods. The average 
credit period taken on sales of goods is 51 days.
The allowance that has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods is £12 million (2010: £13 million). 
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience and future recoverability. The net impairment loss 
recognised in the year as a result of irrecoverable receivables balances is £nil (2010: £nil).
Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing. Other receivables include amounts owed by associated 
undertakings, interest receivable, refundable deposits, refunds due in respect of VAT, sales and payroll taxes, commissions 
earned and insurance recoveries.

ongoing basis.
Further information on the Group’s approach to credit risk in relation to trade and other receivables is given in Note 22.

Cash and cash equivalents attract interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalents. Short-term deposits have an average 
maturity of 10 days (2010: 11 days). The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is not materially different from their book value. 
For information on the exposure of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents balances to credit risk refer to Note 22.
Restricted cash and short-term deposits
The Group has operations in a number of territories including China, Brazil and India which place restrictions on the ability of 
subsidiaries to lend money to other Group entities outside those territories. However, distributions to the Group are permitted 
from audited reserves. At 31 March 2011 restricted cash and cash equivalents held in such territories totalled £58 million 
(2010: £68 million).
Cash and cash equivalents include £31 million (2010: £37 million) of collateral held in the ordinary course of business to provide 
security for local bonding facilities. In addition, the Group has bonds and guarantees issued under uncommitted facilities which 
are outlined in Note 21.

out of the previous year’s free cash flow (this restriction does not apply if the Company has an investment grade rating).
2 Finance leases are secured by charges over the assets to which they relate. At 31 March 2011 £nil of such loans were classified as non-current liabilities (2010: £1 million).
As at 31 March 2011, the committed syndicated loan facility available to the Group was a £400 million multicurrency credit 
facility with a term of five years from July 2008. The facility is available for utilisation as loans, letters of credit or bank guarantees. 
The available facility at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010 was £400 million, of which £254 million was drawn at 31 March 2011 
for the provision of bonds and guarantees (2010: £240 million).
As at 31 March 2011, the committed bilateral local loan facility available to the Company was a £25 million subordinated 
multicurrency credit facility with a term of two years and seven months from December 2010. The facility is available for 
utilisation as loans, letters of credit or bank guarantees. The available facility at 31 March 2011 was £25 million of which £nil 
was drawn at 31 March 2011.
In addition, at 31 March 2011, the Group has bonds and guarantees totalling £219 million (2010: £245 million) issued under 
uncommitted facilities. Of these, £31 million (2010: £37 million) are supported by cash collateral and a further £17 million 
(2010: £20 million) are supported by guarantees issued under the Group’s committed syndicated loan facility. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 99

22 Financial risk management and financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank facilities for cash advances, guarantees, leases, cash and cash 
equivalents, other financial assets, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables. The Group also enters into 
derivative transactions, primarily forward currency contracts. This note explains the nature and extent of the risks arising from 
financial instruments; how those risks arise; the objectives, policies and processes used by the Group for managing the risks; 
and the methods used to measure the risks.
Overview of treasury policy
The Group manages its exposure to risks arising from its use of financial instruments by the application of its treasury policy.
The Group’s treasury policy is approved by the Board and seeks to ensure that:
• appropriate financial resources are available for the maintenance and development of the Group’s divisions;
• the financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposure is understood, measured and managed 
appropriately; and
• the Treasury department operates as a cost centre and that no speculative transactions are undertaken.
There have been no significant changes in the Group’s exposures to risk, and its approach to managing those exposures, 
in the year ended 31 March 2011 compared to the year ended 31 March 2010.
Policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
Operating within the strict controls of the Group’s treasury policy, the Treasury department manages this risk, ensuring that 
sufficient funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the Group together with a prudent level of headroom 
to allow for cash flow and bank guarantee variability. In addition to the free cash flow of the Group, Invensys adopts a flexible 
approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt facilities and short-term cash deposits. Funding is 
provided by bank facilities which mature in July 2013, as described in Note 21(ii). The undrawn level of these facilities as set out 
in Note 21(iii) together with the Group’s cash balances as set out in Note 20, are the key measures of the Group’s liquidity.
Bank guarantees issued by the Group as set out in Note 21(ii) represent a potential liquidity requirement. This risk is mitigated 
by issuing guarantees under the committed syndicated loan facility and holding sufficient liquidity to cover the forecast cash 
requirements of guarantees issued under uncommitted facilities.
Liquidity management is centralised through cash pooling arrangements and inter-company funding structures, under the 
control of the Treasury department. In countries where cash pooling arrangements cannot be implemented, cash balances are 
monitored to ensure that surplus amounts are repatriated and deficits adequately funded. The Treasury department maintains 
sufficient back-up liquidity in the form of available cash balances and committed facilities.
Standard business practices include the strict application of credit control procedures to ensure the collection of cash from 
customers in accordance with agreed credit periods and terms that result in positive cash flows over the life of a construction 
or long-term service provision contract whenever possible. 100 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to risk arising from the effect of changes in floating interest rates on the level of interest it receives on its 
cash deposits.
As at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010, in line with the Group having a net cash position, Invensys had no significant borrowings.
The interest rate profiles of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 20 
and 21 respectively. All other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing and a statement has been 
made to that effect in the relevant balance sheet notes. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 101

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held 
constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating-rate cash and borrowings). There is no impact on the 
Group’s equity. The same assumptions have been used for the years ended 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010.

Currency risk
Transaction  exposure
Currency transaction exposure arises when the units face revenues or costs in a currency other than their own. The incidence 
of this risk varies across the Group and is subject to change. However, the majority of revenues and costs will usually be in the 
functional currency of the business undertaking the transaction. Where this is not the case and the exposure is significant, it 
is the Group’s policy for units to hedge their exposures. The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts to manage 
transaction exposure.
The Group is also subject to exchange risk when making bids, particularly on major contracts, where movements against the 
specific exchange rate assumed within a bid would lead to a change in the anticipated margin on the contract should the bid 
be successful. This exposure to contract risk is hedged if significant.
Translation  exposure
The majority of the Group’s operating capital is employed in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, 
particularly US dollars. As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both net asset values and reported results. This risk 
is not hedged directly, but to the extent that the Group has debt, any that is held in foreign currency would reduce the level of 
net assets exposed to currency fluctuations. The interest expense related to such debt would also reduce the level of earnings 
exposed to exchange rate movements.

Credit risk
The Group is exposed to risk if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Such a risk arises 
principally in relation to receivables due from customers and cash deposited with banks or other financial institutions.
The Group monitors the identity of the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so 
as to control exposure to any territory or institution. As far as it is both feasible and practical to do so, cash is held centrally by the 
Treasury department. Risk is assessed using ratings from major credit rating agencies.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their respective carrying values as at the balance 
sheet date (see 22(i) on page 103). Credit risks arising from acting as guarantor are disclosed in Note 30.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Details of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements in respect of receivables are given in Note 19.
Based on past experience, the directors believe that there is no significant credit risk associated with receivables that are neither 
past due nor impaired. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and performs credit verification 
procedures on all customers. Receivable balances, including uninvoiced receivables reported as amounts due from contract 
customers, are monitored on an ongoing basis.
The Group has not renegotiated the terms of any significant financial assets such that those assets would have been past due 
or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
Capital management
Capital is managed under the Group’s treasury policy. The policy sets out a strategy for the long-term funding of the Group, 
with the objective of ensuring the Group has access to appropriate sources of funding to support its businesses, as and when 
required. Key aspects of the policy are:
• The Group’s debt capacity is determined as part of the annual strategic review process;
• Appropriate contingency levels are maintained to cover unforeseen events;
• Financing is obtained from multiple sources, for example capital markets, bank debt and cash resources;
• Funds are raised from various geographical locations;
• The Group aims to maintain a consistent credit rating;
• The Group aims to maintain strong relationships with its banks and rating agencies;
• Interest cover and other financial ratios (principally the ratio of EBITDA to total borrowings and net finance costs) are 
maintained at appropriate levels, and compliance with covenant arrangements is tested semi-annually. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 103
Group Financial Statements
Funding is arranged centrally and managed by the Treasury department. The Treasury department can make use of a number 
of approved funding instruments, including bilateral bank facilities, syndicated bank facilities, public bonds or loan notes, 
private placements and commercial paper programmes. New long-term funding requires approval under the Group’s Board 
Delegated Authority Levels, with facilities in excess of £100 million requiring Board approval.
The main credit facility in place at 31 March 2011 provides liquidity for the Group until July 2013 and supports the current 
strategy of the Group. This facility, including the related covenant arrangements, is described further in Note 21(ii) and the 
amount of undrawn committed facilities is disclosed in Note 21(iii). Investigations are continually undertaken to review 
alternative financing arrangements. In making those considerations the Board takes into account the cost of any refinancing 
compared to the benefits, which include terms and conditions, the cost of funding and repayment schedules.
There were no significant changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the years ended 31 March 2011 and 
31 March 2010.
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:
As at 31 March Notes

(i)  Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table sets out the classification, carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. 
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties. Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting 
cash flows at prevailing interest rates translated at year end exchange rates. Provisions have been included where there is 
a contractual obligation to settle in cash. 104 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

— Foreign exchange options, swaps and forwards 22(ii) (4) (4) (9) (9)
(544) (544) (532) (532)
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a 
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions 
were used to estimate the fair values:
• Available-for-sale investments: fair values are derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
• Loans and receivables: trade and other receivables; cash and cash equivalents; provisions and trade and other payables: 
the directors consider that the carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
• Short- and long-term bank and other loans; finance leases: fair values are evaluated based on interest rates.
• Derivative financial instruments: foreign exchange swaps and forwards: fair values are derived using forward pricing and 
swap models. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange 
spot and forward rates.
The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees issued 
to customers. The fair value of such indemnities is not material as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is considered 
remote.
At 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010, the Group had no arrangements in place to guarantee borrowings by third parties.
Fair  value  hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation

The Group uses derivatives to hedge currency transaction exposure, currency translation exposure and contract pricing 
exposure. The figures in the above table are analysed by category below.
Foreign  exchange  swaps  and  forwards  used  to  hedge  transaction  exposure
The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made 
by the Group’s units in currencies other than their own functional currency. The turnover (i.e. notional principal) of such 
derivatives (which typically have a term of less than one year), excluding swaps, in the year to 31 March 2011 was £506 million 
(2010: £614 million) and their fair value at 31 March was:

All of these instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges. £8 million losses relating to hedged cash flows that 
have not yet impacted the income statement have been deferred and recognised in equity at 31 March 2011 (2010: £6 million). 
£nil (2010: £3 million gain) has been transferred to the income statement during the year to 31 March 2011 in respect of 
contracts which matured. This amount is included within cost of sales in the income statement.
Foreign  exchange  swaps  and  forwards  used  to  hedge  translation  exposure
The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to match the currency profile of its net debt to that of its net assets, 
revenue and earnings and ensure that it has sufficient cash available to meet its payment obligations by currency as they fall due. 
The fair value of such derivatives (which typically have a term of less than one year) is £nil (2010: £nil).

Warranties are provided for in the normal course of business based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past 
claims. Such costs are generally incurred over the product life cycle. The actual amount of costs that will be incurred will depend 
upon the level and nature of future claims.
Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the 
balance sheet date.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably. 
This generally coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites. These costs 
are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.

Group Financial Statements
Provisions for onerous contracts relate to lease rentals in respect of vacant property and the costs of other onerous contracts. 
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it. The provisions represent the best estimate of the unavoidable costs 
remaining under the current contractual terms of the contracts. These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the 
next 15 years.
Other provisions principally relate to legal claims, claims under workers’ compensation or similar employee disability benefit 
schemes and other miscellaneous obligations. These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next ten years. 
The costs are estimated based on the expected outcome of the legal claim or obligation. The amount of the final liability and 
timing of payment, if any, is dependent upon the final outcome of any litigation or other negotiation involved.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value.
25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates 28 defined contribution schemes. Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes represented 
contributions payable in the year and amounted to £18 million (2010: £12 million). At 31 March 2011, there were £1 million 
(2010: £1 million) of outstanding contributions included in payables.
(ii) Defined benefit schemes — general
The Group operates 56 funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement schemes. Contributions to 
the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant 
scheme. There are two main funded defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the 
rest of the world. The main UK scheme is final salary in nature. The main US Plan ceased to be a final salary scheme following 
its closure to future accrual and the freezing of benefits for existing members with effect from 1 November 2009. 
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme. The Invensys Pension 
Scheme (UK) is a funded defined benefit scheme. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group. 
These assets are managed by trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the scheme’s beneficiaries. The Trustee 
Board is made up of nine directors, four nominated by the Company and five by the members. The Company is responsible 
for appointing the Chairman from the Board. The last full actuarial valuation of the scheme for funding purposes was carried 
out with a valuation date of 31 March 2008 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the 
liabilities. The assumptions that had the most effect on the results of this valuation for funding purposes are those relating to 
the discount rate and inflation on scheme liabilities and mortality assumptions. The current actuarial valuation of the scheme 
for funding purposes with a valuation date of 31 March 2011 is currently underway.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries. Of these the largest Invensys Pension Plan (US) is assessed 
annually by an actuary, and the other overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent 
actuaries in accordance with local practice.
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, the majority of which relate to the provision 
of medical benefits to retired former employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the US. These schemes are generally unfunded.
The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2011 to reflect market conditions and 
material events in the plans.
(iii) Defined benefit schemes — major assumptions
The major assumptions made when valuing the liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows:
As at 31 March 2011 the major financial assumptions are:

1 The assumptions used for medical trend rates for beneficiaries of the US healthcare plan were 8.0% per annum, declining to an ultimate rate of 4.5% per annum 
(2010: 8.3% declining to 4.5%).
2 The pension increase assumption disclosed for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is in line with RPI, subject to a floor of 3.0% and a ceiling of 5.0%.
3 The inflation rate for the UK schemes is based on RPI. An additional inflation rate assumption for CPI is now required for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) (2.95%) and for 
one Other funded scheme (2.95%) to reflect the UK Government’s change of the inflation measure used to determine minimum pension increases which impacts on some 
of the pension increases within these schemes. 108 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

UK  Main  Scheme:  Deferred  pension  increases
In 2010, the UK Government changed the inflation measure used to determine the minimum pension increases to be applied to 
the statutory index-linked features of retirement benefits from the Retail Prices Index (RPI) to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). 
In general, annual CPI increases have been lower than annual RPI increases and therefore the change has reduced the overall 
liabilities of the scheme. The UK Accounting Standards Board has published guidance on how to account for this situation 
for companies that report under UK GAAP. Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) Abstract 48, Accounting implications of the 
replacement of the retail prices index with the consumer prices index for retirement benefits, sets out how to apply the 
requirements of the UK standard FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, to the change from using RPI to using CPI. The Group considers 
that this guidance is relevant and useful when determining how to account for this change under its IFRS accounting policies, 
as the requirements of FRS 17 are substantially the same as the equivalent requirements of IAS 19, Employee Benefits. 
As the scheme was not obligated to increase pensions in line with RPI, the change to using CPI is considered to be a change in 
the increase assumption, and gives rise to an actuarial gain in accordance with IAS 19. In the main, the change to CPI affects only 
deferred pensions and has limited impact on pensions already in payment. The impact of the change is highlighted in Note 25(iv).
The demographic assumptions which were applied for the main schemes are as follows:
Invensys  Pension  Scheme  (UK)
Standard actuarial mortality tables PA92 were adopted using year of birth and medium cohort projections. The probability of 
death at each age was multiplied by 122% for males and 135% for females. Future improvements in life expectancy have been 
allowed for in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a floor of 1.00% for males and 1.25% for females.
By way of illustration the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown 
below:
Years
Retiring today at age 65: Male 21.0
Female 23.5
Retiring in 20 years at age 65: Male 22.8
Female 25.9
Invensys  Pension  Plan  (US)
The mortality table adopted was the RP 2000 Table for combined employee/annuitants, projected to 2015 using projection 
scale AA.

Sensitivities
Invensys  Pension  Scheme  (UK)  and  Invensys  Pension  Plan  (US)
The two largest schemes within the Group are the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) (representing 75% of gross liabilities of all 
defined benefit schemes) and the Invensys Pension Plan (US) (18%). The principal sensitivities, with all other variables held 
constant, for these two schemes are illustrated below:

and inflation assumptions shown.
2 This sensitivity assumes that a 0.1% increase in future inflation expectations result in a 0.1% increase in all inflation related pension increase assumptions. As a result of 
the upper and lower limits on the majority of inflation related pension increases, a given change in the inflation assumption may result in a smaller change in pension 
increase assumptions and hence smaller change in the liabilities (particularly where such a change in inflation is large).
3 This illustrates the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to a 0.1% change in bond yields. The discount rate used to determine the liabilities is based on AA corporate bond 
yields.
4 This sensitivity is not applied to the Invensys Pension Plan (US) because US mortality tables do not use such underpins.

(vii) Impact of IFRIC 14
The Group is committed to make payments to the UK Main Pension Scheme under a deficit funding contribution schedule 
agreed with the trustees. Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the 
scheme as measured under IFRS, and would therefore, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, a provision is 
recognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable. Any surplus on the UK Main Pension Scheme ultimately 
repaid by the trustees would currently be subject to a 35% tax charge prior to being repaid, so a liability for this tax is recognised 
at the relevant balance sheet date. At 31 March 2011 the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability of 
the scheme under IFRS and consequently the irrecoverable element of the pension surplus is £30 million (2010: £30 million).

As required by IAS 19 liabilities for each scheme are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. 
This is an accrued benefits valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for 
projected earnings.
If the UK Main Pension Scheme were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the 
Pensions Act 1995 to fund the UK Main Pension Scheme up to the levels of the cost of buying out the benefits for all scheme 
members with an insurer. This cost would be considerably more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting 
purposes. The deficit in the UK Main Pension Scheme calculated on a winding up basis was approximately £1.4 billion as at 
31 March 2008, the date of the last actuarial valuation. This will be reviewed and updated at the next valuation.

The expected return on each asset class has been determined on the basis of market expectations for the rate of return on 
each asset class over the life of the related obligation, at the balance sheet date. In respect of the UK Main Pension Scheme, 
Government and Corporate Bond indices have been used to set the expected rate of return on bonds, and a risk premium 
has been applied to determine the expected long-term rate of return on equity investments. Similar processes are applied 
to other schemes.
The investment strategy determined by the trustees of the Invensys Pension Scheme continues to reflect the mature nature 
of the scheme with assets predominantly invested in bonds or bond-like investments. 116 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Regarding rates of contributions for future years, the deficit funding contribution schedule for the UK Main Pension Scheme is 
subject to revision after the next triennial valuation which will have a reference date of 31 March 2011. In the meantime, 
contributions to the UK Main Pension Scheme will continue to be made at the rate of 19.8% of pensionable salaries. In addition, 
the Company will continue to make annual supplemental contributions to the scheme. These amount to £39 million in the year 
ending 31 March 2012 increasing by £1 million per annum until 31 March 2014 and then £2 million per annum thereafter until 
2017. Where the proceeds from the sale of a business exceed £1 million, at least 8% of the proceeds net of tax and costs will be 
paid as additional contributions to the UK Main Pension Scheme.
Under the US Plan, contributions will be made at the level required to meet the minimum requirements set forth by the Pension 
Protection Act of 2006 and related regulations. From time to time, discretionary amounts are contributed to enhance the 
security of participants’ benefits based on other considerations, including available cash flow and the Company’s tax position.

Terms and conditions of the above financial liabilities are as follows:
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are on average normally settled on 50-day terms. Interest payable on the Group’s 
borrowing facility is settled quarterly. Other payables include sales taxes, social security and payroll taxes, payroll creditors, 
customer advances (not related to construction contracts), payments received from customers in advance of work performed 
on construction contracts and commissions payable. They are non-interest bearing. The majority of non-current other payables 
will mature in more than one year but in less than two years; there is a small proportion that will mature in over five years. 
The maturity profile of trade and other payables classified as financial liabilities is given in Note 22.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of both current and non-current trade and other payables approximates to 
their fair value.

On 17 June 2010, 13 September 2010, 8 December 2010 and 14 March 2011, conditional awards over a total of 5,267,195 shares 
were granted under the 2007 LTIP (2010: 6,956,484 under the 2007 LTIP).
There were 14,279,061 conditional awards outstanding under the 1998 LTIP and 2007 LTIP at 31 March 2011 (2010: 13,765,202). 
These conditional awards will be released at various dates between 2011 and 2014, subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance requirements and any appropriate holding period. As at 31 March 2011, outstanding shares awarded under 
the CEO Special Award (including shares representing accrued dividends) were 377,861 (2010: 1,608,554). These will be 
released as soon as practicable following a 12-month period from the first release of shares on 25 May 2010.
As at 31 March 2011, outstanding executive share options exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions, at various dates between 2011 and 2012 and at various prices between 154.59 pence and 1,307.31 pence per

Shares held by the Invensys Employee Share Trust
At 31 March 2011, the Invensys No.2 Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) held 716,763 ordinary shares of 10 pence each in 
Invensys plc with a market value of £2 million (2010: 230,380 ordinary shares of 10 pence each with a market value of £1 million). 
The Trust holds ordinary shares in the Company which may be used to deliver ordinary shares under certain executive share 
schemes. All the shares held by the Trust are solely for this purpose and are distributed to employees in accordance with the 
terms of the Company’s schemes. Shares held by the Trust are accounted for as treasury shares and deducted from equity. 
During the year under review the Company established a Rabbi Trust in the US which is used to deliver ordinary shares of the 
Company in the US under certain executive share schemes. The Rabbi Trust held no ordinary shares at 31 March 2011.
Restricted shares
570,076 restricted shares with a market value of £1 million were issued on 15 March 2010 as a replacement award for the 
remaining shares still to be issued under the 2006 LTIP Award, RSP and DSP awards. Participants receiving the restricted shares 
were required to retain them until the service condition was satisfied on the vesting date of the original award in June 2010. 
If the service conditions were not satisfied on this date, legal ownership of the share reverted to Invensys plc. These shares 
were accounted for as treasury shares as at 31 March 2010. There was no equivalent arrangement in place at 31 March 2011. 120 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
28 Nature and purpose of other equity reserves 
The analysis of the balance and movement on other equity reserves is shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The nature and purpose of these reserves are as follows:
Share premium account
This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.
Capital reserve
Previously the Group merger reserve, this reserve was created on the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in February 1999 and 
is non-distributable. 
Special reserve
This reserve represents the balance remaining after the elimination of the deficit in the reserves of the Parent Company following 
the capital reduction on 22 January 2009. The reserve will remain pending the settlement or consent of creditors (or contingent 
creditors) of the Parent Company in existence at the date of the capital reduction. The reserve is non-distributable.
Cash flow hedge reserve
This reserve records, for each hedged item in an effective cash flow hedge, the cumulative change in fair value of the expected 
future cash flow on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge relationship.
Foreign exchange reserve
The foreign exchange reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial Statements 
of foreign subsidiaries. It is also used to record the foreign exchange on net investments in these subsidiaries.
29 Share-based payment plans
Measurement of fair value
Share  awards
An ‘adjusted market value’ method of valuation, based on market value at grant date and market-based performance 
conditions, has been used to calculate the fair value of all share awards granted during the year.
Share  options
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of all share options granted during the year. 
These options were granted under savings related share option schemes for which vesting is not dependent on market 
conditions.
Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous ten years and on 
the implied volatility of traded options of the Group’s shares. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Share-based  payment  expense
The Group recognised total expenses of £9 million (2010: £11 million) related to share-based payment transactions 
during the year, of which £8 million (2010: £9 million) related to equity-settled and £1 million (2010: £2 million) related 
to cash-settled transactions. The carrying amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled awards at 31 March 2011 
is £1 million (2010: £2 million).
The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards have been granted and are outstanding 
as detailed below:
Plans for senior employees
Executive share options
Invensys  1998  Senior  Executive  Share  Option  Scheme
Grant details
An executive share option scheme under which options have been granted to directors and senior executives at no cost. 
Options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle 
market quoted price of the Company’s shares over the five dealing days which precede the date of grant. Options are 
satisfied by the issue of new shares or, in the case of awards granted as share appreciation rights, in cash.

Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: 
Earnings per share (EPS) performance of RPI + 12% over a three-year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when 
the condition is met, or the measurement period, the last financial year of which is the year preceding that, in which the option 
will lapse. 
No performance conditions are attached to the option granted to the former Chief Executive Mr Henriksson under a separate 
arrangement on 1 June 2004.
Service requirements:
The general rule is that the option will forfeit if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable for 
a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The Company can no longer make grants under this scheme as the scheme expired in July 2008.

Long-term incentives
Invensys  1998  Senior  Executive  Long  Term  Incentive  Plan  (LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards were granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) 
cost. Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following 
mechanisms: (a) a nominal or nil price option which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal or nil payment (unless the Company 
determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a notional number of shares). 
Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention 
period. For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 
50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements were released at the end of the performance period 
with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
TSR test
TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (with no retesting opportunities). 
TSR must rank at the median position (when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares 
subject to the award to be available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is 
achieved. Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least median position 
is not achieved the whole award will lapse. The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows:
• awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant; and
• awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, 
Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.

2007  Senior  Executive  Long  Term  Incentive  Plan  (2007  LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost. 
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following 
mechanisms: (a) a nominal or nil price option which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal or nil payment (unless the Company 
determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a nominal number of shares). 
Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the start of the financial year in which the date 
of the award falls. There is no retention period.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
Awards are subject to two independent performance conditions. For executive directors (a) 50% of an award is based on growth 
in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and 
(b) 50% of an award is based on the compound annual growth rate in the Group’s Earnings Per Share. For all other participants 
(a) 35% of an award is based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s 
Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 35% of an award is based on the compound annual growth rate in the Group’s 
Earnings Per Share. There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee retains discretion to ensure that, as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall 
performance of the Group must be satisfactory. Factors that will be taken into account will include EPS growth and the 
Group’s cash position over the performance period.
Service requirements:
The general rule is that the award will forfeit if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released, subject 
to satisfaction of the performance conditions, in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The 2007 LTIP is used as the Group’s main share-based long-term incentive plan under which share awards are granted.

2007  CEO  Special  Award  (Special  Award)
Grant details
Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted 
to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007/08 base salary. The Special Award was subject to a three-year performance 
period ending on 31 March 2010 followed by a holding period and detailed below.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflected those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being 
more demanding. The Special Award was split into two layers, each of which vested on a different basis. For the first layer equal 
to 200% of base salary, 20% would vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance. For the second layer 
equal to 500% of base salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% would vest for maximum 
performance. Vesting in each layer was to be on a straight-line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% would vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP . However, for 
the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting would require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile. This 
was calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poor’s Global 
1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 (i.e. 40%). In addition, the Remuneration Committee retained discretion 
to ensure that as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of the Company had been satisfactory. 
In the case of the TSR performance target, factors that would be taken into account will include EPS growth and the Company’s 
cash position.
Result of performance requirements for CEO Special Award
With regard to the TSR test, the Remuneration Committee determined that 93.0% of the first layer of shares and 91.3% 
of the second layer of shares were available to vest. Of this total, 50% were released as soon as practicable following the 
announcement of the full-year results for 2009/10 and the balance will be released as soon as practicable following a 
12-month period from the first release at 25 May 2010. 
With regard to the EPS part of the award (50%), after considering the 2009/10 audited financial results, the Remuneration 
Committee determined that the threshold level of EPS CAGR required for vesting was not achieved and the shares subject 
to the EPS performance condition, as a result, lapsed.
Service requirements:
The general rule is that the award would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although shares may be released 
in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. The holder left the Company on 
24 March 2011 and the Remuneration Committee permitted retention of the entitlement to the remaining 50% of the 
shares under the Special Award.

Turnaround  Bonus  Overlay  Plan  (TBOP)
Grant details
The Company introduced the TBOP in 2005/06 under which executives had the opportunity to receive a supplemental bonus of 
up to 100% of their base salary in respect of the relevant financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target levels 
of performance. The TBOP operated in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan (EBP). Any bonuses earned under the 
TBOP (the Overlay Bonus) were payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first anniversary 
of those shares being awarded and the other 50% being released following the second anniversary. All awards made under the 
TBOP had been forfeited or exercised by 31 March 2010.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
The amount of the Overlay Bonus (which in turn determines the level of the award) was set by reference to the performance 
targets specified for the executive in the EBP.
Service requirements:
Release of the shares was generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may have been 
released early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. 126 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Scheme use
The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006. It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up 
to and including the financial year 2007/08. However, as a result of the changes made to the annual incentive arrangements 
for 2007/08 onwards, the TBOP ceased one year early. The final awards under the TBOP were granted in the year ended 
31 March 2008 in respect of the financial year 2006/07.
No grants were made in the years ended 31 March 2011 or 31 March 2010.

Deferred  Share  Plan  (DSP)
Grant details
The DSP was introduced in 2007/08 to replace the TBOP. Any bonus earned under the EBP for 2007/08 in excess of target 
performance was paid in deferred shares, with any bonus earned up to the target performance being paid in cash. The 
shares would be released to the individual after three years in the case of executive directors and two years for all other 
participants. For 2008/09 onwards, the DSP is only used for executive directors and members of the Group Leadership 
Team; in all other respects the same terms apply as outlined in the previous paragraph. All awards are satisfied by shares 
purchased in the market.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
The amount of shares granted is set by reference to the performance targets specified for the executive in the EBP.
Service requirements:
Save where a participant is dismissed for cause before the relevant release date, shares under award will be released to 
participants on the release date, unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion should decide on a different 
release date.
Scheme use
The first grant under the DSP was made on 24 July 2008 and was used for all participants in the EBP who earned bonuses 
in excess of target. For 2008/09 onwards, where applicable, bonus in excess of target performance is only paid in deferred 
shares to executive directors and members of the Group Leadership Team. Bonus payments for all other members of the 
EBP are paid entirely in cash.

Group Financial Statements
The Group leases a small proportion of its plant and equipment under finance leases, but does not currently have any significant 
finance lease arrangements. The average effective borrowing rate for the year ended 31 March 2011 was 4% (2010: 7%). The fair 
value of the Group’s finance lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount.
The Group’s finance lease liabilities are secured against the assets to which they relate.
Contingent liabilities
Group companies have given performance guarantees to certain subsidiaries (and certain former subsidiaries prior to disposal) 
in the normal course of business. Counter-indemnities have been received from purchasers in the case of guarantees given in 
favour of former subsidiaries. At the balance sheet date, the directors are not aware of any circumstances that may give rise to 
a liability to the Group under these performance guarantees.
No member of the Group is engaged in nor (so far as the directors are aware) has pending, or is threatened by, or has against 
it any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group, other than

32 Analysis of business combinations and business disposals
(i) Business combinations
Year  ended  31  March  2011
On 21 April 2010, Invensys acquired 100% of the share capital of Skelta Software Private Limited (Skelta), a privately held 
software company headquartered in Bangalore, India, for cash consideration of £6.4 million. Skelta provides business process 
management (BPM) and advanced workflow software solutions. The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition 
method of accounting and the Group Financial Statements include the results of Skelta from its date of acquisition to 31 March 
2011.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Skelta at the date of acquisition was:

Net cash outflow (6.1)
1 The intangible assets acquired relate to capitalised development costs.
Trade and other receivables includes trade receivables of £0.7 million. The gross contractual amount of trade receivables is 
£1.2 million. £0.5 million of the trade receivables have been impaired, £0.2 million has been collected and it is expected that 
£0.5 million of the remaining contractual amount can be collected.
The goodwill shown above is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits arising from combining the assets and 
activities of Skelta with those of the Group. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Costs relating to the acquisition of Skelta of £0.3 million have been expensed in the year and are included in exceptional items 
in the income statement.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, costs of up to £2.0 million will become payable to the former owners of Skelta 
dependent on the achievement of certain agreed performance targets subsequent to the acquisition of Skelta by the Group.
From its acquisition date of 21 April 2010, Skelta has contributed a profit of £0.1 million to the net profit before tax of the Group 
and revenue of £2.2 million. These amounts are included in the Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2011. 
Had Skelta been part of the Group for the whole of the year ended 31 March 2011, the profit and revenue of the Group for the 
year would not have been materially different from the amounts shown in the Group Financial Statements.

No operations have been discontinued in the years to 31 March 2011 or 31 March 2010. In the year ended 31 March 2011, the 
Group disposed of net assets of £4 million relating to a small European business in Invensys Controls. The sale completed 
on 31 December 2010 for cash consideration of £5 million. The net assets sold comprised property, plant and equipment of 
£4 million, working capital of £1 million and pension liabilities of £1 million. The gain on disposal of £1 million is included within 
exceptional items in the income statement. The assets and liabilities had not been treated as held for sale and prior to their 
disposal, were included in the Invensys Controls operating segment. Additional costs have also been incurred in both years, 
in relation to prior year disposals.

33 Directors’ loan and pension commutation
Director’s loan
The following loans were made to Mr Henriksson while he was a director of the Company. Mr Henriksson left the Company on 
24 March 2011.
Year  ended  31  March  2010
Mr Henriksson incurs both US and UK tax liabilities in respect of his employment duties undertaken in the US. Deloitte LLP 
has advised that the UK tax liabilities paid by Mr Henriksson in respect of such duties should be refunded to him by HM Revenue 
and Customs (HMRC). However, such refund was delayed pending a determination by the US and UK tax authorities of the 
relevant treaty provisions. In view of the double taxation suffered, Invensys Systems Inc. advanced £546,000 on 14 April 2009 
to Mr Henriksson, being an amount equal to the expected refunds due from HMRC. This loan was free of any interest and was 
repayable within five business days from the date of HMRC making the refund to Mr Henriksson. The refund was paid by HMRC 
on 28 June 2010 and Mr Henriksson subsequently repaid the loan within five business days as required.
Year  ended  31  March  2011
A further loan of £312,691 was advanced to Mr Henriksson on 29 June 2010 in respect of the double taxation suffered in respect 
of his US employment duties in 2009/10 pending the refund of the amount by HMRC. This loan was made on the same terms as 
the previous loan, and will be repayable within five business days from the date of HMRC making the refund to Mr Henriksson. 
Mr Henriksson’s repayment obligations are not affected by the termination of his employment with the Company.
Director’s pension commutation
Year  ended  31  March  2010
Kathleen O’Donovan left Invensys as Chief Financial Officer on 31 December 2002. Part of her pension entitlement for service at 
Invensys was provided through an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (UURBS). As permitted by her termination 
agreement, Ms O’Donovan requested a commutation of her UURBS during the year. The Remuneration Committee agreed to 
pay £2.1 million commutation on a fair value basis, resulting in a reduction in the accrued IAS 19 pension liability. The cash 
settlement was made in March 2010, in addition, the Company bore National Insurance costs of £268,800.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Invensys plc
We have audited the Parent Company Financial Statements of 
Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 which comprise 
the Parent Company balance sheet and the related Notes 1 to 13. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 64, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Parent Company  
Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the Parent Company Financial Statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the Parent Company Financial 
Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the Parent 
Company Financial Statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on Parent Company Financial Statements
In our opinion the Parent Company Financial Statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 31 March 2011;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the Financial Statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Parent Company Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group Financial Statements 
of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2011.

Parent Company accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention 
and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. 
The policies are consistent with the previous year except for the 
adoption of the following amended standards and new Urgent 
Issues Task Force (UITF) abstract:
• Amendment to FRS 25 (IAS 32), Financial Instruments: 
Presentation — Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations 
Arising on Liquidation
• Amendment to FRS 26 (IAS 39), Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement — Eligible Hedged Items
• FRS 30, Heritage Assets
• Amendment to FRS 20 (IFRS 2) Group Cash-settled Share-based 
Payment Transactions
• Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2009
• Amendment to FRS 25 (IAS 32), Financial Instruments: 
Presentation — Classification of Rights Issues
• UITF 48, Accounting implications of the replacement of 
the retail prices index with the consumer prices index for 
retirement benefits.
The amendment to FRS 20 (IFRS 2) Group Cash-settled Share-
based Payment Transactions has resulted in the Company 
recognising in its separate accounts the financial effect of share 
options and awards over its equity shares granted to employees 
of subsidiary undertakings. Previously the Company recognised 
only those options and awards made to employees of the 
Company itself. For options and awards made to employees of 
subsidiary undertakings, the Company records an increase in its 
investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the 
FRS 20 cost in subsidiary undertakings. This change in accounting 
has been applied retrospectively, subject to the transitional 
arrangements of FRS 20. The effect of the change has been to 
increase shareholders’ funds and net assets by £33 million at 
31 March 2010.
Adoption of the other amended standards and the new UITF 
abstract has not had any material effect on the Financial 
Statements of the Company.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are included in the profit and loss 
account for the year.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing retirement 
benefits to employees during the year is charged to operating 
profit or loss in the year. The cost of providing benefits under the 
defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each scheme 
using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The 
full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past 
service that vests immediately is also charged to operating profit 
or loss in the year. The net surplus or deficit on defined benefit 
pension schemes is reported on the balance sheet within the 
pension asset or liability.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit 
and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions 
payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable 
in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as 
accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less 
provisions for impairment where a permanent diminution in value 
has been identified.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Debt instruments
Borrowings are stated at net proceeds received after deduction of 
issue costs. The issue costs of debt instruments are amortised over 
the life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of all timing 
differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that 
date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right 
to pay less tax, in the future. Timing differences arise from the 
inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation computations 
in periods different to those in which they are included in the 
financial statements.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can 
be deducted.
Deferred income tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 139
Parent Company Financial Statements
Share-based payment
The Company operates various equity-settled and cash-settled 
share schemes. For equity-settled share options, the services 
received from employees are measured by reference to the fair 
value of the share options. The fair value is calculated at grant date 
using a valuation model and recognised in the profit and loss 
account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ 
equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an 
estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest. Vesting 
conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into 
account when estimating the fair value. Market conditions are 
those conditions that are linked to the share price of the Company. 
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated 
based on the share price at the grant date and, where applicable, 
any market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting 
period based on the number of shares expected to vest. No 
expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition; which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance or service conditions 
are satisfied.
The financial effect of share options and awards over its equity 
shares granted to employees of subsidiary undertakings are 
recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements. 
In particular, the Company records an increase in its investment in 
subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the FRS 20 cost 
in subsidiary undertakings.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if 
the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award 
are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification 
that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment 
transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if 
it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes 
any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either 
the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award 
is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a 
replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and 
new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original 
award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations 
of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from 
employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and 
recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period. The fair value of the liability is remeasured 
at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes 
in fair value recognised in the profit and loss account.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements in FRS 20 
(IFRS 2), Share-based Payment, the requirements of FRS 20 have 
not been applied to equity instruments granted on or before 
7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (treasury shares) 
are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit 
or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s 
own equity instruments. Treasury shares are purchased and held 
by the Employee Share Trust to meet future distributions of shares 
to employees under the Group’s various share option and share 
award schemes. 
Dividend income 
Revenue is recognised when the Company’s right to receive 
payment is established. 140 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

8 Pensions and post-retirement benefits
(i) Pensions and post-retirement benefits
The Company operates one unfunded defined benefit pension scheme. The last full valuation of the scheme on a FRS 17 (IAS 19) 
basis has been updated to 31 March 2011, to reflect market conditions and material events in the plan.
The Company also participates in the UK Main Pension Scheme, which is the principal Group scheme covering the majority 
of UK employees. The UK Main Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme. However, the Company is unable to 
separately identify on a consistent and reasonable basis its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined 
benefit scheme to which it participates, mainly because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate information for disposed 
companies and the subjective nature of any allocation basis. Therefore the Company accounts for this scheme as a defined 
contribution scheme, in accordance with the provisions of FRS 17. The scheme is currently in deficit on an IAS 19 basis using the 
projected credit actuarial valuation method to determine the scheme’s liabilities. Details of the scheme and its deficit are 
included in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 19, 
which are generally equivalent to those of FRS 17. 
Pension costs in respect of the UK Main Pension Scheme represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to £nil 
(2010: £nil). At 31 March 2011, the outstanding contributions included in creditors were £nil (2010: £nil).

Long-term incentives
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards were granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) 
cost. Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following 
mechanisms: (a) a nominal or nil price option which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal or nil payment (unless the Company 
determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a notional number of shares). 
Awards are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention 
period. For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 
50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements were released at the end of the performance period 
with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
TSR test
TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (with no retesting opportunities). 
TSR must rank at the median position (when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares 
subject to the award to be available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is 
achieved. Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least median position 
is not achieved the whole award will lapse. The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows: 
• awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant; and
• awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, 
Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
Overall performance test
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: (a) for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there has been a sustained 
delivery over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds 
and reduction in Group indebtedness; (b) for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: 
(1) achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items; and  
(c) for awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests have been met: (1) relating to the successful completion 
of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance 
of the Group; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items.
Service requirements: 
The general rule is that the award will forfeit if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released  
subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the 
Remuneration Committee.

Invensys 2007 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) 
cost. Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following 
mechanisms: for awards granted up to and including 7 March 2008 (a) a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire 
shares for a nominal payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award 
(granted in respect of a nominal number of shares); and for awards granted from 8 March 2008 to date (a) a nominal price option 
award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); or (b) a conditional 
share award. Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the start of the financial year in 
which the date of the award falls. There is no retention period.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
Awards are subject to two independent performance conditions. For executive directors (a) 50% of an award is based on growth 
in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 
50% of an award is based on the compound annual growth rate in the Group’s Earnings Per Share. For all other participants (a) 
35% of an award is based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 
1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 35% of an award is based on the compound annual growth rate in the Group’s Earnings 
Per Share. There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award. In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion to ensure that, as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of 
the Group must be satisfactory. Factors that will be taken into account will include EPS growth and the Group’s cash position 
over the performance period.
Service requirements: 
The general rule is that the award will forfeit if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released, subject 
to satisfaction of the performance conditions, in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.

2007 CEO Special Award (Special Award)
Grant details
Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted 
to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007/08 base salary. The Special Award was subject to a three-year performance 
period ending on 31 March 2010 followed by a holding period and detailed below.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflected those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being 
more demanding. The Special Award was split into two layers, each of which vested on a different basis. For the first layer equal 
to 200% of base salary, 20% would vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance. For the second layer 
equal to 500% of base salary, there would be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% would vest for maximum 
performance. Vesting in each layer was to be on a straight-line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% would vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP. 
However, for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting would require more stretching performance equivalent 
to upper quintile. This was calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the 
Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 (i.e. 40%). In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee retained discretion to ensure that as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of 
the Company had been satisfactory. In the case of the TSR performance target, factors that would be taken into account will 
include EPS growth and the Company’s cash position.
Result of Performance Requirements for CEO Special Award
With regard to the TSR test, the Remuneration Committee determined that 93.0% of the first layer of shares and 91.3% 
of the second layer of shares were available to vest. Of this total, 50% were released as soon as practicable following the 
announcement of the full-year results for 2009/10 and the balance will be released as soon as practicable following a 
12-month period from the first release at 25 May 2010.
With regard to the EPS part of the award (50%), after considering the 2009/10 audited financial results, the Remuneration 
Committee determined that the threshold level of EPS CAGR required for vesting was not achieved and the shares subject 
to the EPS performance condition, as a result, lapsed.
Service requirements:
The general rule is that the award would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although shares may be released in 
defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. The holder left the Company on 24 March 2011 
and the Remuneration Committee permitted retention of the entitlement to the remaining 50% of the shares under the 
Special Award. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.invensys.com | 149

Awards are not subject to specific performance conditions apart from continued employment throughout the vesting period 
and satisfactory personal performance.
Service requirements:
The general rule is that the award will forfeit if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined 
good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The plan is operated predominantly for senior executives in special circumstances, such as recruitment and retention situations.

Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP)
Grant details
The Company introduced the TBOP in 2005/06 under which executives had the opportunity to receive a supplemental bonus 
of up to 100% of their base salary in respect of the relevant financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target 
levels of performance. The TBOP operated in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan (EBP). Any bonuses earned under 
the TBOP (the Overlay Bonus) were payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first 
anniversary of those shares being awarded and the other 50% being released following the second anniversary. All awards 
made under the TBOP had been forfeited and exercised by 31 March 2010.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
The amount of the Overlay Bonus (which in turn determines the level of the award) was set by reference to the performance 
targets specified for the executive in the EBP.
Service requirements:
Release of the shares was generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may have been 
released early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006. It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up 
to and including the financial year 2007/08. However, as a result of the changes made to the annual incentive arrangements 
for 2007/08 onwards, the TBOP ceased one year early. The final awards under the TBOP were granted in the year ended 
31 March 2008 in respect of the financial year 2006/07.
No grants were made in the years ended 31 March 2011 or 31 March 2010.

Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
Grant details
The DSP was introduced in 2007/08 to replace the TBOP. Any bonus earned under the EBP for 2007/08 in excess of target 
performance was paid in deferred shares, with any bonus earned up to the target performance being paid in cash. The shares 
would be released to the individual after three years in the case of executive directors and two years for all other participants. 
For 2008/09 onwards, the DSP is only used for executive directors and members of the Group Leadership Team; in all other 
respects the same terms apply as outlined in the previous paragraph. All awards are satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
The amount of shares granted is set by reference to the performance targets specified for the executive in the EBP.
Service requirements:
Save where a participant is dismissed for cause before the relevant release date, shares under award will be released to 
participants on the release date, unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion should decide on a different 
release date.
Scheme use
The first grant under the DSP was made on 24 July 2008 and was used for all participants in the EBP who earned bonuses in 
excess of target. For 2008/09 onwards, where applicable, bonus in excess of target performance is only paid in deferred shares 
to executive directors and members of the Group Leadership Team. Bonus payments for all other members of the EBP are paid 
entirely in cash.

(2010: 2.0 years).
Measurement of fair value
Share awards
An ‘adjusted market value’ method of valuation, based on market value at grant date and market-based performance conditions 
has been used to calculate the fair value of all share awards granted during the year.
Share-based payment expense
The Company recognised total expenses of £nil (2010: £nil) related to equity settled share-based payment transactions during 
the year. 152 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
13 Deferred income tax assets
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of £28 million with a tax value of £7 million 
(2010: £26 million with a tax value of £7 million) in respect of pension obligations.
The Company has unrecognised income tax losses of £51 million with a tax value of £13 million (2010: £51 million with a tax value 
of £14 million) available for offset against future profits.
The Company has unrecognised capital losses of £50 million (2010: £50 million) that are only available for offset against future 
capital gains. These capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax will reduce to 26% from 1 April 2011 and will continue to fall by 1% each year to 23% in 
2014. The impact of the rate change to 23% would reduce the total unrecognised deferred income tax assets by £4 million.

Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM is the Company’s principal forum for communication 
with private shareholders. Investors holding shares in the 
Company through a nominee service should arrange to be 
appointed as a corporate representative or proxy in respect 
of their shareholding in order to attend and vote at the meeting. 
The 2011 AGM will be held on Thursday, 28 July 2011 at 11.00am 
at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, 
Westminster, London SW1P 3EE.
ShareGift
Shareholders with small holdings of shares who do not wish to 
sell such shares because the sales commission applied would be 
disproportionate to the sale price may consider donating them to 
charity. The Orr Mackintosh Foundation operates a charity share 
donation scheme, ShareGift.
ShareGift can be contacted at 17 Carlton House Terrace, London 
SW1Y 5AH or by telephone on +44 (0)20 7930 3737 or online at 
www.sharegift.org
Dividend
Subject to shareholder approval, the directors recommend a 
2010/11 final dividend of 2.5 pence per share (2010: 2.0 pence per 
share). The total dividends for the year ended 31 March 2011 are 
4.0 pence per share (2010: 3.0 pence per share).
As dividends are currently only paid in sterling, for overseas 
shareholders with small shareholdings it may not be economically 
viable for them to convert sterling payments into their local 
currency. Shareholders can, should they so wish, arrange for 
their dividends to be paid to a charity in the UK. ShareGift is a 
UK registered charity which takes unwanted shares and donations 
and uses the proceeds to make donations to a wide range of other 
UK registered charities.
In order to donate outstanding dividend payments to charity, 
shareholders need to send a signed letter of authority to Equiniti 
asking them to make all outstanding payments payable to 
ShareGift or another charity. If not ShareGift, the charity’s full 
name and address needs to be included.
For future dividends, if shareholders wish for these to be paid 
direct to ShareGift, this needs to be clearly stated in their letter of 
authority. For all other charities, shareholders will need to include 
the charity’s bank account details to enable the payments to be 
made by Equiniti via BACS.
The Company has decided to introduce a dividend reinvestment 
plan (DRIP) beginning with this final dividend, which will enable 
shareholders to reinvest their dividends directly into Invensys 
shares. Details of the DRIP are contained in separate 
documentation mailed to shareholders.
In future the Company will issue a consolidated tax voucher to 
those shareholders who receive dividends direct to their bank 
accounts. This will be issued in December of each year when the 
interim dividend (if any) is normally paid, unless shareholders 
advise the registrars in writing that they wish to receive a separate 
tax voucher with each dividend payment. Institutions and other 
companies that hold shares in the Company will continue to 
receive a tax voucher for each dividend payment.

Criminals may steal your personal information, putting your 
shareholding at risk. Tips on protecting your shareholding:
• Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold 
your shares electronically in CREST via a nominee.
• Keep all correspondence from the registrars which shows 
your shareholder reference number in a safe place, or destroy 
correspondence by shredding.
• If you change address, inform the registrars. If you receive a 
letter from the registrars regarding a change of address and 
have not recently moved, please contact them immediately. 
You may be the victim of identity theft.
• If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers 
registered in your country of residence or the UK.

Warning to shareholders
In recent years, many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a 
connection to the company concerned. These are typically from 
overseas-based “brokers” who target UK shareholders, offering 
to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares 
in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 
2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) reported 
that the average amount lost by investors is around £20,000. It is 
not just the novice investor who has been duped in this way: many 
of the victims had been successfully investing for several years. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports about 
the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and 
organisation and make a record of any other information 
they give you (e.g. telephone number, address, etc.).
• Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA 
before getting involved. You can check at  
www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do
• The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised 
overseas firms who are targeting or have targeted UK investors, 
and any approach from such organisations should be reported 
to the FSA, so that this list can be kept up-to-date and any other 
appropriate action can be considered.
• If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. The FSA can be contacted on 0845 606 1234 or by 
completing an online form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/
regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml
• Inform the Company’s registrars on 0871 384 2036. They are not 
able to investigate such incidents themselves but will record the 
details and pass them on to the Company and liaise with the FSA.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses 
will be included in Company mailings.

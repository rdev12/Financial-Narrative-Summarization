WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Our good results were achieved despite 
heightened levels of uncertainty in 
world markets with exchange rate 
volatility and lower growth in many 
of the world’s developed economies.
>
Performance
I am pleased to report that the Group 
delivered another set of good results 
against a background of continued 
challenges in the broader macroeconomic 
environment. During the year, we made 
further progress on the delivery of our 
strategy. Our portfolio optimisation 
is now largely complete and our margin 
progression has continued towards 
our 8% goal. We were also pleased 
to have recently completed a number 
of acquisitions during the period.
Macroeconomic environment
Our results were achieved despite 
heightened levels of uncertainty in world 
markets with exchange rate volatility 
and lower growth in many of the world’s 
developed economies. Falling oil prices, 
volatile stock markets, and economic and 
political uncertainties affected many of 
our regions. The falling oil price has led 
the world’s oil companies to review 
capital expenditure and also affected 
the economic climate in the Middle East. 
China’s recent higher growth rate 
declined somewhat and that, coupled 
with the Government’s introduction of 
a programme of anti-corruption initiatives, 
led to deferrals in the award of projects 
and payments. Delays in project approvals 
also affected Hong Kong, following the 
pro-democracy activity.
In the UK, the Government’s commitment 
to infrastructure investment continued 
with major programmes in the rail, 
road and water sectors all progressing 
as expected. 
In North America, the economic recovery 
was encouraging but remains fragile with 
long-term visibility around infrastructure 
investment being impacted by the uncertain 
political environment. 
Strategy
Our operational excellence programme 
is delivering efficiencies, particularly in 
North America. In addition, on 1 April 2015 
we reorganised our UK business to enhance 
our client focus, improve efficiency and 
drive business performance.
Chairman’s statement  Strategic Report 07 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Investor Information
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Chairman’s statement continued
and our flexible working practices have 
been introduced across our Energy 
business and in our global design centres. 
Our Energy business is also piloting a 
programme to support women returning 
to work after maternity leave. In the 
UK, we were delighted to be recognised 
as one of The Times Top 50 Employers 
for Women 2015.
During the year, we have invested in our 
brand to create a new purpose statement 
to capture the ‘what’, ‘how’ and ‘why’ 
of Atkins. Rather than simply what we do, 
we want to be known for what we stand 
for, the things that drive us, and the way 
we work. Our purpose brings all that 
together in one description and is outlined 
in the Strategy section (page 19).
Board of directors
Rodney Slater and Alun Griffiths retired 
from the Board at our annual general 
meeting on 30 July 2014. Rodney served 
the Board for three years and I would like 
to thank him for his input during that 
time. Alun was with the Group for 
28 years and served on the Board as 
an executive director for seven years; 
he was succeeded as Group HR director 
by James Cullens. During his tenure, 
Alun made a significant contribution to 
the Board and more broadly throughout 
the Company. He will be missed 
and I would like to thank Alun for his 
longstanding dedication to the Group. 
I am delighted to welcome Catherine 
Bradley to the Board. She joined as a 
non-executive director on 9 June 2015 
and brings significant corporate finance 
and acquisition experience obtained 
in the UK, Asia, the US and Europe.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 25.5p per ordinary share in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2015, 
making the total dividend for the year 
36.5p (2014: 33.75p), an increase of 
8.1%. If approved at the Company’s 
annual general meeting, the dividend will 
be paid on 21 August 2015 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register on 10 July 2015. 
Further details regarding dividend 
payments can be found in Investor 
Information (page 203).
Outlook
The Group has maintained its resilience 
to challenging markets worldwide 
through the breadth and depth of its 
market positioning. 2015 continues to see 
a heightened level of uncertainty in world 
markets with the consensus of forecasts 
of world economic growth between  
2.8% and 3.8% overall, but with 
significant regional variations. Sustained 
low oil prices and economic and political 
uncertainties provide a complex backdrop 
to near-term developments.
In the UK, we are encouraged by 
the continuing overall commitment by 
the recently elected Government 
to infrastructure and the National 
Infrastructure Plan and we believe our 
refreshed operating model positions 
us well to take full advantage of this. 
In North America, as our technical 
professional organisation matures, we 
expect productivity will continue to 
increase and help drive further margin 
improvement. In Energy we see a good 
pipeline of work across nuclear and 
renewable balancing ongoing staff 
reductions in oil and gas. In the Middle 
East economies, the reduction in oil prices 
may have some near-term impacts on 
decision making and the launch of major 
capital spending commitments. However, 
we believe essential infrastructure will 
remain a priority and the long-term 
objectives of governments in core markets 
are unlikely to be diverted significantly. 
Asia Pacific remains well placed to deliver 
on its strategic growth plan, helped by 
the acquisition of Confluence in 2013. 
Overall, the outlook remains positive.
Allan Cook CBE
Chairman
10 June 2015
We also completed a number of strategic 
acquisitions in North America and Europe. 
In September 2014 we received approval 
from the US Government which facilitated 
the successful completion of our 
acquisition of Nuclear Safety Associates. 
This acquisition will enhance the capability 
of our Energy business, and extend our 
nuclear footprint in North America in 
the federal and commercial US nuclear 
industries. In October 2014, we acquired 
Houston Offshore Engineering, a leading 
offshore oil and gas business based 
in Houston, Texas. This business brings 
to the Group vast experience in the 
design of offshore deep water floating 
production platforms. Our acquisition of 
Terramar, one of Norway’s leading project 
management consultancy firms, was 
also completed during the third quarter. 
In September 2014, we completed the 
disposal of our 77 person business in 
Poland to Multiconsult, a Norwegian  
multidisciplinary consultancy and design 
business. We intend to exit the Portuguese 
market where we currently employ 
48 staff.
People
We are fortunate to have a team of 
excellent people around the world who 
are winning and delivering fantastic work. 
They play a central role in everything that 
we do and I would like to thank them for 
their continued outstanding contribution. 
Together, we’re making a huge difference.
We continue to maintain our focus on 
inspiring and encouraging more young 
people to pursue a career in the 
engineering sector. During the year, 
we welcomed almost 400 new graduates 
across the Group and accelerated our 
apprentice programme by recruiting 
71 apprentices within our UK business.
A more diverse workforce can help to 
address the critical skill shortage in parts 
of our business and our commitment 
to building a more diverse organisation 
continues to gain momentum. We have 
increased the number of our women’s 
professional networks around the world  08 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
CEO’s statement
We have delivered another 
year of good results and 
demonstrated that our strategy 
is working.
>
We delivered good results this year. 
We are pleased to report that we have 
made progress in all areas of our strategy, 
which comprises the three pillars of 
operational excellence, portfolio 
optimisation and sector and regional 
focus. We have delivered efficiencies, 
particularly in North America and, on 
1 April 2015, we reorganised our UK 
business to enhance our client focus, 
improve efficiency and drive business 
performance. Our focus on growing 
organically has been boosted this year 
with strategic acquisitions in Europe and 
North America. Together, these actions 
are resulting in tangible progress towards 
our 8% margin goal as evidenced 
by solid growth in profitability and 
excellent cash performance.
Business performance
Our underlying profit before tax was 
£121.9m, an increase of 14.6% over 
last year’s profit of £106.4m, on revenue 
that increased 0.4% to £1.76bn 
(2014: £1.75bn). This profit includes 
the benefit of £5.0m of research and 
development expenditure credit following 
early adoption of new rules in the UK. 
In previous years the equivalent benefit 
was shown as a reduction in the tax charge. 
As discussed in more detail in the Business 
review (page 23), we believe underlying 
profit is a more representative measure 
of performance, removing the items that 
may give a distorted view of performance. 
The unadjusted reported profit before 
tax was £106.7m (2014: £114.2m). 
Revenue and profit before tax were 
adversely affected by currency headwinds 
of £22.8m and £1.1m respectively against 
a constant currency basis. 
Reported operating profit was £118.5m 
(2014: £113.7m), at a margin of 6.7% 
(2014: 6.5%), while the more representative 
underlying operating profit was £134.1m 
(2014: £116.4m) giving an improved 
underlying margin of 7.6% (2014: 6.7%).  Strategic Report 09

CEO’s statement continued
In Scandinavia, we continue to work 
across a number of important rail and 
road infrastructure projects. We believe 
that the strategic acquisition of Terramar 
will position us to secure further work 
in the well-funded infrastructure markets 
in Norway, as well as unlocking further 
project management opportunities. 
In North America, we saw an improvement 
in both operating profit and margin as we 
embedded our new operating structure, 
despite a first half impacted by currency 
headwinds. Our consultancy business’s 
more focused, client-centric model made 
solid progress, increasing win rates and 
positioning the business to maximise 
existing relationships and create new 
opportunities. We benefited from good 
new contract wins in the environmental 
and general engineering services areas 
of our business in Florida, Nevada and 
Colorado, and were reappointed on 
significant contracts for the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency as 
well as contracts to oversee transport 
solutions for highways authorities in 
Florida, Texas and Georgia. Our strategic 
ventures business completed its first year 
of operation with a diverse portfolio of 
rail, transit and energy and renewables 
clients. Faithful+Gould had a quieter year 
following the conclusion of some client 
programmes and we were impacted 
by cost reduction measures taken by 
clients in the oil and gas sector.
I am pleased to report that our 
Middle East business delivered a strong 
overall performance this financial year, 
with revenue and operating profit up 
significantly as we continued our focus 
on major projects and programmes in 
rail, infrastructure and property. Good 
progress was made on the mobilisation 
and design delivery for our major metro 
projects, including Riyadh Metro, Doha 
Metro Red Line South and Doha Metro 
Gold Line, the latter a notable win in 
the first half of the year. There continues 
to be demand for metro projects across 
the region, with further opportunities 
to work selectively for design and build 
contractors. Our work with the Qatari 
Government, advising on infrastructure 
planning and design projects to meet its 
National Vision 2030, has continued 
through the year. Property sector activity 
in the United Arab Emirates experienced 
an upturn in confidence in 2014 resulting 
in increased property workloads with 
selective clients. Our Faithful+Gould 
business had a strong year with growth 
across the region buoyed by the 
Confluence acquisition in 2013, which 
added project management strength. 
We have also seen a number of successes 
in the property sector.
Our Asia Pacific region had a good 
year, particularly in our core markets 
of Hong Kong and China, despite the 
Government’s introduction of anti-
corruption measures and the subsequent 
slowdown in contract awards in mainland 
China and the impact of pro-democracy 
demonstrations in Hong Kong. Our 
work outside the region with Chinese 
contractors continued to gain momentum. 
We are focused on expanding our 
footprint in southeast Asia. In Indonesia 
we won a substantial masterplanning 
project and in Malaysia and Vietnam we 
continue to pursue projects selectively 
in the transport and property sectors. 
The acquisition of Confluence, through 
our Faithful+Gould business in the region, 
has enabled us to achieve particular 
success in Singapore on several high 
profile projects in more diverse sectors 
and strengthened our multidisciplinary 
offering to clients.
The net profit on disposal of £0.4m 
is explained in more detail in note 8 
to the Financial Statements (page 153) 
and comprises £0.5m of deferred 
consideration received in relation to 
our previously disposed UK highways 
services business and a loss of £0.1m 
on the disposal of our Polish business.
Headcount closed the year at 18,462 
(2014: 17,489), reflecting organic 
headcount growth and the acquisitions of 
Nuclear Safety Associates (NSA), Houston 
Offshore Engineering (HOE) and Terramar.
Our United Kingdom and Europe business 
saw a much improved second half 
performance after a mixed first half. 
We faced a market downturn in our 
aerospace business in the year and 
our profitability was also affected by a 
number of contract variation negotiations 
in our UK rail business, which have now 
been largely resolved. By contrast, our 
highways and transportation and design 
and engineering businesses continued 
to benefit from the UK Government’s 
focus on infrastructure investment. Our 
highways and transportation business 
won significant contracts for Highways 
England as one of its key suppliers on 
the Collaborative Delivery Framework 
and also for the Welsh Government’s M4 
corridor project and Transport Scotland’s 
A9 upgrade. All sectors of our design and 
engineering business have strong pipelines 
of secured workload and opportunities. 
Our rail business remains busy, operating 
at a high level of staff utilisation, 
reflecting strong markets in the areas 
of signalling, electrification and station 
design. Our water and environment 
business returned to growth during the 
second half of the year. This improved 
performance was due to increased 
volumes from contracts secured with 
water utility clients for the 2015 to 
2020 regulatory period (AMP6). Our 
Faithful+Gould business has performed 
well with continued signs of recovery 
in the market. 10 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
CEO’s statement continued
Our Energy business continued to perform 
well despite the effect of the falling oil 
price. During the year, we were delighted 
to complete two acquisitions in North 
America. In October, the successful 
acquisition of HOE added 150 people in 
North America with world class skills in 
deepwater floating production platforms, 
while the completion of the NSA purchase 
added 130 specialists in nuclear safety, 
design engineering, and professional 
security services. Our expertise and 
international footprint has helped us 
secure long-term framework agreements 
for both consultancy and design services 
for major international oil and gas 
operators and our international nuclear 
portfolio remains strong. The Middle East 
market continues to provide opportunities 
for growth with a strong pipeline of work, 
including the recent award of a contract 
to provide engineering services to 
Shanghai Electric Power Construction 
Corporation in support of Aramco. 
Priorities
We are committed to becoming an 
even more responsible and sustainable 
organisation. During the year, this has 
been supported by the introduction of 
our new code of conduct, Behaving the 
Atkins Way. The code provides a strong 
leadership statement and direction and 
emphasises the importance of ensuring 
the safety and wellbeing of all our people 
while encouraging and empowering 
them to challenge and raise concerns 
about any dishonest, unethical, 
unacceptable or unsafe behaviour.
Work to implement our strategy 
continues. We see attractive prospects 
in a number of our existing sectors, most 
notably Energy. Other sectors on which 
we place a particular focus will evolve over 
time. Security remains an attractive sector 
but is not yet a business of scale. The 
challenging environment in aerospace has 
also seen a reduction of the market and 
this will be less of a focus area in future. 
We continue to expand our market facing 
offering in geographic areas where we 
already have a presence, for example in 
Asia Pacific.
Conclusion
These results could not have been 
achieved without the hard work of 
our people worldwide and I would like 
to thank them all for their dedication, 
for their focus and the way they work 
together as one Atkins to truly make 
a difference for our clients.
We have delivered another year of 
good results and demonstrated that 
our strategy is working. Organic growth 
remains our priority but, during the year, 
we have underpinned it with acquisitions 
that added new skills and expanded 
our regional presence while successfully 
disposing of our Polish business. We start 
the new financial year with an attractive 
pipeline of opportunities across the 
Group and a strong balance sheet. 
Our operational excellence programme 
continues to maintain our focus on 
improving our overall operating margin, 
towards our 8% goal. We are confident 
of delivering further growth in the 
coming year.

Our business
Our business model
Design, engineering and project 
management services are key to 
infrastructure development. When clients 
are undertaking capital projects they  
need professional support with planning, 
designing and enabling activities – 
from policy, strategic choices, feasibility, 
concept and detailed design, through to 
project and programme management, 
implementation and operation. At each 
stage, services are sought from design, 
engineering and project management 
consultancies.
 
Large or particularly complex projects 
may only be able to be undertaken by 
organisations of scale, where a breadth of 
expertise and deep technical knowledge 
must be applied in combination to deliver 
the project.
Our business may be characterised 
as follows:
•	 we are a people business selling the 
specialist output from our talented 
teams
•	 the services we provide demand 
high end critical thinking and expert 
judgement
•	 we operate in many parts of the world 
and in many market sectors 
•	 we undertake projects of different sizes 
but increasingly those of larger scale  
and complexity.
How we add value
Our strength lies in our client relationships 
and the breadth and depth of our 
technical expertise, which enables us to 
provide practical solutions to the most 
complex challenges for clients in a number 
of sectors. 
Our differentiators
We aim to put our clients at the centre 
of what we do, work more collaboratively 
and exploit technology wherever we can 
to secure our future profitable growth. 
Clients
Our thought leadership, key account 
management and agility place us well for 
increased client intimacy and focus. We 
focus on winning work and delivering 
for our clients.
Collaboration
External partnerships provide both 
domestic and international opportunities 
including significant work in, for 
example, metros and nuclear markets. 
Internal cooperation also remains a 
priority, including the work undertaken 
by our global design centres (GDCs) 
in Bangalore and Delhi in India.
Technology
We are pursuing advances in design and 
engineering. Innovation and research 
and development are taking place in 
client programmes and Group activities. 14 Strategic Report

Urbanisation Prospects: The 2014 Revision
Rural Urban
The world population is increasingly 
moving to urban environments. The 
UN estimates that more than half of the 
world’s population now lives in cities and 
that by 2050 this number will be almost 
two thirds of a projected nine billion 
population.
Not all regions of the world have reached 
the 50% level and the urbanisation trend 
is most marked in growth markets outside 
the developed world. It is anticipated that 
urban growth will be concentrated in 
Africa and Asia over the next few years. 
According to the UN, it is expected that 
half of the population of Asia will live in 
urban areas by 2020, while Africa is likely 
to reach a 50% urbanisation rate in 2035.
This overarching driver will create 
ongoing demand for new and improved 
infrastructure in a number of allied 
sectors.

G7
In a report on economic growth 
projections to 2050 (The World in 2050), 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) projects 
the world economy to grow at an average 
of just over 3% per annum in the period 
2014 to 2050. The economic power shift 
away from the established advanced 
economies is anticipated to continue. 
In purchasing power parity terms, the 
E7 economies (China, India, Brazil, Russia, 
Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey) had 
already overtaken the G7 economies 
(the US, Japan, Germany, the UK, France, 
Italy and Canada) by 2014. 
PwC’s model projections suggest that 
the E7 countries could overtake the G7 
countries in around 2030 in market 
exchange rate terms, with China, India 
and the US likely to be the three largest 
economies in the world by 2050. There 
are many uncertainties surrounding 
any such projections but higher growth 
is anticipated in China and emerging 
Asia more generally. The PwC model 
suggests that the E7 could grow at an 
average rate of 3.8% per annum during 
the period 2014 to 2050, while the G7 
could grow at an average rate of just 
2.1% per annum over the same time 
period. As PwC notes, global strategies 
need to strike the right balance 
between mature, lower risk, advanced 
economies and faster growing but 
generally higher risk emerging markets. Strategic Report 15

Technology
By 2019, there will be more than 
11 billion mobile connected devices, 
about four billion more than there 
were in 2014. 
Technological advances in the design 
and engineering of projects are having 
an impact on the industry. Through 
building information modelling and 
other tools, 3D, 4D and 5D (including 
time and cost information) design is 
becoming more prevalent. In addition, 
the application of large data sets and 
cloud-based applications to analysis 
(historic and predictive) is creating new 
ways of looking at projects in the 
planning and design stage, is simplifying 
and speeding up infrastructure 
construction and maintenance efforts, 
and is tying the satisfaction of end user 
needs much more closely to the built 
environment.
Market drivers
In more and more situations, we are 
moving parts of the work we undertake 
for our local clients to other Group 
locations. This may be to one of our 
GDCs or offices in other parts of the 
world where we undertake the work in 
our centres of excellence for a particular 
discipline. Seamless delivery and robust 
processes are required to achieve this.
As we change the way in which we work, 
society is also shifting and ageing. 
According to the UN, between 2015 and 
2060 two thirds of the growth in the 
overall population will be in the 40 to 79 
age group and, within this, the number 
of 60 to 79 year olds will increase by 
more than one billion. This will have 
implications for the way we work as 
the priorities of the population and 
infrastructure needs change.

Our markets
Market size and share
There are a number of industry surveys 
that capture the top firms in regions and 
sectors by revenue. The calculation of true 
market share remains difficult due to the 
large number of very small firms in each 
region that do not form part of these 
surveys. However, we use the information 
available, together with our own industry 
knowledge, to develop our own best 
estimate of market share. 
We estimate that the market for our 
skills in selected geographies is in excess 
of £100bn per annum and, such is the 
fragmented and extensive nature of the 
competition, we command an overall 
share of less than 2% of our addressable 
market. 
Market shares vary enormously by 
individual sector – from around a third 
in UK rail signalling works/structures 
down to very small market shares in 
niche activities. By region, we estimate 
our market share as more than 5% from 
our significant position in the UK and, 
demonstrating the potential for growth, 
around 2% in the Middle East and less 
than 1% in each of the US, Europe and 
Asia Pacific.
Business focus
Competitive environment
Due to the breadth of activities that 
the Group undertakes, competitors are 
generally sector or service specific.
Each region of the world is characterised 
by a small number of large players, often 
with multinational reach, together with 
a large number of smaller companies 
that tend to have very specific niche skills. 
Typically, therefore, competitors at the 
local level are divisions of large companies 
or smaller privately owned specialists.
Barriers to entry vary across the sectors 
in which we operate – from very high 
in areas such as nuclear, where specific 
domain knowledge and certification is 
required, to much lower barriers in more 
generalist areas of civil infrastructure 
design and project management. 18 Strategic Report

Our strategy
Our purpose
Our purpose reflects the principles 
and qualities valued by people inside 
and outside our organisation that 
differentiate Atkins from our competitors 
and guide the way we do things:
As one of the world’s most respected 
design, engineering and project 
management consultancies, we have 
a responsibility to help move the world 
forward, one step at a time. We care 
about it; we want it to be a place where 
everyone is considered, and where lives 
are enriched through the implementation 
of our ideas.
You see, we don’t just imagine; we have 
the power to transform potential into 
reality. We have the breadth and depth 
of expertise, the intellect and the drive 
to make such a future happen; not only 
because we can, but because we must.
Working with our clients and partners, 
we believe that the scale of what we 
can accomplish together is greater than 
anyone can imagine. This is our time 
to make a difference.
Our strategic 
pillars
Our strategy
The primary objective of the Group 
is to deliver shareholder value through 
profitable growth.
The overall strategy for the Group was 
established and communicated in 2011. 
Annual reviews test the progress and 
continuing relevance of each aspect 
of the strategy. 
Three pillars of activity form the basis 
of our strategy – operational excellence, 
portfolio optimisation, and sector and 
regional focus.
These align with our business model, drive 
an appropriate risk profile for the Group 
and allow us to monitor progress through 
our key performance indicators.  20 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015

Our strategy
Context Progress and next steps
Operational 
excellence
We continue to drive an improved 
operational performance across the 
Group – with a distinct emphasis on 
optimising financial delivery on our 
projects – and we are successfully 
implementing our operational 
excellence programme.
This involves a continued focus on 
utilisation and margin, together with 
an increased emphasis on billing and 
cash collection.
UK reorganisation in progress.
Further utilisation improvements 
from our technical professional 
organisation (TPO) structure in 
North America.
Increased use of GDCs as a source  
of competitive and quality resources.
Portfolio 
optimisation
A second aspect of ensuring we are 
well positioned for the future is an 
ongoing review of the businesses in 
our portfolio, continuing to focus the 
Group on higher growth, higher 
margin activities. 
We have made excellent progress 
in this area over the last few years 
with the sale of our business in 
Poland, the UK highways services 
operations and the disposal of 
the Peter Brown construction 
management at risk business, 
together with the sale of our 
UK asset management business and 
the disposal of our non controlling 
interest in the RMPA (Colchester 
Garrison) private finance initiative.
Sector and 
regional focus
We organise our Group along regional 
lines with the addition of Energy as 
a segment addressing global clients. 
While this structure is reflected in 
the organisation of the Group, we also 
undertake pan Group coordination of 
key sectors with multiple jurisdictions.
Sectors and regions on which we 
place a particular focus will evolve 
over time.
Energy and Asia Pacific currently 
remain the primary sector and 
regional areas on which we will 
focus.
The security market, and in 
particular IT and cyber security, 
offers a good pipeline of 
opportunities, although by contrast 
recent challenges in aerospace 
mean this will be less of a focus  
area in future.

Overview of the business and performance in the year
Our business
Our core business is helping our clients 
to plan, design and enable capital 
programmes that resolve complex 
challenges in the built environment. 
We are able to provide our clients with 
professional support to plan, design 
and enable projects from policy, strategic 
choices, feasibility concept and detailed 
design, through to project and programme 
management, implementation and 
operation.
Atkins’ structure of five business segments 
reflects how we manage the business 
in different geographies and markets. 
Details of activities and results by business 
segment are shown in the segmental 
performance section which follows.
Key performance indicators 
The Group uses a range of performance 
measures to monitor and manage the 
business. Those that are particularly 
important in monitoring our progress 
in generating shareholder value are 
considered key performance indicators 
(KPIs).
Our KPIs measure past performance 
and also provide information and 
context to anticipate future events 
and, in conjunction with our detailed 
knowledge and experience of the 
segments in which we operate, allow 
us to act early and manage the business 
going forward. We track safety, volume, 
staff turnover, profitability, efficiency, 
secured workload and capacity.
Revenue, operating profit and margin, 
earnings per share (EPS) and operating 
cash flow provide indications as to the 
volume and quality of work we have 
undertaken. They measure both 
profitability and the efficiency with 
which we have turned operating profits 
into cash.
We plan, design and enable 
our clients’ capital programmes.

Business review continued
Work in hand measures our secured 
workload as a percentage of the 
budgeted revenue for the next year. 
Staff numbers and staff turnover are 
measures of capacity and show us how 
effective we have been in recruiting 
and retaining our key resource. 
Safety in the workplace and on our 
project sites is paramount and forms 
part of our commitment to quality and 
reliability and, as such, we track the 
accident incident rate (AIR) across the 
Group. The AIR is an industry measure 
of the number of reportable accidents 
per 100,000 staff and is explained in 
more detail in the Corporate sustainability 
review (page 60).
As a people business, staff turnover 
is an important metric for us and shows 
the rate at which staff chose to leave 
the Group.
KPIs for the year ended 31 March 2015 
are shown on page 24, along with prior 
year comparatives.
Review of the year
As outlined in the CEO’s statement and in 
more detail in the Financial performance 
review section (page 45), this has been 
another good year in terms of Atkins’ 
financial performance. 
Our underlying profit before tax was 
£121.9m, an increase of 14.6% over 
last year’s profit of £106.4m, on revenue 
that increased 0.4% to £1.76bn 
(2014: £1.75bn). This profit includes 
the benefit of £5.0m of research and 
development expenditure credit (RDEC)
following early adoption of new rules in 
the UK. In previous years the equivalent 
benefit was shown as a reduction in the 
Group’s tax charge. 
We believe underlying profit is a more 
representative measure of performance, 
removing the items that may give a 
distorted view of performance. In the 
current year we have removed profits 
on disposals and costs associated with 
disposals of £0.4m (2014: £10.5m), 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of £6.9m (2014: £2.7m), exceptional 
transaction costs of £4.4m (2014: £nil), 
impairment of goodwill of £2.8m 
(2014: £nil) and deferred acquisition 
payments of £1.5m (2014: £nil). The 
unadjusted reported profit before tax 
was £106.7m (2014: £114.2m).
Revenue and profit before tax were 
adversely affected by currency headwinds 
of £22.8m and £1.1m respectively against 
a constant currency basis. 
Reported operating profit was £118.5m 
(2014: £113.7m), at a margin of 6.7% 
(2014: 6.5%). As we state above, we 
believe a more representative measure 
of operating profit adds back amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets of £6.9m 
(2014: £2.7m), exceptional transaction 
costs of £4.4m (2014: £nil), impairment 
of goodwill of £2.8m (2014: £nil) and 
deferred acquisition payments of £1.5m 
(2014: £nil). 
This shows a more representative 
underlying operating profit of £134.1m 
(2014: £116.4m), at an improved 
underlying margin of 7.6% (2014: 6.7%).
The net profit on disposal of £0.4m 
is explained in more detail in note 8 
to the Financial Statements (page 153) 
and comprises £0.5m of deferred 
consideration received in relation to our 
previously disposed UK highways services 
business and a loss of £0.1m on the 
disposal of our Polish business.
Underlying diluted EPS increased 11.4p 
per share to 97.1p (2014: 85.7p), an 
increase of 13.3%. 
The Group pension schemes have seen 
an overall actuarial gain of £6.0m over 
the year, with the net liability reducing 
to £298.4m. This is due to a combination 
of increased liability losses of £237.2m 
as a consequence of changes in economic 
assumptions, being more than offset 
by asset gains over the year of £243.2m. 
The fair value of plan assets has increased 
to £1,528.8m (2014: £1,236.3m) and 
the liabilities have increased to £1,827.2m 
(2014: £1,560.5m).
Operating cash flow in the year was 
£133.9m (2014: £95.5m), representing 
99.8% (2014: 82.0%) of underlying 
operating profit. The Group’s liquidity 
remains strong with closing net funds 
of £179.3m (2014: £188.3m).
As at 31 March 2015, the Group had 
secured 51% (2014: 51%) of budgeted 
revenue for the coming financial year, 
this excludes in both periods the future 
workload of our Polish business, which 
was sold in the year.
A segmental analysis follows (starting on 
page 25) that explains more fully each of 
our segments. We outline their financial 
performance in the period, their strategy, 
business model and external factors 
driving their business together with 
specific risks relating to the segment. 
We have also provided information on

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Segmental performance continued
United Kingdom and Europe
Performance
Our United Kingdom and Europe business 
delivered a much improved second half 
performance after a mixed first half. 
Full year revenue decreased 9.5% to 
£903.8m, reflecting the sale of our 
highways services business last financial 
year and our Polish business in 2014, 
a market downturn in aerospace and 
difficult trading conditions in Scandinavia 
and Portugal. 
On an ongoing basis, excluding disposals 
and changes to joint venture reporting, 
revenue actually increased by 2.7% driven 
primarily by the UK where we have seen 
good momentum in our core markets, 
which continue to be well-funded.
The operating margin at 6.7% includes 
the benefit of around £5m of research 
and development expenditure credit 
(RDEC) following early adoption of 
new rules in the UK. In previous years 
the equivalent benefit was shown 
as a reduction in the tax charge. On a 
comparative basis excluding the effects of 
RDEC, the disposals and changes to joint 
venture reporting give a margin of 6.0%. 
We successfully completed the acquisition 
of Terramar, one of Norway’s leading 
project management consultancy firms, 
during the third quarter. Our strategy 
of portfolio optimisation also continued 
with the disposal of our Polish business 
to Multiconsult, a Norwegian consultancy 
and design business, in September 2014. 
Closing staff numbers rose by 1% to 
9,642, with growth driven by our rail, 
design and engineering and highways 
and transportation businesses as well as 
the acquisition of the 65 person Terramar 
business. This was partially offset by 
the sale of our Polish business and the 
rightsizing of our aerospace business.
Business model
Our focus is on the planning, design 
and enabling of our clients’ capital 
programmes and projects in and around 
infrastructure, as well as providing 
engineering consultancy services to wider 
markets. We are a technical consultancy, 
providing advice, design and engineering 
together with project management skills 
for public and private sector clients. Our 
multidisciplinary skills allow us to draw 
on expertise from across the business, 
including our resource pool of professional 
technical staff in India, to deliver complex 
projects and to support other Group 
businesses with specialist expertise.
As we continue to progress our 
operational excellence programme, we 
have recently announced a reorganisation 
and rationalisation of our UK operations 
into four market facing divisions, which 
took effect on 1 April 2015. The new 
organisation structure is designed to 
maximise our core technical skills and 
bring people together into new market, 
business development and project delivery 
teams to support competitive bidding and 
focus on delivering projects effectively. 
Overall, we believe these changes will 
make it easier for us to collaborate and 
share ideas internally, allowing us to 
provide our clients with greater innovation 
and a broader range of expertise,  
together with best use of technology and 
resources. We expect the reorganisation 
to deliver year on year margin progress 
in a stable market.
Strategy
Our strategy focuses on maintaining 
our market leadership positions in the 
UK and realising the opportunities arising 
from the UK Government’s commitment 
to stimulate the economy through 
infrastructure investment and from 
regulatory spend in rail, utilities and 
airports. Our defence, security and 
aerospace markets provide good diversity 
to our infrastructure exposure.
Our operational excellence programme 
continues to improve the underlying 
processes of the business, ensuring 
increased time to focus on our clients’ 
needs and project delivery.
Our ability to leverage skills and capability 
from a variety of industry sectors and 
professional disciplines provides a strong 
selling proposition to our clients. We 
see multiple opportunities for our broad 
multidisciplinary offering, providing 
good growth potential.
Business drivers
The economic environment significantly 
affects the opportunities available to 
our business and the UK Government’s 
recognition of infrastructure as a core 
enabler of growth provides a positive 
stimulus. Our diversified portfolio provides 
resilience to market fluctuations, as does 
the fact that a number of our markets 
remain well-funded. We intend to exit the 
Portuguese market where we currently 
employ 48 staff.
Scandinavian markets continue to benefit 
from investment in infrastructure from 
the public and private sectors, providing 
stable, well-funded market conditions.
Added resilience is brought to our 
UK business by its ongoing support for 
projects in other regions, together with 
the use of our global design centres in 
India, which provide flexibility of delivery 
and access to high quality, lower cost 
resources.
Our market leadership position in the 
UK is underpinned by the technical 
excellence of our people and the quality 
of their work. For example, we were 
delighted to be shortlisted for four 
awards at the 2015 MCA (Management 
Consultancies Association) awards.  Strategic Report 27

Segmental performance continued
United Kingdom and Europe
People
Excluding the people who transferred 
with the sale of our Polish business, our 
United Kingdom and Europe headcount 
increased very slightly during the year. 
Staff turnover increased to 11.9% from 
9.5% as market conditions continued 
to improve.
In the UK, we continue to implement 
programmes to assist with the attraction, 
engagement and retention of talented 
people and to be recognised by a number 
of independent organisations as a great 
place to work. In The Sunday Times 
25 Best Big Companies to Work For 
we rose from 18th to 16th place and 
we appeared in the top 25 for the ninth 
time in 11 years. We are one of the largest 
and most popular recruiters of newly 
graduated engineers and were shortlisted 
for the TARGETjobs most popular 
graduate recruiter in the construction, 
civil engineering and surveying sector 
in 2015. In Denmark, as part of Engineer 
the Future – we collaborate with a 
number of organisations, institutions 
and companies to encourage many more 
people to choose a career in technology 
development. 
The ongoing promotion of science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics 
(STEM) careers to young people continues 
to be a focus. Our eight STEM hubs 
in the UK enable a more coordinated 
approach to STEM activity with schools, 
colleges and community groups.
During the year, 364 young people joined 
the UK business on formal education 
and development programmes including 
71 apprentices.
Atkins is a founder member of the 5% 
Club (see the People section (page 57) for 
more detail). As at 31 March 2015, 8.9% 
of our UK staff were on a formalised 
apprentice, sponsored student or graduate 
programme.
We are focused on increasing the 
proportion of female employees and 
have developed a range of flexible 
working options to help us both recruit 
and retain staff. During the year, the 
proportion of females in the UK increased 
slightly to 25% and we were recognised 
as one of The Times Top 50 Employers 
for Women 2015.
In line with the rest of the Group, we 
measure employee engagement through 
our Viewpoint employee opinion survey. 
In the UK, our results in 2014 showed 
a slight decrease compared with the 
previous year reflecting changes in the 
business and some of our markets. In 
Europe, the result was unchanged. Both 
results continued to outperform the global 
norm for the professional services sector.
Safety and sustainability
Workplace health, safety and wellbeing 
continue to be a high priority. The overall 
AIR has improved this year, primarily as a 
result of the sale of our highways services 
business and the introduction of proactive 
measures such as the Atkins operating 
safely system (see the Corporate 
sustainability review (page 61) for more 
information). 
We won Engineering Practice of the 
Year at the Irish Building and Design 
Awards for our approach to sustainability 
and innovation, our commitment to 
training, and the depth and breadth 
of our projects. 
We have formalised a volunteering policy 
commitment in the UK. These volunteer 
days have mainly been used to support 
charity organisations such as RedR and 
Engineers without Borders.
Risk
We recognise that there is a risk in the 
medium- and longer-term of a shortage 
of professional technical staff in our 
industry. To help address this, we 
commissioned a study, The skills deficit: 
consequences and opportunities for UK 
infrastructure. We have outlined in the 
People section (page 55) our approach 
to recruiting apprentices and sponsoring 
students and graduates to help mitigate 
this risk.
The majority of the Group’s post-
employment benefit liability sits within 
the UK business and is comprised of 
defined benefit pension obligations, 
the largest of which is within the Atkins 
Pension Plan, which is closed to the 
future accrual of benefits (see note 29 
(page 182) for more detail).
The pension obligations are recognised 
as a risk due to their size and the fact 
that the ongoing liability is a function of 
a number of assumptions, not least the 
life expectancy of members. This risk is 
mitigated by ongoing cash contributions 
to the pension fund, which have been 
agreed with the pension trustees, along 
with measures to manage ongoing 
volatility.
We identify, review and assess risks 
across all our businesses and the process 
is explained in more detail in the Principal 
risks and uncertainties section (page 48).
Outlook
The outlook for our United Kingdom 
and Europe business as a whole is stable, 
despite a slowdown in our aerospace 
business.
In the UK, the infrastructure markets 
continue to present opportunities for 
our broad multidisciplinary offering as the 
UK Government stimulates the economy 
with its commitment to infrastructure 
spend. We believe our refreshed operating 
model is well placed to address this 
need. Our Faithful+Gould business 
enters the new financial year with its 
diverse portfolio providing an order book 
that is comfortably ahead of last year. 
Notwithstanding the current competitive 
landscape in Scandinavia, our core 
markets remain well-funded, with a 
good pipeline of infrastructure projects, 
supported by government commitments. 
Our secured work in hand in the 
United Kingdom and Europe is 45.3% 
(2014: 49.2%) of next year’s budgeted 
revenue and, with our reorganisation 
in place, this gives us confidence for the 
year ahead. 28 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Segmental performance continued
United Kingdom and Europe
United Kingdom
Performance
Our UK business has seen headline 
revenue reduce by 9.4% to £835.6m 
(2014: £922.0m) and headcount growth 
of 0.9%. Excluding disposals and the 
change in the accounting treatment of 
joint ventures gives a more representative 
increase in revenue of 2.7%.
The full year operating margin was 7.1% 
(2014: 6.3%). Operating profit includes 
RDEC and joint venture reporting 
changes, excluding these gives an 
operating margin of 6.4% (2014: 7.2%). 
Our aerospace business faced a market 
downturn in the year and profitability 
was further impacted by a number 
of outstanding contract variation 
negotiations in our UK rail business, which 
have now been largely resolved. During 
the first half, we also rightsized our water 
and environment business. By contrast, 
our highways and transportation and 
design and engineering businesses 
continue to benefit from the UK 
Government’s maintained focus on 
infrastructure investment, and performed 
strongly during the year.
Operations
Rail
Our rail business remained busy, operating 
at a high level of staff utilisation, reflecting 
strong markets in the areas of signalling, 
electrification and station design. As a 
result our headcount continued to grow 
steadily during the year.
Work continued on signalling projects 
awarded under the two major frameworks 
for the Sussex/Wessex and Kent/Anglia 
areas, including East Sussex that was 
completed successfully in February 2015 
and a major resignalling project in east 
Kent. This was in addition to ongoing 
work on our other non-framework signalling 
contracts at Cardiff and Wolverhampton.
In partnership with Network Rail, Laing 
O’Rourke and VolkerRail, we are jointly 
delivering the Stafford area improvement 
programme, and continue to support the 
delivery of a number of other technically 
challenging projects for Network Rail, 
including the transformation of 
Birmingham New Street station, which  
will open in September 2015.
The UK’s electrification programme 
presents a substantial opportunity for our 
rail business. In partnership with Parsons 
Brinckerhoff, we are the lead design 
organisation for the electrification of the 
Great Western main line between London 
and South Wales. We are also working 
with Carillion Power Lines to deliver the 
Midland Mainline electrification programme.
Following our involvement in early stage 
design for phase one of High Speed 2 
between London and the West Midlands, 
we believe we are well placed to win 
further opportunities in phase two.
Our overall financial performance was 
adversely impacted by a number of 
outstanding contract variation negotiations. 
We have reached resolution on the large 
majority of these which, as previously 
indicated, impacted positively on our 
regional cash performance at the end 
of the period.

Highways and transportation
Our highways and transportation business 
focuses on three core areas: strategic 
advice, design consultancy and asset 
management. In addition, we provide 
operational maintenance and design for 
the M25, London’s orbital motorway, as 
part of our role within the M25 Connect 
Plus consortium. 
In November 2014, Highways England 
appointed Atkins as one of its key 
suppliers on the Collaborative Delivery 
Framework (CDF). The CDF will deliver 
important upgrades to motorways and 
trunk roads across England over the 
next four years. We will provide design 
and engineering expertise for 
upcoming programmes including major 
improvements. Among the projects in 
the CDF pipeline are the A14 trunk road 
between Cambridge and Huntingdon 
and a programme of smart motorway 
schemes. 
In 2014, we were appointed to provide 
design development expertise to the 
Welsh Government’s M4 corridor project 
around Newport working with design 
partners Arup and RPS. The proposals 
include the development of 24km of 
new motorway and a 2.5km long viaduct 
crossing of the river Usk, as well as major 
remodelling of M4 junctions 23 and 29.
In a joint venture with Mouchel, we 
have been awarded the design contract 
for the third stage of Transport Scotland’s 
ambitious programme to upgrade a 
177km stretch of the A9 between the 
cities of Perth and Inverness to full dual 
carriageway standard by 2025. We will 
provide multidisciplinary design work 
for the 50km stretch of road between 
Dalraddy and Inverness.
We were also appointed in collaboration 
with CH2M as designer for the Aberdeen 
western peripheral route/Balmedie 
to Tipperty. The contract will include 
the design and construction of 58km 
of new dual carriageway as well as 
new side roads, access tracks and more 
than 100 new structures, including two 
significant focal point bridges over 
the rivers Dee and Don.
Water and environment
Our water and environment business 
returned to growth during the second half 
of the year. This improved performance 
was due to increased volumes from 
contracts secured with water utility clients 
in the prior year, including Thames Water 
and Severn Trent Water, delivering 
their programmes for the 2015 to 2020 
regulatory period (AMP6). 
We have bid successfully for similar 
collaborative opportunities with other 
water companies and secured frameworks 
with United Utilities, Southern Water 
and are one of three selected consultants 
for Wessex Water, giving us confidence 
in continuity of workload for our water 
engineering team in AMP6.
Our work in sustainable development 
continues to grow, evidenced by recent 
commissions for significant land 
developments which we are leading 
in South Africa and Morocco, as well 
as additional sites for the development 
sector in the UK. 
During the year, the business undertook 
work on major UK infrastructure projects 
including Crossrail and High Speed 2, 
and recent awards on major highways 
and rail projects are drawing on our 
specialist environmental and ground 
engineering teams. 
Faithful+Gould
Our UK business has performed well with 
continued signs of recovery in our market. 
The Scape Asset Management, Surveying 
and Design Services public sector 
framework has provided a steady stream 
of work, particularly in education. Wins 
include appointments at the universities 
of York, Edinburgh, Loughborough and 
Wolverhampton and for Kent county and 
Leicester city councils. The London and 
southeast commercial property sector is 
improving and we have been appointed 
to work for Solum Regeneration at 
London Bridge and Walthamstow, and 
Argent at Paradise Circus, Birmingham 
and Kings Cross, where we have been 
appointed on the development of block 
R7, a new 13,000 square metre office 
space set over 12 floors. 
Our market position in the nuclear 
sector continues to grow. We have been 
appointed by Capenhurst Nuclear Services 
as the programme management office to 
deliver its new process plant, the Legacy 
Cylinder Facility. 
In Scotland, we have been appointed 
to provide project management and 
multidisciplinary design services on 
Cockenzie Marine Park, an old power 
station site being redeveloped into flexible 
large scale manufacturing facilities, and 
for EDI Group in its redevelopment of 
the Fountainbridge site in Edinburgh.
Design and engineering
Our design and engineering business 
has performed well during the year. 
The business serves customers across five 
key market segments: education, airports, 
defence, transportation and mixed use 
development. All sectors have strong 
pipelines of secured workloads and 
opportunities. The division also works 
closely with the Group’s Energy business 
to deliver the buildings and infrastructure 
elements of major UK projects.  30 Strategic Report

In the education sector, we successfully 
won the design contract to work with 
Laing O’Rourke on the Priority Schools 
Building Programme in Yorkshire. We will 
continue to focus on higher and further 
education opportunities going forward.
Our airports team continues to win and 
deliver significant programmes of work 
at both London Gatwick and Heathrow.
Our defence infrastructure portfolio 
includes major programmes of work for 
BAE Systems, designing facilities for air 
and sea-based defence. 
In January, the business was appointed 
by Transport for London as part of one of 
the major consulting groups developing 
the detailed plans for Crossrail 2. It is also 
supporting the Middle East business on 
the Doha Metro Gold Line project. 
We continue to support London Legacy 
Development Corporation on the 
transformation of Queen Elizabeth 
Olympic Park. 
We have also supported initial nuclear 
new build infrastructure work in the UK, 
including EDF Energy’s new Hinckley Point 
reactor, and remain heavily involved in 
nuclear decommissioning work, including 
a role on the Silos Direct-encapsulation 
Plant project at Sellafield. We are the 
client’s engineer on Tidal Lagoon Swansea 
Bay, creating the world’s first man made, 
energy-generating lagoon.
Defence, aerospace and 
communications
Overall our defence, aerospace and 
communications business experienced 
a difficult year.
Our aerospace business was impacted 
by a significant market downturn as our 
major client, Airbus, moved from design 
to production on a number of its 
programmes. We reduced the number 
of people engaged on aerospace projects 
in both the UK and India, with the 
majority of those affected successfully 
redeployed into growth areas of the 
business, including defence and energy. 
We are focused on developing our 
relationships with other aerospace 
partners and the business is now stable. 
We are well positioned in defence where 
discussions with front line commands 
secured important contract wins and 
we are encouraged by further pipeline 
opportunities. 
Management consulting
Our management consultancy business 
provides the UK Government and various 
industry clients with practical capability 
to run the full lifecycle of technology 
enabled change programmes. 
We continue to deliver security work for 
central government, as well as supporting 
Heathrow Airport’s IT outsourcing 
contract in partnership with Capgemini, 
leveraging our position in aviation. 
We have established a strong capability in 
holistic security and this team is delivering 
a range of high profile projects, including 
a number of cyber security assignments 
for multinational private sector clients. Strategic Report 31

Europe
Performance
Our Europe business is primarily focused 
on the rail and highways infrastructure 
markets in Scandinavia, with smaller 
operations in Portugal and Ireland.
Headline revenue reduced by 10.6% to 
£68.2m reflecting the sale of our Polish 
operation and an increasingly competitive 
market in Scandinavia. Margins decreased 
to 1.9% (2014: 5.9%) reflecting losses 
in our Polish and Portuguese businesses 
and workload issues in Sweden.
Headcount rose to 757 (2014: 734), 
with the disposal of our Polish operation 
in September 2014 being offset by the 
acquisition of Terramar in Norway.
Operations
In Denmark, we continue to work 
across a number of major rail and road 
infrastructure projects, including the new 
railway line between Copenhagen and 
Ringsted and the European Rail Traffic 
Management System signalling 
programme. Atkins’ teams of specialists 
are collaborating with the client and 
suppliers in a joint team to ensure a 
successful implementation of the project, 
which is currently in the design phase.
We have maintained a good order book 
through the year. The Danish Government 
has announced a major programme 
of investment in rail infrastructure and 
rolling stock, and we believe we are well 
positioned to benefit from this.
In Sweden, we successfully bid with 
our partners on the Molnby Depot and 
Gothenburg-Borås High Speed Line 
contracts which will generate good 
work for us. Bidding activity remains high 
as a series of projects come to market. 
We are also working on a number of 
other significant infrastructure projects, 
such as the Hallsberg double tracking 
project and the Mälarbanan rail systems 
project for the state transport authority, 
Trafikverket. The market outlook, and 
medium-term pipeline and order book, 
remain good.
We are focused on expanding our position 
in the Norwegian infrastructure and 
project management markets. We believe 
that the strategic acquisition of Terramar 
will position us to secure further work 
in the well-funded infrastructure markets 
in Norway, as well as unlocking further 
project management opportunities. 
We made further progress on our 
portfolio optimisation strategy, with the 
sale of our 77 person business in Poland 
to Multiconsult which completed in 
September 2014.
Our operations have stabilised in Ireland 
and showed some modest growth 
through the year with headcount 
increasing for the first time since 2008 
on the back of some good wins in the 
water and highways sectors. In Portugal, 
the continuing difficult economic 
conditions will curtail any meaningful 
growth in the medium term and we 
intend to exit the Portuguese market, 
where we currently employ 48 staff.

North America
Performance
Our North America segment, which 
consists of our consultancy and 
Faithful+Gould businesses, saw a 4.7% 
increase in operating profit over last year, 
to £20.0m (2014: £19.1m) at an improved 
margin of 5.9% (2014: 5.0%). Revenue 
was down 10.4%, reflecting first half 
currency headwinds, and a change in 
the Group’s accounting for joint ventures. 
Excluding these effects, together with 
the impact of the prior year disposal 
of Peter Brown, revenue was down 3.8%. 
Our consultancy business delivered 
revenue of £274.5m (2014: £305.3m)  
and operating profit of £18.1m 
(2014: £17.4m), at an improved margin 
of 6.6% (2014: 5.7%).
Faithful+Gould had a more challenging 
year, delivering operating profit of £1.9m 
(2014: £4.9m). Results were adversely 
affected by bad weather on the East 
Coast and industrial action across some 
of the oil and chemical sites on which 
we work, both of which impacted our 
delivery capability.
In the prior year we disposed of our 
Peter Brown business which contributed 
a loss in the period to March 2014 of 
£3.2m and revenue of £6.8m. 
During the year, our consultancy 
business established a new, more 
focused, client-centric operating model, 
which made solid progress, increasing 
win rates and positioning the business 
to capitalise better on existing and new 
market opportunities. Our focus on 
implementing and embedding our 
operational excellence programme 
contributed to our improved margin.
Average staff numbers reduced by 5.9% 
as a result of the implementation of our 
new operating model and reduced oil 
and gas workloads for Faithful+Gould. 
Business model
Our new consultancy operating model 
established five client-focused businesses 
supported by a technical professional 
organisation (TPO) to ensure the best 
people are assigned to the work quickly 
and efficiently, irrespective of staff 
location.
The five client facing businesses consist of 
transportation, public and private, federal, 
aviation and strategic ventures, which 
includes areas such as rail, energy, 
technology and future-proofing cities. 
The model is now established and proving 
successful in aligning with our clients’ 
needs.
 
The TPO is gaining momentum and 
focusing on recruiting, retaining and 
developing world class technical 
professionals in our industry. This supports 
our objective of providing new and 
innovative technical and business solutions 
to our clients, resulting in broader, deeper 
client relationships and the opportunity 
to work on their largest and most complex 
projects. 
Our operational excellence programme 
is also focused on centralising, simplifying 
and streamlining the management and 
administration of key shared services. 
We believe that the efforts to streamline 
these areas will yield structural cost 
reductions in the medium term. 
Strategy
We will continue to focus on growing 
our business by concentrating on excellent 
project delivery and client service, 
expanding our services and focusing 
on securing larger, longer-term projects. 
As a result of our shift in focus last year, 
we increased our win rate and on average 
won larger contracts. In particular, we 
increased the number of clients delivering 
more than $5m of business per year, while 
reducing the number of clients delivering 
less than $0.1m per year. 
We are shifting our focus to major 
infrastructure programmes in our core 
markets and strengthening our capability 
to compete for major projects and 
programmes by drawing on resources 
from across the business and leveraging 
the Group’s worldwide capabilities.
Business drivers
The majority of North America’s projects 
are government funded, in part or in 
whole, either through a state or local 
government or directly through federal 
agencies. Publicly funded projects provide 
greater stability although they tend to be 
awarded more slowly and are at greater 
risk of being delayed due to changing 
priorities or political scrutiny.
Operations
Our transportation business has delivered 
another good performance, particularly 
with important clients such as the 
departments of transportation in Florida, 
Texas, Colorado and Georgia. Other 
notable contract reselections, extensions 
and task awards include the Central 
Florida Expressway and Camino Real 
Regional Mobility Authority. 
Our public and private business has 
increased its focus on larger projects 
and programmes and on select clients. 
These efforts have resulted in an 
increase in average contract size. Our 
client portfolio is expanding with new 
environmental and general engineering 
services appointments with city and 
county governments in Florida, Nevada, 
and Colorado, and at the state level 
for organisations such as the Louisiana 
Coastal Protection and Restoration 
Authority and South Florida Water 
Management District. 
In aviation, we continue to execute 
successfully our programme management 
contract at New Orleans’ Louis Armstrong 
and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson 
international airports. Notable new 
contract awards at airports include Los 
Angeles International, Tampa International 
and additional work at Austin-Bergstrom 
International.  34 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Segmental performance continued
North America
Our federal business has expanded its 
presence in the flood mapping sector 
with reselection as one of two consultants 
to provide nationwide mapping services 
to the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. In addition, we were successfully 
reappointed on our Federal Highway 
Administration design and construction 
management services and our Federal 
Transit Administration programme 
management contracts. 
Our strategic ventures business completed 
its first year of operation with a diverse 
portfolio of rail, transit and energy and 
renewables clients for whom we provide 
environmental, planning, permitting, 
programme management, asset 
management and engineering services.
Faithful+Gould’s North American 
business had a quieter year following the 
conclusion of some key client programmes 
and cost reduction measures taken 
by clients in the oil and gas sector 
redirecting their demand for our services. 
Notwithstanding this, the oil and gas 
sector remains a key part of the business 
with ongoing work for many of the 
large operators.
People
Our North American consultancy 
headcount has remained stable due to 
sustained recruitment efforts throughout 
the year. Turnover has stabilised and 
is now in line with industry norms.
We remain focused on attracting then 
retaining staff, and we continue to 
measure employee engagement through 
our Group wide Viewpoint employee 
opinion survey. The overall score remains 
in line with industry benchmarks, but the 
exercise did highlight areas targeted for 
improvement as we bed in our TPO.
The implementation in 2014 of My Career, 
our Group wide online performance 
management system, is improving the 
quality of our performance management 
activities by creating greater links between 
performance and reward.
We are committed to recruiting, retaining, 
developing, and elevating minority and 
women professionals through initiatives 
such as our sponsorship of WTS 
International (WTS). Founded in 1977, 
WTS has a specific mission of fostering 
lifelong career goals for women in the 
transportation industry. Our support has 
included scholarship programmes through 
our charitable giving foundation, The 
Atkins Foundation. 
Safety and sustainability
Our safety culture plays a central role in 
how we deliver work. Sustainability and 
employee wellbeing continued to be an 
area of focus. We reduced overall injuries 
by 18% compared with last year and our 
AIR was reduced by 67%. We exceeded 
the Group’s global AIR goals in all areas. 
Our serious injury rate is more than four 
times lower than the industry average. 
The Atkins Foundation supports projects 
that aim to improve the long-term quality 
of life for those in our local communities. 
It primarily supports community initiatives 
focused on education and response 
to natural disasters. Special consideration 
is given to programmes that promote 
science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics (STEM) subjects.
Risk
A majority of our work is government 
funded and, as a result, political 
uncertainty and deadlock caused by 
the 2016 presidential election may lead 
to delays in federal programmes and 
funding. We are closely monitoring 
Congress’s activities for continued funding 
of programmes, particularly around 
transportation and highways, where 
delays would have an adverse impact 
on our workload. 
Previously reported Department of Justice 
and Securities and Exchange Commission 
enquiries relating to potential Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act violations by 
The PBSJ Corporation prior to its 
acquisition by the Group have now been 
resolved with an agreed settlement 
of $3.4m.
We identify, review and assess risks across 
all of our businesses and the process is 
explained in more detail in the Principal 
risks and uncertainties section (page 48). 
This year we commenced the 
implementation of our online service 
delivery process in North America, for 
more information see the market section 
(page 51).
Outlook
We see stable market conditions in the 
key states in which we operate. Economic 
conditions in states such as Florida, 
Texas, California and Georgia are showing 
promising developments in funding, 
coupled with growing investment interest 
from the private sector.
Our work in hand improved year on 
year both as a function of improved 
win rates and the scale and longevity 
of individual awards, increasing our 
secured work in hand as a percentage 
of next year’s budgeted revenue to 61.6% 
(2014: 58.8%) giving a solid platform 
for future growth. 
We will continue our cost and efficiency 
efforts in the new financial year, building 
on the savings realised in the year ended 
31 March 2015. 
As our refreshed consultancy business 
model embeds further, we expect 
productivity to continue to increase, 
helping to drive further margin 
improvement.  Strategic Report 35

Segmental performance continued
Middle East
Performance
Our Middle East business had a strong 
overall performance this financial year, 
with revenue up 28.7% to £216.7m 
(2014: £168.4m) and operating profit up 
56.3% on last year. This improvement is 
a consequence of our continued strategic 
focus on major projects and programmes 
in rail, infrastructure and property in 
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar 
and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). 
We have also seen very good cash 
performance which is a result of our 
continued focus in this area and also 
reflects advance payments on our 
strategically important metro projects. 
Operating margin improved to 10.4% 
(2014: 8.6%).
Business model 
Our business model is to maintain strong 
local resources in our chosen markets, 
complemented by multi-skilled design 
centres within the region and in India. 
This provides agility and efficiency by 
maximising our ability to mobilise for 
major projects, while minimising exposure 
to individual market resource demands 
and constraints. 
Strategy 
Our strategy in the Middle East is to focus 
on what we believe to be the region’s 
most robust markets and sectors; namely 
infrastructure, rail and property in the 
UAE, Qatar and KSA. The region offers 
good opportunities linked to the drive for 
economic diversification and the need to 
invest in social infrastructure. Our strategy 
is aimed at carefully selecting and securing 
critical projects and programmes with 
established key clients. In addition, local 
resources support our energy business in 
the region, which is reported within our 
Energy segment. 
Business drivers 
The economic climate in the Middle East 
is primarily driven by the global oil price, 
which affects demand for our services 
since regional spending ultimately flows 
through to capital investment in 
infrastructure, transportation and 
property. Regional security issues and 
changes in leadership, whether real or 
anticipated, can also serve to heighten 
market sensitivity. 
While we have not seen an immediate 
short-term impact on our workload from 
the rapid decline in the oil price, there has 
been a consequent slowing of decision 
making and more uncertainty around 
some property and infrastructure projects. 
The longer-term need to invest in 
strategically important infrastructure 
development that supports economic 
growth and diversification will continue 
to drive demand for our services. We have 
a clear view of well-funded programmes, 
although timing and scope are 
increasingly subject to review. 
Operations
Our business built on its strong first half 
to deliver a significant improvement in full 
year performance, further reinforcing its 
position among the Middle East’s leading 
design and engineering consultancies. 
Good progress was made on the 
mobilisation and design delivery for our 
major metro projects, including Riyadh 
Metro, Doha Metro Red Line South and 
latterly Doha Metro Gold Line, a notable 
win in the first half of the year. 
The Gold Line, for which Atkins is lead 
designer for a consortium comprising 
Greece’s Aktor, Yapi Merkezi and STFA 
of Turkey, India’s Larsen & Toubro and 
the local Qatari contractor Al Jaber 
Engineering, is the largest civils package 
of works to be awarded on Doha Metro. 
With a capital cost of approximately 
£2.5bn, the project crosses the city from 
east to west and includes 15km of twin 
tunnels and 13 underground stations. 
There continues to be good demand for 
metro projects across the region, with 
further opportunities to work selectively 
for design and build contractors within 
our core markets. 
Transport infrastructure, including roads, 
bridges and utilities networks, is of critical 
strategic importance across the region, 
particularly in Qatar, where we continue 
to work with the Qatari Government, 
advising on infrastructure planning and 
design projects to meet its National Vision 
2030. Our major projects include the 
Central Planning Office, which is making 
an important contribution to the 
coordination of Qatar’s major transport 
programmes, and a significant framework 
contract to upgrade Doha’s roads and 
drainage systems.
In KSA, we supported strategic 
programmes that are driving the 
Kingdom’s long-term economic growth 
and diversification, including an ongoing 
partnership with Bechtel to advise the 
Economic Cities Authority on the 
development of four new cities. In 
addition, we are supporting the Royal 
Commission of Jubail and Yanbu with 
its major industrial development activity 
in the Eastern Province, having signed 
a third framework contract to provide 
technical planning consultancy in the 
final quarter of the financial year.
In Abu Dhabi, we have a broad portfolio 
of infrastructure projects with clients 
including Abu Dhabi and Al Ain 
Municipality, the Department of Municipal 
Affairs and Musanada. Notable projects 
include the design of infrastructure for 
a £1.3bn, 42 square kilometre Emirati 
community in North Wathba.  Strategic Report 37 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Investor Information
Segmental performance continued
Middle East
Property sector activity in the UAE 
experienced an upturn in confidence in 
2014, linked to Dubai’s successful bid to 
host Expo 2020, resulting in increased 
property workloads with selective clients. 
Our current key projects include Dubai 
Opera House and the residential element 
of Al Habtoor City, a major new 
development along Sheikh Zayed Road, 
the city’s main arterial highway.
Our Faithful+Gould business in the 
Middle East has had a strong year with 
growth across the UAE, KSA and Qatar. 
The Confluence acquisition in 2013 added 
project management strength to the 
business and we have seen a number of 
successes in the property sector, notably 
at the Atlantis 2 super-luxury five star 
hotel in Dubai, the National Laboratories 
project in Qatar, Mall of the Emirates 
extensions and Reem Mall in Abu Dhabi, 
and new projects for Majid al Futtaim and 
Al Farwaniyah on Al Zahia Mall in Sharjah. 
We are also supporting Aramco in KSA 
as it undertakes a large programme of 
sports stadia construction.
People 
Headcount grew strongly, up 597 year 
on year, reflecting, in part, deployment 
on our major metro projects. Improved 
market conditions also led to greater 
competition for staff, particularly in 
important markets such as Qatar and 
the UAE. However, we were pleased 
that staff turnover remained flat at 16.1% 
(2014: 16.0%) across the region. 
We measure staff engagement through 
our Group wide Viewpoint survey. Our 
overall engagement score for the Middle 
East improved by five percentage points 
year on year, putting us significantly above 
the benchmark for our industry sector. 
This is reinforced by the large proportion 
of people who indicated in the survey 
that they are proud to work for Atkins 
and that they care about the success 
of the organisation. 
During the course of the year, a Middle 
East women’s professional network was 
established to encourage and enable 
talented women throughout the region 
to reach more senior roles. The initiative 
includes projects to make Atkins an 
employer of choice for women in the 
region, with engagement and networking 
sessions, as well as coaching and 
mentoring activities.
Safety and sustainability 
The improvement in our AIR was driven 
by an increase in headcount while the 
number of major accidents was unchanged.
We are demonstrating strong leadership 
through the implementation of the 
Atkins minimum requirements (AMR) for 
construction safety in the region, which 
provides a platform for close engagement 
with clients and their supply chains 
for construction supervision projects, 
including health, safety and welfare 
regulations. As discussed in the Corporate 
sustainability review (page 61), the 
AMR has achieved industry recognition.
We extended our commitment to 
sustainability leadership through the 
continued funding of the chair and senior 
lecturer of sustainable design of the built 
environment at the British University 
in Dubai. 
Risk 
Certain countries within the Middle East 
have greater potential for political change. 
In addition, it is a region where there is 
an increased risk of payment delays. 
Our extensive experience of operating 
in the Middle East over the last 40 years 
gives us a level of insight into the political 
environment which, combined with our 
focused strategy of carefully selecting 
both the countries in which we operate 
and our clients, enables us to mitigate 
political and commercial risks.
Further uncertainty around the oil price 
presents a principal risk because of the 
potential impact on government spending 
and the knock on effect on private sector 
confidence. Our focus on strategically 
important projects and programmes 
gives us a relative degree of insulation 
from short-term changes, which partially 
mitigates this commercial risk. 
 
Construction safety remains an elevated 
risk in the Middle East. We are mitigating 
this wherever possible and have been 
instrumental in creating improved 
standards for the industry. 
We track risks across all our businesses. 
This process is explained in more detail 
in the Principal risks and uncertainties 
section (page 48). 
Outlook 
We have a strong order book standing at 
74.2% of next year’s budgeted revenue 
(2014: 62.7%), which reflects our success 
in winning long-term, major projects. 
Many of these will continue throughout 
next year and are considered unlikely to 
be affected by the oil price uncertainty. 
We see balanced opportunities across 
the key property, infrastructure and rail 
sectors in our focus markets of Qatar, 
the UAE and KSA.  38 Strategic Report

Segmental performance continued
Asia Pacific
Performance
Our Asia Pacific region saw good growth 
in revenue this financial year, up 9.2% 
to £109.7m (2014: £100.5m).
Our operating margin improved compared 
with last year to 8.9% (2014: 8.0%), 
despite our continued investment in IT 
and personnel costs associated with our 
drive to expand into new territories. 
Headcount was slightly ahead, closing 
at 1,523 (2014: 1,498), due to the market 
slowdown in mainland China which 
constrained growth. 
Business model
In Asia Pacific, we operate predominantly 
in Greater China supplemented by 
a network of offices across Malaysia, 
Vietnam, Singapore, India and Australia. 
We provide our clients with a range of 
services throughout the entire cycle of 
urban development, supporting them 
both in-country and overseas, working 
in partnership with chosen Chinese 
contractors.
We have strengthened our regional 
capability in project management and also 
draw upon our Group wide expertise to 
deliver the most technically appropriate 
solutions to our clients.
Strategy
In Hong Kong, we continue to diversify 
our client base and strengthen our 
relationships with internationally 
renowned contractors through our design 
and build projects. We have also assigned 
a dedicated team to pursue government 
projects. 
In mainland China, despite the property 
market slowdown due to the transition 
from an investment to service led 
economy and the introduction by the 
Government of a programme of anti-
corruption measures, our planning and 
architecture business remains client 
focused and is well prepared for the 
continued growth cycle. 
Across the region, we aim to develop 
our advisory role, forming strategic 
partnerships with engineering companies 
and contractors to secure higher value 
opportunities. As our partners increasingly 
look for opportunities to invest as well 
as construct, we seek to work with them 
at the planning and design stage as well 
as during implementation.
As the urbanisation of countries in 
southeast Asia continues, we retain a 
clear focus on urban planning, transport 
infrastructure and property. In India, we 
provide urban planning with a focus on 
programme and project management in 
the infrastructure, buildings and property 
sectors. In delivering our strategy of 
geographic diversification, we are gaining 
traction in the wider region, with project 
wins in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia 
and Singapore. 
Business drivers
Our growth potential in the Asia Pacific 
region is underpinned by the speed 
and scale of urbanisation driving both 
government spending and the rate of 
private sector investment.
Outside Asia Pacific, good business 
opportunities exist for the Group as a 
whole as major Chinese companies invest 
in large scale infrastructure development 
projects outside their domestic market.
Operations
In Hong Kong, following our appointment 
to project manage the implementation 
of major elements of the West Kowloon 
Cultural District in April 2014, the first 
foundation works for the M+ Museum 
and Conservation and Storage Facility 
have begun. Our team dedicated to 
pursuing government projects also 
made good progress, winning a major 
assignment from the Drainage Services 
Department to upgrade the sewerage 
facilities in West Kowloon and Tsuen Wan. 
We have been appointed by Leighton-
China State JV to carry out the detailed 
design for temporary works for the 
underground Exhibition Station and 
300 metre long western approach tunnels 
on Shatin-Central Link, one of the major 
MTR lines that are under construction.
We have won a consultancy service 
contract for the detailed design of 
650 hectares of reclaimed land in 
preparation for the construction of the 
third runway system at Hong Kong 
International Airport. The expansion plan 
will allow the airport’s annual passenger 
capacity to increase by 30 million a year 
upon commissioning by the planning year 
of 2023 according to the Airport Master 
Planning of 2030.
In China, the UK Foreign & Commonwealth 
Office-funded Eco Low-Carbon Urban 
Planning Methodology continues to 
enhance our reputation as a pioneer 
for sustainable urbanisation. We also 
won a new contract to undertake the 
development planning of Shangrao 
High-speed Railway New District, a 
district of 72.8 square kilometres in 
Jiangxi Province strategically located 
within China’s high-speed railway 
network. 
Our 2014 memorandum of understanding 
for global strategic cooperation with 
China Communications Construction 
Company Ltd. and its subsidiary China 
Harbour Engineering Company Ltd.

Asia Pacific
In southeast Asia, we won a substantial 
masterplanning project in Jakarta, 
Indonesia during the year. In Malaysia and 
Vietnam, we continue to pursue projects 
selectively in the transport and property 
sectors. In particular, we are pursuing an 
increased number of private sector roles 
by bringing our programme and project 
management, design, engineering and 
technical capability together to provide 
a fully integrated service.
In India, we see good opportunities in 
the property, masterplanning and 
transportation sectors. We are working 
closely with our team in Hong Kong 
to target selected clients and niche 
opportunities in the Indian property 
market.
Our Faithful+Gould business has fully 
integrated Confluence strengthening 
our multidisciplinary offering to clients. 
Our appointment as engineering project 
manager on the Formula 1 Singapore 
Grand Prix has been extended for a 
further three years and our pharmaceutical 
sector workload remains strong for clients 
such as Abbott, GSK, Johnson&Johnson, 
Novartis and Roche. While economic 
growth has slowed in China and India, 
we continue to see opportunities in the 
hospitality sector and have been appointed 
to project manage the refurbishment 
works at one of Singapore’s most iconic 
resorts. 
People
Overall headcount in our Asia Pacific 
region was slightly ahead in the year 
although there were marked variations 
by territory. Staff turnover has decreased 
to 12.2% (2014: 16.4%), reflecting 
market conditions. Our ability to attract 
and retain staff remains a key area of  
focus for us this year.
We are investing in and developing our 
human resources infrastructure to support 
our regional expansion plans, and have 
also invested in technology and personnel 
to ensure that we are able to support 
and sustain our next phase of growth.
In Asia Pacific, our equal opportunities 
employment approach has helped attract 
and retain female employees, with 
43% of the overall headcount being 
female and with a 27% representation 
in senior management roles. Over 40% 
of all our new hires for graduate engineer 
and experienced candidate positions, 
outside Faithful+Gould, were female.
Our work with engineering campuses to 
showcase the varied opportunities and 
work culture that Atkins has to offer has 
resulted in 50% of our overall graduate 
engineers being female in our global 
design centres (GDCs). The GDCs have 
also introduced a flexible working policy. 
Currently over 20% of the GDC workforce 
is female.
Safety and sustainability
Against a strong background in health 
and safety, we were disappointed our 
AIR increased again this year although 
the increase is due to a single office-
related incident. 
In November, we won the Sustainability 
Award at the British Business Awards 
2014 in China. The awards recognise 
and promote excellence in innovation, 
enterprise and endeavour in British 
and Chinese business. The Sustainability 
Award recognises organisations that 
have demonstrated a commitment to 
the building of a sustainable business 
in China.
In India, we have set up a health and 
safety forum to review and share safety 
best practice with other consultants.
Risk
During the year, we have seen political 
unrest in Hong Kong and the introduction 
of widespread anti-corruption measures 
on mainland China, both resulting in 
potentially increased risk for our business. 
We continue to monitor developments 
closely in both territories. If this impacts 
the flow of work we will take appropriate 
action regarding headcount and resourcing.
We are expanding our footprint across 
the region and we recognise that this 
expansion brings increased risks. These 
risks have been identified as lack of 
commercial transparency, political 
instability and risks associated with 
operating within unfamiliar regulatory, 
tax and employment regimes. We mitigate 
these risks by undertaking research into 
both the market and specific clients, as 
well as using professional advisors to assist 
with legal and regulatory compliance.
We identify, review and assess risks across 
all of our businesses and the process is 
explained in more detail in the Principal 
risks and uncertainties section (page 48). 
This year we implemented successfully 
our online service delivery process in 
Asia Pacific, for more information see the 
market section (page 51).
Outlook
Asia Pacific remains well placed to deliver 
on its strategic growth plan, helped by 
the acquisition of Confluence in October 
2013. In mainland China, growth is 
expected to be impacted by the 
slowdown in the economy during the 
second half of this year and the 
Government’s anti-corruption campaign, 
but to remain attractive. Our move to 
focus on higher quality projects will 
continue.
In Hong Kong, the Legislative Council’s 
delayed approval of funding has caused 
a reduction in the pipeline of public work. 
However, across the segment work in 
hand is consistent with last year at 49.2% 
(2014: 49.3%) of our budgeted revenue, 
and we believe the potential in the region 
remains underpinned by the speed and 
scale of urbanisation.  Strategic Report 41

Performance
Our Energy business continued to perform 
well despite the effect of the low oil price. 
Revenue was up 7.3% year on year 
(5.4% on an underlying basis excluding 
this year’s acquisitions and changes to 
joint venture accounting) and staff 
numbers increased 24.1% to 1,813. The 
year on year improvement in operating 
margin was supported by a reduced level 
of bidding costs on major programmes 
as compared with last year. Growth has 
been supported by successful partnering 
arrangements and two acquisitions in 
North America. The downturn in certain 
oil and gas markets during the second 
half was more than offset by growth in 
our nuclear business. 
Business model
The Energy business operates worldwide 
competing against a wide range of 
competition, from large multinational 
engineering consultancies to specialist 
niche players. 
Strategy
We remain focused on oil and gas, 
nuclear, conventional power generation 
and renewables. In these industries we are 
applying our high end, multidisciplinary 
engineering skills during both design and 
operational phases to assure the integrity 
and economic performance of our clients’ 
facilities.
We continue to look at investment 
opportunities to selectively expand our 
geographic footprint and service offering 
through organic growth, as well as 
extending and creating new partnering 
arrangements and targeting acquisitions. 
Business drivers
Our business is underpinned by the global 
growth in energy requirements as many 
countries struggle with increasing demand 
and the desire to decarbonise to mitigate 
the effects of climate change.
In nuclear and conventional power 
generation, the imperative to keep 
existing generation and distribution 
facilities operating safely for longer 
remains, as well as the need for technical 
support around nuclear decommissioning. 
As many countries look to develop nuclear 
power as part of their long-term strategy 
for more secure, low carbon energy, we 
are seeing momentum gather on nuclear 
new build programmes around the world. 
Our skills are therefore in high demand 
across the entire nuclear lifecycle. 
In oil and gas, we continue to see a similar 
focus on keeping existing production 
and distribution facilities operating safely 
for longer, drawing on our safety and 
integrity services. As the oil and gas 
industry seeks to reduce operating costs 
as a consequence of the low oil price, 
there is continued demand for our 
advanced engineering skills and lifecycle 
expertise.
Operations
Nuclear
Approval from the US Government in 
September 2014 saw the successful 
completion of our acquisition of Nuclear 
Safety Associates. The acquisition not only 
enhances the capability of the Group’s 
Energy business, with 130 specialists in 
nuclear safety, design engineering, and 
professional security services, but also 
establishes our nuclear footprint in 
North America in both the federal and 
commercial US nuclear industries. 
Elsewhere our international nuclear 
portfolio remains strong as we continue 
to provide a broad range of services to 
the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation 
in the Middle East on the £20bn Barakah 
New Nuclear Programme, through our 
joint venture with French engineering 
consultancy Assystem, n.triple.a., and to 
the €15bn International Thermonuclear 
Experimental Reactor programme in 
the South of France, through our role 
as architect engineer, as part of the 
Engage consortium. 
In the year, we signed a memorandum 
of understanding (MOU) with the China 
National Nuclear Corporation that will 
enable us to focus on supporting China’s 
entry into the UK new build market. This 
MOU represents our first step in building 
a longer-term relationship with Chinese 
companies in the energy industry.
Our position in the UK’s nuclear 
decommissioning market strengthened 
in the year with the award of a new 
contract with Sellafield Ltd for its £1.4bn 
Silos Direct-encapsulation Plant project, 
one of the largest high hazard nuclear 
waste projects in the world, as part of 
a joint venture with AREVA and Mace. 
This award is testament to the success of 
our strategic partnerships, which continue 
to deliver some excellent opportunities 
for the Group. Strategic Report 43

Energy
We continue to be busy on existing 
nuclear generation and life extension 
work through our role as an EDF Energy 
UK Strategic Supply Chain Partner 
and providing design, engineering, 
infrastructure and project management 
services to URENCO’s €540m capital 
expenditure programme.
Our position in the UK nuclear new build 
market remains strong as we continue to 
provide engineering and related technical 
services to Horizon Nuclear Power and 
EDF Energy for a new generation of 
nuclear power stations in the UK.
Oil and gas
While the oil price has resulted in 
challenging market conditions for some 
of our oil and gas teams, the division 
overall remains resilient. With much 
of our experience and expertise in 
operational support, our clients are 
seeking the added value that our skills 
in asset integrity management and 
production optimisation can bring to 
improve operational efficiency.
We continue to expand our ability to 
provide services on a worldwide scale 
through our operational hubs in the 
UK, Middle East, North America and Asia 
Pacific. In October 2014, the successful 
acquisition of Houston Offshore 
Engineering added 150 people in 
North America with world class skills in 
deepwater floating production platforms. 
Further expanding our expertise and 
international footprint has helped us 
secure long-term framework agreements 
for both consultancy and design services 
for major international oil and gas 
operators such as BP, Shell, Maersk, 
Chevron, Apache, Nexen and Statoil. 
An addition to our long-term framework 
agreements, a notable win in the year was 
a five year contract for the provision of 
structural integrity management services 
with Talisman Sinopec Energy UK Limited, 
elevating us to a tier one supplier and 
building on our previous 10 year 
multidisciplinary working relationship. 
A new five year agreement with Centrica 
to support decommissioning projects in 
the UK and Netherlands demonstrates 
how our cross-industry expertise and 
decommissioning experience in both 
nuclear and oil and gas has become 
an important differentiator in the 
decommissioning market. 
 
The Middle East market continues to 
provide opportunity for growth with 
a strong pipeline of work, including the 
recent award of a contract to provide 
engineering services to Shanghai Electric 
Power Construction Corporation in 
support of a major project for Aramco 
and we continue to support the Abu 
Dhabi Marine Operating Company with 
the safe life extension of existing critical 
infrastructure.
Elsewhere, our international oil and gas 
operations remain busy on projects such 
as supporting Eni UK Limited’s portfolio 
of assets in Australia, a contract for the 
INPEX Corporation-operated Ichthys 
LNG Project, offshore Western Australia, 
and acting as technical advisor and 
engineering designers on Singapore’s 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal as 
part of a five year engineering services 
agreement for our full range of 
capabilities, building on our portfolio 
of projects in the LNG market. 
Power
Our power division continues to maintain 
a significant portfolio in providing high 
end technical support to large scale power 
generation and transmission projects 
with clients such as National Grid, Drax, 
Eggborough and ENERGOS in the UK. 
We became framework partner to 
SSE Hornsea Ltd in the year to provide 
end to end support through the 
development and execution of major 
projects at two gas storage sites in the 
UK. Our ability to draw on expertise from 
different parts of the Group, including 
project costing and management 
capabilities from Faithful+Gould, was key 
to establishing this long-term partnership.
This division continues to access new 
international markets with the award by 
the Hyundai Engineering and Construction 
Company to provide engineering design 
services for the Abu Dhabi Water & 
Electricity Authority Mirfa Independent 
Water and Power Project in Abu Dhabi. 
As well as building our pipeline in the 
Middle East, we have been engaged by 
China Light and Power in Hong Kong to 
look at options to extend the life of its 
generating assets. These contracts follow 
the award of the open ended contract 
providing engineering design services 
to Tennessee Valley Authority’s coal 
and gas plants as part of our teaming 
arrangement with Merrick & Co in 
North America last year.  44 Strategic Report

Marine renewables
Our portfolio of work in the marine 
renewables industry continues to expand 
with the addition of another engineering 
design services contract for three offshore 
substations at DONG Energy’s proposed 
Hornsea Project One offshore wind farm. 
We have secured major contracts with 
DONG Energy’s eight offshore substations, 
including those at the planned Burbo 
Bank Extension, Race Bank and Walney 
Extension offshore wind farm projects in 
the UK. Our work on Statoil’s Dudgeon 
Offshore Wind Farm also continues. 
We have been commissioned by the 
Carbon Trust to carry out an industry 
study into the use of low frequency AC 
technology for offshore wind farm power 
transmission. This commission to explore 
ways to reduce the costs of wind power 
grid integration, together with our work 
in developing offshore floating technology, 
improves the viability for wind farms to 
be located further offshore and therefore 
helps to position us at the forefront of 
the industry’s next development phase. 
People
Overall headcount increased by 352 
due in part to our two North American 
acquisitions. Underlying headcount 
increased approximately 7%, underpinning 
good business performance. Staff turnover 
has fallen in line with our expectations 
and reached a four year low of 8.6% 
(2014: 11.7%).
We measure employee engagement 
through our Group wide Viewpoint 
survey. Our overall engagement score for 
Energy remains significantly better than 
the benchmark for our industry sector. 
A significant majority of people indicated 
that they are proud to work for Atkins. 
Our people have used a variety of 
platforms to encourage students to 
consider a career in engineering, including 
visits by our graduates to school and 
university events.
We continue to work to increase the 
proportion of female employees and have 
introduced a range of flexible working 
options to help us both recruit and retain 
staff. This and other initiatives helped 
us to increase the level of new recruits 
in the UK this year that are female from 
23 to 30, which is 24% of total hires, an 
increase of 6%. A women’s professional 
network is now well established in our 
major office locations and we are piloting 
a programme to support women 
returning to work after maternity leave. 
Safety and sustainability
The year on year increase in our AIR is 
the result of a single reportable accident, 
compared with zero accidents in the 
prior two years. 
Worldwide, we currently have over 
120 safety engineers who provide 
technical and safety engineering services 
to the onshore and offshore assets 
of the majority of large oil companies 
and we provide similar services to the 
nuclear and power industries.
We are helping society to make the 
transition to a low carbon economy 
through our work on a wide range of 
low carbon enabling technologies such 
as nuclear, offshore wind, tidal, carbon 
capture and storage, and biomass. 
We also work on helping to extract 
the world’s remaining oil and gas 
resources sustainably. 
Risk
The risks identified as being most 
pertinent to Energy are the oil price 
remaining low for an extended period 
and those associated with the safety, 
environmental and reputational 
consequences of an error in our work 
given the high hazard nature of the 
facilities on which we work. 
We have also identified that our plans 
for growth are potentially affected by 
the availability of skills. To mitigate this 
risk we continue to invest in our in-house 
training academy that now provides 
externally recognised courses. This year 
we welcomed over 500 people onto 
these courses. 
We assess risks across all of our businesses 
and this is explained in more detail in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section 
(page 48).
Outlook
The outlook for our Energy business 
remains good despite the ongoing market 
impact of falling oil prices. 
We are well positioned in growth 
markets and have work in hand at 29.8% 
(2014: 31.8%) of budgeted revenue. 
We are monitoring the trading 
environment in oil and gas closely and 
will react rapidly and adapt to changes; 
we anticipate reduced volumes in this 
industry during the coming year and if 
necessary will redeploy resources to 
other parts of Energy and across the 
Group as a whole. Strategic Report 45

Financial performance review
Performance summary
Our underlying profit before tax was 
£121.9m, an increase of 14.6% over 
last year’s profit of £106.4m, on revenue 
that increased 0.4% to £1.76bn 
(2014: £1.75bn). This profit includes 
the benefit of £5.0m of research and 
development expenditure credit (RDEC) 
following early adoption of new rules in 
the UK. In previous years the equivalent 
benefit was shown as a reduction in the 
tax charge. 
We believe underlying profit is a more 
representative measure of performance, 
removing the items that may give a 
distorted view of performance. In the 
current year, we have removed net profits 
on disposals and costs associated with 
disposals of £0.4m (2014: £10.5m), 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of £6.9m (2014: £2.7m), exceptional 
transaction costs of £4.4m (2014: £nil), 
impairment of goodwill of £2.8m 
(2014: £nil) and deferred acquisition 
payments of £1.5m (2014: £nil). The 
unadjusted reported profit before tax 
was £106.7m (2014: £114.2m).

Revenue and profit before tax were 
adversely affected by currency headwinds 
of £22.8m and £1.1m respectively against 
a constant currency basis. 
Reported operating profit was £118.5m 
(2014: £113.7m), at a margin of 6.7% 
(2014: 6.5%). As we state above, we 
believe a more representative measure 
of operating profit adds back amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets of £6.9m 
(2014: £2.7m), exceptional transaction 
costs of £4.4m (2014: £nil), impairment 
of goodwill of £2.8m (2014: £nil) and 
deferred acquisition payments of £1.5m 
(2014: £nil). 
This shows a more representative 
underlying operating profit of £134.1m 
(2014: £116.4m) giving an improved 
underlying margin of 7.6% (2014: 6.7%).
The net profit on disposal of £0.4m 
is explained in more detail in note 8 
to the Financial Statements (page 153) 
and comprises £0.5m of deferred 
consideration received in relation to 
our previously disposed UK highways 
services business and a loss of £0.1m 
on the disposal of our Polish business.
Headcount closed the year at 18,462 
(2014: 17,489), reflecting headcount 
growth and the acquisitions of Nuclear 
Safety Associates, Houston Offshore 
Engineering and Terramar.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs were £14.5m 
(2014: £13.6m). The year on year increase 
was primarily the result of the increase 
in the net finance costs on net post-
employment benefit liabilities in the UK.
Tax
The Group’s income tax expense for 
the year was £21.0m (2014: £17.9m), 
giving an effective tax rate of 19.7% 
(2014: 15.7%). The Group’s underlying 
effective tax rate was 20.1% 
(2014: 19.0%). The increase in the 
effective tax rate is primarily due to the 
adoption of the new RDEC regime in 
the UK, explained in more detail below. 
Apart from this, the effective tax rate is 
lower than the UK statutory rate of 21% 
(2014: 23%) due to continued utilisation 
of tax losses not previously recognised, 
the impact of prior year adjustments 
and our regional profile of profits.
The Group has early-adopted the new 
RDEC regime in the UK with effect from 
1 April 2013. This regime permits research 
and development (R&D) credits to be 
recognised above the line rather than as 
an incentive delivered entirely via tax relief. 
For the year ended 31 March 2015, this 
resulted in an increase in our reported 
profit before tax of £5.0m. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS from continuing operations was 
87.8p (2014: 98.4p). Underlying diluted 
EPS on continuing operations was 97.1p 
(2014: 85.7p), an increase of 13.3%.
Pensions 
Funding
Cash contributions of £32.0m 
(2014: £32.0m) were made to the Atkins 
Pension Plan (the Plan) during the year. 
Under the latest agreed recovery plan 
the Group will contribute £32.8m to the 
Plan for the year ending 31 March 2016, 
with annual contributions escalating by 
2.5% each year until 31 March 2025.
There were no pension settlement or 
curtailment gains in 2015 or in the 
comparative period.
Charges
The total charge to the Consolidated 
Income Statement in respect of defined 
benefit schemes was £16.0m 
(2014: £14.3m), comprising current 
service cost of £2.2m (2014: £2.1m), 
administrative expenses of £0.2m 
(2014: £0.2m) and a net interest expense 
of £13.6m (2014: £12.0m). The charge 
relating to defined contribution schemes 
increased to £39.8m (2014: £37.9m).
IAS 19 (revised 2011) – valuation 
and accounting treatment
The Group determines pension scheme 
funding with reference to actuarial 
valuations, but for reporting purposes 
uses IAS 19 (revised 2011). Under 
IAS 19 (revised 2011) the Group 
recognised a reduced retirement benefit 
liability of £298.4m at 31 March 2015 
(2014: £324.2m).
The assumptions used in the IAS 19

(2014: £130.2m) and the Company 
had shareholders’ funds of £196.3m  
(2014: £186.4m). The Company had 
104.5m fully paid ordinary shares in issue 
at 31 March 2015 (2014: 104.5m). For 
further details, refer to note 31 to the 
Financial Statements (page 191).
Treasury policy and objectives
The Group’s treasury function manages 
and monitors external funding and 
investment requirements and financial 
risks in support of the Group’s corporate 
objectives. The Board reviews and agrees 
procedures, requirements and authority 
levels for treasury activities. The Board 
delegates responsibility for the detailed 
review of the policies to the Audit 
Committee. 
The Group’s financial instruments, other 
than derivatives, comprise borrowings, 
cash and liquid resources and various 
items, such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, which arise directly from its 
operations. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to finance the 
Group’s activities. The Group also enters 
into derivative transactions, principally 
forward foreign currency contracts to 
manage foreign exchange risk on material 
commercial transactions undertaken in 
currencies other than the local functional 
currency. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s 
financial instruments are market risk 
(including foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and price risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s exposures to 
and management of each of the main 
risks, together with sensitivities and risk 
concentrations, are described in more 
detail in note 19 to the Financial 
Statements (page 167).
The Group funds its ongoing activities 
through cash generated from its 
operations and, where necessary, 
borrowings and finance leases. The 
Group’s debt facilities are described 
in note 26 to the Financial Statements 
(page 179). Utilisation of the Group’s 
facilities is a consequence of prior and 
current year acquisitions and ongoing 
organic growth. As at 31 March 2015 
the Group had £138.1m of undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities available 
(2014: £141.5m).
There have been no significant changes 
to the Group’s treasury procedures, 
requirements and authority levels 
during the year.
Critical accounting policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies 
are described in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements (page 135). The Financial 
Statements for the year ended 
31 March 2015 have been prepared 
under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
The preparation of financial statements 
in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. 
Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the 
amount, event or actions, actual results 
may ultimately differ from those 
estimates. Material estimates applied  Strategic Report 47

Investor Information
Financial performance review continued
across the Group’s businesses and joint 
ventures are reviewed to a common 
standard and adjusted where appropriate 
to ensure that consistent treatment of 
similar and related issues that require 
judgement is achieved upon consolidation. 
Any revisions to estimates are recognised 
prospectively.
The accounting policies and areas that 
require the most significant estimates and 
judgements to be used in the preparation 
of the Financial Statements are in relation 
to contract accounting, including 
recoverability of receivables, goodwill 
impairment, defined benefit pension 
schemes, tax, research and development, 
and joint arrangements.
Contract accounting
The Group’s contract accounting policy is 
central to how the Group values the work 
it has carried out in each financial year.
This policy requires forecasts to be made 
on the projected outcomes of projects. 
These forecasts require assessments 
and judgements to be made on changes 
in, for example, work scope, changes 
in costs and costs to completion. While 
the assumptions made are based on 
professional judgements, subsequent 
events may mean that estimates 
calculated prove to be inaccurate, with a 
consequent effect on the reported results.
Goodwill impairment
As set out in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements (page 135), goodwill is subject 
to impairment review both annually 
and when there are indications that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 
The carrying value of goodwill is 
compared to the recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of the value in use 
and fair value less costs to sell.
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to each of the 
cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups 
of CGUs, that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. 
Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest 
level within the entity at which goodwill 
is monitored for internal management 
purposes. 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired 
requires an estimation of the value in use 
of CGUs to which the goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation 
requires an estimate to be made of the 
timing and amount of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the CGU and the 
application of a suitable discount rate to 
calculate the present value. The discount 
rates used are based on the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital adjusted 
to reflect the specific economic 
environment of the relevant CGU.
Following the downturn in the European 
aerospace market, the carrying amount 
of goodwill arising on the acquisition in 
2007 of the Dutch consultancy Atkins B.V. 
(formerly Nedtech Engineering B.V.) was 
reviewed and, as a consequence, has 
been reduced to its recoverable amount 
through the recognition of an impairment 
loss of £2.8m. This loss was included in 
administrative expenses in the Group’s 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Defined benefit pension schemes
Accounting for pensions involves 
judgement about uncertain events in the 
future such as inflation, salary levels at 
retirement, longevity rates, rates of return 
on plan assets and discount rates. 
Assumptions in respect of pensions and 
post-employment benefits are set after 
consultation with independent qualified 
actuaries. Management believes the 
assumptions are appropriate. However, 
a change in the assumptions used would 
have an impact on the Group’s results 
and net assets. Any differences between 
the assumptions and the actual outcome 
will affect results in future years. An 
estimate of the sensitivity to changes in 
key assumptions is disclosed in note 29 
to the Financial Statements (page 182).
Tax
The Group is subject to tax in a number 
of jurisdictions and judgement is required 
in determining the Group wide provision 
for income taxes. The Group provides for 
potential liabilities in respect of uncertain 
tax positions where additional tax may 
become payable in future periods and 
such provisions are based on 
management’s assessment of exposures.
As set out in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements (pages 135 to 146), deferred 
tax is accounted for on temporary 
differences using the liability method, 
with deferred tax liabilities being provided 
for in full and deferred tax assets being 
recognised only to the extent that it is 
judged probable that future taxable 
profits will arise against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Research and development
All R&D expenditure is written off to 
the Consolidated Income Statement as 
incurred. In the UK, the Group has early 
adopted the new UK RDEC regime with 
effect from 1 April 2013. These credits 
have characteristics more akin to 
government grants than income taxes 
and therefore are offset against the 
relevant expenditure in the income 
statement rather than via the tax charge. 
The credits are recognised to the extent 
that there is reasonable assurance that 
they will be received, albeit that the claim 
process takes place sometime after the 
original expenditure was incurred. In the 
balance sheet, the receivable reduces the 
overall current tax payable for the Group. 
Joint arrangements
The Group holds 50% of the voting 
rights in some of its joint arrangements. 
However, the Group has joint control 
over these arrangements as under the 
respective contractual agreements 
unanimous consent is required from all 
parties to the agreements for all relevant 
activities. These joint arrangements are 
not structured through separate legal 
vehicles and the terms of the arrangements 
provide the Group and the other parties 
to the arrangements with the rights 
to the assets and obligations for the 
liabilities, or other facts and circumstances 
indicate this is the case. Therefore, 
these arrangements are classified as joint 
operations of the Group. 48 Strategic Report

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Effective risk management is embedded 
in our governance framework, which is 
summarised in the Corporate governance
report (pages 72 to 79).
Our risk management framework supports 
the Board in assessing and determining 
the nature and extent of the significant 
risks it is willing to accept in achieving 
its strategic and operational objectives.
This framework, and the associated risk 
management structure, allow us to 
identify consistently, assess, prioritise, 
manage and report risks of both a 
strategic and operational nature. Our 
strategic and operational risk registers 
allow us to assign owners and mitigation 
strategies to identified risks. Ownership 
is not the exclusive responsibility of 
senior management but is passed down 
to appropriate staff members.
The registers are routinely reviewed by 
the Group Risk Committee. It also receives 
presentations from selected risk owners 
to provide a more detailed explanation 
of the risk, including the associated 
mitigation measures, controls and key 
actions that are required to manage it. 
We also assess all potential project 
opportunities using an online service 
delivery process which includes a risk 
categorisation tool that scores and ranks 
these opportunities using a traffic light 
system. This determines the risk profile 
and is one factor that informs the required 
level of review of each opportunity as it 
moves through the Group’s ‘stage gate’ 
bid approval process. This process, 
combined with the risk management 
framework, is applied across the Group 
and is designed to achieve progressive 
improvement in the quality and rigour 
of our bidding process. 
We continue to manage a number of 
potential risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material impact on our 
strategic and operational objectives. 
Many of these risks are common to other 
companies and we assess them regularly 
to establish the principal risks for 
the Group. 
The table outlines the principal risks, 
the mitigating activities undertaken in 
respect of each of them and indicates 
the direction of change of each in the 
year. We continue to assess these risks 
under two main categories: strategic 
and operational.
Where applicable, the table cross-
references principal risks with segment-
specific risks.
The Board reviews the Group operational and strategic 
risk registers at least quarterly. It delegates authority 
for the service delivery process and risk management 
process to senior management.
Consolidates the risks submitted by functional areas and 
businesses to compile the Group’s key risks. Operational 
risk logs are updated monthly and strategic risk logs 
quarterly.
The Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Group CEO, 
oversees the operation of the Group’s risk management 
framework and provides support to the Board and the 
Audit Committee. It reviews the Group operational and 
strategic risk registers regularly.

Economic outlook
Imposition of government austerity 
measures has an impact on our trading 
performance as spending on public 
sector infrastructure is reduced.
Worsening economic conditions lead 
to reduced levels of private sector 
infrastructure spend and have an adverse 
impact on our clients’ ability to pay for 
our services.
We have increased our sector and 
geographic diversification to provide 
resilience at a time when many of our 
markets still experience uncertainty. 
We have a clear strategic priority to focus 
on sectors which have attractive growth 
prospects with good levels of funding.
We reshaped our business so that nearly 
50% of our revenue is now delivered 
outside the UK. Our medium-term goal 
is to generate more than 75% of revenue 
from our non-UK and Energy businesses.
To provide resilience and remain 
competitive, we utilise our global design 
centres (GDCs) in India to support market 
opportunities and projects across the 
regions in which we operate.
We seek to redeploy our people around 
the Group to meet demand in growth 
markets and sectors, frequently moving 
work to people and people to work to 
enhance Group agility and staff utilisation.
We perform periodic client credit checks 
and maintain regular management reviews 
of credit terms, trade debtors and work 
in progress.
We are focused on targeting growth 
in well-funded infrastructure markets. 
During the year we increased the 
utilisation of our Indian GDCs, increasing 
staff numbers across our two sites 
(Delhi and Bangalore).
Financial
A deterioration of the Group’s financial 
position limits our ability to invest 
in growth.
Adverse movements in liability 
assumptions or asset values result in a 
significant increase in the Group’s defined 
benefit pension obligations, increasing 
the cash funding required to repay the 
deficit and reducing our ability to invest 
in further growth opportunities.
We review the Group’s trading and 
funding position on an ongoing basis.
The Group’s treasury function manages 
and monitors external funding and 
investment requirements and risks arising 
from the Group’s financial instruments 
risks, including foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
We have made good progress in 
implementing our strategy to continue 
to de-risk our defined benefit pension 
schemes. We will continue to manage 
the assets and liabilities of our pension 
schemes.
In early 2015, we amended and extended 
our five year revolving credit facility of 
£200m which now matures in 2020. This 
is in addition to our 2012 debut issue in 
the US private placement market, which 
together broaden the sources of funding 
available to the Group.
We have continued to monitor and 
manage our strategy to de-risk our 
defined benefit pension schemes during 
2015. In 2014, we successfully concluded 
our negotiations on the triennial actuarial 
funding valuation with the Trustee of 
the Atkins Pension Plan, which resulted 
in an extension of the associated deficit 
repayment plan to 31 March 2025.
Further information is contained in 
the United Kingdom and Europe review 
(page 27).
Geopolitical
Political instability in the regions within 
which we operate has a negative impact 
on our ability to deliver contractual 
services and receive payment, and 
endangers the safety of our people.
Political transition leads to uncertainty 
or deadlock delaying government 
funded programmes.
We have focused on geographies that 
have more stable trading markets and 
environments with regional growth 
resulting from economic diversity, 
population growth and urbanisation.
We closely monitor our operating 
geographies and markets to identify 
geopolitical change that could potentially 
have an impact on the trading conditions 
across the Group.
We obtain the latest professional risk and 
security information provided by external 
organisations before engaging in contracts 
in new geographies and we regularly 
monitor the economic stability and the 
security of the markets in which we 
continue to trade.
The operational leadership team and 
senior management periodically review 
geopolitical influences that have the 
potential to affect the economic and 
safety environment in our operating 
geographies and markets.
During the year we developed a security 
standard for our staff when working in 
low, medium and high risk geographies. 
Testing of this standard is underway in 
anticipation of a Group wide roll out 
during the year ending 31 March 2016.

Market
Worsening market conditions, for 
example a fall in commodity prices or a 
shift in industry demand, lead to changes 
in contracts resulting in increased risk 
transfer from clients as competitors 
accept more onerous contract terms 
to win work.
Reductions in the amount of available 
work increase pricing pressure and 
reduce our operating margins.
We have robust, integrated online service 
delivery review processes, which include 
risk classification, peer reviews and Group 
authority approvals during the key stages 
of bidding work, entering into contracts 
and during delivery of our projects.
We continue to focus our strategy on 
sectors with strong sustainable growth 
prospects, good levels of funding and 
higher technical barriers to entry.
We have a strategic focus on operational 
excellence and, through a series of 
initiatives together with the increasing use 
of our GDCs in India, we aim to deliver a 
competitive cost base while also supporting 
and enabling growth across the Group.
We are continuing to drive operational 
performance across the Group to improve 
our margins.
We continue to embed our integrated 
online service delivery process across the 
Group and this year we implemented 
successfully the online service delivery 
process in Asia Pacific and commenced 
the implementation of the process in 
North America.
During the year, we carried out a review 
of our online service delivery process 
to ensure it continues to provide a robust 
standard for winning, delivering and 
reducing contract and commercial risk 
across the Group.
During the second half of the year we 
have taken action to reduce our resources 
in our oil and gas business, redeploying 
elsewhere within the Group where 
possible, in response to reduced demand 
for our services from a number of our 
clients as they have reacted to the fall 
in oil prices. 
Regulatory/legal
Legislation and regulations restrict our 
ability to operate in certain locations or 
perform certain activities leading to the 
need to exit these markets.
Breaches of regulation or legislation result 
in fines, imprisonment and reputational 
damage.
We seek external advice about new and/
or changing trading restrictions, 
communicating these changes across 
our business as necessary.
We operate a Group trading standard and 
associated country approval list, detailing 
the approved procedure for trading 
worldwide. The country approval list 
details the risk profile for countries around 
the world across matters including trade 
restrictions, corruption and travel security, 
which determine the level of approval 
required to trade there.
We continue to invest in training and 
communication in the area of compliance.
We have a whistleblower hotline that 
is available to all our people, suppliers, 
subcontractors, clients and third parties.
The Group code of conduct was launched 
during the year with all our people either 
receiving or being provided with access 
to a copy. To ensure that all our people 
have read and understood the code, 
an e-learning module has been built and 
tested ready for launch during the year 
ending 31 March 2016.
During the year the Group trading 
standard and the associated country 
approval list have been reviewed and 
updated, and these are accessible to all 
our people via our intranet.

Health, safety and environmental
Shortcomings in our design or works’ 
supervision result in a health, safety 
or environmental incident involving our 
people, clients or other third parties 
leading to injury, loss of life and/or 
significant damage to our reputation 
with all stakeholders.
Safety is part of our commitment to 
quality and reliability. Clear and explicit 
senior management leadership on health, 
safety and environmental matters is 
regularly reinforced via targeted campaigns.
Our Group wide behavioural awareness 
programme, Safe and Secure by Choice, 
supports our commitment to creating 
a leading health and safety culture.
We have implemented our safety 
standards worldwide.
We mandate accident and near-miss 
reporting and provide a whistleblower 
hotline to enable our people, suppliers, 
subcontractors, clients and third parties 
to raise concerns confidentially.
We invest in training of and 
communication to our people about 
the importance of safety and security 
in the workplace.
Our standard to assess the competency 
of construction contractors and set the 
minimum requirements expected on 
site during the supervision of the services 
and works continued to be communicated 
to Group businesses around the world 
during the year. Further information is 
contained in the Middle East review 
(page 37).
During the year we developed a security 
standard for our people when working in 
low, medium and high risk geographies. 
Testing of this standard is underway 
in anticipation of a Group wide roll out 
during the year ending 31 March 2016.
We also developed the Atkins operating 
safely (AOS) system this year. The system 
includes an online risk assessment and 
enables employees to be tracked while 
working on site. It has initially been 
implemented in the United Kingdom and 
Europe with a wider roll-out to the rest 
of the Group planned during 2015/16.
The International Standard for Driving, 
ISO 39001, has been adopted providing 
a minimum standard across the Group. 
The whole Group, apart from Europe, 
currently uses the travel tracker 
system through local travel providers. 
Implementation of the standard in Europe 
is planned during the financial year 
ending 31 March 2016.
Part of our code of conduct focuses on 
the safety behaviours of our employees, 
highlighting the importance of reporting 
health and safety incidents. The Safe and 
Secure by Choice awareness campaign 
rolled out during the year includes 
sections on personal safety, able to 
challenge, driving and near miss reporting.
Physical and data security
Confidential client business and/or 
personal data is mishandled, resulting 
in breach of contract, the inappropriate 
release of commercially sensitive 
information or the loss of the personal 
information of our clients and/or our 
people.
Our business systems suffer an attack 
from hackers or viruses.
The safety and security of our people 
is threatened.
We use appropriate physical security, 
secure networks and encryption to 
protect data.
We train our people and provide guidance 
on best practice in information assurance.
The Group security officer seeks to ensure 
best practice and continually raise the 
profile of security across the business.
During the year, we continued to provide 
information assurance guidance and 
training across our business. Information 
assurance guidance and behaviour based 
training modules for the Group are also 
being developed to complement and 
improve the effectiveness of our controls 
in this area and these will be made 
available to all our people.
We have developed a security standard 
(protecting our people and property) and 
an information assurance standard. These 
are scheduled to be rolled out during 
the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
Recognising the increasing focus on 
privacy, the protection of personal data 
and the expectations of our clients, 
people and other stakeholders in this 
regard, a Group data protection manager 
was appointed to develop our approach 
to data protection further.

Projects
Poor management of projects leads to

people.
We continually improve project controls, 
which include regular financial reviews 
of project performance.
We continued during the year to invest 
in increasing the project management 
capabilities across all sectors (people, 
processes and systems) by developing 
a new project management competency 
framework.
Staff recruitment and retention
Failure to attract and retain the most 
talented, motivated professionals in 
their respective fields makes us unable 
to deliver on clients’ expectations and 
respond to the most technically 
challenging and time critical projects, 
thereby eroding our market share and 
damaging our financial performance.
Regular business reviews evaluate  
a number of metrics including headcount, 
staff turnover, vacancy levels and 
employee engagement.
We maintain a succession management 
plan across the Group.
Regular succession planning reviews  
provide support for internal mobility, 
development of an effective talent pipeline 
and career path management.
An annual review of our staff engagement 
through our Viewpoint survey ensures 
that the morale and motivation of our 
people is managed effectively.
During the year we regularly reviewed 
data relating to headcount, staff turnover, 
vacancy levels and employee 
engagement.
Sector succession plans are developed, 
reviewed and implemented each year 
to ensure that we retain our best talent.
A talent management pilot has been 
launched to focus on our high potential 
people in succession management 
planning across the Group.
We implemented improvements across 
the Group during the year to define and 
support career paths within the Group 
including technical, project management, 
business management and business 
development routes. 
We continue to use a variety of channels, 
including our annual Viewpoint survey,  
to engage in a two way dialogue with  
our people.
Technical delivery
Design errors or omissions lead to client 
dissatisfaction, financial losses and 
damage to our reputation for technical 
excellence.
Our robust service delivery process, 
and the associated stage gate review 
procedures during the bidding, 
contracting, delivery and completion 
stage, ensure that the Group has the 
capability to deliver the technical 
requirements within our contracts. 
We use seven design principles which 
govern all our technical work and are 
embedded in our business management 
system. Technical reviews and checking 
during delivery of our projects remains 
a key control.
Our technical assurance guidance is 
included within our business management 
system. 
We have implemented a programme 
of continual technical training and 
development.
’Network chairs’ lead our technical 
centresof excellence across the Group.
We have continued to develop our 
standard in project manager competence 
and development and electronic data 
management across all sectors during 
the year.
We developed a technical assurance 
standard during the year establishing the 
minimum assurance requirement for our 
technical deliverables to our clients in the 
Group. We also refreshed the technical 
assurance guidance in our business 
management system.
During 2014, we set up a working group

businesses and relevant corporate 
functions to develop and disseminate 
best practice regarding technical 
assurance and governance.

Overview
At Atkins, our people are our competitive 
edge. We trust them to go above and 
beyond for the Group and our clients. 
Their individual talent and our collective 
expertise help us to exceed client 
expectations and meet our strategic 
objectives. 
We review our people related activities 
regularly and, as part of this process, 
we consider a range of human resources 
measures, such as headcount, retention 
and employee engagement. We also 
review progress against our Group and 
sector people strategies, ensuring we 
are able to forecast the future skills 
and resourcing needs to support our 
growth plans.
Headcount
Headcount increased by over 970 in the 
year ended 31 March 2015 to 18,462. 
There was a rise in the United Kingdom 
and Europe, the Middle East and Energy, 
reflecting our strategy of organic growth 
and targeted acquisitions. These increases 
were partly offset by a reduction in North 
America, as the region continues to focus 
on operational efficiency and productivity.
We remain focused on attracting people 
into engineering careers from schools 
and universities. We hired almost 
400 new graduates in September 2014 
across all our regions and will be targeting 
a similar number in our September 2015 
intake. There was also an increase in the 
percentage of female graduates in this 
year’s intake, which supports our diversity 
agenda. Our apprentice programme 
continues to attract school leavers 
choosing a career in engineering. Further 
details are provided in the United 
Kingdom and Europe business review 
(page 27). Our Group wide careers 
website gives our people easy access to 
all our vacancies throughout the world 
and helps to encourage internal mobility.
In conjunction with developing our talent 
pool in local markets, we have a growing 
number of people working on planned 
international assignments across the 
Group, either to supplement skills not 
available locally by bringing specific 
technical knowledge to bear or to help 
resource the delivery of larger projects. 
We completed a strategic review of our 
requirements, policies and processes for 
international assignments in the year 
to ensure that we remain competitive 
in this area.
Engagement
Ensuring our people feel valued and 
motivated at work underpins our ethos 
and supports our strategy for growth. 
We know there is always room for 
improvement, therefore, we ask our 
people to tell us what they think and 
then involve them in our plans for change.
Every year we ask our people around 
the world to participate in our Viewpoint 
employee engagement survey. The 
survey comprises a series of strategically 
important themed questions, aligned to 
a pre-defined engagement model. This 
model measures our people’s relationship 
with management and how they feel 
about their jobs and the Group.
Group results are communicated both 
locally and via our Group wide intranet, 
with presentations of results by business 
arranged locally.
Our 2014 survey included 80 questions 
and was completed by 76% of our 
people. Our overall engagement score 
was 68, a really pleasing result. Although 
this represents a one point decrease 
from last year, it is still far higher than 
the global norm for organisations in the 
professional services sector.  56 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
People continued
Questions about carrying out work 
safely remain among our top scoring 
areas, with 95% of people understanding 
how to work safely. Safety questions 
also account for our biggest increases 
from last year, with 68% actively 
challenging unsafe behaviours and 
67% feeling that managers help them 
to take a proactive and visible approach 
to safety, an increase of 3% for both. 
It is also evident that people across 
Atkins continue to care about the 
success of our organisation (94%). 
Areas where we have scope to improve 
further include our ability to retain 
our best people and give them a clear 
career path. 
The Group operational leadership team 
will continue to use the survey outputs 
to improve our employee engagement 
and is committed to developing a set 
of clear actions each year to address 
the feedback.
Day to day we maintain regular 
communication with our employees 
through a range of digital media, with 
content relating to our client wins, project 
successes, thought leadership and stories 
about our people all available on our 
Group wide intranet. We supplement 
online channels with face to face town 
hall meetings and line manager team 
briefings. To coincide with the 
announcement of our financial results, 
we provide updates on our Group 
performance via webinar for all colleagues.
Our senior leadership teams hold 
meetings and open discussions to give 
employees the opportunity to ask 
questions about our strategy and future 
plans. We also use webinars and ‘all hands 
calls’, to engage with our people and 
give them the chance to participate and 
ask questions directly.
Another popular communication channel 
is our CEO blogs, through which our 
regional, Energy and Faithful+Gould 
CEOs share informal thoughts, images 
and updates.
It is evident that people 
across Atkins care about the 
success of our organisation.

What is engagement and why do we measure it?
Ipsos MORI has identified three components – alignment, involvement and loyalty – that can help us to understand and improve the experience  
of our employees.
Alignment Involvement Loyalty Overall score
Our employee engagement score for 2014 can also be measured against the Ipsos Global Sector Norm – in other words, how we compare  
against the responses given by employees in other organisations in the professional services sector, both globally and regionally.
Alignment is about how closely 
an individual’s objectives, values 
and aspirations match those 
of the Group.

Involvement is about how 
involved people feel with their 
job. We measure this through 
key questions around job 
satisfaction, motivation and 
personal fulfilment.
Loyalty measures the emotional 
tie people have to the Group  
as a whole, i.e. how proud they 
feel, what their outlook is and 
how they would speak about 
the Group to others.
The employee engagement 
score is an average score against 
which employee engagement 
can be measured across all  
three components. Strategic Report 57

Investment in people
To achieve our vision to be the world’s 
best design, engineering and infrastructure 
project management consultancy, 
we need to develop and enhance the 
capabilities and performance of our 
people. The Group’s annual training  
spend has increased to over £22m  
(2014: £18.5m).
We have completed the roll out of 
our My Career system, which won 
The Training Journal award for Best 
Change Programme 2014. The system 
automates the performance appraisal 
process across the Group. We continue 
to develop and simplify the process to 
provide greater clarity of objectives, 
improve visibility and tracking, and also 
strengthen the link between performance 
review and reward. This has provided 
an improved process for the targeting 
and delivery of training, at the same time 
allowing greater access to online learning 
and tracking of learning and compliance 
training.
One of the key challenges for our industry 
is to develop the next generation of 
engineers to solve the challenges of 
urbanisation, climate change and energy 
generation. This puts our graduate 
and apprenticeship programmes at the 
heart of developing our talent for the 
future. During the year in addition to our 
significant graduate intake, we recruited  
a further 71 apprentices. We are a 
member of the ‘5% Club’, an industry led 
campaign whose member organisations 
make a public commitment to have at 
least 5% of their UK workforce on formal 
graduate and apprenticeship schemes. 
Our current proportion is 8.9% of 
UK headcount.
We continue to engage with schools 
and colleges to attract students into 
studying science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics (STEM) subjects and 
encourage them towards careers in 
our industry. 
One of the key requirements of our 
growth ambition is the capability of our 
people to get close to our clients and to 
understand their drivers and requirements. 
Our worldwide sales excellence programme 
has continued to strengthen the capability 
of our people in these areas. A further 
1,000 staff attended programme modules 
during the year.
Reward
Pay movement across the Group varies 
by business and geography. This reflects 
both the diversity of our businesses and 
the variability in market conditions 
between businesses and regions. With 
effect from 1 April 2015, the average 
salary increase was 3.3% across the 
Group, with significant variation by region.
To inform the salary review and other 
reward decisions, we conduct 
comprehensive annual benchmarking 
studies across our regions. We use the 
data to improve the competitiveness of 
our remuneration packages and to help 
line managers with pay decisions.
Approximately 1,000 senior leaders 
worldwide participate in our executive 
bonus scheme. This incentivises the 
delivery of above-average financial results 
and exceptional individual performance by 
rewarding the achievement of stretching 
targets and personal objectives.
A discretionary bonus scheme covers 
the wider Atkins population. We expect 
to pay a bonus to around one third of 
staff members, recognising individual 
contribution and performance.
Employee share ownership is encouraged 
across the Group, to align the interests 
of our employees and our shareholders 
and to enable our employees to share in 
the success of the Company. In the UK, 
we operate a share incentive plan (SIP) 
that provides a tax-efficient mechanism 
for employees to become shareholders 
through salary sacrifice arrangements. 
Approximately 11.4% of eligible 
employees participate in the SIP.
We have maintained our focus on the 
management of our historic UK defined 
benefit pension liabilities. The last triennial 
valuation of the Atkins Pension Plan was 
agreed in February 2014 and provides 
a stable repayment plan mechanism to 
manage our deficit contributions over 
the next 11 years.
One of the key challenges for 
our industry is to develop the 
next generation of engineers. 58 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015

Diversity
We are committed to building a diverse 
organisation to maximise the skills 
available to us in the regions in which 
we operate. Policies have been adopted 
to ensure this commitment is implemented 
from the point of attraction and 
recruitment and continues throughout an 
individual’s employment. Our people are 
supported to develop to their full potential 
regardless of sex, race, age, religion or 
belief, disability, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, marriage and civil partner status, 
pregnancy, parental obligations or 
background, subject to the laws of the 
jurisdictions in which we work.
The Group encourages recruitment, 
training, career development and 
promotion on the basis of aptitude 
and ability, without regard to disability. 
We are also committed to retaining and 
retraining, as necessary, employees 
who become disabled during the course 
of their employment.
Gender diversity continues to be a key 
focus for the Group and our goal is to 
develop an organisational culture that fully 
embraces male and female contributions 
in a male-dominated industry. We are 
working towards achieving a better 
gender balance to provide an environment 
where women want to stay and develop 
their careers. In the UK, our efforts in the 
year have been recognised externally, with 
the Group winning a place in The Times 
Top 50 Employers for Women. 
Our goal is to develop an 
organisational culture that 
fully embraces male and 
female contributions.
We have a range of objectives which 
have been devised to align to these goals. 
The women’s leadership council links 
senior women across all regions and 
is committed to supporting women 
throughout the organisation to develop 
and fulfil their potential. A women’s 
professional network is also now well 
established in most regions and Energy, 
which has helped women to feel well 
connected across Atkins.
The gender balance of the senior 
management population decreased 
slightly to 12.37% over the course of 
the year. However, early indications are 
that we have reversed this trend with 
an increase to 13.5% as we progress into 
the new financial year.
As we continue to work to increase 
the proportion of female staff in Atkins 
we have developed a range of flexible 
working options to help us both recruit 
and retain a broader range of staff. This 
is supported by our Viewpoint results, 
which showed an improvement in the 
scores provided by women in many areas.

Corporate sustainability review continued
Our sustainability principles are based 
around three key themes: a society for 
our future, an environment with a future, 
and a responsible business of the future. 
During the year, we ran an employee 
engagement programme to understand 
better what these mean to our people. 
Feedback has been used to create a 
sustainability pathway, for launch in 
2015, setting our sustainability direction 
up to 2020. 
Internally, we are using our RACE2 
programme to put our sustainability 
principles into action in our offices 
worldwide. 
Our focus on health and safety, efficient 
and effective delivery of client solutions, 
environmental management and continual 
improvement are integral to our approach 
to sustainability. 
Leadership
Our commitment to becoming a more 
responsible and sustainable organisation 
has been supported by the introduction 
of our new code of conduct, Behaving 
the Atkins Way. The code provides a 
strong leadership statement and direction 
from our Group CEO. He emphasises 
the importance of ensuring the safety 
and wellbeing of all our people while 
encouraging and empowering them to 
challenge and raise concerns about any 
dishonest, unethical, unacceptable or 
unsafe behaviour.
Raising safety and welfare standards
We are proud of our contribution to 
raising safety standards all over the 
world, which was recognised at the 2014 
inaugural MEED Corporate Health Awards 
in Abu Dhabi, where the Atkins minimum 
requirements for construction safety 
was named Health & Safety Initiative 
of the Year.
In the UK, we were awarded the 
internationally recognised Royal Society 
for the Prevention of Accidents Gold 
Medal. This demonstrated our 
commitment and focus on health and 
safety as it becomes a natural and integral 
part of our culture. 
A society for our future
Inspiring the next generation 
We recognise that inspiring the next 
generation of engineers to build a 
sustainable future will be critical, both 
to our success and to that of society. 
This was emphasised by the publication of 
our report, The skills deficit: consequences 
and opportunities for UK infrastructure. 
The report predicts that infrastructure 
projects in the UK could experience higher 
costs, delays, or poor decision making 
and project delivery in coming years 
due to a lack of scientists, engineers 
and technicians.
We are increasing our efforts to attract 
young people into engineering and other 
technical professions, using a range of 
innovative approaches. For instance, 
during 2014, we used interactive games 
and outdoor photography displays in the 
UK, supersonic cars in North America 
and model bridge building in Hong Kong, 
to engage our audience.
Supporting our people’s development
We are committed to supporting our 
people’s development, equipping them 
to deliver innovative and sustainable 
solutions. As part of this, we ran 
sustainability weeks in the UK, Asia Pacific 
and the Middle East to engage employees, 
raising awareness of its importance to 
Atkins and inviting feedback for inclusion 
in our sustainability pathway strategy. 
We also challenged our international 
graduate community to imagine actions 
we might take on our journey to a more 
sustainable future.
Social and community investment
We are encouraging and supporting 
our people to make an even greater 
contribution to the social, environmental 
and economic health of our communities. 
Across each sector, we focus our efforts 
where we believe our skills can do the 
most good. In the UK we are a patron 
of RedR (an engineering relief charity) 
and in Asia Pacific our volunteers have 
designed two schools for pre-school 
students in Cambodia. 
At a regional, local and office level, our 
people raise money and volunteer time 
and skills in support of a wide range of 
community based activities. For example 
CARES (Collaborate, Awareness, Reward, 
Engage, Support), is a local programme 
which began in our UK business to 
support our people in integrating 
corporate sustainability and responsibility 
into their lives, and which won an award 
for its work this year. Our Hong Kong 
office has been recognised by Hong Kong 
social services for its corporate and social 
responsibility practices, and our people 
in India are supporting their Government’s 
Clean India campaign.
A healthy, safe and secure workplace
We are committed to providing and 
maintaining a safe and healthy working 
environment for our employees and 
ensuring the safety of others affected 
by our operations and services.
This year, we introduced Atkins operating 
safely (AOS), a bespoke system designed 
to help keep our people safe when they 
are visiting sites and unfamiliar offices in 
the UK. The system enables us to track 
people when they are working on site and 
has initially been implemented successfully 
in the United Kingdom and Europe with 
a wider roll-out to the rest of the Group 
planned during 2015/16.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Corporate sustainability review continued
We have demonstrated the high value 
we place on our people’s health by 
conducting a health risk assessment 
across the Group and aim to put an action 
plan in place in 2015 to address the results 
of the assessment. In addition, we have 
broadened our journey to ‘natural safety’ 
by introducing a set of security principles 
to raise awareness of security issues and 
establish minimum standards of expected 
behaviour. 
Safety performance
The accident incident rate (AIR) is an 
industry measure of the number of 
reportable accidents per 100,000 staff. 
Our overall AIR figure for staff summarises 
AIRs for our people and contractors 
working in offices, engineering and 
construction. We set a more stretching 
target than suggested by the UK’s Health 
and Safety Executive (HSE) Labour Force 
Survey data. This is the first time that 
AIR performance levels for staff in office, 
engineering and construction were well 
within our benchmark. Contractor 
performance for office and construction 
was worse than benchmark, although it 
should be noted that, because of the way 
in which it is calculated, AIR is sensitive to 
low contractor numbers and this below 
benchmark performance related to just 
two accidents. The engineering AIR result 
was above benchmark.
Viewpoint survey
Our 2014 employee satisfaction survey, 
Viewpoint, continued to show very 
positive results around safety. 95% of 
our people say that they understand 
how to work safely, with 68% actively 
challenging unsafe behaviours when they 
see them and 67% feeling their managers 
help them to take a proactive and visible 
approach to safety, representing a 3% 
increase for both measures on last year. 
Safe and Secure by Choice
Part of our code of conduct focuses on 
the safety behaviours of our employees, 
highlighting the importance of reporting 
health and safety incidents. The Safe and 
Secure by Choice awareness campaign, 
rolled out during the year, includes 
sections on personal safety, able to 
challenge, driving and near miss reporting. 
We continue to work with colleagues, 
clients and our supply chain to try to 
ensure that health, safety and security are 
fully integrated into our decision-making 
processes. 
Industry leadership
We have played our part in global industry 
leadership by supporting the introduction 
of a Consultants’ Health & Safety Forum 
in India.
In the UK, we collaborated with other 
members of the UK Consultants’ Health 
& Safety Forum, to influence and support 
the HSE in introducing its new 
Construction (Design and Management) 
2015 regulations, which came into force 
on 6 April 2015 and set out what people 
involved in construction work need to 
do to protect themselves and anyone the 
work affects. Our contribution included 
developing industry guidance concerning 
the new role of principal designer which 
arises when it is foreseeable that more 
than one contractor will be working 
on a project.

Measuring and reporting emissions 
to stakeholders and investors
We have disclosed data to the Carbon 
Disclosure Project, the global platform 
for organisational disclosure of investor-
relevant climate change data, for the 
last six years. In 2014 we scored 81 out 
of 100.
For the fifth consecutive year, the Group 
achieved certification to the ISO 14064 
international standard for quantification 
and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. 
We report on gas, electricity and liquid 
fuel consumption, and travel emissions. 
Table 1 shows total emissions by region 
split between scopes 1, 2 and 3, as 
defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
Reducing our emissions
We have carried out energy audits of 
our offices as part of a UK pilot to see 
where we can reduce our emissions. 
Following evaluation of the pilot we will 
look to carry out more energy audits 
in other regions.

Pacific we participated in Earth Hour. 
We also showcased our sustainable 
design credentials by renovating one of 
our own offices in the UK using passive 
environmental design (use of natural 
elements e.g. sunlight, to heat, cool, 
or light a building). 
Transition to a low carbon economy
We are proud to have won a British 
Business Sustainability Award from the 
British Chamber of Commerce in China 
and the China-Britain Business Council, 
in recognition of our commitment to 
building a sustainable business in 
China and promoting the advantages 
of a sustainable business model in the 
Chinese market. 
In the UK, our in-house developed 
carbon critical design tool has attracted 
industry interest and been adopted by 
one of our major clients, Network Rail. 
Our aerospace teams worldwide have 
seen the culmination of over eight years 
work as part of the team developing the 
Airbus A350 XWB (eXtra Wide Body). 
The A350 XWB, the newest and most 
technologically advanced civil aircraft 
in the world, burns 25% less fuel than 
current long-range competitors, 
significantly reducing carbon emissions.
Affordable, reliable and clean energy
As well as working to reduce emissions 
from our own operations, we also use 
our technical expertise in this area to help 
clients incorporate energy efficiency and 
low carbon design into their projects. 
For example, we are working with clients 
on projects that make use of waste to 
energy (WtE) technologies and facilities 
such as the Amager Bakke combined 
heat and power complex on the outskirts 
of Copenhagen, which will produce 
electricity and heat for 150,000 homes, 
and the Abu Dhabi National Energy 
Company’s development of the first 
WtE plant in the United Arab Emirates.
We are also advising megacity Lagos 
on how best to address its energy needs 
through improved distribution and 
increased use of renewable energy 
sources, as well as ways in which it can 
increase resilience against the effects 
of climate change.

Respect for the environment
Managing resources
Our office sustainability programme, 
RACE2, is designed to get all of our 
people thinking and acting in a more 
sustainable and environmentally friendly 
way. Key areas that it encompasses are 
efficient use of materials, control of 
water, waste and recycling. We aim to 
collaborate across the Group to reduce 
both wastage and costs. While RACE2 
is a worldwide initiative, the RACE2 
Awards have so far celebrated good 
practice in the UK only but will be rolled 
out globally in 2015. 
Environmental projects for clients
We won an Outstanding Contribution 
Award at the British Construction Industry 
National Awards for our work as design 
consultant and CDM coordinator on 
Godmanchester town’s flood risk 
alleviation scheme, which included 
a combination of flood walls and flood 
embankment alongside the river Ouse, 
protecting 556 properties.
We have been awarded a new contract 
for data collection and design and 
construction oversight on projects 
initiated by Louisiana’s Coastal Protection 
and Restoration Authority, helping 
to implement its coastal masterplan, 
protecting natural resources and critical 
energy infrastructure.
We are also providing services for the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s 
extensive digital flood risk mapping 
and hazard mitigation programmes, 
identifying risks posed by natural and 
manmade disasters to infrastructure 
and buildings. 
A responsible business of 
the future
Technical excellence
We continue to provide sustainable value 
and technical excellence for our clients, 
using management standards to develop 
more collaborative client relationships. 
For example, we used our technical skills 
to design a simulator to demonstrate the 
consequences of cyber-attack on critical 
national infrastructure such as railways, 
power and water supplies. We won 
Engineering Practice of the Year at the 
Irish Building and Design Awards for our 
approach to sustainability and innovation, 
our commitment to training, and the 
depth and breadth of our projects.
Atkins’ designed Kowloon City Sewage 
Pumping Stations achieved provisional 
Platinum BEAM ratings for innovative 
architectural and landscaping and 
eco-friendly design. The project was also 
recognised with a Green Building Award 
2014 and won Silver Award at Hong Kong 
Institute of Landscape Architects Design 
Awards 2014.
We are also rolling out our Right First Time 
behavioural programme, building on the 
technical assurance standard that we have 
developed to define the requirements for 
all technical deliverables across the Group. 
The standard provides guidance for single 
discipline, multidiscipline, distributed 
working and large/complex projects and 
aims to provide a framework that will 
ensure the consistent quality of all Atkins’ 
deliverables to clients.

We work with our clients and other 
partners to translate investment in 
infrastructure and technology into 
economic and environmental resilience. 
For example, in Sweden, we have been 
contracted in Vetlanda Municipality to 
assess employment, land and premises 
provision for existing and future 
businesses over the next 20 to 30 years, 
aligning global urban planning network 
objectives and identifying the level of 
potential job growth. In the UK, we have 
been appointed to work alongside CH2M 
to provide strategic transport modelling, 
route development, transport planning, 
economic appraisal and evaluation for the 
Crossrail 2 route. We have also provided 
similar services for the High Speed 2 
rail link.
Strong governance and accountability
Our commitment to behaving as a 
responsible business, demonstrating 
transparency and fairness, is outlined 
by our Group policy statements and 
sustainability principles. Our new code 
of conduct, Behaving the Atkins Way, 
works with our business management 
system to set out not only what we do, 
but also how we do it. It provides a 
clear framework within which to make 
decisions, defining what we are all 
expected to do on a daily basis, and 
what we can expect from colleagues. 
Our continued success depends upon 
our ability to maintain the worldwide 
reputation we have built, something we 
can only do if we maintain the highest 
standards of behaviour.

Corporate sustainability review continued
Respect for human rights is critical to us 
and we seek to have a positive influence 
wherever we operate. We communicate 
our support for human rights to 
stakeholders, including employees, 
clients and shareholders, through a 
variety of channels, including the visible 
representation of our values in our day 
to day business dealings.
Strategic engagement for innovation
We help to address the complex 
sustainability challenges faced by society 
by developing innovative solutions in 
collaboration with partners. 
We produced the concept design and 
masterplan for Asia Aerospace City in 
Subang as part of Malaysia’s Economic 
Transformation Plan, which aims to 
produce a self-sufficient, industrialised 
Malaysia by 2020.
We have also been appointed to support 
EY in delivering the UK Government’s 
flagship project – UK Trade and 
Investment’s (UKTI) high value 
opportunities programme to secure major 
contracts for UK companies. We will 
disseminate market intelligence on many 
of the world’s biggest infrastructure 
opportunities, such as proposed nuclear, 
airport and transport schemes, and 
new city developments around the world, 
with UKTI facilitating access to major 
government and private sector clients.
We are very proud of our people’s 
commitment to Atkins’ sustainability 
principles and of their growing effect 
on our activities and operations. Playing 
our part as a responsible business of the 
future is important to us, and we look 
forward to making even more progress 
in the year ahead.

company for each financial year, designed 
to inform shareholders and help them 
assess how the directors have performed 
their duty to promote the success of the 
company. Additionally the directors are

•	 Principal risks and uncertainties 
(pages 48 to 53)
•	 employment matters, such as inclusion 
and diversity and provision of 
information to, and consultation with, 
employees (People, pages 54 to 59).
The following pages of the Annual Report 
contain all other statutorily required 
information and information required 
to be disclosed under the UK Listing 
Authority’s Listing Rules and Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules (the LRs and DTRs 
respectively). To the extent necessary,

The Annual Report will be laid before 
shareholders at the annual general 
meeting (AGM) to be held at One Great 
George Street, Westminster, London 
SW1P 3AA at 1100 on Wednesday 
29 July 2015. Details of the business 
to be considered at the AGM, together 
with an explanation of each of the 
resolutions, are set out in the separate 
notice of meeting.
Directors
The names and biographies of those 
persons serving as directors of the 
Company as at the date of this report are 
incorporated into this report by reference 
and can be found in the Board of directors 
section (pages 66 to 67). James Cullens 
was appointed as a director with effect 
from 1 July 2014 and replaced Alun 
Griffiths as Group HR director following 
his retirement on 30 July 2014. Rodney 
Slater retired as a non-executive director 
on 30 July 2014. Catherine Bradley was 
appointed as a non-executive director 
with effect from 9 June 2015.
Under the Company’s articles of 
association all directors must retire at the 
first AGM following their appointment 
by the Board and may offer themselves 
for election by shareholders. Catherine 
Bradley, following her appointment by 
the Board as a non-executive director 
from 9 June 2015, will stand for election 
at the AGM. In line with the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
all directors retire at each AGM and, 
if eligible, may offer themselves for 
re-election. This year all the directors, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for 
re-election. The Board considers that each 
of the directors standing for re-election 
continues to be effective and that each of 
them demonstrates a strong commitment 
to their role.
Indemnification of and insurance 
cover for directors and officers
Directors and officers of the Company 
and its subsidiaries benefit from directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance cover in 
respect of legal actions brought against 
them. In addition, directors of the 
Company are indemnified in accordance 
with article 138 of the Company’s articles 
of association to the maximum extent 
permitted by law, such indemnities being 
qualifying third party indemnities. Prior to 
the adoption of new articles of association 
by shareholders on 3 September 2008, 
all directors in appointment on that date 
had separate deeds of indemnity. These 
indemnities, which still remain in force, 
are available for inspection by shareholders 
at the Company’s registered office 
during normal business hours and will 
be available for inspection at the AGM.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnities 
provide cover where the relevant director 
or officer has acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly.
Articles of association
The Company’s articles of association 
set out the Company’s internal regulation 
and cover such matters as the rights 
of shareholders, the appointment and 
removal of directors, the power to issue 
and buy back shares and the conduct of 
Board and general meetings. A copy of 
the Company’s articles of association 
is available on the Group’s website or 
on request from the company secretary. 
Amendments to the articles of association 
must be approved by at least 75% of 
those voting in person or by proxy at 
a general meeting of the Company. Governance 69

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ report continued
In accordance with the Company’s 
articles of association, directors can be 
appointed or removed by the Board or 
by shareholders in general meeting. 
Subject to the provisions of relevant 
legislation, the Company’s articles of 
association and any directions given by 
a special resolution of the shareholders, 
the Board of directors may exercise all 
the powers of the Company and may 
delegate authorities to committees and 
management as it sees fit. Details of 
the main committees of the Board are

and on the Group’s website.
Research and development
The Group develops and delivers 
innovative technical solutions to its clients, 
the costs of which are expensed to the 
Consolidated Income Statement (page 128). 
The Group obtains enhanced tax relief 
for these costs in certain territories, 
particularly the UK and the US. In the 
UK, the Group has early-adopted the 
new RDEC (research and development 
expenditure credit) regime in the UK with 
effect from 1 April 2013, further details 
on which are provided in note 1 to the 
Financial Statements (page 14).
Political donations and 
expenditure
The Group made no political donations 
and incurred no political expenditure 
in the UK or European Union (EU) 
during the year ended 31 March 2015 
(31 March 2014: nil).
Since 1 April 2012, our policy has, in 
accordance with relevant US Federal 
and state election laws, been to make 
corporate political donations only on the 
following basis:
•	 directly to non-partisan ballot initiatives 
supporting infrastructure development 
and maintenance or
•	 to individual candidates and political 
parties only via the affiliated PACs, 
funded entirely by employee contributions.
Under this policy there were seven 
donations totalling $48,000 made to 
non-partisan US ballot initiatives during 
the year ended 31 March 2015 (2014: nil). 
In addition, we have one political action 
committee in the US that makes donations 
funded entirely by employee contributions.
Shares
Share capital
As at the date of this report, the Company’s 
share capital consists of 104,451,799 
issued and fully paid ordinary shares each 
with a nominal value of 0.5p, listed on 
the London Stock Exchange, of which 
4,341,000 ordinary shares are held in 
treasury. Shares may be held in certificated 
or uncertificated form. Further details 
of the Company’s issued share capital, 
including changes during the year, can 
be found in note 31 to the Financial 
Statements (page 191).
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares are contained 
in the Company’s articles of association 
and the Companies Act 2006 (the Act). 
In summary, the ordinary shares allow 
holders to receive dividends and to 
exercise one vote on a poll per ordinary 
share for every holder present in person 
or by proxy at general meetings of the 
Company. Shares held in treasury are not 
entitled to vote or receive dividends. There 
are no restrictions on the transfer or sale 
of ordinary shares and no requirements 
for prior approval of any transfers, except 
as described below. Under the Company’s 
articles of association, the directors have 
the power to suspend voting rights and 
the right to receive dividends in respect 
of ordinary shares and to refuse to 
register a transfer of ordinary shares in 
circumstances where the holder of those 
shares fails to comply with a notice 
issued under section 793 of the Act. The 
directors also have the power to refuse 
to register any transfer of certificated 
shares that does not satisfy the conditions 
set out in the articles of association.
The Company has a Level 1 American 
Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme, 
which enables US investors to purchase 
the Company’s American Depositary 
Shares (ADSs). Each ADS represents one 
ordinary share and allows each holder, 
subject to the terms and conditions of the 
ADR, to receive dividend payments and 
vote by proxy on resolutions at a general 
meeting.
Shares acquired through Atkins’ employee 
share schemes rank equally with all 
other ordinary shares in issue and have 
no special rights. The trustees of the 
Company’s employee benefit trusts (EBTs) 
have waived the rights of the EBTs to 
receive dividends on shares they hold, 
with one EBT fully waiving this right and 
another waiving the right to dividends 
in excess of 0.01p per share. In addition 
neither of the trustees of the EBTs 
exercises its right to vote in respect of 
such shares. Shares held in trust on 
behalf of participants in the Atkins Share 
Incentive Plan are voted by the trustee, 
Capita IRG Trustees Limited, as directed 
by plan participants. Details of  
share-based payments, including 
information regarding the shares held 
by the EBTs, can be found in note 32 
to the Financial Statements (page 192).
At the AGM held in 2014, shareholders 
granted authority for the directors to allot 
relevant securities up to approximately 
one third of the issued share capital and 
a further one third in connection with 
an offer by way of a rights issue. The 
directors intend to seek shareholder 
approval for an equivalent authority 
at this year’s AGM, details of which are 
contained in the notice of meeting.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
might result in the restriction of transfer 
or voting rights in relation to the shares 
held by such shareholders. 70 Governance
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ report continued
Share purchases
At the AGM held in 2014, the Company 
was granted authority by shareholders 
to purchase up to 10,011,000 ordinary 
shares, representing approximately 10% 
of the Company’s ordinary share capital 
as at 11 June 2014. No ordinary shares 
were purchased pursuant to this authority 
during the year ended 31 March 2015 
or to the date of this Annual Report. This 
authority will expire at the forthcoming 
AGM and the Company will seek 
shareholder approval for an equivalent 
authority (such authority being in 
accordance with current best practice) 
at this year’s AGM.
4,341,000 ordinary shares of 0.5p each, 
representing approximately 4.2% of the 
Company’s issued share capital, were held 
in treasury throughout the year and to 
the date of this Annual Report following 
a historic share buyback programme.
Significant shareholders
As at the year end and the date of this 
Annual Report, the Company had been 
notified of holdings of 3% or more of the 
total voting rights attaching to its issued 
share capital as detailed in table 1.
Change of control
No agreement with a director or 
employee of the Company provides 
for compensation for loss of office 
or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) that occurs as a result of 
a change of control.
All of the Company’s employee share 
schemes contain provisions relating to 
a change of control of the Company. 
Under these provisions, a change of 
control would normally be a vesting 
event, facilitating the exercise of options 
or transfer of allocations subject to any 
relevant performance conditions being 
satisfied.
The Company is not a party to any other 
significant agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of 
control other than its funding facilities, 
which provide that in such a situation the 
Company may be unable to draw down 
any further amounts under the facilities 
and/or that they may be cancelled.

The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Remuneration 
report and the Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and

to prepare financial statements for

the directors have prepared the Group

directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company 
and Group for that period. Table 1: Holdings of 3% or more of the total voting rights attached to the

The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements and the

The directors are responsible for the

Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial

Each of the directors, whose names and

(pages 66 and 67), confirms that, to the 
best of his/her knowledge:
•	 the Group Financial Statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group
•	 the Directors’ report contained in the

a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
As required by the LRs, the Company’s 
independent auditor has considered 
the directors’ statement of compliance 
in relation to those points of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code which are 
specified for its review.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and therefore 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Financial Statements.
Disclosure of audit information
The directors confirm that, as at the 
date this Annual Report was approved, 
so far as each director is aware there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s independent auditor 
is unaware and that he or she has taken 
all the steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a director in order to make 
himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s independent auditor is aware 
of that information.
Independent auditor
The Company’s independent auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has 
expressed its willingness to continue

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Corporate governance report
Letter from the chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Board’s annual report on corporate 
governance. This review, and the reports of the Nomination, 
Audit and Remuneration Committees which follow, summarise 
our activities in this important area during the year. 
Governance practices
Effective corporate governance is integral to the successful 
delivery of our business goals. How we work is just as 
important as what we do. We believe Atkins has developed 
a governance framework which fosters transparency, together 
with an informed approach to risk management across our 
business. However, we recognise that there is always room for 
improvement. We therefore very much welcome developments 
from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and others that 
help us continue to improve and draw upon best practice 
from others.
This year, as every year, the Board has reviewed the 
Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) published by the FRC. As described in this 
report, we successfully complied with all provisions of the 
Code, except the provision in respect of the requirement 
to put the independent audit out to tender at least every 
10 years. The Company has, however, complied with the 
FRC’s suggested transitional arrangements regarding the 
timing of its audit tender and further details on its approach 
are provided in the Audit Committee report (page 88). 
Last year, a new edition of the Code was published (the 2014 
Code) which applies to reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 October 2014. The 2014 Code has therefore applied to the 
Company from 1 April 2015. During the year, the FRC also 
published new guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business Reporting. This guidance 
summarises the Board’s responsibilities in these areas, identifies 
factors that should be considered in order to exercise these 
responsibilities effectively and provides fresh insight into 
establishing, monitoring and reviewing risk management and 
internal control systems. The Board is reviewing this guidance, 
alongside the 2014 Code requirement to publish a viability 
statement, and will report on compliance against the 2014 
Code next year.
Board membership 
James Cullens joined the Company during the year, succeeding 
Alun Griffiths as our Group HR director. Following Rodney 
Slater’s retirement as a non-executive director in July 2014, 
Thomas Leppert joined our Remuneration Committee. 
I am pleased to take this opportunity to welcome Catherine 
Bradley to the Board. Catherine joined as a non-executive 
director on 9 June 2015 and brings significant corporate 
finance and acquisition experience obtained in the UK, Asia, 
the US and Europe.
Diversity
The Board recognises that gender imbalance among 
our employees remains an issue, as it does for many other 
organisations that work in the science, engineering, maths 
and technology sectors. Updates on the positive action that 
the Group is taking to create a more diverse profession 
can be found in the segmental performance sections of our 
Strategic Report (from page 25). 
Relationships with shareholders
We welcome the increasingly active engagement from you, 
our shareholders. The Board seeks to be clear and concise in 
its communications with you and, taken as a whole, to provide 
you with a fair, balanced and understandable view of the 
Group, its performance and prospects. I very much look 
forward to discussing the Group’s progress with you at our 
forthcoming AGM and responding to your questions.
Yours faithfully

Statement of compliance with the Code
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2015 the Company complied with all provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code), published by the FRC in 2012, except the provision in respect of the requirement to put the independent audit out to 
tender at least every 10 years. The Company has, however, complied with the FRC’s suggested transitional arrangements regarding 
the timing of its audit tender and further details on its approach are provided in the Audit Committee report (page 88). A copy of 
the Code is available on the FRC’s website: www.frc.org.uk. 
The disclosures that follow mirror the five sections of the Code: Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, Remuneration and Relations 
with Shareholders.
Full details of the Group’s governance framework are available on its website: 
www.atkinsglobal.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance.
Leadership
The Board is responsible for ensuring the long-term success of the Company. It does so by determining the Company’s long-term 
direction and strategic aims within a framework of appropriate and robust controls. A key principle of the framework is the 
delegation of operational management to the CEO, with a matrix of authorities setting out how this is further delegated through 
the businesses. This enables the efficient and effective day to day operation of the Group’s different businesses.
Further details on the roles of the chairman, CEO and senior independent director can be found on the Group’s website:  
www.atkinsglobal.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/leadership. The CEO has established two teams to enable him 
to discharge his responsibilities effectively: the senior leadership team (SLT) and the operational leadership team (OLT). The SLT 
has a wider strategic focus while the OLT concentrates on operational matters by providing a forum for the regional, Energy and 
Faithful+Gould CEOs to focus on performance, sharing best practice and knowledge.
The Board has reserved a number of matters for its sole consideration. These include:
•	consideration and approval of strategy
•	general oversight of the Group’s operations
•	approval of significant bids and contracts
•	the Group’s capital, corporate, management and control structures
•	approval of financial statements and shareholder communications
•	approval of dividend policy and interim dividends
•	approval of Group policies and the Code of Conduct
•	implementation and monitoring of internal control and risk management systems
•	approval of significant acquisitions and disposals
•	material changes to the Group’s pension schemes.
While the Board has specific responsibility for the matters reserved for its consideration, in certain areas specific responsibility is 
delegated to committees of the Board within defined terms of reference. The activities of these committees are discussed in more 
detail in the Nomination Committee report (pages 80 to 83), the Audit Committee report (pages 84 to 89) and the Remuneration 
report (pages 90 to 120). The committee terms of reference are available on the Group’s website or on request from the company 
secretary.
In addition the Board may delegate authority to a standing committee, consisting of any two directors, to provide final sign-off 
for an agreed course of action within predefined parameters.

The senior independent director led the appraisal of the chairman’s performance. She sought input from all directors before 
discussing her findings with the independent non-executive directors. She then provided feedback to the chairman. During the year, 
the independent non-executive directors also met regularly with the chairman.
Allan Cook’s external commitments changed during the year following his appointment as the lead non-executive director of the 
UK’s Department for Business, Innovation & Skills and Vice-President of the Royal Academy of Engineering. He also resigned from 
his position as chairman and director of Finmeccanica UK Limited and Selex ES Ltd. To enable him to carry out his responsibilities 
as chairman he continues to spend at least three days per week with the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Each director is required, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, to declare any interests that may give rise to a conflict of 
interest with the Company on appointment and subsequently as they arise. Where such a conflict, or potential conflict, arises the 
Board is empowered under the Company’s articles of association to consider and authorise such conflicts as appropriate. In addition, 
the Company undertakes an annual review of all authorised conflicts to ensure such authorisation remains appropriate, the last such 
review having taken place in March 2015.

Effectiveness
Nomination Committee
Details of the work of the Nomination Committee can be found in the Nomination Committee report (pages 80 to 83).
Performance evaluation
The Board recognises the need to ensure its continuing development and the development of individual directors to ensure that 
its effectiveness is maintained or improved and that it is able to respond to the needs of the Company and to evolving best practice. 
This involves an ongoing process of:
•	reflecting on past performance and the implementation of past actions
•	consideration of future training, skill and diversity requirements
•	identification and implementation of new actions to improve performance.
The Board recognises that, as the needs of the Company change and best practice evolves, particular areas require its regular 
attention to ensure that effectiveness is maintained.
The Board undertakes a rigorous and formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and directors annually. 
The Board believes that an external evaluation every three years brings new insight into its processes and performance. An external 
evaluation took place in 2012/13 and the next such evaluation will take place in 2015/16.
The 2014/15 evaluation was conducted internally. The chairman conducted one to one sessions with each member of the Board 
and the company secretary. The following areas of its role and performance were explored in depth during the evaluation process:
•	Board role and remit, including meeting frequency and focus
•	 diversity of skills, experience, independence and knowledge on the Board, including consideration of diversity of gender, 
nationality and ethnicity
•	succession planning
•	input and performance of individual directors 
•	the support provided by the company secretary
•	any other factors relevant to the Board’s effectiveness, such as management of meetings.
The Board received a written report from the chairman, which identified progress made from previous years and areas for further 
improvement. This was debated and discussed in detail and a clear action plan for the year ahead was then developed and approved.
The actions identified in the 2014/15 review focus on:
•	information flows to the Board between meetings
•	the continuous development of the business awareness of the non-executive directors
•	opportunities for the Board to meet high performers within the business
•	ensuring the roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee and the Board remain appropriate and consistent with best practice. 
The key findings of the 2014/15 performance review will be implemented in the current financial year and progress will be considered 
as part of the planned externally facilitated performance evaluation in 2015/16.
Commitment
During the year all directors, including the independent non-executive directors, committed significant time to the Company, in line 
with the requirements stated in their letters of appointment and service contracts. Governance 77

Development, business awareness and induction
The chairman regularly reviews training requirements with each director in order to maximise the contribution of the directors. 
The company secretary ensures suitable opportunities are identified and communicated to directors. During the year, the directors 
have undertaken training on matters including compliance with the Financial Conduct Authority’s Model Code, audit tendering 
and corporate governance.
The Board also receives regular updates from the company secretary on legal, regulatory and governance developments, which 
highlight any impact they may have on the Board and/or the Group.
On joining the Board, directors take part in a formal induction process. This includes the provision of past Board materials to provide 
background information on the Group, information on Board processes and governance, site visits and meetings with key employees. 
The induction is tailored to each new director’s specific needs. James Cullens participated in a comprehensive induction programme 
following his appointment to the Company on 1 July 2014. The planned induction programme for Catherine Bradley is already well 
advanced and will be reported on in full in the 2016 Annual Report.
Accountability
Financial reporting
Statements regarding directors’ responsibilities and the status of the business as a going concern are given in the Directors’ report 
(pages 68 and 71).
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the Group’s governance framework and ensuring its adequacy and 
effectiveness, as set out in the FRC’s 2005 Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code. The changes 
in this area following publication by the FRC in September 2014 of its Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting have been noted by the Board and its committees. A review will be undertaken in the forthcoming 
year to consider possible enhancements to the Group’s governance framework. 
Our code of conduct, ‘Behaving the Atkins way’ (the Code of Conduct), was launched to all employees in October 2014. It sets out 
the standards and behaviours that all employees should consider when making decisions or taking actions. The Code of Conduct 
forms part of our corporate governance framework and is an important element of our corporate compliance programme. 
The Group’s governance framework is illustrated in figure 1.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Corporate governance report continued
Our governance framework reflects the devolved and decentralised structure of the Group, which is considered a key part of our 
ability to deliver services to our clients. Under this structure the Board has delegated operational responsibility to the CEO, who 
then delegates authority and control to the regional, Energy and Faithful+Gould CEOs (who are all members of the SLT and OLT). 
Authority is further delegated from them to the managing directors of the principal operations and then downward to business 
and project managers as appropriate. This approach is reflected in our governance framework as follows:
•	 the policy statements approved by the Board, available on our website:  
www.atkinsglobal.com/corporate-responsibility/policy-and-governance, set out clearly and succinctly our vision, commitment 
and arrangements, including: business conduct, risk management, employment, excellence in delivery, health, safety and security, 
sustainability and stakeholder communication
•	 Group controls set out mandatory activities and standards that are part of the overall Group processes and apply across the Group
•	 our Code of Conduct sets behavioural expectations for everyone who works for and represents Atkins, the purpose being to 
reinforce the controls and underpin the ethics and values that apply across the Group, thereby protecting the reputation of our 
business and maintaining our professional standing and brand
•	 a Group BMS framework incorporates all Group controls and forms the basis of each segment’s BMS, each of which adds the 
regional and industry-specific controls it requires to deliver our four key business processes of: win work, deliver work, people and 
business operations, providing a single source of information for employees that enables them to understand their responsibilities 
and comply with all Atkins’ requirements.
The following principles are key to the successful operation of the framework:
•	authority is delegated within clearly prescribed limits (under the Group’s authority matrix)
•	decisions are escalated where either project size or risk profile require a higher level of authority
•	activity and performance are tracked through monthly and quarterly reports
•	effectiveness is audited via internal audit and self-assessment reviews.
Our governance framework is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve stated business objectives. 
It can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Joint ventures and other investments in which the Company does not have overall control are not covered by the Group’s governance 
framework. For these joint ventures and other investments, systems of internal control are applied as agreed between the joint 
venture parties or by management but as far as possible we seek compliance with our governance requirements as a minimum.
The Board monitored and reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s governance framework, including internal controls 
and risk management, on a continuous basis throughout the year ended 31 March 2015 and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report. Support was provided by the Group Risk Committee, the internal audit function and the Company’s independent auditor.
Audit Committee
Details of the work of the Audit Committee can be found in the Audit Committee report (pages 84 to 89).
Remuneration
Details of the directors’ remuneration and the work of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the Remuneration report  
(pages 90 to 120).
Relations with shareholders
Engagement with our shareholders is a fundamental part of the Group’s corporate governance model. To this end we seek to 
establish an early and effective dialogue with shareholders regarding significant changes that affect corporate governance, in addition 
to ongoing engagement on more routine matters. Communication regarding the delivery of our strategy is integral to this ongoing 
dialogue.
The primary means used by the Board for communicating with all Company shareholders are the Annual Report, preliminary 
statement of annual results, half year results and the AGM. We also recognise the importance of the internet as a means of 
communicating widely, quickly and cost-effectively. An investor relations section is provided on our website:  
www.atkinsglobal.com/investors to facilitate communications with institutional and private investors. This includes material shared 
with fund managers and analysts at Company meetings. Governance 79 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Investor Information
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Corporate governance report continued
Our shareholders play an important role in the Group’s governance and their increasingly active engagement is welcomed. The 
investor relations director, alongside the CEO, Group finance director and chairman, provides a focal point for communication with 
investors and is always keen to engage with, educate and inform potential new investors. Our approach to investor relations enables 
us to be proactive in our engagement with both shareholders and non-shareholders.
The CEO and Group finance director present the preliminary statement of annual results and half year results to institutional 
investors and analysts. These presentations are also available via webcast and teleconference. Analyst breakfast events are hosted 
regularly which include presentations from senior leaders within our business. In the year ended 31 March 2015 our Energy and 
North American businesses were the focus of our analyst breakfasts. The CEO, Group finance director and investor relations director 
also regularly attend conferences and roadshows to give shareholders, and other potential investors, access to management.
The non-executive directors receive updates on the views of shareholders from the executive directors, following investor meetings. 
The Group’s broker also provides updates to the Board on shareholder opinions and compiles independent feedback from investor 
meetings twice a year. The company secretary brings to the attention of the Board any material matters of concern raised by the 
Company’s shareholders, including private investors.
Shareholders have the opportunity to attend our AGM, where all directors are expected to be available to answer questions. They are 
also able to submit questions in writing at any time. All of the directors in appointment at the time attended our AGM in July 2014 
and were available to speak to shareholders.
We intend to call a poll for all resolutions to be considered at the 2015 AGM. This ensures the Company continues to follow best 
practice and allows all shareholders, present in person or by proxy, to vote on all resolutions in proportion to their shareholding. 
Details of the 2015 AGM are set out in the separate notice of meeting.

Dear Shareholder
The Nomination Committee had another busy year.
Diversity
As I describe in my foreword to this Annual Report, our 
commitment to building a diverse organisation continues 
to gain momentum. It is pleasing that 22% of our Board is 
female following the appointment of Catherine Bradley; we 
have made solid progress towards our one third aspiration and 
Lord Davies’ 25% target. However, we need to do more work 
in the wider Group where we missed our short-term target of 
15% female representation at senior levels by 31 March 2015, 
as discussed in the People section (pages 58 and 59). 
Succession planning 
Board succession planning continues to be an important 
responsibility of the Committee as we seek to ensure it remains 
strong and effective. When recruiting new members to the 
Board, we consider the balance of skills, experience and 
diversity of both existing members and potential candidates, 
as well as the value that they will add. We seek to balance 
not only expertise and backgrounds but also thinking styles. 
Following a rigorous and transparent recruitment process, 
James Cullens joined the Board as an executive director on 
1 July 2014 and succeeded Alun Griffiths as Group HR director 
on 30 July 2014. We appointed Catherine Bradley as a 
non-executive director on 9 June 2015 following the same 
recruitment process.
We will continue to ensure a robust approach is taken to 
succession planning for the Board and senior management 
in the year ahead.

Board composition
The Committee regularly reviews the Board’s composition to ensure that directors have the necessary skills and experience to facilitate 
the Group’s continued development and remain well placed to continue to provide effective leadership. 
Board and employee diversity
The Board attaches significant importance to diversity both within its own membership and within the Group. The background of our 
directors reflects the increasing internationalisation of the Group, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to diversity of perspective, 
experience, thought, gender, ethnicity and nationality. 
We believe that creating an inclusive and diverse culture supports the attraction and retention of talented people and supports 
effective performance. We reaffirm our aspiration to meet and exceed the target of 25% of Board positions being held by women 
by 2015, as set out by Lord Davies. As previously stated, the Board aspires to a membership of at least one third women by 2015,

Succession planning
A comprehensive review of the succession plan for the executive directors and for members of the Group’s senior leadership 
team took place during the year. This review looked at the senior management teams and the Group functional senior employees 
and included the identification of emergency cover and short- and long-term succession options for all key roles. The review 
also considered diversity and gender balance as well as informing any related training and development needs at a Group and 
individual level.
The Committee concluded that good progress had been made on the development of the Group’s succession plan to date but 
recognised the need for management to continue to identify talent deeper within the Group. This will be an area of continued focus 
over the coming year.
A matrix of skills and experience required for each role is being developed and the skills and experience of identified potential 
internal successors is being mapped against this matrix to identify potential gaps where development is required.
Fiona Clutterbuck and Raj Rajagopal will have served as non-executive directors for nine years in 2016 and 2017 respectively. 
During the year, in anticipation of their future retirement, the Committee developed and progressed a plan to ensure that the 
skills and experience which they bring to the Board are maintained following their retirement from the Board. Governance 83

Appointment process
James Cullens was appointed to the Board as an executive director on 1 July 2014 and succeeded Alun Griffiths as Group HR director 
at the end of July. Catherine Bradley was appointed to the Board as a non-executive director on 9 June 2015.
At the beginning of each appointment process, the Nomination Committee considered in detail which areas of expertise the Board, 
and in turn the Group, would most benefit from and drew up detailed role specifications accordingly. Candidates were assessed 
against the role specification as well as undergoing a comprehensive interview process. Gender diversity was an important part 
of the appointment process. We mandated that balanced shortlists be presented for both appointments.
The executive search firm Korn Ferry supported the Board on the appointments of James Cullens and Catherine Bradley. It has 
signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms launched in July 2011 and, subsequently, the enhanced 
version launched in July 2014 which promotes gender diversity and best practice for corporate board search processes.
During the year Korn Ferry also provided career development and management assessment services to the Group.

Audit Committee report
Letter from the Audit Committee chairman
Dear Shareholder
This was my first full year as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Our last financial year has, once again, seen more regulatory 
changes that have continued to increase the responsibilities of 
the Committee. I am pleased to present the Audit Committee 
Report for the year ended 31 March 2015, which sets out 
our response to those responsibilities.
Responsibilities
Each year the Committee works to a planned programme 
of activities focused on key events in the annual financial 
reporting cycle and other matters that are considered in 
accordance with its terms of reference. We provide oversight 
and guidance to contribute to the ongoing good governance 
of the business, particularly by providing assurance that 
shareholders’ interests are being properly protected by 
appropriate financial management, reporting and internal 
controls.
During the year, we continued to focus our activities on the 
integrity and quality of the Group’s financial reporting, the 
performance of internal and independent audit processes 
and the suitability of the Group’s internal governance, risk 
management system and controls.
Internal auditor
The Committee aims to ensure its activities support the future 
development of the Group. In particular, my colleagues and 
I ensure that Ernst & Young (EY), the Group’s internal auditor, 
develops an internal audit plan that focuses on areas of 
particular potential risk, as well as those areas of most 
importance to the delivery of the Group’s strategy and future 
performance.
Independent auditor
Last year we reported to you in some depth on the proposed 
reforms to the audit sector by the European Union (EU) and 
the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). We also 
highlighted the need for clarity regarding how these proposals 
would interact with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) published by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) in September 2012 for audits to be 
put out to tender every 10 years.
The CMA has since issued its final order dealing with audit 
firm tendering requirements for FTSE 350 companies and the 
EU has approved a directive and regulation setting out new 
EU wide audit legislation. Work is now underway on the 
UK implementation of the EU legislation, and both the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the 
FRC are consulting on implementation decisions. Concurrently, 
the FRC is undertaking a wider review of its Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
We continue to believe our long-term audit tender policy 
should be based on a holistic view of the final outcome of all 
these developments. In particular, restrictions/prohibitions on 
the provision of non-audit services by the independent auditor 
will inevitably have an impact on our audit tendering decisions 
and this is discussed in more detail later in this report.
During the year our current audit partner advised us of his 
intended retirement in June 2015, a year ahead of his planned 
rotation. We therefore considered the transition arrangements 
proposed by the FRC, which suggest that a tender for 
independent audit services could be carried out at the time of 
an audit partner rotation. Given the continuing need for clarity 
regarding the criteria for determining the independence of the 
auditor under the EU directive and regulation, the Committee 
considered carefully whether or not it was appropriate to put 
the independent audit out to tender during the year. It initially 
concluded that it was prudent to wait to tender the 
independent audit service so as to ensure the appointed firm 
would meet all relevant independence criteria. However, as 
these criteria are not expected to be finalised until later in the 
financial year ending 31 March 2016, we intend to conduct 
a tender during the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
Consequently, the Committee considered the effectiveness 
and performance of the incumbent independent auditor 
and agreed to accept a new audit partner with a view to 
tendering the appointment during the financial year ending 
31 March 2016. The Committee has therefore recommended 
the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) 
as independent auditor.
Yours faithfully

Annual financial reporting
Significant issues
We have reviewed the key judgements applied to a number of significant issues in the preparation of the Financial Statements. 
Our review included consideration of the following:
Significant issue How the Committee addressed this
Contract accounting/
revenue recognition
•	 The Group enters into a number of large and complex long-term contracts which can span 
a number of reporting periods. Significant judgements are required to forecast how each contract 
will perform over its lifetime. These judgements may include, for example, the level of revenue 
and profit recognition based on management’s estimates of the extent to which the Group has 
fulfilled its obligations under the contract and the level of costs that will be incurred to complete 
them. There can be particular uncertainties in determining the amounts to be recovered as 
a result of contractual variations due to, for example, changing client specifications or unforeseen 
circumstances. We received regular reports from management on a number of higher risk contracts 
and challenged estimates of completion costs, with consequential impacts on revenue recognition, 
including the timing of revenue recognition within different reporting periods. We concluded that 
the approach to revenue recognition is appropriate in the context of the Group’s business model 
and contract structures.
Goodwill impairment •	 The Group has significant goodwill relating to The Atkins North America Holdings Corporation 
(formerly known as The PBSJ Corporation) and its subsidiaries (the ANA business) following the 
acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation in 2010. A goodwill impairment calculation was undertaken 
as at 30 September 2014 using similar assumptions in relation to future cash flows as were used 
at 31 March 2014. This led us to determine that there were no triggering events requiring an 
impairment of this goodwill. At 31 March 2015 we examined the detailed full impairment review 
undertaken by management, which included testing of assumptions and sensitivity analysis. 
We also received and considered the independent auditor’s comments on the key assumptions 
used and the sensitivity analysis performed. The issue of impairment involves making significant 
judgements about the future results of the ANA business and the market in which it operates. 
We agreed with management’s recommendation that no impairment charge should be made 
but that, given its quantum, there remains a risk of impairment of goodwill in the ANA business 
in the future and appropriate disclosures have therefore been included in the Annual Report 
(note 14 to the Financial Statements, page 163).
•	 The Group also had goodwill relating to its European aerospace business following the acquisition 
of Nedtech Engineering B.V. in 2007. A goodwill impairment calculation was undertaken as at 
30 September 2014 in relation to this acquisition based on an initial revised forecast developed 
in response to a change in market conditions. This led us to determine that a partial impairment 
of £2.8m of the acquired goodwill of £5.6m was required. At 31 March 2015 we examined the 
detailed full impairment review undertaken by management. We agreed with management’s 
recommendation that no additional impairment should be made at 31 March 2015 and appropriate 
disclosures have therefore been included in the Annual Report (note 14 to the Financial Statements, 
page 162).
Pension liabilities •	 The Group has significant post-retirement liabilities via the Atkins Pension Plan and the Railways 
Pension Scheme (RPS). The valuation of plan liabilities requires significant levels of judgement and 
technical expertise to ensure the assumptions applied are appropriate, as relatively small changes 
can have a material impact on the size of the liabilities. The assumptions applied by the Group 
to the Atkins Pension Plan and the RPS were reviewed as at 31 March 2015 in light of prevailing 
conditions. We agreed with the assumptions applied by management and with the valuation of 
the Group’s pension liabilities. Governance 87 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Investor Information
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Audit Committee report continued
Significant issue How the Committee addressed this
Taxation •	 The completeness and valuation of provisions to cover the range of potential final determinations 
by the tax authorities of the Group’s tax positions are the subject of judgement. In particular, 
judgement is required in relation to deferred tax assets, current tax deductions and ongoing tax 
audits. The provisions held by the Group were reviewed by management as at 31 March 2015. 
We agreed with management’s assessment of the Group’s tax provisions.
Professional indemnity 
provisions
•	 The Group manages a significant proportion of its professional indemnity claims through its 
insurance captive in Guernsey. The most significant claims relate to perceived deficiencies in work 
performed by the Group. The size of the provision held against any particular claim is determined 
by management, based on its knowledge of the specifics of the claim, and therefore is inherently 
judgemental and may change over time as new information comes to light. We agreed with 
management’s recommendations regarding the level of claims’ revenues carried by the Group.
We also considered a number of other judgements made by management, including judgements concerning accounting for 
acquisitions and disposals, application of accounting standards and the useful economic life of intangible assets.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The content and disclosures made in the Annual Report are subject to a verification exercise by management to ensure that no 
statement is misleading in the form and context in which it is included, no material facts are omitted which may make any statement 
of fact or opinion misleading, and implications which might be reasonably drawn from the statement are true.
The Audit Committee examined the Annual Report and was asked by the Board to advise it on whether it was fair, balanced and 
understandable. To enable us to draw our conclusions in this respect, we:
•	 examined the preparation and review process for the Annual Report and considered the level of challenge provided through 
that process
•	assessed whether, from our own review of the Annual Report, we concurred with the results of that process
•	considered the accounting policies applied by the Group
•	 assessed the information contained in the Annual Report against the Group’s strategy and business model to ensure the 
information provided was sufficient to enable shareholders to assess the Group’s performance.
Following our review, we advised the Board that the Annual Report of the Company for the financial year ended 31 March 2015 
is fair, balanced and understandable and gives shareholders the information necessary for them to understand and assess the 
Group’s performance, strategy and business model.
Independent auditor
The independent auditor is currently PwC, which has acted in this capacity since the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange 
in 1996. During the year, we conducted a review of the performance of and relationship with the independent auditor, as well as its 
qualification, expertise and resources and the effectiveness and quality of the audit.
As part of our review, we issued a questionnaire which was circulated to the members of the Committee and senior management 
after the publication of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2014. Recipients were asked to answer questions which 
focused on the robustness of the audit, audit planning, willingness to challenge management, the quality of delivery of audit services 
and the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the independent auditor. Responses received were collated ahead of, and 
fed into, our consideration of the audit strategy and approach for the financial year ended 31 March 2015.
There were no significant findings arising from the review and we concluded that, overall, both PwC and its audit process continued 
to be effective. Areas where the Committee believed that the independent audit process might be improved, which focused on the 
added value PwC’s insight could bring and its coordination of its international teams, were discussed and agreed with PwC and are 
being addressed.
The independence of the independent auditor is evidenced in part through its challenge to management. The rotation of the audit 
partner on a regular basis also contributes to the independence and objectivity of the audit process, the last such rotation having 
taken place in 2012. During the year, the Group’s audit partner advised us of his intended retirement from PwC in June 2015, a year 
before his five year tenure would have ended, and hence a new audit partner at PwC was identified. The transition to the new audit 
partner has already begun and is going smoothly. 88 Governance
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Audit Committee report continued
Audit tender policy
As reported last year and noted above, in September 2012 the FRC amended the Code to include, among other changes, a 
requirement for FTSE 350 companies to put the independent audit contract out to tender at least once every 10 years. The FRC 
recognised that the audit market could be disrupted if a large number of companies chose to go out to tender in the first year in 
which the revised Code applied and hence proposed transitional arrangements that brought tenders in line with the cycle for rotating 
the audit partner. Under these transitional arrangements, the retirement of our audit partner, a year ahead of his planned rotation, 
could have been considered to trigger a tender of the Group’s independent audit contract.
Following the approval by the EU of the directive and regulation setting out new EU wide audit legislation and the issue of the 
final order from the CMA dealing with audit firm tendering requirements for FTSE 350 companies, work is now underway on the 
implementation of these changes. Concurrently, the FRC is undertaking a wider review of its Ethical Standards for Auditors. As 
a result, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the restrictions/prohibitions on the provision of non-audit services by the independent 
auditor poses a particular challenge for us. Specifically it is anticipated that:
•	 as our appointed internal auditor, EY will be prevented from participating in any tender for the independent audit contract unless 
the internal audit contract is also put out to tender
•	 the current provision of tax compliance services by PwC (as noted in our discussion of auditor independence below) will prevent 
it from participating in any tender for the independent audit contract unless the provision of tax compliance services is also put 
out to tender
•	 the multidisciplinary nature of many of the projects we undertake, often working in consortia, partnerships or similar arrangements 
with other professional service firms, may prevent other audit firms from participating in any tender for the independent audit 
contract, unless they are able to exit from such arrangements in the required time limits to ensure their independence.
We recognise that, in considering participants in any tender for the independent audit contract, we will therefore need to have 
particular regard to the following points:
•	 the impact of the appointment of any firm on our existing and future multidisciplinary projects to ensure that our business is not 
inadvertently damaged, as we would be unable to work in consortia, partnerships or similar arrangements with the appointed firm
•	 the need to tender the contracts for the provision of any other services, balancing this against the impact of a large number of 
service provider changes on the Group
•	the ability of any appointed firm to provide services across our complex, international business
•	the views of our shareholders.
We therefore initially concluded that, until the outcome of the BIS and FRC consultations was known, it would not be possible to 
run a tender process for our independent audit contract. However, as this outcome is not expected to be finalised until later in the 
financial year ending 31 March 2016 at the earliest, we intend to conduct a tender during the early part of the calendar year 2016. 
Under this timetable we expect that we can comply with the independence criteria in advance of any appointment taking effect, 
which is likely to be for the financial year ending 31 March 2018. We intend to consult with our major shareholders in due course 
regarding the tender process.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice of independent auditor.
Auditor independence
We understand that certain work of a non-audit nature may be best undertaken by the independent auditor as a result of its unique 
position and knowledge of key areas of the Company. Approval is required prior to the independent auditor commencing non-audit 
work in accordance with a Group standard, summarised in table 2. This standard is drafted to preserve the independence and 
objectivity of the independent auditor and is reviewed and approved annually by the Committee. We also regularly consider the 
impact on independence, if any, of non-audit work performed by the independent auditor. The standard sets out the safeguards 
to be considered when engaging the independent auditor for non-audit services. The appointment of former employees of the 
independent auditor to positions in the Group is also regulated by the Committee. The standard will be reviewed once the FRC has 
published the outcome of its review of its Ethical Standards for Auditors. Governance 89

associated with, that work will be regularly reported  
to the Committee).
The independent auditor’s audit partner also has to 
approve any such engagement before it can proceed.
Following a supplier review, if management 
does identify the independent auditor as 
being the best supplier in a specific field 
and also believes that such an assignment 
does not run the risk of prejudicing its 
independence, then an evaluated request 
will be made to the Committee to confirm 
the appointment.
Appointments for non-material fee levels 
may be approved by the Group finance 
director (or company secretary in his 
absence).
The independent auditor’s audit partner 
also has to approve any such engagement 
before it can proceed.
n/a
Note 4 to the Financial Statements (page 150) sets out the fees paid to the independent auditor for audit (£1.40m) and non-audit 
work (£2.20m). Approximately 52% (£1.14m) of the non-audit fees incurred related to services provided in connection with an 
unsuccessful acquisition pursuit (included in Other in note 4) and approximately 44% (£0.96m) to taxation compliance services 
(identified separately in note 4). In relation to the services provided in connection with our unsuccessful acquisition pursuit, certain 
of the services were required to be performed by an independent accountant and it was considered efficient to appoint a single 
advisor to provide these and the associated accountancy services. PwC was appointed given it was our incumbent independent 
auditor. It was considered appropriate to engage PwC’s services in regards to the taxation compliance services in light of its detailed 
understanding of the Group and specialist expertise in these areas.
The level of non-audit fees paid to PwC represented a value of approximately 157% of the audit and audit-related fees for the 
Group. Excluding those fees relating to our unsuccessful acquisition pursuit, the non-audit fees paid to PwC represented a value 
of approximately 76% (£1.06m) of the audit and audit-related fees for the Group, of which approximately 90% related to the 
provision of taxation compliance services. We concluded that the non-audit services provided by PwC did not have any impact 
on its independence.

Remuneration report
Letter from the Remuneration Committee chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present this year’s remuneration report 
following another set of good results. The report sets out 
details of what has been paid to directors during the year 
ended 31 March 2015. The report also includes a summary 
of the implementation of the Company’s remuneration policy 
for the financial year which has recently commenced. 
The Company’s remuneration policy was approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 annual general meeting (AGM) 
held on 30 July 2014. No changes have been made to the 
remuneration framework and policy this year. A full copy 
of the Company’s remuneration policy, as approved by 
shareholders, is available on the Company’s investor relations 
website: www.atkinsglobal.com/investors_remuneration. 
However, to assist shareholders, a copy of the policy table 
has been appended to this report, together with other relevant 
policies which have been applied by the Committee during 
the year. We have added to the policy table additional columns 
which provide a high level summary of the implementation of 
each element of remuneration in both the financial year ended 
31 March 2015 and the financial year ending 31 March 2016. 
I very much hope that you find this approach useful.
Overview of our remuneration framework
The primary aim of the Committee is to align our remuneration 
framework with business strategy, calibrated to pay for 
performance while ensuring that the Company pays no 
more than is necessary.
In particular, our policy seeks to:
•	 link the remuneration received by the executive directors 
with the value created for shareholders
•	 reward for the successful delivery of our business strategy
•	 provide the right balance between short- and long-term 
incentives
•	 align senior management remuneration with that of the 
executive directors
•	 recognise that we operate a people business, where 
reward and incentive structures are critical to our success.
Our policy is directly aligned with the delivery of our strategy 
as evidenced by the performance delivered. The following 
key themes provide the basis for our remuneration framework:
•	 as a people business, our policy must enable us to attract, 
retain and incentivise the best global talent
•	 our policy must be based on simple principles, aligned with 
our key performance indicators (page 24), and provide clear 
line of sight for participants and alignment with 
shareholders’ interests
•	 a significant portion of executive directors’ remuneration 
should be performance related (on both a short- and 
long-term basis) and delivered in the form of Atkins shares
•	 growth in earnings per share (EPS) is a key metric for 
measuring the overall performance of our business and 
should be balanced with a focus on long-term share price 
growth and delivery of our strategy.
Paying for performance 
The Company delivered good results against a background 
of significant challenges in the broader macroeconomic 
environment. As reported by Allan Cook in his annual 
statement, we have made further progress on the delivery 
of our strategy with our portfolio optimisation now largely 
complete and margin progression towards our 8% goal 
continuing. 
Management delivered solid growth in profitability, with profit 
for the year above the budgeted and slightly below the stretch 
target levels. 
The Group’s excellent cash performance exceeded the stretch 
target for cash conversion, resulting in the maximum level 
payout for this element of bonus.
The Committee also considered the performance of each of 
the executive directors against their key strategic objectives 
for the year, full details of which are contained in the annual 
report on remuneration (page 96).
As a result, bonus payments to the current executive directors 
were between 95.3% and 96.5% of their maximum bonus 
opportunity. This reflects the level of performance delivered 
by the Company. 
Three year underlying diluted EPS growth over the period 
to 31 March 2015 was 30.6%. As a result, 70% of the 
WS Atkins plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards granted 
in 2012 will vest.  Governance 91

Letter from the Remuneration Committee chairman
Shareholder dialogue
The Company put both its annual remuneration report and 
directors’ remuneration policy to a shareholder vote at the 
2014 AGM. The advisory vote in respect of the Company’s 
annual remuneration report received votes in favour from 91% 
(2013: 85%) of shareholders. In addition, 89.5% of votes cast 
were in favour of the Company’s first binding vote in respect 
of our directors’ remuneration policy. This policy took effect 
from the 2014 AGM and applies for three years from that 
date unless amendments are required which require a further 
shareholder vote.
As I reported in my last letter to shareholders, the Committee 
has undertaken extensive dialogue with the Company’s major 
shareholders and the proxy voting agencies to explain its 
remuneration policy and, in particular, to address concerns 
raised by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) regarding the 
WS Atkins plc Long-term Growth Unit Plan (LGU). In response 
we have sought to explore ISS’s concerns regarding the LGU 
and, following our discussions, we increased our disclosure 
surrounding the LGU in last year’s report; in particular, to 
address more explicitly the strategic measures which will be 
considered by the Committee prior to vesting. As the LGU 
cycles mature, we will give a full explanation of the 
Committee’s decisions on the extent to which the awards 
have vested based on the performance achieved. 
The Committee and Board were pleased to see the resulting 
increase in support for the remuneration report in 2014 
from the previous year. 
Malus and clawback
The Company has been able to withhold payment of 
performance related remuneration since 2012. These malus 
provisions have applied to the deferred element of the annual 
bonus, the LTIP and the LGU. Following changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Committee has concluded 
that it is appropriate to introduce additional clawback 
provisions to each of these elements of performance related 
remuneration to enable the Company to recover sums paid 
for the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
Review of policy
The Company’s current remuneration policy was adopted in 
2012 following a comprehensive review in 2011. This review 
coincided with the appointment of Uwe Krueger as CEO. 
We believe that, to date, our remuneration framework has 
created a clear link between the performance of the Group, 
the creation of shareholder value and the remuneration of our 
executive directors. The Committee wishes to ensure that this 
clear link is retained as the Group continues to develop and 
has concluded that it is now appropriate to look again at the 
Company’s remuneration policy and, in particular, ensure that 
the Company’s long-term incentives remain appropriate. 
The Committee therefore intends to review the Company’s 
long-term incentive plans this year. Once the Committee has 
developed its initial thinking, we will consult the Company’s 
major shareholders prior to presenting a new policy to 
shareholders for approval at the 2016 AGM.
We look forward to receiving your continued support at the 
AGM on 29 July 2015.
Yours faithfully

1. James Cullens was appointed on 1 July 2014. This remuneration relates to the period for which he held office.
2. Alun Griffiths retired on 30 July 2014. This remuneration relates to the period for which he held office.
3.  Taxable benefits principally comprise medical insurance/healthcare allowance, company car or car allowance and, in respect of Uwe Krueger, an expense allowance 
of £15,000 per annum.
4. Cash value of defined contribution or cash equivalent.
5. Value of total bonus (two thirds cash and one third shares). Further detail on bonus payments is provided in table 6.
6.  LTIP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options. These figures relate to awards granted in 2012. The EPS performance condition attached to these awards 
has been met in part. The awards will vest on, and are capable of being exercised from, 13 August 2015. The disclosed values are based on the average mid-market 
quotation of the Company’s shares for the three months ended 31 March 2015 and include the value of dividend equivalents which will be payable on the vesting 
date. The value of dividend equivalents includes a payment in respect of the 2015 final dividend which is subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s AGM to 
be held on 29 July 2015. The final value of the 2012 LTIP award will be on the basis of the Company’s share price at vesting. In accordance with the Regulations, the 
disclosed value in respect of Alun Griffiths’ 2012 LTIP award will be reported in the payment to past executive directors section in next year’s annual remuneration 
report. 
7.  This relates to LTIP awards granted in 2011 which partially vested on 20 June 2014. The disclosed values reported in last year’s annual remuneration report were, in 
accordance with the Regulations, based on the average mid-market quotation of the Company’s shares for the three months ended 31 March 2014. These figures, 
as required by the Regulations, have been updated to reflect the final value of the 2011 LTIP awards based on the Company’s share price at vesting. The disclosed  
value includes the value of dividend equivalents payable. In last year’s annual remuneration report, the value of dividend equivalents payable at vesting was recorded. 
This has been updated to include any additional dividend equivalent payments to which the executive director became entitled during the period between vesting 
and the date on which the award was exercised.
8.  Other payments generally relate to dividend equivalent payments made following the exercise of a share award during the year which had been granted in connection 
with a deferral of annual bonus under the terms of the Atkins Deferred Share Plan (DSP). In respect of Uwe Krueger, it also includes an aggregate allowance of 
£39,000 for travel expenses incurred between his home and the UK during the first five years following his appointment (a direct replacement for the rental allowance 
disclosed in 2011).
Implementation of remuneration policy: executive directors
Salary
The percentage increases in salary for each executive director with effect from both 1 April 2014 and 1 April 2015 are set out 
in table 2 in accordance with the Company’s approved remuneration policy (table 27). Each percentage increase was below the 
average salary increase for all employees across the Group in the same year (2015: 3.26%, 2014: 3.96%). 
As disclosed in the 2014 remuneration report, James Cullens was appointed as an executive director on 1 July 2014 on an annual 
salary of £270,000.

receive higher cash allowances reflecting their roles as executive directors.
Alun Griffiths retained an entitlement to a defined benefit pension on the same basis as other long serving UK employees. 
During 2011, a consultation was held with staff with a defined benefit pension entitlement to remove the link to final salary via 
an amendment to their contracts of employment. From 1 February 2012 this final salary link was removed and transitional relief 
is being paid to all employees (including Alun Griffiths) affected by the contractual change. The transitional relief for Alun Griffiths, 
which is in addition to the maximum Company contribution of 10% of salary, remained at 2% of salary until the date of his 
retirement.

Annual bonus: 2014/15 performance against targets (audited)

For bonus purposes, the Committee believes that underlying profit after tax is a more representative measure of 
performance, removing certain items from the reported profit after tax of £85.7m (2014: £96.3m) that may give a 
distorted view of performance. Underlying profit after tax is determined by applying the Group’s underlying effective 
tax rate of 20.1% (2014: 19.0%) to its underlying profit before tax of £121.9m (2014: £106.4m). The following items 
have been removed from the Group’s reported profit before tax to determine underlying profit before tax: 
•	net profits on, and costs associated with, disposals of £0.4m (2014: £10.5m)
•	amortisation of acquired intangible assets of £6.9m (2014: £2.7m)
•	exceptional transaction costs of £4.4m (2014: £nil)
•	impairment of goodwill £2.8m (2014: £nil)
•	deferred acquisition payments on the HOE acquisition of £1.5m (2014: £nil).
The Group’s underlying profit after tax also includes the benefit of £1.1m of research and development expenditure credit 
(RDEC) following early adoption of new rules in the UK. To ensure a consistent treatment with the basis of the budget and 
the stretch targets, the Committee removed the positive impact of RDEC when calculating the underlying profit after tax 
position for bonus purposes. Consequently, the adjusted result of £96.3m (2014: £86.2m) was slightly below the stretch 
target resulting in a payout of 98% (2014: 100%) for this element of annual bonus. In previous years the equivalent 
benefit from research and development expenditure was shown as a reduction in the effective tax rate.

The Group’s cash performance was strong. Operating cash flow was £133.9m (2014: £95.5m) with half year and full year 
cash conversion results of 34.5% and 102.3% respectively.
This resulted in both the half year and full year stretch conversion targets (12.5% and 71.3% respectively) being exceeded, 
leading to the maximum 100% payment (2014: 100%) for this element of the bonus.

2.  Alun Griffiths retired from the Company on 30 July 2014. As a consequence of his retirement following 28 years of service to the Group, his annual bonus for 2013/14 
was, and his pro rata 2014/15 bonus payment will be, paid entirely in cash. 
3.  To ensure a like for like comparison Alun Griffiths’ annualised bonus compares an equivalent full year bonus for the year ended 31 March 2015 (£240,570) with the full 
year bonus paid to him for the year ended 31 March 2014.
Annual bonus: 2015/16 performance targets
The Committee has determined that the bonus for the year ending 31 March 2016 will operate on similar terms to 2014/15. 
50% of the bonus will be based on Group profit after tax performance with a further 25% based on a cash conversion measure. 
50% of the maximum will be paid for meeting the budgeted profit after tax and cash conversion targets and 100% for meeting 
the stretch targets. The profit after tax and cash conversion targets are considered commercially sensitive so will not be disclosed 
in advance, although the Committee’s assessment of performance against these targets will be confirmed in next year’s report. 
The remaining 25% will be based on individual objectives aligned to key strategic areas for each executive director.
Table 7 provides the headline strategic areas under which personal performance targets have been set. The performance targets 
which apply to these areas are measurable, challenging and subject to rigorous review by the Committee at the time they are set, 
during the year and at the year end when performance is assessed. Subject to commercial sensitivity, we intend to provide an 
overview of the Committee’s assessment of performance against the underlying targets in next year’s report.

LTIP outcomes in 2014/15 (audited)
The long term incentive values shown in the single total remuneration figure table (table 1) relate to LTIP awards granted in 2012 
and for which the performance period was 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2015. The EPS performance targets and vesting levels are 
set out in table 8.
The Committee adjusted the underlying diluted EPS as at 31 March 2012 as a consequence of the introduction of changes to 
IAS 19 to ensure that the underlying diluted EPS was measured consistently during the performance period and to facilitate a like 
for like comparison. This adjustment reduced the underlying diluted EPS as at 31 March 2012 from 79.0p to 73.5p. 
In determining the underlying diluted EPS as at 31 March 2015, the Committee considered the beneficial impact of RDEC and 
those same items that could give a distorted view of performance as were considered for the purposes of bonus calculations. 
In all cases its treatment was consistent with that applied in relation to the bonus, including removing the positive impact of RDEC. 
These adjustments increased the underlying diluted EPS as at 31 March 2015 from 85.4p to 96.0p. Accordingly, the actual vesting 
percentage for the LTIP awards granted in 2012 is 70%.  98 Governance
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015

In determining the LTIP outcome the Committee concluded that:
•	cash conversion over the performance period had been suitably underpinned by cash generation
•	there were no significant acquisitions in the performance period for which it was necessary to adjust vesting
•	inflation during the performance period has not had a significant effect on the level of challenge presented by the targets
•	it was not appropriate to apply malus provisions.

LTIP, LGU and DSP awards in 2014/15
The current long-term incentive framework is built around two performance measures, both of which are fundamentally aligned 
to the creation of shareholder value, as illustrated in figure 2:
•	 Growth in EPS. The primary metric for measuring the delivery of our growth objective over the medium to long term. It is 
incorporated into the long-term incentive framework via the LTIP, which is our primary long-term incentive vehicle, reflecting the 
importance of EPS growth to our strategy
•	 Sustained growth in the share price. This ensures alignment between executive reward and sustained share price growth 
over the long term, representing the ultimate measure of performance for our shareholders, and is incorporated into the long-term 
incentive framework via the LGU.

The Committee believes that these EPS targets are appropriate and stretching in the current environment. Performance against 
these targets will be measured from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2017. 
Executive directors also received a LGU award of 50% of salary. The vesting of each tranche of this award is subject to the 
Committee’s assessment of the Group’s progress against its strategy. This will include:
•	driving margins over the longer term above 8%
•	reducing dependence on the UK (with our long-term aspiration being to have more than 75% of our business outside the UK)
•	growing organically and through acquisition. Governance 99

Remuneration report continued
Annual remuneration report
One third of annual bonuses payable to Uwe Kruger and Heath Drewett for the year ended 31 March 2014 was deferred via the 
Atkins Deferred Share Plan (DSP).
LTIP, LGU and DSP awards are normally granted in June/July each year. However, it was not possible to grant share awards on the 
intended date of grant of 26 June 2014 due to the Company being in a prohibited period at that time. Consequently the awards  
were granted on 17 November 2014, which was within the next available award window. 
The Committee agreed that, in accordance with the rules and terms of the LTIP and DSP, the vesting date for these awards would 
be 26 June 2017 as originally intended. However, the LGU awards will, in accordance with the rules and terms of this plan, vest on  
the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of 17 November 2014 (the date of grant) as outlined in the policy table (table 27).
LTIP, LGU and DSP awards made during the year are set out in table 10.

1.  The LTIP awards have been granted in the form of nil-cost options. The face value has been calculated using the middle market quotation for an Atkins ordinary 
share on 17 November 2014, the date of grant, which was £13.03. The stated values exclude any amount attributable to dividend equivalents over the relevant 
performance period.
2.  The LGU awards are granted in the form of units where the value of the LGU is dependent on sustained long-term share price growth. The face value for the LGU 
awards has been calculated using the middle market quotation for an Atkins ordinary share during the six months immediately preceding the 17 November 2014 
date of grant, which was £13.2835. Given the value of the LGU is dependent on share price growth, the percentage of face value for stretch performance has been 
valued in a manner consistent with the guidance issued by the GC100 and Financial Reporting Lab, namely assuming units are worth 33% of their initial face value. 
The target performance face value is assumed to be 50% of stretch performance face value.
3.  The DSP awards have been granted in the form of nil-cost options and represent the deferral of the annual bonus for the financial year ended 31 March 2014. The face 
value has been calculated using the middle market quotation for an Atkins ordinary share on 26 June 2014, the intended date of grant, which was £13.06. The stated 
values exclude any amount attributable to dividend equivalents.
LTIP and LGU awards to be made in 2015/16
The Committee intends to grant LTIP and LGU awards to Uwe Krueger, James Cullens and Heath Drewett on the same basis as the 
awards made in the financial year ended 31 March 2015.
The underlying diluted EPS for the year ended 31 March 2015 was 97.1p. This figure, which includes the positive impact of RDEC, 
will be used to assess the extent to which the performance condition of the 2015 LTIP awards has been satisfied. The Committee 
determined that no adjustment in respect of RDEC was required as all future financial results will be presented on a consistent basis. 
The Company has been able to withhold payment of performance related remuneration since 2012. These malus provisions have 
applied to the deferred element of the annual bonus, the LTIP and the LGU. Following changes to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Committee has concluded that it is appropriate to introduce additional clawback provisions to each of these elements 
of performance related remuneration to enable the Company to recover sums paid for the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
All employee share plans
All executive directors currently participate in the Atkins Share Incentive Plan (SIP) although James Cullens’ first SIP share purchase 
is not able to take place until after the date of this report purely for administrative reasons. Alun Griffiths participated in the SIP 
until he retired on 30 July 2014. 100 Governance

4.  50% of the 2011 LTIP award was subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition and the remaining 50% subject to an EPS condition. As disclosed in last 
year’s report and accounts, the TSR condition vested in full and the EPS condition, having been adjusted for the impact of the material IAS 19 accounting charge 
introduced in the final year of the performance period, was met in part which resulted in 68.7% of the awards vesting.

6.  LTIP B and DSP share awards are normally granted in June/July each year. However, it was not possible to grant share awards in June/July 2014 due to being in

13 August 2015. The disclosed value is based on the average mid-market quotation of the Company’s shares for the three months ended 31 March 2015 and includes 
the value of dividend equivalents which will be payable on the vesting date. The value of dividend equivalents includes a payment in respect of the 2015 final dividend 
which is still subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s AGM to be held on 29 July 2015. The final value of the 2012 LTIP award will be calculated on the basis

Payments to past executive directors (audited)
Keith Clarke, who retired as a director on 31 July 2011, retained a pro rata entitlement granted under the Atkins Long Term Incentive 
Plan. In accordance with the rules of this plan, 11,204 shares vested on 20 June 2014. The value of this award, based on the share 
price at vesting and including the value of dividend equivalents payable on the vesting date, was £161,058. 
Alun Griffiths continued to work with the Group on a consultancy basis following his retirement on 30 July 2014 until 31 December 
2014, covering a number of areas including advice and support in relation to management development and client relationships. 
Payments in relation to Alun Griffiths’ entitlements to bonus and share awards on his retirement, as confirmed in last year’s annual 
remuneration report, are outlined below:
•	a bonus of £235,000 for the financial year ended 31 March 2014 was paid entirely in cash in July 2014
•	a pro rata bonus of £79,751 for the financial year ended 31 March 2015 to be paid in cash in July 2015
•	 deferred share awards over 23,880 shares granted under the terms of the DSP in connection with annual bonus entitlements from 
prior years were exercised on 8 September 2014; the value of these awards, including dividend equivalents received, was £344,065
•	 a vested LTIP share award over 20,266 shares granted on 20 June 2011 was exercised on 8 September 2014; the value of this 
award, based on the share price at vesting and including the value of dividend equivalents payable on the vesting date, was 
£291,324, as disclosed in table 1 (page 94). 
In addition, Alun retains pro rata share award entitlements granted under both the LTIP and the LGU as outlined in tables 11 and 12 
(pages 100 and 101). In line with policy and best practice, these pro rata awards remain subject to the applicable performance 
conditions being satisfied and the original vesting schedule. 
Payments for loss of office (audited)
There were no payments for loss of office made during the year.
Statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited)
Share ownership guidelines
Executive directors are ordinarily expected to build up an interest in the Company’s shares equivalent to one times their salary, 
based on the value of such shares at the time of the acquisition or their current market value, whichever is the higher. 
The interests of the directors and their families in the ordinary shares of 0.5p each in the Company as at 31 March 2015 are 
shown in tables 17 and 18 (pages 104 and 105). Heath Drewett and Uwe Krueger currently exceed the Company’s share ownership 
guideline of one times salary. James Cullens, who was appointed in the year, is expected to satisfy the one times salary share 
ownership target within five years of his appointment. 
There are no shareholding requirements for the chairman or the non-executive directors.

The Committee met five times during the year (2014: eight). Details of the attendance of members at meetings can be found in 
the Corporate governance report (page 75). 
Committee meetings are attended by the Group HR director. The chairman of the Board, the CEO and the Group reward director  
also attend meetings at the discretion of the Committee chairman. The company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. 
No director or other attendee, including the company secretary, participates in discussions regarding their own remuneration.
Advisors to the Committee
During the year, the Committee was supported by Towers Watson and received advice from Ashurst on legal matters. Table 24 
provides a summary of advice received from each advisor to the Committee, fees paid and any other services provided by the advisor 
to the Group. 
Towers Watson, a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, was appointed by the Committee following 
a tender process. Each year the Committee assesses the advice it has received and is satisfied that the advice received during the year 
has been objective and independent.

the Company on a range of matters.
The Committee also consulted the chairman of the Board, the CEO, the Group HR director, the company secretary and the Group 
reward director regarding remuneration policy.
Dilution
DSP share awards can only be satisfied using market purchase shares held in the employee benefit trust (EBT). LTIP and LGU share 
awards can be satisfied using new issue shares, shares held in treasury or market purchase shares held in the EBT. The Committee 
reviews the hedging and dilution position of the Company at least bi-annually prior to making grants of share awards. 
In line with best practice, the Committee ensures that the number of new ordinary shares issued in any 10 year period does not 
exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital under all the Company’s share plans and does not exceed 5% under the LTIP, 
the LGU and any other executive share plan of the Company (executive schemes). 
At 31 March 2015 the EBT held 2,730,695 shares (2014: 2,311,202) to hedge outstanding awards over 3,985,588 shares 
(2014: 3,925,406) and 451,420 units (2014: 361,169). Using an approximation of one unit to one share, at this date the EBT held 
shares to satisfy 62% (2014: 54%) of all outstanding awards. In addition as at 31 March 2015, 213,461 shares (2014: 213,461) were 
held in a separate EBT which are available to satisfy future awards granted under an all-employee share plan arrangement. No new 
issue shares have been used to satisfy share awards since 2005 and, to date, no treasury shares have been used. Governance 109

Executive Bonus 
Scheme (EBS)
To incentivise and reward the 
delivery of stretching annual financial 
performance targets and key strategic 
objectives.
A bonus scheme which operates annually. Two thirds of the bonus is paid  
in cash and one third is deferred into shares over three years subject to 
continued employment. The deferral into shares is usually structured as 
a nil-cost share option. Following vesting, the option can be exercised 
at the discretion of the participant up to the tenth anniversary of grant.
Dividend equivalents accrue on the deferred shares and are payable 
in cash following the vesting and exercise of the nil-cost share option.
Annual bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings and are 
non-contractual.
Measures and performance targets are set by the Committee at the 
beginning of each financial year with payout determined after year end 
following the Committee’s assessment of performance relative to targets 
and objectives.
The Committee may reduce the amounts paid if there has been a material 
quality, safety or environmental failure.
The shares are subject to malus provisions which allow the Committee 
to reduce the award in certain circumstances set out in the notes to the 
policy table.
Executive Bonus 
Scheme (EBS)
The current maximum 
annual bonus opportunity 
is 125% of base salary for 
the chief executive officer 
and 100% of salary for 
other executive directors. 
Base salary is the average 
salary paid to the executive 
director for the bonus year.
The Committee has the

The Committee would

Annual bonus will normally 
be subject to Group financial 
targets (75% of total

Individual objectives will be 
directly linked to strategic

is assessed. Any amounts 
due on this component are 
also subject to achieving

In assessing the formulaic 
outcomes of targets, the

Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
To incentivise and reward the creation 
of long-term shareholder value based 
on the delivery of growth in earnings 
per share (EPS).
An award is made on an annual basis with vesting conditional upon 
performance and continued employment over a three year period. Awards 
are typically structured as nil-cost options. Following vesting, the options 
can be exercised at the discretion of the participant up to the tenth 
anniversary of grant.
Dividend equivalents accrue on deferred shares and are payable in cash 
following the vesting and exercise of the nil-cost share option.
The shares are subject to malus provisions which allow the Committee 
to reduce the award in certain circumstances set out in the notes to the 
policy table.
Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
The maximum annual 
award limit is 150% of 
salary. It is not normally 
expected that awards to 
exceed 100% salary.
In any year that an LGU 
award is made, awards 
will be capped at 75% 
of base salary.
Vesting is subject to a 
stretching growth target 
in absolute EPS. This is 
considered the primary 
metric for measuring the 
delivery of our growth 
objective over the medium 
and long term. 
In determining the level of 
vesting, the Committee 
will give consideration to: 
(1) cash conversion over 
the performance period to 
ensure that the achieved EPS 
growth has been suitably 
underpinned by cash 
generation; (2) the impact 
of any significant acquisitions 
in the performance period; 
(3) the impact of inflation 
during the performance 
period if it deems that this 
has had a significant impact 
on the level of challenge 
presented by the targets. 
In considering these factors 
the Committee may reduce 
the level of vesting.
All current executive 
directors were granted 
the maximum 75% of 
base salary award 
permissible when an LGU 
award is also granted.
If the Company’s 
absolute EPS growth 
over the three year 
performance period is 
less than 5% per annum, 
none of the awards 
will vest.
At 5% EPS growth per 
annum, 25% will vest. 
At 12% EPS growth per 
annum, 100% will vest, 
with straight-line vesting 
for EPS growth between 
5% and 12% per annum. 
The Committee intends 
to grant 2015/16 LTIP 
awards on the same 
basis as 2014/15.

Executive Bonus 
Scheme (EBS)
To incentivise and reward the 
delivery of stretching annual financial 
performance targets and key strategic 
objectives.
A bonus scheme which operates annually. Two thirds of the bonus is paid  
in cash and one third is deferred into shares over three years subject to 
continued employment. The deferral into shares is usually structured as 
a nil-cost share option. Following vesting, the option can be exercised 
at the discretion of the participant up to the tenth anniversary of grant.
Dividend equivalents accrue on the deferred shares and are payable 
in cash following the vesting and exercise of the nil-cost share option.
Annual bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings and are 
non-contractual.
Measures and performance targets are set by the Committee at the 
beginning of each financial year with payout determined after year end 
following the Committee’s assessment of performance relative to targets 
and objectives.
The Committee may reduce the amounts paid if there has been a material 
quality, safety or environmental failure.
The shares are subject to malus provisions which allow the Committee 
to reduce the award in certain circumstances set out in the notes to the 
policy table.

annual bonus opportunity 
is 125% of base salary for

salary paid to the executive 
director for the bonus year.

Additional notes to the future policy table
Malus provisions under incentive arrangements
Deferred shares awarded in connection with the EBS and LTIP and LGU awards are subject to malus provisions which allow the 
Committee to reduce awards in certain circumstances including (but not limited to):
•	a material misstatement of the Company’s audited results
•	a material downturn in the financial performance of the Company
•	a material failure of risk management by the Company
•	serious reputational damage suffered by the Company 
•	the executive director’s misconduct.
Administrative powers under incentive plans
Any awards made under legacy incentive plans prior to the approval of the Company’s remuneration policy may be paid out subject 
to the terms of those plans (as originally applied at grant or subsequently amended) and the relevant performance conditions being 
achieved.
Administrative powers under incentive plans
The policy table provides a summary of the incentive plans in the form required by the Regulations. In addition to the operational 
features described, the Committee retains standard administrative powers such as inviting individuals to participate and determining 
the structure of an award and deciding whether or not to apply malus provisions. These powers, as set out in the rules of the plans, 
will continue to apply.
Selection of performance measures and target setting
The Committee has the flexibility to select performance measures and weightings and set targets annually to ensure continuing 
alignment with the strategic priorities of the Group. Any significant departure from the current operation of the policy as set out 
in the annual remuneration report would be discussed in advance with our major shareholders.
In selecting performance measures the Committee takes into account the Group’s strategic objectives and short- and long-term 
business priorities. The performance measures selected incentivise and reward the delivery of stretching financial performance and 
the creation of shareholder value.
The performance targets chosen are set in accordance with the Group’s operating plan and are reviewed annually to ensure they 
are sufficiently stretching. In selecting the targets the Committee also takes into account analysts’ forecasts, economic conditions 
and the Committee’s expectation of performance over the relevant period. Targets and actual performance in relation to them will 
be disclosed in the annual remuneration report provided that the Committee determines that the information is not considered 
commercially sensitive. In practice it is anticipated that EBS targets will remain commercially sensitive and so a full description of actual 
performance and the Committee’s performance assessment will be disclosed only at such time as the Committee considers they are 
no longer commercially sensitive. LTIP targets will be disclosed in the remuneration report prior to grant if determined at that time or, 
if not, in the first report following grant. For LGU awards, a full explanation will be provided on vesting of the performance 
assessment in the context of the Group’s strategic priorities over the period.
Share ownership guidelines
The Company’s shareholding guidelines seek to strengthen further the alignment of the executive directors with shareholders. 
Executive directors are expected to build up a significant interest in the Company’s shares equivalent to one times their individual 
salaries, based on the value of such shares at the time of their acquisition or their current market value, whichever is the higher. 
Shares that count towards this guideline include those held by the executive director’s spouse and/or dependent children plus any 
vested shares awarded under a Company share plan. 
Our share ownership guidelines were adopted on 1 April 2012. Executive directors are expected to meet the guideline within 
a five year period from 1 April 2012 or, if later, the date of their appointment to the Board. The Committee may vary the length 
of the periods within which the shareholding may be acquired. Governance 117

Directors’ remuneration policy
Other remuneration policies relating to executive directors
During 2014/15: 
•	James Cullens was appointed as an executive director 
•	Uwe Krueger was appointed as a non-executive director of Aggreko plc. 
The relevant approved policies relating to recruitment, termination and external directorships have therefore been restated in this 
report for ease of reference.
Recruitment and appointment of executive directors 
The Committee determines the remuneration package for all new executive directors appointed to the Board. Such appointees 
may be individuals who are already employed by the Group or from elsewhere.
In determining the appropriate remuneration package for a new executive director the Committee will consider the calibre of the 
candidate, the level of their existing remuneration, the jurisdiction the candidate is recruited from and their skills and experience, 
data for companies of a similar size and complexity and contextual information regarding remuneration paid to employees elsewhere 
in the Group. 
The remuneration of a new executive director will include all elements set out in the policy table (table 27), namely salary, benefits, 
pension, participation in the EBS and long-term incentive awards under the LTIP and LGU. Depending on the level of salary set on 
appointment, the Committee may make larger initial increases to move salary to the desired level during the first three years following 
appointment. The maximum opportunity levels in relation to other elements of remuneration outlined in the policy table (table 27) 
will apply. 
Depending on the timing and circumstances of the appointment, the Committee may vary the weighting of objectives under the 
EBS in the first year that the individual serves on the Board.
For an external appointment the offer may include compensation for the forfeiture of awards from a previous employer. In assessing 
the level of such a ‘buyout’ award, the Committee will take into account the type of incentive scheme, performance targets (and 
whether they are likely to be achieved) and the performance period of the forfeited award. In so doing the Committee will seek 
to ensure up to equivalence in value. To the extent that the Committee determines that it is appropriate, such awards will be share 
based with vesting subject to appropriate performance targets. The Committee reserves the right to rely on exemption 9.4.2 of 
the Listing Rules to enable a buyout award to be made. In such circumstances any arrangement put in place will only compensate 
for remuneration lost and will take the form of performance-related variable remuneration. For internal promotions, the Committee 
reserves the right to satisfy pre-existing executive incentive awards and other obligations which may be in place at the time 
of appointment.
Termination policy for executive directors 
In line with current market practice, the executive directors have rolling service contracts which are terminable on giving 12 months’ 
notice. On the recruitment of an executive director who previously had a longer notice period (commonly seen outside the UK), 
the Committee reserves the right to mirror the notice period with it reducing on a rolling basis to 12 months within two years 
of appointment.
No service agreement provides for predetermined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination of service contracts 
or a change in control.
The Committee retains its discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice which will be limited to one year’s base salary, benefits 
and pension. The Committee also retains its discretion to make phased payments. The service agreements include a duty for the 
executive director to mitigate loss and any payment in lieu of notice may be reduced to take account of such mitigation (for example 
if alternative employment is taken up). There is no contractual obligation to pay annual bonus. Depending on the circumstances, 
the Committee has the discretion to make a pro rata bonus payment, linked to the original performance standards and delivered 
entirely in cash. 
The executive directors’ entitlements to any bonus and unvested share awards granted in connection with the EBS or under the 
terms of the LTIP and LGU will be treated in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan rules, summarised in table 28.  118 Governance

Remuneration report continued
Directors’ remuneration policy
The Committee reserves the right to make additional compensatory payments where such payments are made in good faith and 
following the receipt of: (i) the discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); 
and (ii) settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a director’s office or employment. 
Payment of the leaver’s reasonable legal fees will also be permissible.
External directorships
The Board and the Committee recognise the benefit we can obtain if our executive directors serve as non-executive directors of other 
companies. Subject to review in each case, the Board’s general policy is that each executive director may accept one non-executive 
directorship with another FTSE 350 company from which any fees received may be retained. The Board also encourages executive 
directors to undertake pro bono appointments with charitable or professional organisations to aid their personal development and 
further enhance the profile of the Company.
Remuneration policy for the chairman and non-executive directors
Table 29 summarises the remuneration policy for the Company’s chairman and non-executive directors. 
Table 29: Remuneration policy for the Company’s chairman and non-executive directors
Component of 
remuneration
Fixed fees
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To attract and retain high-calibre individuals by offering market-competitive fixed fees commensurate with 
time commitment and responsibilities.
Operation Fees
All fees are paid in cash in arrears.
The chairman is paid a basic fee. The non-executive directors are paid a basic fee and, if applicable, additional 
fees for chairmanship and membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. An additional fee is also 
paid to the director who serves as the senior independent director.
Reviewed annually by the executive directors with any changes effective from 1 April. A review does not 
automatically give rise to an increase in fees.
Benchmarked periodically against published fee data for companies of similar size and complexity and bespoke 
comparator groups as appropriate to ensure that fees remain market-competitive.
Considered in light of economic climate, market conditions, Company performance, pay and conditions across 
the wider workforce, the non-executive director role, remit and the level of salary increases made in the rest 
of the business.
No recovery provisions apply to fees.
Expenses
Fees for the chairman are currently inclusive of normal travel expenses for travelling to and from the Group’s 
London office. However, the Committee may pay such expenses in the future. Expenses are payable on all travel 
and subsistence payments to the non-executive directors and are grossed up where such expenses are deemed 
to be a taxable benefit by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The Company may also meet the cost of compliance 
with HMRC’s individual reporting requirements where the director is not resident in the UK. The chairman and 
non-executive directors are not eligible for a pension, share incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments 
other than out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their duties.
Opportunity Fee increases for non-executive directors will normally not exceed the average salary increases across the Group. 
Increases above this level may be made in specific situations, such as significant additional time commitment 
from non-executive directors in exceptional or unforeseen circumstances. The details and reasoning behind such 
an exceptional increase will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report.
In aggregate, total fees (basic fees plus additional fees) paid to the chairman and non-executive directors shall 
not exceed £600,000 per annum as set out in the Company’s articles of association (as amended with 
shareholder approval from time to time).
Performance When determining fee increases the performance and time commitment of the non-executive directors 
is considered.
Implementation 2014/15 
With effect from 1 April 2014, the chairman’s fee was 
increased by 3.4% and the non-executive directors’ 
annual fees by 3.5% compared to an average salary 
increase for all employees of 3.96%.
There was no change to the committee membership 
or chairmanship fees. 
2015/16 
With effect from 1 April 2015, the chairman’s fee has 
increased by 2.2%, non-executive directors’ annual 
fees by 2.3%, committee chairmanship fees by 6.7% 
and the senior independent director’s fee by 10% 
compared to an average salary increase for all 
employees of 3.26%.
There was no change to committee membership fees. Governance 121

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the Financial Statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, 
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias 
by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, 
are identified as ’areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in 
order to provide an opinion on the Financial Statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the outcome of our procedures 
should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Timing and accuracy of contract revenue 
and profit recognition
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 86) 
and Revenue Recognition and Contract Accounting 
(page 139).
We focused on this area because the timing of 
revenue recognition, forecasts of costs to complete 
and the recognition of variations on fixed price 
contracts have inherent complexities in the design, 
engineering and construction industries.
The Group enters into contracts, many of which 
are complex and long-term in nature and can 
span a number of reporting periods.
The total amount of revenue and profit to be 
recognised under a contract can be affected by 
changes in conditions and circumstances over time, 
such as:
•	variations to the original contract terms
•	cost overruns
•	 scope changes that require further negotiation 
and settlement.
Variations can arise from changing client 
specifications, changes to the job based on 
unforeseen circumstances (e.g. macroeconomic 
factors), as well as from inefficiencies on the part 
of either party. There can be some uncertainties, 
therefore, in determining the amounts to be 
recovered from any additional work performed. 
The timing of revenue recognition is subject to 
judgements surrounding the costs expected to 
be incurred in completing the work, as revenue on 
fixed price contracts is recognised on a percentage 
completion basis. There is also the opportunity 
to misstate the amount of variations expected.
Given the degree of subjectivity involved in 
determining costs to complete and the magnitude 
of variations, there is also scope for error in the 
calculation of revenue and the opportunity to 
misstate the allocation of revenue between 
reporting periods.
The risk is, therefore, that contract revenue is not 
recognised in the correct period or that revenue 
and associated profit is misstated.
We evaluated the IT systems used in the determination of revenue recognition by testing 
access and change management controls. We also tested the internal controls over the 
timing of revenue recognition in the Financial Statements. Based on the results of this 
testing, we placed a high level of reliance on controls for the purposes of our testing of 
revenue and designed our further testing accordingly.
We selected a number of contracts, using risk based criteria, which included individual 
contracts:
•	with significant revenue recognised in the year or
•	with forecast losses or
•	with significant unbilled work in progress balances or
•	that had been identified by management as higher risk.
To assess whether revenue and profit is accurately recorded, we tested the forecast 
costs to complete on a sample of contracts by obtaining an understanding from project 
managers as to how they had estimated these costs, challenging the assumptions, for 
example by assessing forecast hours against historical and current run rates underpinning 
those estimates, evaluating the outturn of previous estimates and agreeing the actual 
costs incurred post-year end to the forecast costs for the period. We also assessed how 
the project managers determined that the stage of completion was correctly calculated 
and the appropriateness of variations recognised through obtaining their calculations and 
agreeing the inputs to documentary evidence or our independently formed expectation 
as appropriate. We found that the costs to complete and variations taken to value were 
appropriate.
For an additional sample, we tested the monthly monitoring of the total forecast revenue 
for the contract, costs expected to be incurred in its completion, the profit recognised to 
date and the working capital position on the contract. This was tested by checking 
electronic sign off by a suitable individual. No significant issues were noted from our work.
To test the timing of contract revenue, we challenged senior management’s judgements 
on the completeness of work for our sample of contracts by checking original contracts, 
amendments to contracts, where applicable (e.g. due to agreed variations), and checking 
that the contractual milestones had been reached. We also read and considered the 
implications of correspondence with customers (both upon the acceptance of work 
done and relating to disputes).
No significant issues were noted from our work. Governance 123

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Goodwill impairment assessment, particularly 
in the Group’s North America and aerospace 
divisions
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 86) and 
Note 14 Goodwill (page 161).
We focused on this area because the determination 
of whether or not an impairment charge is required 
involves significant judgement, including 
forecasting the future results of the business by 
estimating future sales growth rates, profit margins 
and inflation rates and determining the discount 
rate for the calculations.
We particularly focused on the goodwill held in 
respect of the North American business as this 
accounts for £144.7m (59%) of the total goodwill 
of £244.4m and has historically had the least 
relative headroom, but in respect of which no 
impairment charge has been recognised in the year.
We also focused on the Directors’ assessment of 
impairment within the aerospace business to check 
that the impairment charge of £2.8m recognised 
in the year is sufficient to reflect the downturn 
in this business.
IFRSs require complex and often detailed disclosure 
in the financial statements about goodwill and 
impairment. In addition to reviewing the need 
for any impairment charge, we focused on 
these disclosures because they form a valuable 
communication, enabling users of the Financial 
Statements to understand the basis for any 
impairment recognised or not recognised.
We evaluated the Directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they were 
drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board-approved budgets, and testing 
the underlying calculations. We challenged the Directors’ key assumptions for:
•	 short-term sales growth rates and profit margins in the forecasts by comparing them 
to short-term historical results and economic industry forecasts
•	 long-term growth rates in the forecasts by comparing them to long-term historical 
results and economic industry forecasts
•	 the discount rate, by assessing the cost of capital for all cash generating units (CGUs), 
using our specialist valuations knowledge and comparing the Company’s key inputs 
to externally derived data.
We compared the current year actual results to the figures for the financial year ended 
31 March 2015 included in the prior year impairment models to consider whether any 
forecasts included assumptions that, with hindsight, had been optimistic. Actual 
performance in the Atkins North America and European aerospace businesses was found 
to be lower than expected so we checked and found that the Directors had appropriately 
reflected this in the current year cash flow models.
Using our own independent analysis, we assessed sensitivity analysis that had been 
performed by management around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts, which were:
•	the discount rate
•	the projected operating profit margins
to identify how much each of these key drivers needed to change, either individually 
or collectively, before the goodwill was impaired.
Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that either individually 
or collectively would be required for the goodwill to be impaired, we considered the 
likelihood of such a movement in those key assumptions arising.
We found that the discount rate applied by the Directors was in line with the cost of 
capital for North American businesses and the profit margins and short- and long-term 
growth rates were in line with those forecasts presented to the Board and those of the 
US market.
We considered the related disclosures in note 14 to the Financial Statements by checking 
that they were compliant with IFRSs and that their presentation was consistent with our 
understanding of the key issues in this area. We found that they appropriately describe the 
inherent degree of subjectivity in the estimates and the potential impact on future periods 
of revisions to these estimates, including specific disclosures on the key assumptions most 
sensitive to reasonable possible change.
Valuation of net retirement plan liabilities
Refer to Note 29 Post-employment benefit  
liabilities (pages 182 to 191).
The Group operates two significant defined benefit 
plans and total net post-retirement liabilities of 
£298.4m which are significant in the context of 
the overall balance sheet of the Group: the Atkins 
Pension Plan and the Railways Pension Scheme.
We focused on this area because the valuation 
of plan liabilities requires significant levels of 
judgement and technical expertise in choosing 
appropriate assumptions. Unfavourable changes 
can result in a number of key assumptions 
(including salary increases, inflation, discount rates 
and mortality) having a material impact on the 
calculation of the liability. 
There is also some judgement in the measurement 
of the fair value of pension assets giving rise to 
a risk of material misstatement in their valuation.
We liaised with the Group’s actuaries and used our own actuarial expertise to evaluate the 
Directors’ assessment of the assumptions made in relation to the valuations of the liabilities 
and assets in the pension plans. We compared the assumptions around salary increases 
and mortality rates to national and industry averages. We checked with the Group’s 
actuaries that there had been no significant events or settlements that would impact the 
current pension balances and disclosures.
We tested the Group’s contributions to the bank statements and the pensions paid out 
of the schemes by tracing them to the pension scheme bank accounts. 
We also tested the valuations of pension plan liabilities and assets as follows:
•	 to test the inputs to the calculation of the liabilities, we compared the discount and 
inflation rates used in the valuation of the pension liabilities to our internally developed 
benchmarks and found that they were consistent
•	 to test the valuation of the assets, we obtained third party confirmations on ownership 
and valuation of pension assets. We found these confirmations to be consistent 
with the amounts disclosed in the financial statements.
The evidence we obtained supported the carrying value of the net retirement 
plan liabilities.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions
Refer to Note 7 Income tax expense and Note 18 
Deferred income tax (pages 152 to 153 and  
166 to 167).
We focused on this area due to the judgement 
required in assessing the completeness and 
valuation of provisions to cover the risk of challenge 
of certain of the Group’s tax positions. Provisions 
are held principally in respect of:
•	current tax deductions
•	ongoing tax audits.
We evaluated and challenged management’s rationale for the level of provisions held. 
Where relevant, we obtained and assessed supporting documentation used by 
management to formulate the provisions, and considered the reasonableness of 
management’s best estimate assessments. To do this: 
•	we assessed the impact of tax rate changes and other factors on the current tax
•	 we considered the status of recent and current tax enquiries in the UK and the US, 
and the macro-tax environment in each territory
•	 we considered the sensitivity of management’s probability estimates used to calculate 
the value of provisions, where relevant
•	 we discussed with management all issues known to us, and considered the sufficiency 
of provisions in light of the matters discussed.
The evidence we obtained supported the amounts provided for uncertain tax positions.
Captive insurance claim provisions
The Group operates a captive insurance company, 
which provides self-insurance against claims such 
as professional indemnity and income protection. 
The most significant provisions relate to alleged 
deficiencies found in work performed by the 
Group.
We focused on this area because the determination 
of the size of the provisions held and the settlement 
amounts are inherently judgemental.
We obtained the Group’s schedule for the professional indemnity claims and checked it 
was complete by comparing it to Board minutes and correspondence with the Group’s 
legal counsel. For each material claim we discussed the issue with the Group’s internal legal 
counsel and management of the captive insurance company in order to understand the 
latest position of the proceedings and assess the Directors’ views as to the strength of the 
claim against the Group. 
We obtained a schedule from management detailing the income protection claim 
provisions per underwriting year. We discussed the controls in place around the claims 
cycles with management and obtained evidence that controls had been working during 
the year. We checked year end provisions to Board minutes and to claims schedules 
provided by the Group’s claims specialists and evaluated the specialists as being suitably 
qualified or experienced.
We sought management explanation for significant movements in the period and 
substantiated management’s claims by confirming with insurers, legal correspondence 
where possible and the Group’s legal counsel. From the evidence obtained, we consider 
the level of provisioning at the balance sheet date to be acceptable.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and 
the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group reports its operating results and financial position in five segments, being United Kingdom and Europe, North America, 
Middle East, Asia Pacific and Energy. The Group Financial Statements are a consolidation of the Group’s operating businesses and 
central functions.
The Group’s operating reporting units vary significantly in size, the most significant being the United Kingdom and Europe segment. 
For the purposes of our scoping we divided this reporting unit further by identifying those significant areas where we needed to 
focus our work. This included performing work on the shared service facility, giving us evidence over the centralised processes in the 
UK, and the key UK operating businesses selected based on their size or risk characteristics (e.g. rail). We also performed an audit of 
the complete financial information of North America, the Middle East and UK Energy. We issued instructions to our overseas teams, 
which included guidance on the areas of focus for the audit; we then had regular communication with them and a senior member of 
the Group team also attended all planning and clearance meetings, either in person or by telephone. The Group engagement leader 
visited both North America and the Middle East for the clearance meetings. Further specific audit procedures over Group functions 
and areas of significant judgement, including taxation, goodwill, treasury, post-retirement benefits and material litigation were 
performed at the Group’s head office.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £5.6 million (2014: £5.3 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for exceptional items, which for FY15 consisted of costs attributable 
to an unsuccessful acquisition pursuit.
Rationale for benchmark applied Consistent with last year, we believed that profit adjusted for exceptional items best represents the 
Group’s underlying performance as this eliminates items of income or expense that are one-off and 
significant in nature or amount.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them individual misstatements identified during our audit above 
£0.5m (2014: £0.5m) as well as misstatements below that amount which, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement (page 71) in relation to going concern. We have nothing 
to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Financial Statements using 
the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources 
to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the Financial Statements 
were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Statement of Responsibility (pages 70 and 71), the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of:
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed
•	the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors
•	the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the Financial Statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited Financial Statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2015
1 Accounting policies
WS Atkins plc (the Company) is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, Epsom, Surrey, KT18 5BW, England.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, including the application of new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
and interpretations, unless otherwise stated. 
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
(EU), the Companies Act 2006 that applies to companies reporting under IFRS, and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC or IFRIC) 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including 
derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed 
under critical accounting policies and are incorporated by reference in the Business Review (on pages 46 to 47).  
Changes in accounting policy and disclosure
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There were no standards adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2014 that had a material impact 
on the Group.
The following IFRS and international accounting standards (IASs) and IFRIC interpretations have been adopted by the Group for the first time 
for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2014 and do not have a material impact on the Group: 
•	IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements
•	IFRS 11, Joint arrangements
•	IFRS 12, Disclosure of interests in other entities
•	IFRIC 21, Levies
•	Amendments to the following standards:
 – IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27: Investment entities
 – IAS 32, Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
 – IAS 36, Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets
 – IAS 39, Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting.
IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements. Under IFRS 10, subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group  
has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group has power over an entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The adoption of 
IFRS 10 has had no significant effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 11, Joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, 
depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Before  
1 April 2014, the Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities were accounted for using the equity method. Under IFRS 11, some of the 
Group’s jointly controlled entities have been assessed to be joint operations.
The Group has applied the new policy for its interests in joint operations in accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 11. The Group 
recognised its investment in the assets and liabilities relating to the joint operation, by disaggregating them from the carrying amount of the 
investment used in applying the equity method.
In respect of its interests in joint operations, the Group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Group accounts 
for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance with the IFRSs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses.
The Group has an interest in several joint arrangements. Under IAS 31, some of these joint arrangements were assessed as jointly controlled 
entities and were equity accounted. The Group has reassessed the classification of all its joint arrangements under IFRS 11. 136 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued
Based on the facts and circumstances of each joint arrangement, it was assessed that the Group has rights to the assets and obligations 
for the liabilities in certain of its joint arrangements and they have therefore now been classified as joint operations.
Following the adoption and application of IFRS 11, Joint arrangements, the Consolidated Income Statements and the Consolidated 
Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 31 March 2014 have not been restated, as the restatement was not material. 
The Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2014 and the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity balances as at 1 April 2013 
and 31 March 2014 have also not been restated, as the impact on these was not considered material. 
In addition, the Group has reviewed its reporting of joint operations and joint ventures, and has amended its definition of revenue for 
segmental reporting purposes to exclude the Group’s share of revenue from joint ventures. As a consequence of the adoption of IFRS 11 
and the review of revenue reporting, the segmental results and assets of the operating segments for the year ended 31 March 2015 have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS 11 and this amended definition of revenue. The segmental results and assets for the comparative year 
ended 31 March 2014 have not been restated, as the changes were not considered material.
IFRS 12, Disclosure of interests in other entities. IFRS 12 sets out the disclosure requirements in the financial statements in respect of IFRS 10 
and IFRS 11. The key additional disclosure, above those already required under existing standards, is that additional information is required 
on the nature, risks and financial effects of the Company’s interest in other entities, particularly where there are special purpose entities 
(SPEs) or other entities that are not consolidated. Further disclosure is required about the significant judgements and assumptions made in 
determining the classification of the investments. The Group did not hold any material interests in joint ventures and associates and therefore 
no additional disclosure has been provided.
IFRIC 21, Levies. IFRIC 21 clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity that triggers the payment 
of the levy, as identified by the legislation. The adoption of IFRIC 21 has had no significant effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for earlier periods or for the year ended 31 March 2015.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the Group
The following accounting standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued by the IASB but had either not been adopted 
by the European Union or were not yet effective in the European Union for the financial year beginning 1 April 2014:
•	IFRS 9, Financial instruments
•	IFRS 14, Regulatory deferral accounts
•	IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers
•	Amendments to the following standards:
 − IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture
 − IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment entities: Applying the consolidation exemption
 − IFRS 11, Accounting for acquisitions of interests in a joint operation 
 − IAS 1, Disclosure initiative
 − IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
 − IAS 16 and IAS 41: Agricultural: Bearer plants
 − IAS 19, Defined benefit plans: Employee contributions
 − IAS 27, Equity method in separate financial statements
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective. The Group 
does not currently believe adoption of these would have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
The directors have made initial assessments of the impact of IFRS 15 and do not expect any material quantitative impact to the Group. 
The Group will carry out a systematic review of all existing major contracts to ensure that the impact and effect of the new standard 
is fully understood and changes to the current accounting procedures are highlighted and acted upon in advance of the effective date.
The Group has chosen not to adopt any of the above standards and interpretations earlier than required. Financial Statements 137

The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Income Statement and Balance Sheet include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of 
joint ventures. The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from 
the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement 
up to the date of disposal.
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less 
impairments. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or 
assumed at the date of exchange. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date irrespective of any non-controlling interest. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the 
fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit 
or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of the 
acquisition is lower than the fair value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement. 
Goodwill is reviewed on finalisation of fair values and any adjustments required to the accounting are recorded within 12 months of the 
acquisition date.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Where subsidiaries adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group’s, their reported results are restated to comply with the 
Group’s accounting policies. Where subsidiaries do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Group’s, results and net 
assets are based upon unaudited accounts drawn up to the Group’s accounting reference date.
Joint arrangements
The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 a joint arrangement is an arrangement over which two or more parties 
have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The Group classifies its interests in joint arrangements 
as either joint ventures or joint operations.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement. Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and the carrying amount is 
increased or decreased thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses. Losses of a joint venture in excess 
of the Group’s interest in the joint venture are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.

Joint operations
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets and obligations for the 
liabilities relating to the arrangement, or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Group’s share of assets, 
liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the Financial Statements on a line-by-line basis.
Employee benefit trusts (EBTs) 
The accounts of the EBTs are incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are administered by independent trustees and  
their assets are held separately from those of the Group, in practice the Group’s recommendations on how the assets are used for the 
benefit of employees are normally followed. The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the assets held by the EBTs until the shares 
vest unconditionally with the employees. Shares in the Company held by the EBTs are shown as a reduction in retained earnings. Other  
assets and liabilities held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
Foreign currency transactions and translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling 
(£), which is the Company’s and Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income, for example, as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional 
currency different from the Group’s presentation currency are translated into the Group’s presentation currency as follows:
•	assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that Balance Sheet
•	income and expenses for each Income Statement are translated at average exchange rates
•	all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). 
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the 
chief executive officer (CEO) and the Group finance director. 
The Group’s operating segments for management purposes reflect predominantly its key geographical markets. The segments are: 
United Kingdom and Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Energy. These segments form the basis for reporting the 
Group’s segment information as they are the main determinants of the Group’s risks and returns. The Group considers the UK to be its 
country of domicile. 
Intersegment transfers and transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available 
to unrelated third parties. 
Revenue
Revenue from long-term contracts comprises the value of work performed during the period calculated in accordance with the Group’s 
policy for contract accounting set out below. Revenue from other contract activities represents fee income receivable in respect of services 
provided during the period.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from third party 
contractors and recharge them to the customer at cost. The amounts charged by contractors and recharged to customers are excluded from 
revenue and cost of sales where the Group is acting solely as an agent. Receivables, payables and cash relating to these transactions are 
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Financial Statements 139

Underlying profit
Underlying operating profit is profit before exceptional items, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets recognised on acquisition 
and material transaction costs associated with acquisitions, and relates to continuing operations.
Revenue recognition and contract accounting
The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads and 
attributable profit. Fees invoiced on account are deducted from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately disclosed in 
trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in progress on any contract 
in which case the excess is separately disclosed in trade and other payables as fees invoiced in advance.
The Group enters into a number of different forms of contracts with clients, the most common being fixed price lump sum contracts and 
time and materials contracts based on hourly rates. Some of the fixed price lump sum contracts may be linked to the capital cost of works 
or a profit/(loss) sharing mechanism (pain gain mechanism). 
Revenue is recognised on the majority of the Group’s contracts on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of a contract or project 
can be reasonably foreseen. Under the percentage completion method, the percentage of the total forecast revenue reported at any point 
in time is calculated based upon the proportion of total costs incurred to date as a percentage of total forecast costs or, in some cases, 
based upon the estimated physical per cent complete of the total work to be performed under the contract. In some cases, a margin 
provision is then made, depending on how far progressed each project is and the risk profile of the project. In addition, provision is made 
in full for estimated losses and, where the outcome of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, profit is taken on completion. 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time apportionment basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognised using the 
original effective interest rate.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Pre-contract costs
The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with IAS 11, Construction contracts. Costs incurred before it becomes probable 
that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses. Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised in the Balance 
Sheet and charged to the Income Statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, over the same period 
as the Group’s interest in any special purpose company (SPC) charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the Income Statement.
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the Income Statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, 
over the same period as the Group’s interest in any SPC credits the equivalent capitalised amounts to the Income Statement. Where the 
Group’s interest in any SPC reduces, the deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the Income Statement in proportion to the reduction 
of the Group’s interest.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the Financial Statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the 
financial performance of the Group. They are items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their 
nature or amount.
Exceptional items are also summarised by class in the segmental analyses, excluding those that relate to interest and tax. 140 Financial Statements

Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit (DB) pension plans. 
A DC plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee 
service in the current and prior periods.
A DB plan is a pension plan that typically defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually 
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
For the DB plan, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to 
the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Remeasurement recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is 
recognised in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning  
of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. DB pension costs are categorised as follows:
•	service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements)
•	administrative expenses
•	net interest expense or income
•	remeasurement.
The net retirement benefit liabilities recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent the actual deficit in the Group’s defined 
benefit plan. 
For DC plans, the Group pays contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised 
as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction in the future payments is available.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) or cash (phantom allocations) of the Group.
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the cost of share-based payments awarded is charged to the Income Statement over the
performance and vesting periods of the instruments. The cost is based on the fair value of the awards made at the date of grant adjusted for 
the number of awards expected to vest. In the case of equity settled awards, the credits associated with the amounts charged to the Income 
Statement are included in retained earnings/accumulated losses until the awards are exercised. In the case of cash settled awards, the credits 
associated with the amounts charged to the Income Statement are held as a liability in the Balance Sheet until the awards are transferred, 
at which point a cash amount (based on the Company’s share price at the vesting date) is paid to the employee. Where awards are settled 
by the new issue of shares, any proceeds received in respect of share options are credited to share capital and share premium. Where awards 
are settled in shares held by the EBTs, any proceeds are credited to retained earnings/accumulated losses. 
Share awards are granted by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries. The Company charges to cost of investment in subsidiaries an 
amount equivalent to the equity settled element of the annual IFRS 2 charge, with an equivalent credit to reserves in accordance with 
IFRIC 11, Group and treasury share transactions. Financial Statements 141

Income tax
Current and deferred income tax are recognised in the Income Statement for the period except where the taxation arises as a result 
of a transaction or event that is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Income tax arising on transactions or 
events recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly 
to equity respectively. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in 
the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises 
from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures, except where it is known 
that the earnings will be distributed.
Deferred tax assets of £3.5m (2014: £3.7m) have not been recognised due to the uncertainty of timing of utilisation. 
Research and development (R&D)
All R&D expenditure is written off to the Income Statement as incurred. In the UK, the Group has early adopted the new UK R&D 
expenditure credit regime with effect from 1 April 2013. These credits have characteristics more akin to government grants than income 
taxes and therefore are offset against the relevant expenditure in the Income Statement rather than via the tax charge.
The credits are recognised to the extent that there is reasonable assurance that they will be received, albeit that the claim process takes 
place sometime after the original expenditure was incurred. In the Balance Sheet, the debtor is included within current other receivables. 
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given for a business over 
the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business.
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment. Prior to adoption of IFRS from 1 April 2004, goodwill was amortised over its 
estimated useful economic life. Amortisation ceased on 1 April 2004 and the carrying value of existing goodwill was frozen at that date 
and is subject to impairment reviews.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business acquisition is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, 
that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents 
the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal 
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 April 1997 was written off to retained earnings/accumulated losses. Profit or loss on disposal of the underlying 
businesses to which this goodwill related will not include goodwill previously recorded as a deduction from equity. 142 Financial Statements

Acquired customer relationships
Acquired customer relationships consist of intangible assets arising on the consolidation of recently acquired businesses, that are separable 
from goodwill, in accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, and IAS 38, Intangible assets, and do not fall within the Group’s other 
classes of intangible assets. These comprise principally existing customer relationships which may give rise to future orders (customer 
relationships), and existing order books (backlog orders). 
Acquired customer relationships are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and have a finite useful life. Amortisation of customer 
relationships is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of customer relationships over their estimated useful lives 
of between one and 20 years. Acquired customer relationships are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Backlog orders are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and amortised over their estimated useful lives of up to three years. 
Backlog orders are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Software licences
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. 
These costs are amortised using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the software licences over their useful lives of between 
two and five years. Software licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Corporate information systems
In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible assets, the Group’s corporate information systems are treated as an intangible asset. Costs included 
are those directly attributable to the design, construction and testing of new systems (including major enhancements and internally 
generated costs) from the point of inception to the point of satisfactory completion where the probable future economic benefits arising 
from the investment can be assessed with reasonable certainty at the time the costs are incurred. Maintenance and minor modifications are 
expensed in the Income Statement as incurred. The corporate information systems recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line 
method to allocate the cost of the corporate information systems over their estimated useful life of six years. Corporate information systems 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Trade names and trademarks
Trade names and trademarks have arisen on the consolidation of recently acquired businesses and are recognised at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Where trade names and trademarks are considered to have a finite useful life, amortisation is calculated using the straight 
line method to allocate the cost of trade names and trademarks over their estimated useful lives. Where trade names and trademarks are 
considered to have an indefinite useful life, they are not subject to amortisation; they are tested annually for impairment and when there 
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable, as detailed within the impairment of non-financial assets section below. 
Trade names and trademarks are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost comprises purchase price after 
discounts and rebates plus all directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying 
amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Income Statement during the financial 
period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to write off the cost less residual value 
of each asset over its estimated useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings  – 10 to 50 years
Short term leasehold property  – over the life of the lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles  – three to 12 years.
The assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within administrative 
expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. Financial Statements 143

Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and when 
there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised 
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which 
there are largely independent cash flows (CGUs). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible 
reversal at each reporting date.
Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-
for-sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if 
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated 
as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified 
as non-current.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the Balance Sheet date. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or 
regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted 
market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the mid market price. These instruments are included in Level 1, see note 19.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all 
significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2, see note 19.
The fair value of financial instruments for an asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 
are Level 3 financial instruments, see note 19.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets except where the maturity is greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date, in which case they 
are included as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
and other receivables in the Balance Sheet. Other receivables include loan notes receivable. 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months 
of the end of the reporting period.  144 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit 
or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in 
the Income Statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the investments has expired or has been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less provision for impairment which, due to their short term nature, approximates 
to their fair value. Other receivables include loan notes receivable, which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less any provision for impairment. This valuation approximates to their fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the Income 
Statement in the period in which they arise. 
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in other comprehensive 
income.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included 
in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Interest on available-for-sale financial assets calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the Income Statement as part 
of finance income.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a loss event) and that loss event 
(or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtor, or a group of debtors, is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default 
or delinquency in payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate 
that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate 
with defaults. 
Any impairment is charged to the Income Statement. Impairment testing for trade receivables is described below in the accounting policy 
paragraph relating to trade receivables. For other receivables carried at amortised cost, impairment loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised 
impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Assets classified as available-for-sale
The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets 
is impaired. The Group uses the criteria referred to above. If any evidence of impairment exists, the cumulative loss – measured as the 
difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in 
profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified 
as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised 
in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the Consolidated Income Statement.  Financial Statements 145

Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost less impairment. Cost is determined using the first in, first out method. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in 
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented 
as non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if 
so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 21. The full fair value of a hedging derivative 
is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current 
asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, 
when the forecast cash flow that is hedged takes place). 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain 
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast cash flow is ultimately recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. When a forecast cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported 
in equity is immediately transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Lease obligations
Finance leases
Lease arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee are treated as finance leases. Assets held 
under finance leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment at the lease’s commencement and depreciated over the shorter 
of the lease term and the useful life of the asset. A liability is recognised for the present value of the minimum lease payments within current 
and/or non-current liabilities as appropriate. Rental payments are apportioned between capital and interest expense to achieve a constant 
rate of interest charge on the outstanding obligation. 
Operating leases
Where the Group acts as lessee in an operating lease arrangement, the lease payments are charged as an expense to the Income Statement 
on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are also recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Where the Group acts as lessor in an operating lease arrangement, rental income from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line 
basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives provided are also recognised over the lease term on a straight line basis. 146 Financial Statements

Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business 
if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised at fair value.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some 
or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that 
it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised 
over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming 
vacant. The provision is calculated based on projected discounted cash flows to the end of the lease, after making assumptions for void 
and rent free periods. The pre-tax rate used reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Disposal groups held for sale
Disposal groups are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
2 Segmental information
The CODM has been identified as the CEO and the Group finance director. The CEO and the Group finance director review the Group’s 
internal reporting to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments based on these 
reports.
The Group’s operating segments for management purposes reflect predominantly its key geographical markets. The segments are: 
United Kingdom and Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Energy. Details of the business activities and the economic 
environment in which each segment operates are given in the Business Review (on pages 25 to 44).
The CEO and the Group finance director assess the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit before interest 
and tax. Information provided to the CEO and the Group finance director is measured in a manner consistent with that in the Financial 
Statements.
The Group has interests in several joint arrangements. As detailed in note 1, under IAS 31, some of these joint arrangements were assessed 
as jointly controlled entities and were equity accounted. The Group has assessed the classification of all its joint arrangements following 
the adoption of IFRS 11, Joint arrangements. Some of these jointly controlled entities have now been classified as joint operations and the 
Group has accounted for its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of these joint operations. In addition, the Group has reviewed 
its reporting of joint operations and joint ventures, and has amended its definition of revenue for segmental reporting purposes to exclude 
the Group’s share of revenue from joint ventures. As a consequence of the adoption of IFRS 11 and the review of revenue reporting, the 
segmental results and assets of the operating segments have been prepared to reflect these changes. The segmental results and assets for 
the comparative year ended 31 March 2014 have not been restated, as the impacts were not considered material. Financial Statements 147

Group cash balances; derivative financial instruments; financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; centrally managed joint ventures; 
and corporate assets are not considered to be segment assets as they are managed centrally. Consequently they are shown within 
unallocated central items.
Similarly, post-employment benefit liabilities; bank loans and private placement debt; derivative financial instruments; central tax provisions; 
and corporate liabilities are not considered to be segment liabilities as they are managed centrally. Consequently they are shown within 
unallocated central items.
Capital expenditure includes additions to goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. 
b) Group geographical segments
External revenue is measured by location of operation. There was no material difference between geographic revenue by location of 
operation and by location of customer. 
The Group considers the UK to be its country of domicile. Outside the UK, only the Group’s business in the United States (US) contributes 
more than 10% of the Group’s revenue or non-current assets.

WS Atkins – Polska Sp. z o.o. 
On 11 September 2014 the sale of the Group’s Polish business, WS Atkins – Polska Sp. z o.o., to Multiconsult AS was completed. Multiconsult 
AS is a Norwegian multidisciplinary consultancy and design business. The business was sold for a net cash consideration of €3.5m (£2.8m). 
While the assets and liabilities of the Polish business represent a disposal group, the business has not been reported as a discontinued 
operation at 31 March 2015 as it does not represent a major line of business. 
The Polish business has been reported in the United Kingdom and Europe operating segment (note 2).

On 27 February 2013 contracts were exchanged to dispose of the Group’s UK highways services business, which formed part of the 
UK highways and transportation business, to Skanska Construction UK Limited (Skanska), a wholly owned subsidiary of Skanska AB. 
The business was sold for a cash consideration of £16.0m (subject to certain completion adjustments), together with a deferred conditional 
amount of £2.0m.
The profit on disposal of these items was included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 March 2014.
During the year ended 31 March 2015 a portion of the available deferred consideration was received, totalling £0.5m. 
At 31 March 2013, disposal costs of £3.8m were provided for, comprising transaction costs of £2.4m and restructuring costs of £1.4m. 
Following the conclusion of this transaction in October 2013, £0.6m of the restructuring costs were not required and were subsequently

Terramar AS (Terramar)
On 17 November 2014 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Terramar, one of Norway’s leading project management consultancies. 
Terramar has been involved in the planning and implementation of some of Norway’s most high profile projects. The company has 
65 employees providing project management services across infrastructure, health, urban development and communications.
Terramar has unique project management skills and a well-established client base in both the public and private sector in Norway.  
The acquisition will raise our skills in project management and our presence in Norway, bringing the capacity, skills and knowledge to 
enable us to bid for major projects.  
The initial accounting for this business combination has been determined provisionally and the Group has therefore accounted for the 
combination using provisional values. Adjustments to these provisional values will be made within one year of the date of acquisition 
relating to facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. 
The goodwill of £9.3m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the extensive complementary skills which enable the combined 
operation to provide an enhanced offering to clients and create a broader local presence in Norway. The goodwill recognised is not expected 
to be deductible for income tax purposes. 156 Financial Statements

Nuclear Safety Associates, Inc (NSA)
On 4 September 2014 the Group acquired the entire share capital of NSA, a 130 people engineering and technical services firm, for 
a debt-free cash consideration of US$14.0m (approximately £8.5m) with a further US$1m (approximately £0.6m) deferred for two years.
Contingent consideration is payable in cash to the former owners of NSA based on revenue and operating profit targets for the first 
three years from acquisition, followed by operating margin growth levels for the next two years. The Group prepares detailed forecasts 
on the acquisition of a business and updates these on a quarterly basis as part of its normal operating processes. These forecasts use 
management’s evaluation of the revenue, costs and expected margins, based on past experience. The fair value of the contingent 
consideration arrangement of £2.5m (US$4.0m) was calculated by estimating probable future cash flows payable and discounting these 
at a discount rate of 9.3%. This is a Level 3 fair value measurement. The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that 
the Group could be required to make under this arrangement is between US$0 and US$10.2m (approximately £6.2m).
NSA brings expertise in nuclear safety, design engineering and professional security services and has a well-established project and client 
base in the US nuclear market. 158 Financial Statements

Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, at least annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.  
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGU, or group of CGUs, that management has identified in order to carry out impairment tests.
The following is a summary of goodwill allocation by CGU or group of CGUs, summarised at the operating segment level:
Group
 2015 
 £m 
 2014 
 £m 
United Kingdom and Europe 49.2  45.1 
North America 144.7  131.0 
Asia Pacific  5.6  5.5 
Energy 44.9  22.4 
Total 244.4  204.0 
The impairment test involves comparing the carrying value of the CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated to their 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is based on the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment loss 
is recognised immediately when the carrying value of those assets exceeds their recoverable amount. 162 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued
Recoverable amount
Fair value less costs to sell is the best estimate of the amount obtainable from the sale of a CGU or group of CGUs in an arm’s-length 
transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows 
expected to be derived from the CGU or group of CGUs.
Fair value is assessed from an external perspective and value in use from a Group internal perspective. Both are determined using a business 
valuation model, taking into account planned future cash flows. If available, third-party valuations are taken as a basis for determining 
fair value.
Value in use calculations
Methodology
The internal value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on the following financial year’s budget approved by the Board, 
which is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market developments. The key assumptions in the budget relate 
to revenue and profit margins. Budgeted revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years, along with the 
existing committed and contracted workload, as well as management’s future expectations of the level of work available within the market. 
Profit margins are based on current margins being achieved in conjunction with economic conditions in the market or country of operation.   
The cash flow projections from that budget are extrapolated for the next four years using an estimated growth rate and projected margin  
for all CGUs, or groups of CGUs, except for the North America operating segment. The Group’s formal five year plan is used for the North 
America segment as it provides a better indication of the future performance of the operation. The growth rates used to extrapolate the 
budgets are between 1.9% and 3.8% and are based on the economic environment for the country or region in which the CGU operates. 
As required by IAS 36, cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated based on the long term average growth rate for the primary 
country in which the CGU operates of between 1.8% and 3.8%. These growth rates are derived from the International Monetary Fund’s 
World Economic Outlook published Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates. Projected margins reflect the historical and budgeted 
performance of the CGU. The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet 
committed. 
The cash flows have been discounted using the CGUs specific pre-tax discount rates of between 8.9% and 16.0%. The discount rates have 
been calculated using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. The 
discount rates are revised annually using updated market information.  
Assumptions
The growth rate and discount rate assumptions used for the internal value in use calculations are as follows:
Group
 2015  2014 
Five year growth rate 1.9% – 3.8% 1.7% – 5.4%
Post five year growth rate 1.8% – 3.8% 1.8% – 5.3%
Pre-tax discount rate 8.9% – 16.0% 6.7% – 17.9%
Impairment loss
Following the downturn in the European aerospace market, the carrying amount of goodwill arising on the acquisition in 2007 of the Dutch 
consultancy Atkins BV (formerly Nedtech Engineering BV) was reviewed during the period and, as a consequence has been reduced to its 
recoverable amount based on value in use calculations through the recognition of an impairment loss of £2.8m. This impairment charge 
relates solely to goodwill and has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within administrative expenses as an unallocated 
central item. 
At the year end, the recoverable amount of the Group’s CGU covering the European aerospace market was £3.4m which was determined 
using an internal value in use calculation, a key input to which is the Group’s 2016 budget that has been extrapolated for the next four years 
using an estimated growth rate and projected margin. The growth rate and discount rate assumptions used for this calculation are as 
follows:
Group
 2015  2014 
Five year growth rate 1.9% 2.0%
Post five year growth rate 1.8% 2.0%
Pre-tax discount rate 9.6% 11.2% Financial Statements 163

Sensitivities
Goodwill of £144.7m (2014: £131.0m) allocated to the North America operating segment includes £137.1m of goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of PBSJ. This goodwill has been allocated to the North America group of CGUs and is considered significant in comparison with 
the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount of this group of CGUs has been determined using an internal value 
in use calculation, key inputs to which are the Group’s 2016 budget and the formal five year plan for the North America segment, which 
covers the period to 2019. The other assumptions used for this value in use calculation are the long term growth rate and the discount rate 
as follows:
2015 2014
Post five year growth rate 2.0% 2.2%
Pre-tax discount rate 14.0% 13.5%
Given the materiality of goodwill allocated to the North America group of CGUs, sensitivity analysis has been performed on the key 
assumptions used in the value in use calculations. The recoverable amount of the North America group of CGUs calculated based on value 
in use exceeds its carrying value by £87.5m. The two assumptions to which these value in use calculations are most sensitive are projected 
profit margin and the discount rate. Specific sensitivity analysis with regard to these assumptions shows that, with respect to the profit 
margin it would need to fall by 215 basis points before any impairment would be triggered, and similarly the pre-tax discount rate would 
need to increase from 14.0% to 18.6%. 
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation for the Group’s CGU covering the 
European aerospace market. The recoverable amount of the European aerospace market group of CGUs calculated based on value in use 
exceeds its carrying value by £0.9m. The two assumptions to which these value in use calculations are most sensitive are projected profit 
margin and the discount rate. Specific sensitivity analysis with regard to these assumptions shows that, with respect to the profit margin, 
it would need to fall by 120 basis points before any impairment would be triggered, and similarly the pre-tax discount rate would need to 
increase from 9.6% to 12.2%.
For the CGUs other than those disclosed above, management has considered the level of headroom resulting from the impairment tests. 
Where appropriate, further sensitivity analysis has been performed by changing the base case assumptions applicable to each CGU. The 
analysis has indicated that no reasonably possible change in any individual key assumption would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to 
exceed its recoverable amount. As at 31 March 2015 and 2014, based on these valuations, the recoverable value of the remaining goodwill 
required no impairment. 164 Financial Statements

The Finance Act 2013 enacted a reduction to the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. 
As the Finance Act 2013 had been enacted as at the Balance Sheet date, the impact of these reductions has been reflected in the 
movements in deferred tax as at 31 March 2014 and therefore 31 March 2015. No further reductions to the UK corporation tax rate are 
currently proposed. 
19 Financial risk management 
Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks 
to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain 
risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of directors. Group 
Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides written 
principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, 
credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are further described within the ‘Treasury policies and objectives’ section of the Financial Review (page 46).
Where individual sensitivities are disclosed below, all other variables are held constant.
a) Market risk
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The following foreign 
exchange risk and interest rate risk analyses, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, are intended to illustrate the sensitivity 
to changes in market variables, being primarily the US dollar to sterling and euro to sterling exchange rates and UK interest rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analyses:
•	 changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the 
Consolidated Income Statement 
•	changes in the carrying value of other financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the Consolidated Income Statement.
i) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates in a number of international territories. Each business undertakes a large proportion of its commercial transactions 
within its local market and in its local functional currency. Foreign exchange risk arises from a proportion of commercial transactions 
undertaken in currencies other than the local functional currency, from financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than 
the local functional currency and on the Group’s investments in foreign operations.
Group policy is for each business to undertake commercial transactions in its own functional currency whenever possible. When this is not 
possible, the Group manages its foreign exchange risk from future commercial transactions using appropriate derivative contracts arranged 
via Group Treasury. Cash flows are reviewed on a monthly basis throughout the duration of projects and the future cover amended as 
appropriate.
Trade receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency arise from commercial transactions and 
are therefore largely hedged as part of the process described above. Remaining financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies 
other than the local functional currency include bank accounts, loans and intercompany funding balances. These are generally unhedged, 
with the exception of balances that are themselves designated as hedging instruments used to hedge the Group’s investments in foreign 
operations. 168 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued
The Group’s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk on unhedged financial instruments arises mainly in respect of movements between 
the US dollar (including dollar pegged currencies) and sterling and between the euro and sterling. 
At 31 March 2015, if sterling had strengthened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the US dollar, post-tax profit for the year 
would have been higher by approximately £0.4m (2014: £0.3m lower) and equity would have been £0.4m higher (2014: £0.3m lower). 
If sterling had weakened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the US dollar, post-tax profit for the year would have been lower 
by approximately £0.5m (2014: £0.4m higher) and equity would have been £0.5m lower (2014: £0.4m higher).
At 31 March 2015, if sterling had strengthened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the euro, post-tax profit for the year would 
have been lower by approximately £0.4m (2014: £0.7m) and equity would have been £0.4m lower (2014: £0.7m). If sterling had weakened 
by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the euro, post-tax profit for the year would have been higher by approximately £0.5m 
(2014: £0.8m) and equity would have been £0.5m higher (2014: £0.8m).
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. A proportion 
of the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations is managed through borrowings denominated in the 
relevant foreign currencies. 
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which 
are all interest bearing, offset in part by interest bearing bank loans. The majority of these items are at floating rates of interest or fixed 
deposits for periods of less than six months; changes in the interest rate results in changes in interest-related cash flows. No interest hedging 
is currently undertaken by the Group or its subsidiaries. If interest rates for the year to 31 March 2015 had been 10 basis points higher/lower, 
post-tax profit for the year would have been approximately £0.2m (2014: £0.1m) higher/lower.
iii) Price risk 
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts the profitability of the Group.
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the Group and classified on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. To manage this risk, the Group diversifies its portfolio. Diversification of the 
portfolio is done in accordance with limits set by the Group. 
Management monitors exposures to price risk on an ongoing basis.
The Group is not materially exposed to commodity price risk. Certain longer term project and framework contracts include indexation clauses 
that are applied to unit rates to offset the effect of inflation on input costs over the duration of the agreement. The Group is exposed to 
price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used and forecast project outcomes that form the basis of revenue recognition 
include an estimate of this risk where it is present. 
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will suffer financial loss as a result of counterparties defaulting on their contractual obligations. 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well  
as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions, with the maximum exposure to the risk 
equivalent to 100% of the carrying value disclosed in the Group’s Balance Sheet at 31 March. The Group does not hold any collateral as 
security. The Group’s policy is that cash and investments should not be concentrated with any one counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, concentration of credit risk is very limited due to the Group’s broad customer base. An assessment of 
credit quality of the customer is made where appropriate using a combination of external rating agencies, past experience and other factors. 
In circumstances where credit information is unavailable or poor, the risk is mitigated primarily by the use of advance payments resulting 
in positive cash flows. Exposure and payment performance are monitored closely both at individual project and client level, with a series 
of escalating debt recovery actions taken where necessary. In view of current economic circumstances, additional management attention 
remains focused on the recovery of debtors. There is no recent history of default.
c) Liquidity risk 
The Group funds its activities through cash generated from its operations and, where necessary, borrowings and finance leases. The Group’s 
borrowing facilities include bank facilities and private placement debt. Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the 
Group and aggregated by a central finance department (Group Finance). Group Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity 
requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities (note 26) at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its 
borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans and covenant compliance. 
Any surplus cash is invested by Group Treasury in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits and money market deposits, choosing 
instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the forecasts mentioned 
above. Financial Statements 169

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders and through its borrowing facilities. 
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of its net debt plus net defined benefit pension deficit net of total deferred tax to 
underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA). This policy is unchanged from the prior year.
The ratios of net debt plus net defined benefit pension deficit net of total deferred tax to underlying EBITDA as at 31 March 2015 and 2014 
were as follows:

Fair value estimation
The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been 
defined as follows:
•	quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)
•	 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) 
or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2)
•	inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2015 and 2014.

There have been no changes to the classification of the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value between Level 1, Level 2 and 
Level 3 at 31 March 2015 or 2014.
Level 1 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the Balance Sheet date. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service 
or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted 
market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the mid market price.
Level 2 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on estimates. If all significant inputs 
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. The fair value of certificates of deposit is calculated 
as the present value of the future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate market rate of interest. The fair value of forward foreign exchange 
contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.  Financial Statements 173

Level 3 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments for an asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 
are Level 3 financial instruments.  
Level 3 valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs
The main Level 3 inputs used by the Group in estimating the contingent consideration payment are based on revenue and operating profit 
targets for the first three years from acquisition, followed by operating margin growth levels for the next two years. The Group prepares 
detailed forecasts on the acquisition of a business and updates these on a quarterly basis as part of its normal operating processes. These 
forecasts use management’s evaluation of the revenue, costs and expected margins, based on past experience. The fair value of the 
contingent consideration arrangement of £2.5m was calculated at the acquisition date by estimating probable future cash flows payable 
and discounting these at a discount rate of 9.3%. 
Level 3 inter-relationship between significant unobservable inputs and fair value measurement
The estimated fair value of the Level 3 financial instrument would increase if there was a change in either the annual revenue, annual 
operating profit or the risk-adjusted discount rate. 
Level 3 sensitivity analysis
A reasonable possible change to annual revenue and annual operating profit of 5% and a change of 100bps to the discount rate, holding 
other inputs constant, would not result in a significant change in the fair value.

The derivatives hedge highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency. The gains and losses recognised in the hedging
reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 March 2015 will be recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in 
the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity derivative is more than 
12 months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the derivative is less than 12 months. Financial Statements 177

All of the Group’s undrawn committed borrowing facilities will be subject to floating rates of interest.
On 30 January 2015 the Group amended and extended its five year revolving credit facility (RCF). This facility matures in January 2020. This 
arrangement provides the Group with a committed credit facility of £200m. This facility provides the Group with increased and longer-term 
financial capacity to support its strategy. The total letters of credit in issue under the committed facility at 31 March 2015 were £0.9m 
(31 March 2014: £3.3m).
The facility includes the following lenders: Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Barclays Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc, 
National Westminster Bank plc, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Abbey National Treasury Services plc and United Overseas Bank Limited.
The Group’s borrowing facilities include a number of undertakings and financial covenants. Compliance with these covenants is monitored. 
As at 31 March 2015, and since, there have been no breaches (2014: none). 
In the financial year ended 31 March 2013, the Group raised US$75m through the successful execution of its debut issue in the US private 
placement market. The proceeds were used to repay drawn funds under the Group’s existing banking facilities. The private placement is due 
for repayment on 31 May 2019 and carries a nominal interest rate of 4.38%.

a) Net retirement benefit liabilities
The Group, through trustees, operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. 
Defined contribution schemes are those where the Group’s obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the 
scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Defined benefit schemes are schemes other than defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligation is to provide specified benefits 
on retirement.
The two main defined benefit schemes are the Atkins Pension Plan (the Plan) and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded 
final salary schemes. The assets of both schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds. Other pension schemes include the Atkins 
McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, which is a final salary funded defined benefit scheme, Terramar AS Pension Plan in Norway, 
and a range of defined contribution schemes or equivalent. 
The schemes operate under trust law and are managed and administered by trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the 
terms of the trust deed and rules and relevant legislation. Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, 
after taking actuarial advice. The trustees are responsible for establishing the investment strategy and ensuring that there are sufficient 
assets to meet the cost of current and future benefits.
The Plan is closed to the future accrual of benefit; all defined benefit members of the Plan were transferred to a defined contribution section 
for future service where it was clear they did not benefit from a statutory or contractual right to a final salary pension. 
The Railways Pension Scheme invests in a range of pooled investment funds intended to generate a combination of capital growth and 
income and as determined by the trustee, taking account of the characteristics of the obligations and the trustee’s attitude to risk. The 
majority of the Railways Pension Scheme’s assets that are intended to generate additional returns, over the rate at which the obligations are 
expected to grow, are invested in a single pooled “growth” fund. This fund is invested in a wide range of asset classes and the fund manager 
RPMI has the discretion to vary the asset allocation to reflect its views on the relative attractiveness of different asset classes at any time. 
The remaining assets in the Railways Pension Scheme are principally fixed and index-linked bonds. 
The Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits for members who do not benefit from a statutory or contractual 
right to a final salary pension on 31 March 2009. These members transferred to the Personal Retirement Savings Accounts – Ireland (PRSA 
– Irish Life) scheme with effect from 1 April 2009. 
The Terramar AS Pension Plan was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2009. It is a funded pension scheme and is managed by DNB 
(Norway’s largest financial services group). In order to obtain full pension entitlements, the scheme participants are required to complete 
30 years of pensionable service prior to them obtaining the right to a life-long retirement pension corresponding to the difference between 
66% of the employee’s salary at retirement and estimated benefits from the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. Economic and actuarial 
assumptions comply with prevailing technical recommendations in Norway. 
The defined benefit sections of all pension schemes are mostly closed to new entrants, who are offered membership of the defined 
contribution section. Financial Statements 183

The actuarial tables used to calculate the retirement benefit liabilities for the Plan were the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS) 
tables, with medium cohort improvements from 2002 to 2009 and a scaling factor of 0.85/0.90 for males/females respectively. Future 
improvements are based on Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) improvements with a 1.5% per annum improvement trend, based 
on year of use application. The Railways Pension Scheme results have been adjusted on an approximate basis to be based on the same 
mortality tables. 184 Financial Statements

The Group completed its last triennial valuation as at 31 March 2013 of the Atkins Pension Plan and is therefore due to complete its next 
triennial valuation as at 31 March 2016. The Group considers that the contribution rates set at the recent valuation date are sufficient to 
eliminate the deficit over the agreed period.
The nature of the funding regime in the UK creates uncertainty around the size and timing of cash that the Company will be required to 
pay to the pension schemes.
The Group agreed a new repayment plan that ends in March 2025. One-off payments of £32m were made for the years ended 
31 March 2014 and 31 March 2015. Payments for the year ending 31 March 2016 and onwards will escalate by 2.5% per annum from 
the £32m level.
The Group expects employer contributions to be paid during the financial year to 31 March 2016 to be around £35.8m, of which £32.8m 
is in relation to the funding of the actuarial deficit, and employee contributions paid to be around £1.5m. Expected benefit payments made 
directly by the Group to pensioners in the financial year to 31 March 2016 are £nil. Financial Statements 189

The approximate effect on the liabilities from changes in the main assumptions used to value the liabilities are as follows:
Change in assumption  Effect on plan liabilities
Atkins Pension Plan Railways Pension Scheme
 Discount rate increase/decrease 0.5% decrease/increase 10.0% decrease/increase 8.5%
 Inflation increase/decrease 0.5% increase/decrease 5.0% increase/decrease 8.5%
 Real rate of increase in salaries increase/decrease 0.5% increase/decrease 2.0% increase/decrease 1.5%
 Longevity increase 1 year increase 3.0% increase 2.0%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this 
is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit 
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised 
within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period. 
The effect of the change in inflation on liabilities assumes a corresponding change in salary increases and inflation-related pension increases.  
b) Other post-employment benefit liabilities
The Group operates unfunded schemes within certain of its non-UK businesses, including gratuity schemes, Key Employee Supplemental 
Option Plans (KESOP) and post-retirement medical benefit schemes.
Members of the gratuity schemes are entitled to receive a cash gratuity on leaving the business which is dependent on their length of 
employment and final salary. Valuation of the gratuity obligation is carried out in line with the principles of IAS 19, Employee benefits. 
The Group operates a KESOP providing some key officers and employees in its North American business (the business) with post-retirement 
benefits, known as the Supplemental Income Program (SIP). The SIP is an unfunded plan that provides participants with retirement income 
for a specified period of between 5 and 15 years upon retirement, death or disability. The plan fixes a minimum level for retirement benefits 
to be paid to participants based on the participant’s position in the business, their age and length of service at retirement. Additionally, 
certain executive agreements have been amended to provide post-retirement medical benefits to those employees and their spouses, at 
a level substantially similar to those medical and hospitalisation benefits paid and provided to senior executives currently employed by the 
business. The insurance benefits will be provided without any further or additional services from the employee to the business and they 
will be paid for and provided for as long as the employee and their spouse shall live.

c) Post-employment benefit liabilities – risks
Through its defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit liabilities, the Group is exposed to a number of investment 
and actuarial risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility 
The retirement benefit plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If plan assets under 
perform this yield, this will create a deficit. Both the UK and Irish plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to 
outperform corporate bonds in the long term while exposing the Group to greater volatility and valuation risk in the short term. The 
government bonds represent investments in UK Government securities only. 
Life expectancy
The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the plans’ liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK and Irish plans, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity 
to changes in life expectancy. The Atkins Pension Plan has had interest and inflation rate hedging in place for some time, but due to the 
relative immaturity of the longevity hedging market, to date the Group has held off implementing a longevity hedging programme. 
As a consequence, the Plan remains fully exposed to any future improvements in mortality beyond those already assumed by the Actuary. 
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ 
bond holdings.
Inflation risk
Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, 
caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation). Whilst some of the Plan’s assets are real 
in nature and so loosely correlated with inflation (e.g. equities, index-linked gilts), some of the Plan’s assets are not expected to move in line 
with inflation (e.g. fixed-interest gilts). Therefore an increase in inflation is likely to also increase the deficit.
The Group does not use derivatives or hedging, other than interest and inflation rate hedging, to manage its risk. Investments are well 
diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A large portion of 
assets in 2015 consists of equities and bonds, although the Group also invests in property, cash and investment (hedge) funds. The Group 
believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk. The majority of equities are in a globally 
diversified portfolio of international blue chip entities. A breakdown of the major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan 
assets for the two UK schemes is detailed above.

Proportion relating to pensioners 36.0 39.0 48.0 47.0
Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 20 years (2014: 20 years) for the Atkins Pension Plan, 16 years  
(2014: 16 years) for the Railways Pension Scheme, between 25 and 30 years (2014: between 25 and 30 years) for the McCarthy Pension  
Plan and between 25 and 35 years for the Terramar AS Pension Plan. 
Expected future benefit payments from the Atkins Pension Plan are mostly in respect of pension payments that are either linked to price 
inflation or receive fixed pension increases. These projected benefit payments are expected to be made from the Plan over the next  
80 or so years. The payments are expected to rise over the next 30 years, when they will peak, before beginning to decline. 
The Group expects pension benefits to be paid by the schemes during the financial year to 31 March 2016 to be approximately £45.6m.

Long Term Incentive Plans
WS Atkins plc Long-term Growth Unit plan (LGU) August 2012 onwards
A share plan for senior executives where units are granted at a base price which is based on the six month average share price calculated 
at the date of grant. The vesting of units occurs in three equal tranches on the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of the date of grant. 
Vesting is subject to the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of the Group’s progress against its strategy. 
On exercise, the value of each Unit is equal to the increase, if any, in the average share price of one notional Company share between the 
grant date and the exercise date. Any such gain will normally be calculated using the six month average share price. Any gain on exercise 
will usually be settled in equity except in the US, where awards are granted as market value options and are scaled back on exercise to be 
equivalent in value to the gain that would have been received under a non-US award. No more than 50% of a participant’s total number 
of units subject to a single grant may be exercised in any 12 month rolling period. 
As a general rule, units granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves 
as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro rata entitlement.
WS Atkins plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) August 2012 onwards
A share plan for senior executives used to grant awards that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash. Subject to the 
Company’s growth in diluted EPS over the performance period. Full vesting is triggered if the EPS growth in the three-year performance 
period is 12% per annum or higher. If the increase is less than 5% per annum, there will be no vesting. If the increase is 5% per annum, 
vesting will be at 25%, and a sliding scale operates between 5% and 12% per annum EPS growth.
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves 
as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro rata entitlement. 
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following grant, without interest.  
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2006 to July 2011
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. Different performance targets were used for different categories of management. Grants made to executive directors 
and senior employees had 50% of the grant subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to the constituents 
of the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts) at the start of the performance period. Full vesting of this portion of the grant took place 
if the Company was ranked in the upper quartile and 30% vesting was achieved with a median ranking, with pro rata vesting for intermediate 
performance. No vesting occurred for a ranking below median.
The remaining 50% of grants made to executive directors and senior employees was subject to the Company’s real growth in underlying 
EPS over the performance period. Full vesting was triggered if the increase in real EPS growth above UK RPI in the three-year performance 
period was 10% per annum or higher. If the increase above UK RPI was less than 4% per annum, there was no vesting. If the increase was 
4% per annum above RPI, vesting was at 30%, and a sliding scale operated between 4% and 10% per annum. All awards have now vested.
Awards granted to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition. As a general rule, awards granted to participants who left 
employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant left as a result of a qualifying reason, they received a pro rata 
entitlement. All awards have now vested.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following grant without interest.  Financial Statements 193

Deferred Share Plans
Atkins Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. There was no performance condition but awards were restricted for at least three years from the date of grant.  
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who left employment prior to vesting were forfeited. In the event a participant left 
as a result of a qualifying reason, they received their award in full. Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit 
of dividends declared following grant without interest. All awards have now vested.
Atkins Deferred Share Plan (DSP) 
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or in cash. There is no 
performance condition but awards are restricted for a set period from the date of grant, fixed by the Remuneration Committee at grant.  
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they will receive their award in full. Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of 
dividends declared following grant without interest. Awards granted to executive directors in relation to the Executive Bonus Scheme are 
restricted for three years from the date of grant.

1  During the last financial year, it was discovered that one LGU participant had left on 29 March 2013 which resulted in 21,339 units being forfeited. The units 
outstanding as at 1 April 2013 have been amended accordingly.
2   A correction of an administrative error has been made in relation to awards granted under the LGU on 24 June 2013. The award levels were originally determined 
with reference to a five month average share price instead of the approved six month average share price. The number of units shown as granted in the year ended  
31 March 2014 has been restated in the above table to reflect the amended award levels based on the six-month average share price.
    
The weighted average exercise price of LGU awards is calculated by reference to both non-US awards, where the increase in value is delivered 
in the form of a nil cost option, and US awards, where the awards take the form of market value options.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 1,337.64 pence (2014: 1,100.14 pence). 194 Financial Statements

35 Contingent liabilities 
The Group has given indemnities in respect of performance and contractual related bonds, as well as letters of credit issued on its behalf.  
The amount outstanding at 31 March 2015 includes £0.9m letters of credit issued as a result of the acquisition of PBSJ (2014: £3.3m).
During the year ended 31 March 2011, the Group acquired PBSJ (The Company). Prior to the acquisition, the Audit Committee of the Board 
of directors of PBSJ undertook an internal investigation to determine whether any laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), 
had been violated in connection with certain projects undertaken by PBS&J International, Inc. (one of PBSJ’s subsidiary undertakings). The 
investigation suggested that FCPA violations may have occurred but did not extend beyond the international operation and that none of 
PBSJ’s executive management were involved in criminal conduct. PBSJ voluntarily disclosed this matter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
and to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and cooperated fully with their review. The DOJ has closed its inquiry into this matter 
without taking further action, citing the Company’s thorough investigation, prompt disclosure and cooperation. The Company has also 
resolved the SEC’s investigation and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement pursuant to which the Company has agreed, among 
other things, to pay a settlement amount of approximately US$3.4 million, comprising project profit, interest and civil penalties.
Group companies are from time to time involved in claims and litigation. The Group carries Professional Indemnity insurance cover for 
such claims.
36 Operating lease arrangements 
The Group leases various offices under operating lease arrangements. The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. 
The Group also leases vehicles, plant and equipment under operating lease arrangements.

Giving your shares to charity
If you only have a small number of shares

independent share donation scheme. 
The relevant share transfer form can be 
obtained from the registrar. ShareGift 
is administered by The Orr Mackintosh 
Foundation Limited, registered charity 
number 1052686. Further information

or from www.sharegift.org.
Identity theft
Identity theft is on the increase. Criminals 
may steal your personal information, 
putting your Atkins shareholding at risk.
Tips for protecting your Atkins shares:
•	 ensure all your certificates are kept 
in a safe place or hold your shares 
electronically in CREST via a nominee
•	 keep all correspondence from the 
registrar that shows your shareholder 
reference number in a safe place, 
or destroy your correspondence by 
shredding it
•	 if you change address inform the 
registrar in writing or via our share 
portal at www.myatkinsshares.com
•	 know when dividends are paid and 
consider having your dividend paid 
directly into your bank account. This 
will reduce the risk of the cheque being 
intercepted or lost in the post. If you 
change your bank account, inform 
the registrar of the details of your new 
account. You can do this by post or 
online using our share portal at  
www.myatkinsshares.com. Respond 
to any letters the registrar sends you 
about this
•	 if you receive a letter from the registrar 
regarding a change of address or 
a dividend instruction but have not 
recently moved or requested a change 
to how you receive your dividends 
please contact them immediately as you 
may have been a victim of identity theft
•	 if you are buying or selling shares only 
deal with brokers registered in your 
country of residence or the UK.
Share fraud warning
Remember: if it sounds too good  
to be true, it probably is.
You should be very wary of any 
unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a discount or offers of free company 
reports.
In recent years, many companies have 
become aware that their shareholders 
have received unsolicited telephone calls 
or correspondence concerning investment 
matters. These are typically from overseas 
based ‘brokers’ working in ‘boiler rooms’ 
who target UK shareholders, offering 
to sell them what often turn out to be 
worthless or high risk shares in US or UK 
investments. These brokers can be very 
persistent, extremely persuasive and use 
sophisticated means to approach and 
convince investors. The Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) has found that even 
experienced investors have been caught 
out by share fraud. It was also discovered 
that, on average, victims of boiler rooms 
lose an average of £20,000 to these 
scams, with as much as £200 million 
being lost in the UK each year.
If you receive any unsolicited investment 
advice, you should follow the steps below:
•	 avoid getting into a conversation, 
note the name of the person and firm 
contacting you and then end the call
•	 check that they are properly authorised 
by the FCA before getting involved 
via its register: www.fca.org.uk or 
call 0800 111 6768
•	 search the list of unauthorised firms 
to avoid: www.fca.org.uk/scams
•	 think about getting independent 
financial and professional advice before 
you hand over any money.
Details of any share dealing facilities that 
the Company endorses will be included 
in Company mailings.
Protecting your investment 
We strongly advise you to deal only with 
financial services firms that are authorised 
by the FCA. Keep in mind that authorised 
firms are unlikely to contact you out of  
the blue with an offer to buy or sell 
shares. If you deal with an unauthorised 
firm, you would not be eligible to receive 
payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. 
For more information visit the FCA 
website: www.fca.org.uk/consumers/
scams or read the FCA Beware of share 
fraud leaflet.
Reporting a scam
If you are approached about an 
investment scam, contact the FCA 
using the share fraud reporting form: 
www.fca.org.uk/scams. You can also 
call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 
0800 111 6768. Reporting unauthorised 
organisations who are targeting, or have 
targeted, UK investors, means the FCA 
can maintain an up to date list and 
appropriate action can be considered.
If you have already paid money to share 
fraudsters you should contact Action 
Fraud, the UK’s national reporting 
centre for fraud and internet crime, on 
0300 123 2040. The service is run by the 
City of London Police working alongside 
the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. Investor Information 205

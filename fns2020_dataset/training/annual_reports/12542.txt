Annual Report and Accounts 2007
02
As Acting Chairman I am pleased to report that our results this year are
once again excellent—with strong growth ahead of the market. We
undertook one major acquisition during the year—of Scirex LLC in July
2006—which is reported more fully elsewhere but its beneficial effect
on our business has been enormous. Notwithstanding, it is very
satisfying to report that the existing business also grew organically 
by 20.7% almost double the generally accepted rate of growth 
for the market.
Our financial performance, including the contribution made by the
Scirex acquisition completed in July 2006, was strong with revenues
having grown during the period by 154% to £41.8m from the previous
year of £16.5m. EBITDA (including a £0.2 million non-cash charge for
share based payments) up by 108% to £9.8m (2006: £4.7m) and profit
before tax of £4.3m, up from £2.1m in 2006, despite suffering from
adverse currency exchange effects as over 95% of the revenue is in
either US dollars or Euros.
Strong order intake was maintained with a book-to-bill ratio at the 
year end of greater than one, indicating the consistent growth of the
order book.This indicator of future sales visibility is increasingly
important and what gives even greater comfort to the Board is 
current year trading with revenues on a like-for-like basis significantly 
in excess of the prior period.
The Group reported an effective tax rate of 21% as the result of a
Corporation Tax deduction under the provisions of Schedule 23 of the
Finance Act 2003.This tax deduction arose from the exercise of share
options and the benefit whilst carrying over into next year, is not
expected to be repeated.
For the last two years we have decided against declaring any dividends,
believing that shareholder interests would be best served by having the
cash reinvested into the business and rewarding shareholders with
capital growth. Our current share price bears testament to this
approach. However, as the business matures on to a different level and
as highlighted at the half year the Board feel it is now time to
commence a programme of dividend payments and we are therefore
recommending the payment of a maiden dividend of 0.5p per ordinary
share. It is the Board’s intention to pay a similar dividend at the interim
stage for the current year and thereafter to adopt a progressive
dividend policy.
As highlighted in our trading statement earlier this year, we have
established an operating board.The rationale for this was that going
forward, the focus for the Group would be twofold: accelerating organic
growth and identifying and executing synergistic acquisitions.This
board is now in place and has already had a positive effect on day-to-
day management of the business, allowing the main Board to focus on
the longer term strategic development of the Group, including the
pursuit of earnings enhancing acquisitions.
Further strengthening this strategy, I am pleased to welcome two new
Board members, Dr Troy McCall as Chief Operating Officer and Peter
Kyle as CFO.Troy was appointed to this role on the operating board and
now steps up to the main Board in the same role. Peter, previously
financial controller, takes over from Bernard Gallagher, the current 
CFO. Bernard has increasingly taken on more responsibility in the
strategic development of Premier Research and will become Chief
Development Officer.
Our results this year are 
once again excellent – 
with strong organic growth
ahead of the market

Guy Patrick, Chief Medical Officer and a founder of the Company, has
become less involved in executive duties as the Company has grown.
He has now resigned as a director in order to pursue other interests but
he will continue to provide his services to the Company on a
consultancy basis, as necessary, to ensure the smooth transition of
responsibilities and customer relationships.
With the appointment of these additional Board members and
recognising the increasing number of key senior executives within the
Group, the Board intends to introduce a new long term incentive plan
for such employees.The plan will be discussed with major shareholders
before any proposals are put forward.
In addition to the executive appointments discussed above, the
Company is actively pursuing the appointment of a new non-executive
Chairman and an additional non-executive director, who will chair the
Audit Committee, to balance the composition of the Board.
The outlook for 2007 for the business remains highly encouraging. With
the strong order intake which we experienced toward the end of 2006
continuing into the current year, the Board is confident that Premier
Research is in excellent shape and that it operates in an exciting and
growing market. We have a strong team in place, strengthened by the
management changes announced over the last few months, and are
now ideally positioned to take full advantage of growth opportunities
during the next year and beyond.
That this has been a very successful year for the Group cannot be in
doubt. However, we must always remember that good financial results
do not happen by themselves: they are the culmination of a
tremendous amount of hard work and dedication by all our employees.
On behalf of the Board and the shareholders, I would like to thank them
all for their significant contribution.
Last year, the Group anticipated continued growth based on its buy-
and-build strategy to which it had been committed from the start. I can
but echo those sentiments and look forward to a continuation of the
strategy which has served your Group so well in the past.

Premier Research
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
04
Overview
Premier Research has again put in another extremely strong performance
for the period. I am therefore delighted to report a further 12 months of
sustained organic growth complemented by the US acquisition of Scirex,
in July 2006, our largest to date, and highly strategic in further accessing
the important US market.
Of important note, and an illustration of how Premier Research has
evolved since becoming a public company, is the announcement that we
will be paying our first dividend.This factor in itself demonstrates that as a
business we are coming of age and as such are moving away from a
perceived emerging business model to a company with a sustainable and
growing financial model that can facilitate potential funding requirements
by a mixture of both equity and debt.
Operational Review
Our continued focus as a leading international pharmaceutical services
group has been on sustainable growth and improving our ability to 
win and deliver higher value, multi-national projects.This year has 
seen us further deliver on these goals with turnover increasing by 
over 154% and continued strong demand for our services from new 
and existing international customers, with an increased emphasis on
larger value contracts.
We now have over 170 customers, and have over the period signed 7
preferred provider agreements allowing us greater certainty of repeat
business with those customers. It is also important to note that we are
currently working with 15 of the world's top 20 pharma and biotech
companies and with these contracts there is now a greater emphasis on
winning the more lucrative Phase III work.
Importantly, and to mitigate potential risk, we have ensured that there is
no customer or project concentration by having a well spread business
with over 240 current projects across more than 170 customers, giving
protection against individual project delays.
In 2006 the Group saw strong organic growth from the core business and
the benefits from the Scirex integration process have exceeded
management's expectations.
Scirex
Scirex was acquired in July 2006. It was the seventh acquisition for the
Group and our largest to date. It is a full service CRO that specialises in
providing outsourced clinical services to the global biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries.The company is headquartered in Philadelphia,
USA, and has ten offices located across the US, as well as London (UK) 
and Krakow (Poland). Scirex offers expertise, experience and technology
necessary to develop drugs from Phase I to Phase IV and is working in 
the same therapeutic areas as Premier Research, particularly in central
nervous system disorders. Importantly, Scirex has provided a strategic
footprint for Premier Research to access doctors and patients within 
the important US market.
Post Acquisition Integration
The integration of Scirex went extremely well being completed within
one month of acquisition and below budget, by at least £100,000.This
demonstrated management's prudent and skilled approach to acquisition
integration.That the integration of the largest acquisition to date in one
key territory can be completed quickly and efficiently serves as a huge
endorsement to the ability of the Board and key management to
integrate acquisitions into the core business.We have maintained our
track record of not losing any customers from an acquired company 
or indeed from our core business. Importantly, since the completion 
of the acquisition, we have been awarded repeat business from a 
number of legacy customers and we have continued to be successful in
attracting new customers to the enlarged Group, with the winning of
several new significant global contracts on both sides of the Atlantic 
and a substantial number of Phase III projects in the sales pipeline.The
Group strongly believes that the Scirex acquisition and the skill base 
that it has brought to the Group is a significant contributing factor to
recent increases in sales opportunities.
The successful completion and integration of this acquisition proved
earnings enhancing to the Group in the year. It will contribute greatly to
our continued growth as it strengthens our business model and will
enhance our service offering amongst our customer base.
Our continued focus as a leading
international pharmaceutical
services group has been on
sustainable growth and improving
our ability to win and deliver high
value, multi-national projects

Service Offering & Sales
Our continued focus remains on three of the highest growth areas in
drug development (oncology, central nervous system and anti-infectives)
together with our underlying expertise in paediatrics, a specialised area
with strong regulatory drivers. However, as Premier Research continues 
its expansion as a leading international pharmaceutical services player,
new areas of development within cardiovascular and respiratory 
may be targeted.
Our expertise across consultancy, clinical study delivery, data management
and final medical reporting, continues to provide us with an extremely
robust business model and an infrastructure which boasts over 750
employees in 31 countries.This, together with a powerful reputation
amongst our peer group, continues to provide the kudos to compete for
higher value contracts; a trend which we are focused on maintaining, and
indeed increasing, over time.
Our diverse and highly credible customer base now comprises over 170
customers.With no contract accounting for more than 15% of revenues in
any one year, this continues to provide us with recurring business,
endorsing the excellent service delivery we provide.
Outsourcing Market
The outsourcing market continues to be buoyant and the requirement for
outsourced clinical research services continues to grow with the
improved quality, reliability, safety, efficiency and controls associated with
outsourcing trials. All the indicators point to this continuing for the longer
term. Importantly, Premier Research's positioning within this growing
market will allow the Company to exploit the significant opportunities
which arise.
Current Trading
I am delighted to report that we have had a very strong start to the new
financial year.The continued growth of our sales pipeline with more than
£131m outstanding proposals with customers provide us with further
encouragement of sustaining this aggressive growth strategy. Of
particular note is that we are now seeing the highest proportion to
date of the Phase III contract work and in particular, within the last two
months, Phase III paediatric contract work.
Summary & Outlook
These exceptional results for the year are a true reflection of the quality
and motivation of Premier Research's operational and sales teams across
both the US and International territories combined with the continued
focus on winning new business and driving organic growth.
It is also important to note that our business model of focusing on three
of the highest growth areas in drug development continues to provide us
with a unique proposition to customers and this is truly visible in the
significant contract wins we have achieved whilst competing with larger
generic CRO players.
With current trading buoyant we move into the new financial year with
confidence. Our focus remains on both stimulating and accelerating
organic growth and seeking out earnings enhancing synergistic
acquisitions. A key focus will also be on continuing to bring further scale
to the business by moving larger and more lucrative contracts through
our sales pipeline.
In closing, I would again like to reiterate my thanks to all our staff for their
commitment, to our new employees who joined us from Scirex and to
our shareholders for their continued support.

Results
The results for the year under review include seven months of trading
from the Scirex group, our largest acquisition to date.The acquisition
and subsequent integration of Scirex, combined with continued strong
organic growth from our core business has enabled the Group to
report on a financial performance that is characterised by growth in all
key financial metrics.
Turnover for the year ended 31 January 2007 increased by 154% to
£41.8m and as a result EBITDA increased by 108% to £9.8m. EBITDA
represents earnings before costs of restructuring, amortisation,
depreciation, taxation and interest and is stated after the inclusion 
of a charge of £0.2m following the first time adoption of FRS20,
Share based payment.
The costs of restructuring were those costs incurred following the
acquisition and subsequent integration of Scirex into the Group.
Despite this being the Group’s largest acquisition to date the
restructuring and assimilation into the Premier Research operating
model was, as for all prior acquisitions, implemented and concluded
swiftly after the transaction was completed.This model of rapid
integration enabled the Group to benefit from the synergies arising
from the transaction in the year of the acquisition and kept the
restructuring costs £0.1m below those anticipated.
Interest paid during the year was £1.1m.The increase on last year
reflects the impact of the loan financing used for the prior year and
current year acqusitions.
The Group tax charge to the profit and loss account for the year was
£0.9m, giving an effective rate of tax of 21% following the application of
relief available under Schedule 23 of the Finance Act 2003, the benefit
of which is expected to carry over into next year.
Increases in turnover and EBITDA combined with lower than
anticipated restructuring costs and a low effective rate of tax resulted 
in a 142% increase in retained profits to £3.4m and a 93% increase in
earnings per share to 6.01p.
Maiden Dividend
As evidence of the Group’s sound financial footing and future prospects
the directors believe it is appropriate to pay a maiden divdend. As 
such the Group will seek approval at its Annual General Meeting 
for its maiden dividend of 0.5p per share resulting in a dividend
payment of £0.3m.
Balance Sheet and Working Capital
The Scirex acquisition and subsequent integration has transformed 
the Balance Sheet of the Group and brought our operational metrics
into line with those of the larger CRO’s with whom we now 
increasingly compete.
Goodwill has increased by £18.9m following the acquisition of Scirex
and Unbilled Services and Unearned Income have also increased
significantly to £7.7m and £4.2m respectively.
Our revenue recognition rules, as in prior years are consistent with 
IAS 18 Revenue. Following the acquisition of Scirex the type of 
projects we are now delivering will necessarily result in increased
amounts of working capital being categorised as Unbilled Services 
and Unearned Income.
The highly complementary Scirex acquisition has enabled the Group 
to bid for, win and deliver the larger Phase III trials.These trials require
greater patient recruitment numbers than the Phase II trials, which 
were the Group’s main source of income prior to the Scirex acquisition.
In fact 39% of 2007 sales are for Phase III projects up from 15% in the
prior year and of our current sales pipeline 57% are for Phase III
projects.This move to managing larger projects means Unbilled
Services and Unearned Income will become significant items on the
Group’s balance sheet, and are another indication of the maturing
nature of the Group’s operations.
The results for the year under
review include seven months of
trading from the Scirex group,
our largest acquisition to date
89031 Premier Research Front end.qxd  11/5/07  16:06  Page 6 Premier Research
Annual Report and Accounts 2007

There were two share placings in the year under review in respect of
our acquisitions, comprising 4.4m shares associated with the prior year
Imform acquisition and 5.2m shares associated with the Scirex
acquisition. In addition 2.2m shares were issued and allotted in respect
of deferred consideration for the Pharmdata acquisition.The exercise of
options under the Premier Research Group plc Enterprise Management
Incentives Share Option Scheme resulted in the issue and allotment of
a further 48,000 ordinary shares.
Treasury Policy
The acquisition of the Scirex Group has meant that a larger proportion
of revenues are earned in US dollars than in the past.The Group
however still is in a position where the cost base and revenues are
matched, in Sterling, Euros and US Dollar, and so are only susceptible to
exchange rate exposure on the translation of profits back to Sterling.
The Group therefore does not have a formal hedging policy but
regularly reviews exchange rates and the mix of business to monitor
the appropriateness of this policy. With current bank funding of up to
£21.5m, the Group has an exposure to significant increases in base rates
so has chosen to insure against interest rate rises in excess of 2% on its
term loan facilities.
International Financial Reporting Standard
These results have been reported under UK GAAP .The Group will be
adopting international accounting standards in 2008 and future results
will therefore be reported under IFRS.
Outlook
The continued focus on three of the highest growth areas in drug
development, and the high percentage of Phase III proposals and
project wins gives cause for high levels of confidence that the Group
can continue to deliver strong growth in 2008.This confidence is
supported by the number of outstanding proposals with customers
being at an all time high at more than £131m. In addition the
appointment of a Chief Development Officer signals the Group’s
intention to pursue further acquisition opportunities that can add
significant value to the Group.

Since its founding, Premier Research has
conducted hundreds of studies involving many
thousands of patients. The Group is currently
focused from a sales perspective on the world’s
key outsourcing markets, namely the USA and
Western Europe.
Central Nervous System
The second most important area of Premier Research’s therapeutic
focus is in the field of Central Nervous System (“CNS”) disorders and our
experience covers many different indications, including Migraine,
Epilepsy, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”), Anxiety,
Depression, Pain, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and 
Sexual Dysfunction.
CNS is one of the key areas of unmet needs in therapeutic terms, with
many compounds in the research pipeline and many millions of
sufferers. Premier Research’s expertise is focused on bringing these
compounds through the clinical development process as quickly and
efficiently as possible, while maximizing the value of the data and
information produced.
Premier Research is able to assist in designing the optimum clinical
development plan and implementing that plan in the most efficient
and cost-effective manner.

greater involvement by all employees. Formal and informal briefing of employees takes place as appropriate.
The Group takes all reasonable steps to ensure that employment conditions are equal in all respects for both men and women.

Health and Safety
The Group aims to provide and maintain a safe working environment for all its employees and visitors and seeks the involvement of its employees in
improving health and safety throughout its operations.The board keeps its health and safety policy under continuous review to take account of changes
in legislation, best practice and the working environment.
Environment
Given the nature of its activities, there is limited scope for the Group to have a major impact on environmental matters. Nevertheless, the directors are
mindful of their responsibilities in this regard and strive to seek opportunities where improvements may be made: it is likely that these will be
concentrated in areas of energy conservation and waste control.
Payment of commercial debts
The company’s policy, in relation to all of its suppliers, is to settle the terms of payment when agreeing the terms of each transaction provided always
that it is satisfied the supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.The company does not follow any
code or standard on payment practice but it is the company’s policy, unless otherwise negotiated, to pay all its suppliers within 30 days of the end of the
month in which it received the goods or services.
The number of days’ purchases (“creditor days”) outstanding for payment by the Group at the year end was 40 days (2006: 45 days).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at Buchanan Communications, 45 Moorfields, London EC2Y 9AE on Wednesday 13 June 2007, at 10.30 am.
The special business to be transacted at the AGM is:
Authority to allot shares
In accordance with current guidelines, the directors seek authority for a period of five years from the date of the Annual General Meeting to allot a
maximum of 20,037,328, relevant securities.This represents approximately one third of the aggregate current issued ordinary share capital. Further, in
order to retain some flexibility, the directors seek power to allot 6,011,198 equity securities wholly for cash other than on a pre-emptive basis to
current shareholders pro-rata to their existing holdings.This amount represents 10% of the issued ordinary share capital on the balance sheet at 31
January 2007. Resolutions covering the above matters appear as Items 6 and 7 in the Notice convening the AGM on page 42.

Report of the Directors
for the year ended 31 January 2007
Going concern
After making due enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditors
Hurst Morrison Thomson LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution for their re-appointment as auditors of the company
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
c Corporate governance
Whilst being AIM listed the company is not obliged to do so, the directors nevertheless seek to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code so far
as it is practicable and appropriate for a public company of its size and nature.
The directors believe the board is soundly constituted and, at this stage of the Group’s development, it is felt the functions of a Nomination committee
can be adequately fulfilled by deliberation of the full board: this will nevertheless be kept under review.
With at least six full board meetings spread realistically throughout the year, the board is well able to exercise control over the activities of the group.
There is a clear distinction between the role of the non-executive chairman in running the board and the chief executive in running the business.
The latter is obliged to comply with a schedule of matters requiring board approval before implementation: this schedule is reviewed by the board 
at least annually.
Throughout the year, Steve Harris was designated senior independent director.
The company maintains appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary.
The directors continue to develop relationships with the major shareholders through a series of regular one-to-one meetings.
During the year, the Audit committee comprised Geoffrey Forster (chairman) and Steve Harris. The chief financial officer and representatives of the
external auditors attended meetings by invitation as required.The committee normally meets at least three times each year and receives reports from
the company’s management and external auditors relating to the annual and interim accounts and the accounting and internal control systems
throughout the Group.The committee has direct and unrestricted access to the external auditors.
During the year, the Remuneration committee comprised Steve Harris (chairman) and Geoffrey Forster.The committee normally meets at least twice
each year.The principal duties of the committee are to review the scale and structure of the remuneration and service contracts for executive directors
and senior management.The committee also administers the company’s share option schemes.
The chairman of each of the Audit and Remuneration committees will be available to answer questions at the AGM: following the resignation of
Geoffrey Forster, Steve Harris will represent each committee.
The company secretary is secretary to both committees.
Internal controls
The Group has established processes and procedures for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group.The processes
have been embedded into the fabric of the Group and have been in place for the period under review and up to the date of approval of the annual
report and financial statements.The processes and procedures are regularly reviewed by the board.
The board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness.The role of management is to
implement board policies on risk and control.The system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure of the
achievement of business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
A process of control, self-assessment and hierarchical reporting has been established which provides for a documented and auditable trail of
accountability.These procedures are relevant across all Group operations: they provide for successive assurances to be given at increasingly higher levels
of management and, finally, to the board.

Report of the Directors
for the year ended 31 January 2007
The processes used by the board to review the effectiveness of the system of internal controls include the following:
• annual budgets are prepared for each operating business and compared with monthly management reporting, which focuses on actual
performance against these budgets;
• management reports and external audit reports on the system of internal controls and any material control weaknesses that are identified;
• discussions with management including discussions on the actions taken on problem areas identified by board members or in the external 
audit reports;
• policies and procedures for such matters as delegation of authorities, capital expenditure and treasury management as well as regular updates;
• review of the adequacy of the level of experienced and professional staff throughout the business and the expertise of individual staff members so
that they are capable of carrying out their individual delegated responsibilities; and 
• review of the external audit work plans.
The Group’s management operates a risk management process, which identifies the key risks facing each business.The process is based on each
business unit producing a risk register which identifies the potential key risks to the individual business unit, the impact should they occur and the action
being taken to sufficiently manage those risks.

annual fee. Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any of the company’s bonus or share option schemes.

individuals of the appropriate calibre, whilst at the same time not paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
Executive directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Remuneration committee.
The following comprised the principal elements of executive directors’ remuneration for the period under review:

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law in the United Kingdom requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and far view of
the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.The directors are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Financial information published on the website is based on
legislation in the United Kingdom governing the dissemination of financial statements that may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors in office at the date of approval of this directors’ report confirm so far as each is aware:
(i) that there is no relevant audit information which has not been provided to the auditors; and
(ii) that they have each taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any such relevant audit information and to establish
that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.

This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose.To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s
shareholders as a body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company is not disclosed.

Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test bass, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion

Notes to the Financial Statements
Year ended 31 January 2007
1. Accounting policies
The principal Group accounting policies are set out below and have been consistently applied in dealing with items which are considered material in
relation to the Group’s financial statements throughout the current year and the preceding year, except the Group has adopted the provisions of FRS 20
Share based payment.The adoption of this financial reporting standard has had no impact on the previous year’s reported numbers.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the accounting policies have been
consistently applied, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all Group undertakings at each financial period end.
Merger accounting is considered to be the appropriate method of accounting for the acquisition of Advanced Clinical Sciences Corporation Limited, as
this was a group reconstruction.The subsequent acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method and goodwill on consolidation is
capitalised and written off over twenty years from the year of acquisition.The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included in the profit and
loss account after or up to the date that control passes respectively. As a consolidated profit and loss account is published, a separate profit and loss
account for the parent company is omitted from the group financial statements by virtue of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover
The turnover represents the amount derived from the provision of services in the ordinary course of business, excluding value added tax.
Software development
Software development costs are charged against profits in the year in which they are incurred.
Goodwill
Positive purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised, classified as an asset on the Balance Sheet and amortised over its estimated useful life
up to a maximum of 20 years.This length of time is presumed to be the maximum useful life of purchased goodwill because it is difficult to make
projections beyond this period. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following each acquisition and subsequently
if circumstances emerge that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Amortisation
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Goodwill – over 20 years
Deferred Consideration
The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash, shares or other securities at a future
date, depends on uncertain future events such as the future performance of the acquired company.The amounts recognised in the financial statements
are the fair value of the consideration that is reasonably expected to be paid at the balance sheet date.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Freehold Property – over 50 years straight line
Leasehold Improvements – over the period of the lease
Motor Vehicles – 25% reducing balance
Computers and Equipment – 12.5% – 33% per annum straight line and reducing balance
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may
not be recoverable.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets and depreciated similarly to other
assets.The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase
contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Rental costs under operating leases are charged
against profits as incurred.
Pension costs
Retirement benefits to employees are provided by defined contribution schemes, which are funded by the company and group undertakings and
employees. Payments are made to pension trusts, which are financially separate from the company and group undertakings.These costs are charged
against profits as incurred.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Year ended 31 January 2007
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including directors). Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at
fair value at the date of grant.The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in equity, based upon the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula.The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. In
addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled transaction is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of the cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for
the transaction is recognised immediately. However, if a new transaction is substituted for the cancelled transaction, and designated as a replacement
transaction on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new transactions are treated as if they were a modification of the original transaction, as
described in the previous paragraph.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the company and group undertakings an obligation to
pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is
more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using rates of tax that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas
subsidiaries, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in group
undertakings are taken directly to reserves. All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.

The Group has not disclosed the breakdown of operating profit between continuing and acquired activities.This is because immediately after the
acquisition the activities acquired were integrated into the existing operational structure of the Group such that it is now not possible to separate the
operating profit and cash flows of each of the separate parts of the business.

23. Financial instruments
The Group purchases financial instruments in order to finance its operations and to manage the interest rate and currency risks that arise from those
operations and from its sources of finance. In addition, various balances, for example trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments arise
directly from the Group’s operations.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than currency risk disclosure.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.The Board reviews and agrees policies for
managing these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The interest rate exposure of the financial liabilities of the Group was:

£000 £000 £000

US dollars – 4,999 4,999
Euro – 1,738 1,738
113 11,256 11,369
Sterling bank loans bear interest at a range of rates between 1.5% and 2% above LIBOR.
The bank overdraft facility bears interest at a rate of 1.5% above the Lloyds TSB plc base rate.
The weighted average interest rate on finance leases for the period was 5.3% and the weighted average period which finance leases are over is 3 years.
In order to manage its exposure to overseas floating interest rate risk the interest charged on the US dollar and Euro loans are capped and collared as follows:
Euro loan has a cap of 4% and a floor of 2.15%, maturing on 30 April 2008.
The USD loan for US$9.0m has a cap of 6% and a floor of 3.85%, maturing on 30 April 2008.
The USD loan for US$18.9m has an interest rate cap of 5.5%, maturing on 2 February 2009.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain a mixture of short and medium term bank facilities to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements. Short term
flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
The facilities are subject to review as follows:
Overdraft – £2.5 million – next annual review due on 30 November 2007.
Five year – term loans: £1.5 million,K2.5 million, US$9.0 million and US$18.9m – next review due on 30 November 2007.
Ten year – term loan £0.7 million – next review due on 30 November 2007.
In addition to the above, the Group’s provisions of £415,000 for an onerous lease meet the definition of financial liabilities.These financial liabilities are
considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.This is because in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted and the discount
rate is re-appraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability.

this policy.

In the year ended 31 January 2006, options were granted on 22 December 2005.The estimated fair value of the options granted on this date was £0.95.
The Black-Scholes model has been adopted as the directors believe it provides a reasonable approximation to the fair values of the options concerned.
The inputs into the model were as follows:
2007 2006
Current share price 250p 142p
Expected life 3 yrs 3 yrs
Expected volatility 36.1% 43%
Risk-free rate 5.25% 4.75%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous year..The expected life used in the
model has been adjusted, based on the management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural
considerations.
Each tranche of share options was valued seperately using the actual exercise price.

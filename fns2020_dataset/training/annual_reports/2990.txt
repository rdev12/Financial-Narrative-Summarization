Consistency
in times of  
uncertainty
Our business was built on brave 
decisions. Our success has been  
the product of good timing and good 
judgement. The last 12 months have 
properly tested that formula.
However, we are confident that we  
have made further substantial progress 
in the pursuit of long-term value 
creation. The deal with Best Buy, the 
evolution of our retail proposition and 
the Big Box consumer electronics 
opportunity can transform the scale  
of our retail operations; in our telecoms 
business, the investments of the  
last five years are now beginning to  
pay back, with significant cash 
generation in the years to come.  
We will continue to focus on trying  
to make the right decisions rather  
than the quick decisions. 2 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

Chairman’s Statement
John Gildersleeve, Chairman
 “ ”
The Group’s performance  
has held up well in the  
tough trading conditions –  
a testament to the resilience  
of the model.
It has been a momentous year for the 
Group, as it has been for many enterprises 
worldwide, given the rapid deterioration in 
the global economy. Carphone Warehouse 
has not been immune to these pressures. 
Our customers have been feeling the 
pinch, our suppliers have become less 
profitable, and the currencies in which our 
assets and liabilities are denominated have 
been extremely volatile. However, where 
possible we have continued to focus on 
our long-term goals: to build market share, 
to remain relevant to customers and to 
offer excellent value in everything we do.
Group revenue for the period was down 
3% to £1,385m (2008: £1,424m). Both of 
these figures exclude Best Buy Europe  
to make comparability easier. Following 
the transaction with Best Buy at the end 
of June 2008, the results of the Group’s 
retail and distribution business are shown 
net of interest and tax within joint 
ventures and associates. Results for  
the first quarter and for 2007-08 are 
shown as discontinued operations,  
again net of interest and tax. Best Buy 
Europe revenue was up 15% to £3,563m, 
reflecting significant market share gains 
and a stronger Euro. 
At a divisional level, TalkTalk Group 
achieved EBIT of £124m. Whilst 
representing an increase of 80% on  
the previous year (2008: £69m), this  
was some way below our aspirations  
at the start of the year and reflected  
an unexpected slowdown in the rate  
of growth in the broadband market, 
principally as a result of a markedly  
less active housing market.
EBIT at Best Buy Europe fell 33% to 
£101m (2008: £151m) with strong top  
line growth more than offset by margin 
deterioration, caused partly by product 
mix and partly by our own trading 
strategy, which focused on market share 
gains in a weaker handset market. 
Headline earnings per share fell 18% to 
12.6p (2008: 15.2p). Statutory earnings 
per share, after exceptional items and 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles, 
increased from 8.1p in the prior year to 
61.6p, reflecting the substantial gain on 
the transaction with Best Buy during the 
year. The Board is proposing a final 
dividend of 3.00p (2008: 3.00p), taking the 
total for the year to 4.35p (2008: 4.25p).
While profitability has suffered against  
a backdrop of a very harsh environment,  
I am pleased to be able to report on 
some areas of substantial progress  
for the Group. The deal with Best Buy, 
completed in June 2008, brought our 
retail operations together with the 
acknowledged global leader in consumer 
electronics retailing. Together we are 
confident of not only refreshing our 
existing retail proposition to deliver the 
“Connected World” to customers, but 
also building a substantial Big Box 
consumer electronics retail business in 
Europe. It also enabled us to pay off the 
large majority of our underlying bank 
borrowings, leaving us with a very strong 
balance sheet.
We have been using this financial strength 
to trade aggressively on the high street, 
accepting lower margins in return for 
sustained top line growth and burgeoning 
market share in a more depressed mobile 
phone market. Our increasing market 
presence will allow us to start to rebuild 
margins as volumes recover.
Within the TalkTalk Group, the service 
problems of a couple of years ago have 
been all but eradicated and we are now 
beginning to be recognised for good 
service as well as outstanding value. 
During the year we have focused on 
making our network even more robust 
and putting in place the additional 
capacity required to exceed our 
customers’ growing usage needs.  
After six years of heavy investment,  
the business is now set to generate 
significant amounts of cash. 
Despite the tough times, morale is high: 
our internal employee surveys are 
showing very positive readings and our 
people are excited about our plans for the 
businesses. It can be a challenge to feel 
motivated during times of such great 
uncertainty but our employees have really 
risen to the challenge and I would like to 
thank them on behalf of the Board for their 
continued efforts. Directors’ Report – Business Review
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
4 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Charles Dunstone, Chief Executive Officer
 
“ ”
For 20 years now we have 
developed our business with 
long-term shareholder value 
in mind. This is now more 
important than ever.
It seems hard to believe that it is a year 
since the last annual report. I note from 
my review last year that I flagged the 
“poor economic climate and inflationary 
pressures” as reasons for caution in my 
outlook statement. I was half-right: world 
economies have been at best, poor; at 
worst, terrible; but it is a reflection of how 
fast the macro environment can change 
and make fools of us all that we have 
been worrying for the last six months 
about the spectre of deflation rather  
than inflation.
Companies have to constantly adapt and 
change to survive. This is the difficult 
message I have had to give to 
shareholders this year. Our own major 
change this year – the deal with Best Buy 
which saw them become 50% owners  
of our retail business – was not generally 
well received, and did in part contribute 
to the share price decline. However,  
I am convinced it was absolutely the  
right thing to do and the right time to  
do it. Here’s why.
Carphone has thrived for 20 years now 
on offering customers simple, impartial 
advice over their choice of handset, 
network and tariff. Increasingly though, 
customers don’t need our advice for 
buying mobile phones: they have done it 
before and they understand how it works. 
So if we were to carry on selling just 
mobile phone contracts, we would risk 
opening the stores one day in two or 
three years’ time and finding that we just 
weren’t relevant to customers any more.
We believe our core skill is in making 
complex technologies simple for 
customers. As a result, we have been 
busy over the last two years – ever  
since I first mentioned it in the 2007 
annual report – developing our retail 
proposition to deliver the “Connected 
World” to customers. A range of laptops 
is now available across most of our 
stores, and we are now rolling out 
mid-sized stores to offer a much wider 
range of connected devices.
We could have continued to go it alone 
with this strategy, but during our work 
with Best Buy helping them re-engineer 
their US mobile retailing operations, we 
discovered how much the two businesses 
have in common, and in particular that  
we have a shared vision of the future of 
technology for customers. I absolutely 
believe that in partnership with Best Buy, 
we can deliver the connected world to 
customers much better and faster than 
we could on our own. 
Secondly, Best Buy is without doubt the 
leading consumer electronics retailer in 
the world. They have conquered their 
home market, where consumers are very 
demanding and the competition was 
strong. They have long eyed Europe as 
an attractive opportunity and see 
Carphone as a great vehicle through 
which to launch Big Box consumer 
electronics stores. It is a huge market 
and the existing customer experience 
can be indifferent. By joining together 
with them, shareholders in Carphone can 
access what is potentially an enormous 
new growth opportunity.
Finally, the years of investment in building 
up a valuable telecoms business had 
taken its toll on our balance sheet, and 
our levels of debt were uncomfortable 
given the gathering clouds of the 
financial crisis. The consideration from 
Best Buy enabled us to pay off the large 
majority of our underlying borrowings 
and we are now in a strong financial 
position where many others are 
struggling in this very tight credit market.
So in summary, we have brought in a 
peerless retailing partner to drive forward 
our strategy, given our shareholders 
access to a new growth opportunity, and 
achieved renewed financial strength. 
I feel that over the long term, these 
benefits more than outweigh the issue  
of near-term earnings dilution.  Directors’ Report –

Through organic growth and 
acquisitions, the Group has delivered  
a high rate of compound growth in 
revenues and profitability over the last  
10 years. From a business that used to 
be predominantly reliant on its UK retail 
business, we now have significant retail 
operations across continental Europe 
and a highly visible recurring revenue 
base from our UK residential telecoms 
operations, creating a much broader and 
better diversified business.
Growing and diversifying  
the business over the long term
▪ Growth: we remain focused 
on growing our businesses  
in strategically important 
areas. The opening of our  
first Best Buy Big Box stores 
in the UK, the continued 
expansion of our US interests 
through Best Buy Mobile,  
and further growth in our  
UK broadband base will be 
central to our plans.
▪ Cash: we have set ourselves 
ambitious targets for the year 
ahead to generate operating 
free cash flow* of over £150m, 
after all investment in the  
Big Box business.
▪ Operational efficiency: 
we have undertaken a 
reorganisation programme 
covering all aspects of our 
business. Our goal is to 
reduce our operating cost 
base within Best Buy Europe 
and TalkTalk Group by around 
£50m and £10m respectively, 
without compromising on the 
customer experience.
▪ Transparency: we are 
enhancing our financial 
disclosure and simplifying  
our KPI reporting to allow 
investors to compare our 
businesses more easily with 
peer group companies.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review – continued
Accessing the internet via  
mobile phone is still a relatively 
under used and limited activity. 
How will customer expectations 
drive innovation?
Q&A
Two of the innovative 
handsets that allow 
customers to access the 
internet, almost anywhere 
and at anytime.
Charles Dunstone, Chief Executive Officer
Our conversations with investors 
generally revolve around just a few  
key questions. These change over time 
as our strategy and the marketplace 
evolve, but currently these are the  
main discussions we are having.
Q
 How are you responding to the 
tough macro environment?
A While the economy has entered 
what is for most of us uncharted territory, 
I view it as much as an opportunity as  
a threat. I take the view that in buoyant 
markets, anyone can do well, and 
innovators are easily copied. When  
times are tougher, imaginative and 
well-financed businesses can put clear 
water between themselves and their 
competitors. So the business remains 
committed to its growth avenues – 
through the evolution of the existing  
retail proposition, the launch of Big Box 
consumer electronics stores, and the 
expansion of our US franchise.
At the same time, you have to remember 
that customers have two choices: firstly, 
whether to spend their money or not;  
and secondly, who to spend it with. As  
a retailer, you have to give customers  
a reason to part with their money, and  
by offering outstanding value, exclusive 
products and a unique new customer 
proposition, we are growing our market 
share. There is a cost to us in margin,  
but as markets recover, our increased 
market power will help us to rebuild  
that over time. 
In the broadband business, TalkTalk  
is the clear value proposition in the 
marketplace, focusing on simple, 
transparent tariffs where customers  
only pay for what they want. There are 
signs of building momentum within this 
business thanks to its outstanding value 
and improving service and innovation.
Finally, all businesses need to protect 
their bottom line. We have had to make 
some difficult decisions as part of our 
cost reduction exercise, and our goal  
has been to offset further deterioration  
in gross margin through a matching 
reduction in operating costs. 
Q
 How are you going to improve 
cash generation? 
A We have been disappointed by our 
cash generation over the last couple  
of years. There have been three main 
reasons: an overspend on capex and 
subscriber acquisition costs a couple of 
years ago; working capital outflow within 
the retail business; and foreign currency 
exposure in a weak Sterling environment.
We are now past the peak of investment 
in our broadband network: capex has 
fallen sharply this year and will fall a little 
further next year, to a sustainably low 
run-rate. At the same time, broadband 
gross adds and churn are lower than  
they have been historically, reducing the 
overall cost of recruiting new customers.
On working capital, the way we earn 
commission from networks automatically 
creates a lag between payment to 
handset suppliers and receipts from 
network operators. This is well 
understood by investors. However,  
our terms vary between networks,  
with the working capital of certain 
partners being greater than others;  
so our business mix over the last year 
accentuated this trend. We expect a 
more normal mix going forward, resulting 
in a continued working capital outflow 
but at a much reduced rate.
Finally, we have closed out our Swiss 
Franc hedging position, leaving our 
currency exposure now just to the Euro, 
where we hedge our Euro-denominated 
trading assets. This should result in 
much reduced volatility in our net  
debt figures.  Directors’ Report – 
Business Review
 www.cpwplc.com 7
Q
 Your competitors and suppliers are 
generally larger and better capitalised 
than you: isn’t this a long-term 
disadvantage?
A It is true that we are a relatively 
small business in industries generally 
populated with major multinationals, but 
this has been the case throughout the 
Group’s life. We have thrived on being 
nimble, allowing us to minimise the time 
between spotting opportunities and 
mobilising to address them. Our ability  
to come from nowhere to become the 
number three in the UK residential 
telecoms market is clear evidence of this.
We have also stayed focused and  
stayed close to the customer. In both  
our businesses, the first thing we ask 
ourselves is “What can we do better for 
the customer?”. This may not result in 
immediate profit maximisation, but it 
does create a sustainable business  
that makes fair margins over time and 
creates barriers to entry through scale 
and low pricing.
Q
 How does fibre deployment affect 
your broadband business? 
A The regulator OFCOM has recently 
announced that it plans not to impose 
any wholesale price regime on BT for  
the resale of fibre-based connectivity  
to UK homes. Fibre networks facilitate 
much higher broadband speeds than 
existing copper networks. In theory,  
this could allow BT to set a very high 
wholesale price for fibre, thus preventing 
users of its network (such as us and Sky) 
from reselling fibre profitably and giving 
BT the opportunity to gain significant 
market share through marketing its own 
superfast broadband product without 
meaningful competition.
There are several flaws to this theoretical 
argument. Firstly, BT has a low retail 
market share for an incumbent. This 
means that it will be difficult to get a 
good return on an expensive fibre 
deployment on a “go it alone” strategy 
because they don’t have the density  
of customers; they would need wholesale 
customers to help defray the capital 
outlay. We expect to work closely with 
Openreach, the infrastructure arm of  
BT, on the development of wholesale 
products.
Secondly, demand for “raw” speed, while 
growing, is still relatively low. BT’s ability 
to take significant retail market share 
simply through a higher speed product, 
with no compelling exclusive content, is 
likely to be limited. At the same time,  
the achievement of higher speeds 
through the enhancement of the copper 
infrastructure, and the rapid development 
of compression technologies which 
would allow much more effective data 
transmission at prevailing broadband 
speeds, could dampen demand for 
fibre-based products.
Finally, we all look to Virgin Media, the 
cable-based broadband operator with its 
own network, to see how their customers 
are responding to their new, higher  
speed products. If demand for 50Mbps 
services picks up rapidly, then rapid fibre 
deployment with fair wholesale prices  
will be the natural market response.
Q
 Won’t increasing customer usage 
erode margins in the broadband 
business? 
A Customer usage increased, on 
average, 60% year-on-year this year, 
which was in line with our expectations. 
We are designing our network for 
continued strong traffic growth as 
customers find more to do on the internet 
and will, over time, value reliability and 
consistency from their ISP as much as 
out-and-out speed.
Over the last two years we have been 
increasing backhaul capacity into our 
exchanges by up to ten times. The scale 
economies of this process are very 
healthy, with the operating cost to us  
of running a gigabit circuit only being 
twice that of running a 100 megabit 
circuit. This means that our capacity-
related operating costs are effectively 
capped for the medium term.
I believe that, as customers use 
broadband for an ever-wider array of 
services, metering will be an inevitable 
next step in the marketplace, with 
customers learning to pay for what they 
use rather than having flat rate tariffs.
Q
 Don’t you need content as part 
of your broadband offer?
A The way customers are accessing 
content is rapidly fragmenting. Although 
Pay TV is a significant part of the market, 
an increasing amount of content is freely 
available on the internet and this is only 
going to grow over time. I don’t think that 
telecoms businesses make good media 
businesses, so we will continue to focus 
on providing the best value and most 
reliable network allowing our customers 
to access content of their choice on the 
web. How could we justify charging a 
premium for content that customers 
either don’t want or could find 
somewhere else for free anyway?
Q
 How do you compete with the 
mobile networks’ direct distribution 
strategies?
A The mobile networks have long been 
competitors on the high street as well  
as partners, and we have thrived within  
this market dynamic for many years. 
Customers are not all the same: for every 
customer who is happy to stay with the 
same network and deal with them direct, 
there is another who wants to shop 
around, try a wider range of handsets 
and get impartial advice. That’s why 
Carphone Warehouse exists.
Q
 Isn’t consumer electronics retailing 
an unattractive sector?
A Not at all. It is estimated to be a 
£30bn market in the UK alone. We  
all love the technology we have in our 
homes – music, home theatre, gaming, 
even coffee machines and fridge freezers 
– but generally we don’t love going to 
buy it or having to make it work. Our 
analysis of the UK market suggests  
that competition is focused around  
price rather than service, and while  
most technology products aren’t 
commoditised, they are sold that way.
Our goal is to open large stores with  
deep ranges, well-informed staff, and  
a high level of in-store interactivity  
and after-sales service. We want it to  
be a pleasure to come shopping for 
technology, not a chore. The economics 
of running 30,000 square foot stores  
are much more attractive than stores  
half the size, which our competitors 
typically run, and the current property 
market is providing us with some 
compelling opportunities. 8 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Directors’ Report – Business Review
Chief Executive Officer’s Review – continued
In November last year we announced plans 
to conduct a structural review of the Group. 
This process was a natural consequence of 
the Best Buy deal and reflected discussions 
with investors through the summer over  
our future plans for the Group.
Key considerations for the structural review
The review covered a broad range of 
considerations, the most significant  
of which are set out below, with our 
summarised views on each issue. In 
conclusion, the Board decided that a 
demerger was the right course to pursue, 
allowing the two businesses clearer 
autonomy and investors clearer choices. 
We expect to achieve the demerger  
by July 2010, at which time we expect 
TalkTalk Group and our investment  
in Best Buy Europe to be listed as 
independent publicly-quoted companies. 
We are confident this will make it easier 
Consideration Conclusion
Do the two businesses complement each other 
commercially?
Yes, but not materially. The Carphone Warehouse stores are still  
an important distribution channel for TalkTalk broadband sales but 
now account for only 20% of gross sales, down from around 50%  
at launch. Most new customers are now switchers rather than new 
to broadband and use other channels to switch providers. 
Commercial terms are already at arm’s length. 
Does one business have a financial reliance  
on the other?
Not any more. The growth of the broadband business was 
historically financed by the cash generated by the retail business. 
Both businesses are now expected to be self-financing.
Do the businesses have different investor profiles? Yes, we believe so. The TalkTalk Group is becoming a highly cash 
generative business with a utility-like profile; Best Buy Europe is 
entering a growth and investment phase with a major market 
opportunity in front of it.
Are the businesses easily separable from a 
management and administrative viewpoint?
Yes. We pushed the majority of shared resource down into the 
divisions in May last year, and have gone through a further 
restructuring process early in 2009.
Are there any material financing implications of  
a demerger?
Yes. The demerger will require us to put in place separate facilities 
for the two businesses. However, we are making good progress on 
this and do not see it as an obstacle to demerger.
for shareholders to assess more clearly 
the value of the Group’s businesses and 
that each business will continue to thrive 
with its distinct management strategy, 
investment characteristics, financing 
arrangements and potential.
Meanwhile, the two businesses are 
already effectively run as separate 
entities, with a very limited shared central 
function. This was a process begun 
ahead of the Best Buy transaction last 
year, and taken further in early 2009 with 
the devolution of most remaining central 
functions down to the divisional level. 
The Group functions that remain are the 
Board, Group Finance, Treasury, Investor 
Relations and Company Secretariat.
We now see the Group as a holding 
company managing four assets – our 
100% holding in TalkTalk Group, the  
50% stake in Best Buy Europe, the 
48.5% stake in Virgin Mobile France,  
and the Group’s freehold properties.  
The key elements of each and our 
strategy for them are set out here. Directors’ Report –

TalkTalk Group
TalkTalk Group is our UK fixed line telecoms division, 
serving over 3.9m fixed line customers comprising 
2.8m broadband and 1.1m voice-only and narrowband 
customers. It is currently the number 3 player in the 
UK broadband market, with by far the most extensive 
unbundled network in the UK, which supports a  
low-cost operating model that enables strong 
profitability even on market-leading tariffs. Its  
B2B operation, branded Opal, is a major player in  
the small business market. 
Over the last 12 months we have successfully completed the integration of  
the AOL broadband business and continued to grow the business organically.  
The bulk of our network investment is now complete and the business is set  
to be strongly cash generative going forward.

Key Performance Indicators Strategy
The TalkTalk Group is clearly positioned 
as the best value provider in the UK 
residential broadband market. We do  
not believe that low cost should equate 
to low service, so we are absolutely 
focused on maintaining and improving 
our network quality, developing 
innovative products and delivering  
a positive experience to customers.
Maintaining and growing our 
broadband market share
Our market share has been steady at 
around the 16% mark for the last two 
years. We believe that, as our service 
levels have improved, some of our direct 
competitors have weakened and as 
consumers look for value, we are well 
placed to grow our share. With strong 
margins and low churn, each marginal 
new customer generates a very high net 
present value for the division. In addition, 
increasing scale enables us to spread 
fixed network costs across a wider base.
Focusing on value and simplicity
Our customer research tells us that 
people are fed up of paying over the 
odds for a bundle which includes 
services they don’t want. Our proposition 
is clear: we are the best value provider of 
a combined package of calls, line rental 
and broadband, with no expensive 
extras. However, we have developed  
a range of “Boosts”, which allow 
customers to sign up for higher speeds, 
greater download capacity and other 
features, whenever they like without 
being contractually committed to them.
Continuing to improve network 
performance and reliability
As broadband becomes more ubiquitous 
and customers find more and more 
things to do on the internet, usage  
is increasing significantly. We have 
anticipated this trend and have been 
developing our network to manage the 
huge increases in demand expected over 
the next three years. The investments we 
have made will allow us to do this while 
protecting our margin structure.
Targeting strong cash generation
The Group has invested over £900m into 
the TalkTalk Group over the last six years. 
That period of investment is now over: 
capex is declining sharply, and the 
customer base we have built up is highly 
cash generative. We have set a target of 
over £100m operating free cash flow 
from the division in 2009-10.
UK broadband market
Growth in the UK broadband market 
slowed sharply during 2008, principally 
as a result of the decline in housing 
transactions. Penetration has reached 
over 65%, and despite the slowing 
growth we expect the market to 
eventually reach 80% penetration in the 
next 3-4 years.
Broadband tariffs
Broadband and bundled pricing has 
been remarkably stable overall for the 
last three years, since we came in and 
repriced the market in April 2006. 
Competition is rational, with financially 
weaker players now marketing less 
aggressively, and there have even been 
signs of price rises in recent months. 
Over time we expect pricing changes to 
be driven by speed and metered access.

TalkTalk Group delivered another good 
performance last year, growing its 
customer base, increasing the proportion 
of its customers on its unbundled 
network from 67% to 78% and achieving 
a substantial reduction in its churn rate. 
Despite the unexpected slow-down in  
the rate of growth in the broadband 
market, TalkTalk Group still increased in 
profitability, with Headline EBIT growing 
by 80% to £124m and Headline EBIT 
margins almost doubling from 4.8% to 
9.0%. TalkTalk Group has also started  
to deliver strong cash flows, and has 
significantly increased visibility of these 
cash flows going forward.
Residential revenues were down 
marginally in the last financial year,  
falling 2% to £1,089m (2008: £1,112m). 
Blended broadband monthly ARPU  
rose by 3% to £22.65. The increase  
was driven by the greater proportion  
of higher ARPU TalkTalk customers 
within the base. Non-broadband ARPU 
rose 18% to £20.93, reflecting price 
increases in line with BT’s voice price 
increases during the year.
B2B revenues declined by 5% to £296m 
(2008: £312m). Opal continued to 
improve its revenue mix, with an ongoing 
trend towards higher value services 
offsetting falling premium rate traffic.  
In the second half, the business  
launched its new suite of data products 
for the small business market, which is 
expected to drive moderate revenue 
growth in 2009-10. 
During the year underlying growth in the 
broadband base was 186,000 customers, 
but as part of the AOL integration 
process, we identified a discrepancy  
of 93,000 customers and reduced the 
base accordingly at the half year.  
This delivered a net increase of 93,000 
customers to 2.8m. 
Our base of non-broadband customers, 
encompassing customers taking our 
voice-only service or narrowband 
package, continued to decline in line  
with our expectations, ending the year  
at 1.1m customers. A large number of 
these customers are signing up to our 
own bundled broadband services.
The TalkTalk broadband base made 
further excellent progress during the 
year, increasing by 339,000 customers  
or 27%. The customer service issues  
of previous years are now behind us  
and our simple value proposition 
continues to gain traction in the market. 
Growth picked up noticeably towards the 
end of the financial year, reflecting what 
is seasonally our strongest quarter for 
broadband growth but also underlining 
the brand’s value credentials as 
customers increasingly look to save 
money in the current economic climate. 
Trends in churn at TalkTalk were also very 
encouraging, with annualised churn 
falling materially year-on-year as 
customers became increasingly satisfied 
with our service levels, and the housing 
market became more subdued. With our 
highly efficient, fully-unbundled network,  Directors’ Report – 
Business Review
 www.cpwplc.com 13
we are able to generate strong cash 
margins while maintaining the most 
competitive telecoms bundles in the 
market. With customer lifetimes 
lengthening and acquisition costs stable, 
we believe the net present value of the 
base is increasing all the time.
As expected, the AOL Broadband base 
fell by just under 245,000 customers, 
reflecting the 93,000 adjustment noted 
above and customers switching from  
the higher broadband tariffs to which 
AOL customers were historically signed 
up. We focused our retention 
programmes on customers living within 
our unbundled exchange footprint, where 
we can offer lower tariffs reflecting our 
lower cost base in those areas. As a 
result, AOL churn rates reduced towards 
the end of the year. We also completed 
the integration of AOL during 2008, 
combining the businesses under a single 
UK residential management team.
We made further substantial progress  
on the footprint, capacity and resilience 
of our telecoms network during the year. 
We unbundled a further 326 exchanges, 
taking our fully-unbundled network to 
1,705 exchanges and our partially-
unbundled network to 1,251 exchanges. 
Together this gives us approximately 
80% coverage of the UK population.  
We unbundled 372,000 customers during 
the year, taking the total unbundled  
base to 2.2m customers or 78% of the 
total broadband base, in line with our 
goal. We remain the largest unbundler  
in the UK, representing 39% of all 
unbundled lines. Importantly, we are still 
the only broadband provider that has 
succeeded in making full unbundling 
work. This is testament to the skill of  
our engineers and our strong supplier 
partnerships, and enables us to provide 
packaged broadband and voice services 
at a much lower cost than our partially-
unbundled competitors.
At the year end we changed the way we 
account for subscriber acquisition costs 
(“SAC”). Historically we have capitalised 
SAC and amortised it over a customer’s 
minimum contract term – typically  
18 months. We are now expensing SAC 
as incurred, bringing our policy in line 
with the majority of other telecoms 
companies and more closely aligning  
our profit and loss performance with  
our cash flow.

TalkTalk Group generated operating  
free cash flow of £40m (2008: outflow  
of £44m). Strong EBITDA growth was 
partially offset by an outflow on working 
capital, which was caused by timing 
issues due to a change to calendar 
month ends; there was no deterioration 
in underlying working capital. Capex 
reduced from £172m to £106m, reflecting 
high levels of network investment in  
the prior year.
The major elements of the capital 
expenditure on the network in 2008-09 
were the additional exchanges 
unbundled, increased capacity in existing 
exchanges, and the continuation of our 
project to increase backhaul capacity 
within the network. By the end of the year 
we had substantially completed our new 
CRM and billing platform investment and 
have commenced migrations, which 
should enable us to provide an enhanced 
service to customers in the years ahead. 14 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

TalkTalk Group – continued
Outlook
The prospects for the coming year are 
good. After many years of investment,  
we expect TalkTalk Group to deliver 
significant free cash flow and consolidate 
its position in the marketplace. While we 
remain mindful of the tough times many 
of our customers are enduring, we 
believe that residential broadband and 
telephony are must-have services that 
customers are unwilling to forego. At the 
same time, as a clear value player with 
no unwanted services within the bundle, 
we expect to benefit from customers 
seeking to save on monthly outgoings  
by moving to TalkTalk.
We expect to achieve 125,000-175,000 
broadband net adds next year, reflecting 
stable market share in a maturing market. 
ARPU growth is expected to be marginal, 
with some beneficial mix effects and the 
sale of additional value-added services 
likely to be cancelled out by a slight 
decline in voice traffic. 
The non-broadband base is likely to 
continue to decline but at a slower  
rate than this year, with ARPUs again 
broadly stable.
Within the B2B operation, we are 
budgeting for revenue growth of 3-5%, 
driven by the launch of new data services 
and a renewed strategic focus. EBITDA 
margins in both businesses are expected 
to be flat to slightly up, driven by 
operating efficiency and scale benefits.
While overall EBIT growth is likely to  
be limited, we are targeting significant 
free cash flow generation. We are 
planning for neutral working capital and  
a further reduction in capex, to £80m in 
the coming year. This allows us to target 
operating free cash flow of over £100m,  
a figure which we believe is sustainable 
in the medium term.
Longer term we are bullish about the 
outlook for broadband. The market 
appears to be consolidating around four 
major players, of which we are clearly 
differentiated as offering transparent 
value and simplicity. Across both our 
divisions, we are guided by our view of 
the connected world – that customers 
will increasingly use mobile and fixed 
broadband connectivity wherever they 
are, to integrate their entertainment, 
domestic and business needs 
seamlessly. This makes the broadband 
connection in the home one of great 
strategic importance and value.
However, we remain conscious of the 
role of the regulator in ensuring that 
where significant investment has been 
made, it is suitably protected. Fibre 
networks will come, although we do not 
believe they will reach the mass market 
for five years. When they do, we are 
confident that we will be able to access 
that infrastructure at fair rates 
determined by natural market forces.  www.cpwplc.com 15

The Carphone Warehouse has survived 
and thrived in a highly competitive  
mobile industry by constantly identifying 
changes in consumer behaviour which 
present opportunities if we address  
them and threats if we do not. Over the 
last two years we have been undergoing 
our biggest evolution yet, as we  
address the opportunity presented  
by the “Connected World” – and this 
governs the main elements of our 
divisional strategy.
Evolving the retail proposition  
to embrace a broader array of 
connectivity services 
We have been very successful in 
developing our existing store proposition 
to offer a wider range of connected 
devices, to reflect new services available 
in the market and customers’ changing 
technology needs. Mobile broadband, 
laptops and smartphones have been 
significant contributors to top line growth 
this year. Looking ahead, this is set to 
continue as we refine the small store 
offer and roll out 30-40 of our new, 
mid-sized stores.
European handset market
After five years of strong and consistent 
growth, 2008 witnessed a slight fall in the 
European handset market. A combination 
of market saturation, the macroeconomic 
environment and a lack of new products 
in the mid-tier all contributed to this 
decline. At this stage we expect a similar 
trend in 2009, followed by stabilisation  
in 2010.
Laptop sales and penetration
The laptop market is set for continued 
strong unit growth as prices fall, 
hardware becomes subsidised  
with mobile broadband, and smaller, 
“netbook” type products proliferate.  
The market in Western Europe was up 
41% in 2008 but is still only a fraction  
of the size of the mobile phone market.
Growing our market share of mobile 
connections
Market share has long been a key 
element of our strategy. Significant  
share makes us an important partner  
to network operators and handset 
manufacturers alike. The opportunity  
for market share growth is greater in a 
weak handset market, as more marginal 
players struggle to compete with our 
proposition. We estimate that our market 
share improved significantly year-on-year 
and we aim to deliver further strong gains 
over the next 12 months.
Launching a multi-channel consumer 
electronics business
With our partners Best Buy, the 
acknowledged global champions of  
Big Box consumer electronics retailing,  
we are planning to launch a major assault 
on the UK electricals market. Our first 
out-of-town stores are scheduled to open 
in spring 2010 and, if successful, we  
will roll out a presence across the UK 
supported by a full multi-channel service 
offering. We are confident that the planned 
investments will generate a new and 
material leg of growth for the business.

Short-Term Risks  
and Challenges
▪
 A weak consumer 
environment and an uncertain 
outlook mean that the 
business needs to remain 
flexible in its financial planning
▪
 The launch of the Big Box 
consumer electronics 
proposition requires 
significant upfront investment 
and a major commitment of 
resource on which we may not 
achieve a satisfactory return
▪
 Currency movements could 
have a negative impact on 
handset prices and erode 
margins
▪
 Failure to improve working 
capital management could 
increase financing costs
Longer-Term Risks  
and Challenges
▪
 Mobile networks may continue 
to invest in their own 
distribution platforms and 
seek to deal directly with their 
customers
▪
 The rate of technological 
change may slow, reducing 
the need for customers to 
upgrade their handsets
▪
 We may experience significant 
price competition in the 
consumer electronics market, 
damaging the economics of 
our business plan
▪
 Competition between network 
operators may subside, 
reducing incentives to 
customers

EBIT %  2.8% 4.9%
Best Buy Europe’s revenues grew  
15% to £3,563m, with 9% growth coming  
from the strength of the Euro year-on-
year. Headline EBIT fell 33% to £101m 
(2008: £151m). Although profitability fell 
year-on-year, we made significant 
progress in the development of the 
business and are well positioned in terms 
of market share, product diversification, 
an efficient cost base and the strength of 
our relationships with both vendors and 
mobile network partners.
During the year, we achieved total 
connections of 12.5m, up 8% year-on-
year (2008: 11.5m), despite what we 
estimate to be a year-on-year decline in 
the European handset market. As a result 
we estimate that our market share has 
grown significantly, reinforcing our belief 
in the value of our independent model in 
the eyes of the consumer. 
Subscription connections were also  
up 8% to 4.8m (2008: 4.5m). Growth  
in subscription sales was driven by 
high-end, internet-enabled handsets,  
and by mobile broadband connections.  
It is clear that mobile data, whether via 
laptops or handsets, using 3G networks 
or WiFi, is really taking off. We have 
positioned ourselves well to capture this 
rapid growth, as the connections figures 
demonstrate. In contrast, the market for 
mid-tier handsets, the historical “bread 
and butter” of the subscriptions market, 
was in decline throughout the year. There 
are now signs however, that the features 
available in high-end devices are now 
cascading into the more mass market 
mid-tier ranges, and this segment of the 
handset market is beginning to show 
signs of improving. 
Pre-pay connections were up 9%  
to 7.0m. After a slow second quarter,  
pre-pay sales picked up in the second 
half of the financial year as we took 
significant market share from general 
retailers. Although we initially thought 
that the pre-pay business would be  
more at risk from a more cautious 
consumer environment, any effects  
were more than offset by our own  
strong market share gains.
Like-for-like revenue, stripping out the 
impact of new space, was up 7.9% and 
at constant currencies, like-for-like 
revenue was up 1.1%.
Divisional gross margin fell 140 basis 
points year-on-year, from 30.4% to 
29.0%. This decline reflected both a 
more aggressive trading stance, as we 
sought to use our scale and strong 
financial position to grow our market 
share, and the impact in our product  
mix of lower margin mobile broadband 
connections and our drive into the laptop 
market place.
We opened 180 stores during the year, 
and closed or relocated 132, giving net 
store additions of 48. The total store 
base was 2,459 at the year end (2008: 
2,411), including 219 franchise stores 
(2008: 236). Total average selling space 
excluding franchises was up 8% to 
122,470 sqm (2008: 113,438 sqm). 
Including franchises, total average  
selling space was up 7% to 131,137 sqm 
(2008: 122,976 sqm). 
During the year we reduced our plans  
for fresh store openings based on our 
traditional store format after several 
years of rapid expansion. We focused 
instead on the most significant change

Best Buy Europe – continued
to the in-store proposition achieved in 
the business’s history, which included 
the introduction of a full laptop offer 
across a significant proportion of the 
portfolio. In October, we opened the first 
of our new, mid-sized stores, which are 
up to 300 sqm, compared to our normal 
small store size of around 60 sqm. These 
mid-sized stores offer not only a much 
wider range of laptops, but also areas 
dedicated to gaming, wireless TV and 
music services, all backed up by an 
in-store Geek Squad presence. These 
stores have performed very strongly, with 
excellent customer feedback, and we will 
be introducing a further 30-40 over the 
coming year, through a mix of new stores 
and refits.
During the year we also trialled a major 
change to how our sales consultants are 
remunerated, with the introduction of 
higher base salaries and bonuses, to 
replace the traditional mix of lower 
salaries and sales-based commissions. 
Under the trial, bonuses are based on  
a store’s Net Promoter Score, which  
is a measure of the difference between 
positive and negative customer 
feedback. The trial was a success and 
we are now progressively introducing  
this structure across the whole of the  
UK business. There has been no 
deterioration in sales performance as a 
result, and we believe that, over time, it 
will create even greater trust in the brand 
in the eyes of customers.
In the US, Best Buy Mobile had an 
outstanding year. This business, in which 
Best Buy Europe have a profit-sharing 
agreement, was launched two years ago 
to reposition Best Buy’s mobile retailing 
operations with the assistance of 
Carphone Warehouse. Over the course  
of the year its in-store presence has  
been introduced across all of Best Buy’s 
Big Box stores in the US, delivering near 
triple-digit rates of like-for-like growth 
and significant market share gains as a 
result. In addition, Best Buy have opened 
33 standalone stores, taking the total  
to 39. Our share of profits for the year 
was £8m and is expected to grow 
significantly in the year ahead.
Since the deal with Best Buy, which 
completed at the end of June, we have 
committed significant resource to the Big 
Box consumer electronics retail launch, 
planned for spring 2010. We had 
originally scheduled the first store 
openings for the second half of 2009,  
but the highly favourable property 
environment has presented us with 
increasingly attractive opportunities,  
both in terms of locations and lease 
terms. As a result, we have chosen not  
to rush, but to take our pick of the 
opportunities and ensure that our launch 
has the most material impact. We 
incurred approximately £7m of costs 
relating to the launch during the year. 
Best Buy Europe’s Insurance business 
continues to be an important contributor 
to the profitability of the business. 
Customers value the protection it gives 
when they commit to a high value 
contract and receive a heavily 
subsidised, valuable mobile phone. 
Although performance earlier in the year 
was relatively subdued, business picked 
up in the second half. We benefited from 
the introduction of the laptop proposition 
into the stores, and also from the 
development of a combined insurance 
and Geek Squad assurance policy, giving 
customers not only protection against 
loss, but also access to technology 
assistance from the Geek Squad.

Best Buy Europe saw an outflow on 
operating free cash flow of £87m (2008: 
inflow of £106m). The adverse movement 
was largely due to working capital, 
particularly in the first half of the year. 
Our working capital position reflected an 
increasing alignment of our interests with 
our network partners, with commission 
being deferred over the contract life 
rather than paid up front. Whilst not 
affecting revenue recognition, this had  
an adverse impact on working capital. 
We have been working with the networks 
and other key suppliers to limit further 
absorption of working capital, 
experiencing minimal absorption in  
the second half of the year, and expect 
much-improved cash generation  
in 2009-10.

Outlook
The short-term outlook for Best Buy 
Europe is inevitably uncertain. 
Economies across Europe are set to be 
in recession throughout 2009, and we  
do not expect the handset market to  
be immune to these wider pressures.  
We have set our budgets for the year  
with this in mind.
Overall we expect revenues to be broadly 
flat in 2009-10, excluding currency 
effects. We estimate that the handset 
market will fall slightly but that we will 
continue to make market share gains, 
with connections approximately flat.  
In addition, the evolution of the retail 
proposition should see an increasing 
proportion of non-connection related 
revenue within the mix, with the result 
that from the following year, connections 
will become a less reliable proxy for 
revenue growth.
We expect gross margin to decline by 
25-50 basis points. This reflects a 
continuation of our trading strategy  
and further increases of hardware sales 
within the revenue mix. However, the  
cost saving programme which we  
have undertaken during 2008-09 is 
expected to offset the impact of the 
gross margin deterioration at the  
EBITDA level.
We are planning for a minimal increase  
in the overall store count. Our focus will 
be on further developing the retail 
proposition and opening 30-40 of our 
new, mid-sized format stores. This 
should result in around 1-2% growth  
in average space for the year. 
Our plans for the Big Box store openings 
will accelerate through the year and will 
result in start-up costs of approximately 
£30m, in line with the figure we indicated 
in October 2008. This primarily reflects 
the costs of the team, research and 
consultancy fees and the pre-opening 
rents on the new stores.
Best Buy Mobile is set to grow profits 
strongly in the coming year, enjoying a 
full year’s trading out of all Big Box stores 
and further standalone store openings. 
Best Buy Europe’s share of profits is 
expected to rise to £20-25m.
The impact of all of these effects is 
expected to result in an EBIT margin of 
2.5-3.0%. The Group’s share of the taxed 
profits of the division is anticipated to be 
in the £30-40m range.
Cash flow for the division will be a major 
focus for the year and we are targeting 
an operating free cash flow figure of 
£50m, after Big Box investments and 
start-up costs. Capex for the core 
business is set to fall with the decline in 
new store openings, and we aim to 
reduce working capital outflow materially 
year-on-year.
Longer term, the outlook is very positive. 
Tough trading conditions are effective at 
taking out spare capacity and our 
competitive position is improving. We 
have made significant progress in 
developing our retail model, and see 
good prospects of material profits 
growth from Best Buy Mobile and Best 
Buy Big Box stores in the UK over the 
next five years.

www.cpwplc.com Joint ventures and associates
Alongside the results of Best Buy Europe 
since the transaction with Best Buy, the 
Group’s share of results of joint ventures 
and associates in the income statement 
includes our share of post-tax losses 
from Virgin Mobile, our French MVNO. 
Virgin Mobile had a second successful 
year of customer growth, adding over 
300,000 customers and bringing its base 
to over 1.1m customers, of whom 44% 
are subscription. Our share of losses  
for the year was £8m. The business 
continued to invest significantly in 
brand-building and customer recruitment, 
and while it will record further losses in 
2009-10, broadly in line with 2008-09 
levels, as it continues to invest in growth, 
we expect it to move to profitability at the 
EBITDA level on a monthly basis in the 
second half of this year.
Exceptional items
The disposal of 50% of the Group’s  
retail and distribution business gave  
rise to a net gain after tax of £608m, 
which is reflected in the results of 
discontinued operations. Indirect  
costs of £6m after tax also arose as  
a result of the transaction. Further  
to the new partnership, Best Buy  
Europe commenced the disposal of 
approximately 100 stores, and 
accelerated a shift in its range of retail 
stock away from mobile phones towards 
laptops and other products, resulting in 
an exceptional charge. Exceptional costs 
associated with these programmes are 
reflected in a post-tax charge of £11m 
through the results of joint ventures.
Prior to the transaction with Best Buy, 
the Group conducted a review of its 
central support structures, particularly  
in relation to its retail and distribution 
business, to achieve greater divisional 
autonomy and efficiency. This review 
resulted in a reorganisation programme 
that is expected to yield savings of  
£7m per annum. Redundancy and other 
restructuring costs that have arisen as  
a result of the programme are reflected  
in a post-tax charge of £9m in 
discontinued operations.
Further to the divisionalisation process, 
both TalkTalk Group and Best Buy 
Europe have undertaken comprehensive 
reorganisation programmes in the 
second half of the year. The TalkTalk 
Group programme is expected to 
generate annualised savings of 
approximately £10m per annum, and  
has resulted in redundancy and other 
restructuring costs of £10m, which are 
reflected in exceptional operating 
expenses. The Best Buy Europe 
reorganisation is expected to yield 
annualised savings for the joint venture of 
up to £50m per annum, and has resulted 
in a post-tax charge through the results 
of joint ventures of £7m. TalkTalk Group 
also completed the transfer of its AOL 
network operations, hosting, billing  
and customer management from a 
transitional platform provided by AOL 
Time Warner onto the Group’s own 
systems, at a cost of £16m, shown  
within exceptional operating expenses. 
Additionally, an exceptional foreign 
exchange loss of £85m has arisen in the 
year following a change in the functional 
currency of the Group’s brand company 
from Swiss Francs to Sterling. The 
transaction with Best Buy necessitated  
a change in the operations of the brand 
company, which in turn made Sterling  
the appropriate functional currency.  
As a result of the change, movements  
on the brand company’s Swiss Franc 
borrowings, which would have previously 
been recognised through reserves,  
were thereafter reflected in the income 
statement. These borrowings were 
converted into Sterling before 31 March 
2009. A tax credit of £24m has been 
recognised in respect of this loss.

Whilst profitability has 
suffered against the 
economic environment,  
we have areas of 
substantial progress  
for the Group to report.

The Group no longer has any material 
exposure to movements in the Swiss 
Franc. 
Finally, the Group fully impaired its  
legacy wireless internet investments, 
resulting in a non-cash charge of £5m 
through exceptional operating expenses.
Amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles
The amortisation charge in respect  
of acquisition intangibles amounted  
to £71m (2008: £75m), primarily in  
relation to AOL.
Interest and taxation
Net interest of £4m was payable during 
the year, a substantial reduction in the 
charge for 2007-08 of £45m, as a result 
of the proceeds from the transaction  
with Best Buy. The effective tax rate  
on Headline profits from continuing 
operations excluding joint ventures was 
17% (2008: 50%). The tax rate benefited 
from the recognition of previously 
unrecognised tax assets.
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Headline EPS was 12.6p, a reduction  
of 18% year-on-year (2008: 15.2p). 
Statutory EPS was 61.6p (2008: 8.1p),

The Group had underlying net debt at  
the year-end of £159m. In addition, the 
Group had used its committed facilities 
to provide funding of £293m to Best Buy 
Europe at the end of March, and total net 
debt including Group borrowings to fund 
these loans was therefore £452m.  
The loans were provided under a £475m 
revolving credit facility, half of which is 
guaranteed by Best Buy Co., Inc. 
Best Buy Europe had net debt of £47m  
at the end of the year, comprising loans 
from the Group of £293m and net cash 
and other borrowings of £246m; Best 
Buy Europe’s net cash and other 
borrowings are not consolidated into  
our Group results. The Group’s effective 
net debt, including the Group’s share  
of Best Buy Europe net debt, was 
therefore £182m. 
The principal components of TalkTalk 
Group’s operating cash flows are 
detailed above. 
The Group received gross proceeds of 
£1,041m from the transaction with Best 
Buy. Other cash movements reflect 
operating cash flows prior to the 
transaction (shown in the Group cash 
flow as discontinued operations), the 
removal from Group debt of Best Buy 
Europe’s cash and debt, and share 
capital invested in the business since 
June. In the prior year, other cash 
movements reflect Best Buy Europe’s 
operating free cash flow, together with 
net disposal proceeds of £34m.
The principal acquisition cost in the year 
was the final deferred consideration 
payment of £70m for the AOL acquisition.
Tax and interest reflects a sharp 
reduction in year-on-year interest costs, 
and continuing minimal tax payments, 
reflecting the substantial tax losses 
available to TalkTalk Group.
Dividends and shares include the 
acquisition of 24m Group shares into our 
Employee Benefit Trust earlier in the year 
to avoid future dilution from the exercise 
of share options, at a cost of £53m.
Dividends
We are proposing a final dividend of 
3.00p per share (2008: 3.00p), taking  
the total dividend for the year to 4.35p, 
which represents an increase of 2% on 
last year, and which against Headline 
earnings provides dividend cover of  
2.9 (2008: 3.7).
Balance sheet
The transaction with Best Buy has 
resulted in the deconsolidation of the 
Best Buy Europe balance sheet and the 
Group’s share of Best Buy Europe is now 
shown in interests in joint ventures and 
associates. 
Group net assets have increased from 
£651m to £1,116m. Goodwill, other 
intangible assets, property plant and 
equipment, current assets and current 
liabilities have all reduced significantly 
year-on-year as a result of the 
deconsolidation. Loans to Best Buy 
Europe are shown separately in the 
balance sheet. 
Foreign exchange
A large proportion of the Group’s 
borrowings at the start of the year were 
held in Euros and Swiss Francs, as a 
hedge against non-Sterling assets. The 
part-disposal of the Euro-denominated 
businesses within Best Buy Europe has 
substantially reduced the Group’s 
requirement for Euro hedges, although 
some hedges remain in respect of the 
Group’s investment in and funding to 
Virgin Mobile France and on cash flow 
hedges for TalkTalk Group. 
The further weakening of Sterling during 
the year caused significant currency 
outflows in relation to Swiss Francs. 
However, the change in the functional 
currency of the Group’s brand company 
from Swiss Francs to Sterling during  
the year and redenomination of its 
borrowings have materially eliminated  
the Group’s exposure to Swiss Francs by 
the end of the year.
Financing and treasury
The Group’s operations are financed by 
committed bank facilities, retained profits 
and equity. The Group’s committed bank 
facilities are a £550m revolving credit 
facility (“RCF”), which is used for working 
capital purposes, and a £375m term loan. 
The facilities mature in March 2013 and 
October 2012 respectively. The terms  
of both facilities are similar and the 
covenant packages are identical.  
The Group was in compliance with  
the covenant conditions of both facilities 
at the year end. 
Most uncommitted money market loans 
have been terminated as a result of 
banks’ credit constraints, although some 
overdraft facilities are still in use to 
provide working capital flexibility. 22 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Directors’ Report – Business Review
Other Financial Information – continued
Funding of our subsidiaries is arranged 
centrally with an emphasis on tight cash 
control and efficient cash management. 
All funding is provided on an arm’s length 
basis and currency risk is ordinarily 
hedged using foreign exchange swaps  
or currency borrowings. Other than 
intercompany loans and capital funding, 
balance sheet translational risk is not 
hedged against adverse movements in 
exchange rates and the results of any 
such movements are taken to reserves. 
The Group is exposed to limited cross-
border transactional commitments and, 
where significant, these are hedged at 
inception using forward currency 
contracts.
Group committed debt facilities have 
been used to provide a £475m RCF  
to Best Buy Europe. This RCF has terms 
that are broadly similar to the Group’s 
main external facilities, including a 
debt:EBITDA covenant, and its final 
maturity date is 13 March 2013.  
Under this RCF 50% of drawings are 
guaranteed by Best Buy Co., Inc. 
Treasury policy permits the use of 
long-term derivative treasury products 
for the management of currency and 
interest rate risk and the Group’s interest 
rate exposures are monitored regularly. 
More generally, the Group treasury 
function seeks to follow treasury best 
practice as recommended by the 
Association of Corporate Treasurers  
and adheres at all times to their Ethical 
Code. The Group does not trade or 
speculate in any financial instruments.
Going concern
A review of the Group’s business 
activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out 
elsewhere within this Business Review, 
including the Risks and Uncertainties 
section. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are shown in the 
balance sheet, cash flow statement and 
accompanying notes to the financial 
statements. Further information 
concerning the Group’s financing 
arrangement and policies are set out  
in the Financing and treasury section 
above. Further details of the Group’s 
financial risk management arrangements 
are provided in note 22 to the financial 
statements.
The Directors, in their consideration  
of going concern, have reviewed the 
Group’s future cash forecasts and 
revenue projections, which they believe 
are based on prudent assumptions,  
and based on those forecasts and 
projections, that it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements of the 
Group on the going concern basis.
In arriving at this conclusion, they have 
noted that at 31 March 2009 there was 
substantial headroom against committed 
banking facilities and that these facilities 
do not start to mature until 2012.
Return on capital employed
Total shareholders’ funds at March 2009 
were £1,116m, compared to £651m at 
March 2008. After taking into account 
average net debt, excluding debt used  
to fund Best Buy Europe, and adjusting 
for the amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles and exceptional items, the 
Group generated a return on capital 
employed from continuing operations  
of 8.4% (2008: 2.2%). The return on 
capital employed from continuing  
and discontinued operations was  
8.4% (2008: 12.0%).
Assuming a weighted average cost  
of capital for the period of 5.8%  
(2008: 6.5%), this represents an 
economic value added in respect of 
continuing operations of £36m  
(2008: -£60m) or 2.6% (2008: -4.3%). 
Economic value added for all operations 
on the same basis was £36m (2008: 
£76m) or 2.6% (2008: 5.5%). Directors’ Report – Business Review

Exchange rates Profits adversely affected by exchange rate 
movements; value of assets and liabilities 
similarly affected.
Exchange rate exposures have been reduced 
significantly in the year: our exposure to  
Swiss Francs has been materially eliminated 
following the repatriation of our brand 
management company; our exposure to other 
European currencies has also reduced as a 
result of the sale of half of our non-Sterling 
businesses to Best Buy.

Corporate Responsibility
Retail, as any shopkeeper will tell you,  
is detail: businesses do well because 
they get 1,000 little things right, as much 
as they do because they have a great 
market position or they are selling the 
latest hot product.
We take the same view with our CSR 
programme. We don’t have a grand 
mission statement or a big budget, but 
are gradually looking at all aspects of our 
business to see how we can do things 
better – improve the environment, make 
working easier for our employees, and 
give something back to the community 
that supports us. Over the next few 
pages, we have highlighted some of the 
projects that are new or have made good 
progress during the year. In addition,  
we have started to set ourselves some 
targets for CSR, so our performance  
can be properly quantified by our 
stakeholders.
Charity partners
Our two businesses each have their  
own partner charity. Best Buy Europe 
supports Get Connected, and TalkTalk 
Group supports TreeHouse. We have 
chosen to back two small charities that 
both relate to communication, so we  
can help them not only with fundraising, 
but also with the more practical and 
technical support that is often harder  
for charities to come by.
Get Connected
Get Connected provides a first point of 
contact for young people who need help. 
Originally a telephone service,  
Get Connected now has a hugely 
successful “webchat” platform as well. 
Get Connected provides young people 
with help by:
▪
 providing emotional support; 
▪
 advising on options available to them; 
and
▪
 putting them in touch with the services 
they need.
In addition to raising funds for the  
charity, Best Buy Europe also covers all 
overheads for the charity, including office 
accommodation, IT equipment and 
support, telecommunications and utility 
bills, printing, mailing and marketing 
support. We also offer our employees  
the chance to earn additional holiday  
if they become a helpline volunteer for 
Get Connected.
In February 2009, we held our fifth annual 
charity auction for Get Connected. 
Despite the tougher economic climate, 
through the generosity of our guests and 
those who donated lots to the auction  
we managed to raise over £140,000 
– significantly more than our expectations.
TreeHouse
TreeHouse is the national charity for 
autism education. Its vision is to 
transform through education the lives  
of children with autism and the lives of 
their families.

Community activities
We give Community a broad definition: 
for us it encompasses not only our 
immediate geographical community,  
but other communities around the world 
and the wider social community that  
our services help to create and maintain. 
Our activities here are distinct from  
our charity work in that they are of  
a more practical nature rather than  
the combination of financial and  
skills support that we provide to  
our charity partners. 
Business in the Community (“BITC”)
This year we signed up to BITC, the 
primary national organisation for helping 
companies become better corporate 
citizens across all areas of their activities. 
We are currently undergoing their 
rigorous benchmarking exercise to 
assess how we rate in terms of corporate 
responsibility relative to our peers. These 
results will not be for publication but will 
enable us to see where we are doing  
well and where we should be looking  
to improve; our intention is to become 
part of their public benchmarking 
programme next year.
Business Action on Homelessness 
(“BAOH”)
BITC runs the BAOH programme, which 
is a partnership between business, 
homeless agencies and the Government. 
BAOH aims to break the vicious cycle  
of “no job, no home, no job” by helping 
homeless people gain and sustain 
employment. Carphone Warehouse  
has been a partner of BAOH for a  
few years and has provided several  
work placements resulting in some 
participants being employed by us and 
some gaining employment elsewhere.
We plan to make BAOH one of our key 
areas of focus and are stepping up our 
placement programme. In addition, 
Carphone employees are being trained 
as mentors, who will be resources for 
homeless people as they seek ongoing 
advice on sustaining employment after 
their placements.
Innovation in the Community
The Innovation in the Community Awards 
were launched in 2007 to provide small 
cash awards and broadband connectivity 
to non-profit making institutions  
looking to develop technology-based 
applications to serve specific 
communities. We believe technology 
should be a social enabler, not something 
that creates a divide between the “haves” 
and the “have nots”, and these awards 
aim to address this gap.
In 2008 the TalkTalk Innovation in the 
Community Awards received over 2,200 
entries – over three times the number 
received in 2007. Winners for the year 
included: Screenreader, which supplies 
free software allowing blind people  
to “read” websites; Connection at  
St. Martin’s, which provides IT training  
to homeless people to help them get  
jobs and move off the streets; and 
MusicLink, an arts project which gives 
schoolchildren in isolated areas of 
Cumbria a chance to experiment with 
music technology. Martha Lane-Fox  
was brought on board as a celebrity 
judge to provide mentoring to five  
overall category winners. 
Established in 1997 by a group of 
parents, TreeHouse campaigns for better 
autism education nationally and runs a 
school for children and young people 
with autism. It undertakes policy and 
parliamentary work and research to 
ensure that autism is a national priority, 
supports parents in campaigning locally 
and offers training and consultancy on 
autism education. 
Autism is a lifelong neurological condition 
which affects communication, social 
understanding and behaviour. One in  
100 school age children have autism and 
27% of them have been excluded from 
school, the majority more than once 
(Office of National Statistics, 2005).
In April 2009, TreeHouse launched a new 
website, www.talkaboutautism.org.uk, 
where professionals and parents  
are being encouraged to talk more  
about autism and share knowledge  
and experiences to achieve the  
best educational outcomes for  
autistic children. 
The launch was accompanied by the 
publication of specially-commissioned 
research that highlighted that parents 
face a “postcode lottery” when it comes 
to the quality of services available to 
autistic children, and that over half  
of teachers polled had not received 
training to help them support children 
with autism.
TalkTalk Group helped to fund the 
development of the website and was 
closely involved in the launch, helping  
to generate significant coverage in the 
national and educational press.
The Carphone Warehouse Foundation
The Carphone Warehouse Foundation 
was set up over five years ago to support 
employees with their own fundraising 
initiatives for causes that are close to 
their own hearts. Small grants are 
awarded to charities nominated by 
employees; or where there is a large 
demand for the same charity, a larger 
grant will be made on behalf of the whole 
business.
We support our charitable activities  
in a number of ways, including:
▪
 awarding extra days holiday for 
employees who commit to taking part 
in fundraising activities organised by 
the business; 26 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Directors’ Report – Business Review
Corporate Responsibility – continued
Community projects
We regularly organise overseas 
challenges in which a group of 
employees tackle an infrastructure 
project in developing countries. This 
work cuts across all of our key corporate 
responsibility areas, combining charity 
fundraising, practical community work 
and employee engagement. This year,  
33 employees travelled to Morocco to 
build a bridge for a remote Berber tribe 
to prevent them being cut off from the 
larger cities during floods, and raised 
over £30,000 for our charity partners  
in the process.
Mobile phones and health
In 2007, the UK Mobile 
Telecommunications and Health 
Research (MTHR) programme published 
a detailed report to provide an update  
on the research work it has been 
undertaking since its inception in 2001. 
The work has been funded jointly by 
Government and Industry, and is run by 
an independent programme management 
committee to ensure that none of the 
contributors can influence the outcome 
of the programme. The Carphone 
Warehouse has been a significant 
contributor to research in this area.
None of the research supported by  
the programme and published so far 
demonstrates that biological or adverse 
health effects are produced by 
radiofrequency exposure from mobile 
phones. Specifically, no association was 
found between short-term mobile phone 
use (less than 10 years) and cancers of 
the brain and nervous system. Similarly, 
studies on electrical hypersensitivity 
have not supported the theory that 
symptoms experienced by sufferers 
result from exposure to signals from 
mobile phones and base stations.
The report proposed a further 
programme of work to address areas  
of outstanding concern, which it will 
report on in due course. These include 
whether longer-term mobile phone usage 
increases the risk of developing cancers 
of the brain and nervous system,  
and whether any effects of exposure  
to mobile phone signals are greater  
in children.
The Carphone Warehouse continues to 
take a lead in communicating health 
issues to customers, with leaflets in 
stores and the specific absorption rates 
for every handset we sell listed in our 
buyers’ guide and on our website.
Environmental impact
The Group’s businesses are not, by their 
nature, particularly high impact in terms 
of carbon emissions and waste, but that 
is not to say that we are not committed  
to reducing our impact. This year we 
have begun to take some of the many 
small steps needed to do business 
differently and make a contribution to 
environmental sustainability. Almost all  
of our projects have a real financial 
benefit to the business as well as an 
environmental benefit, so they make 
sense on every level.
Carbon footprint
The carbon footprint for our UK 
businesses is 46,000 tonnes. Our goal  
is to reduce this by 12% by 2012. This 
year we are calculating our non-UK 
carbon footprint and will publish 
combined totals and targets in the  
next annual report.
Mobile phone recycling
With customers typically replacing their 
mobile phones every two years, there  
is a huge number of old phones to be 
processed. We have been recycling 
mobile phones for many years, either 
shipping them for refurbishment and use 
in developing markets, or breaking them 
down into their constituent parts for the 
materials to be used in other products. 
This year we recycled over 130,000 
handsets, an increase of nearly 30%  
on last year. For every handset we 
receive around £10, so this has been  
a major contributor to our charity funds 
over the last few years.
In addition, we are compliant with the 
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
(“WEEE”) Regulations which came into 
force in 2007. These regulations require  
us to finance the collection, treatment and 
recovery of waste electrical equipment, 
and to allow customers to return their 
waste equipment free of charge. 
Information on the correct disposal of 
WEEE is provided to customers with 
relevant products and in stores.
Environmental initiatives
New environmental initiatives over the 
last year include:
▪
 Journey Share: after introducing the 
scheme in December 2007, we now 
have over 500 members sharing lifts  
to work; Directors’ Report – 
Business Review
 www.cpwplc.com 27
▪
 “Bin the bin”: we started a trial in 
March 2009 with a view to rolling it out 
across the business as soon as 
possible;
▪
 water coolers: we have started the 
process of replacing spring water 
coolers with mains-fed units;
▪
 lighting: support centre refits are using 
low intensity lighting and motion 
sensors; and
▪
 store lighting: we are installing motion 
sensitive lighting in all back office 
areas of our stores.
Employees
We continue to take employee 
engagement very seriously. We want 
people to enjoy working for the Group,  
to feel that they are being respected and 
that there are genuine prospects for 
career and personal development, and 
most of all to be part of a good team.
Pulse survey
We introduced Pulse, our new employee 
survey, in February 2008, and now take 
soundings from employees on a range  
of issues every three months. Employee 
engagement, the extent to which 
employees are psychologically and 
emotionally attached to their work, 
positively influences customer 
satisfaction, sales and other measures  
of productivity. Employee engagement  
is a key performance indicator within  
the Group. 
All managers receive data on 
engagement within their team and the 
majority have now been trained in how  
to improve it. As a result the Group  
has seen its already high levels of 
engagement increase. When first 
measured in February 2008, 75% of 
employees were engaged. After manager 
training and work amongst the majority 
of teams the engagement figure for the 
group measured 81% in February 2009. 
Measurement and improvement 
programmes continue throughout the 
year with a view to further increasing  
our performance in this metric. 
One area where we scored less well was 
that employees do not feel that their 
opinion is being valued. To address this, 
we have introduced several listening 
campaigns such as Bringing Back the 
Magic and Every Penny Counts. These 
campaigns involve us actively seeking 
out our employees’ opinions, and we had 
over 300 money-saving ideas in response 
to our Every Penny Counts campaign.
Engagement
The highlights of our employee 
engagement activities over the last year 
were:
▪
 the Morocco project described above;
▪
 a sponsored Skydive for 50 employees 
that raised over £15,000 for our charity 
partners;
▪
 supporting Comic Relief, with 120 
employees giving up a Friday evening 
to staff our call centres to take pledges 
from the public;
▪
 receiving the Bronze Award for Payroll 
Giving by CAF for the number of 
employees who make regular 
charitable donations through payroll. 
We are aiming to reach the gold 
standard by 2010; and
▪
 a mentoring scheme which encourages 
business action on homelessness.
Training and development
There has been a huge amount of 
change in our store proposition over the 
last 12 months, as we start to offer 
laptops, mobile broadband and other 
connected services more widely. We 
could not have done this without a highly 
successful training programme, which 
involved all of our UK retail employees 
attending a “wireless bootcamp” – an 
intensive course for 8,000 people to 
teach them about the new products and 
services we offer. All employees who 
passed a subsequent test were rewarded 
with their own laptop.
We have also continued to invest in  
our leaders and managers, and have 
engaged a specialist consultant to 
manage an extensive leadership 
development programme, designed to 
maximise their own potential and also 
bring out the best from their teams.
Employee turnover
Employee turnover can be a significant 
cost to a business, and given the young 
average age typically prevalent in retail 
and call centre operations, the Group  
is particularly sensitive to changes  
in leaving rates. 28 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

Directors’ Report –  
Governance
Directors’ Report – Governance
Corporate Governance
Introduction
The Board of Directors recognises the 
importance of high standards of 
corporate governance. This Report and 
the Remuneration Report set out on 
pages 33 to 38 explain that the Company 
has complied during the period with the 
principles contained in Section 1 of the 
2006 Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (“Code”). In accordance  
with the Listing Rules issued by the 
Financial Services Authority, the relevant 
parts of this Report have been reviewed 
by the auditors and their opinion is 
contained in the Independent Auditors’ 
Report on page 41.
Board of Directors
Composition of the Board
There are currently two Executive 
Directors and six Non-Executive 
Directors (including the Non-Executive 
Chairman). Biographies of each of the 
Directors, their responsibilities and Board 
Committee memberships are set out on 
page 28. The following changes to the 
Board have taken place since last year’s 
Annual Report:
On 31 July 2008 David Goldie and 
Andrew Harrison stood down as 
Executive Directors and Adrian Martin 
stood down as a Non-Executive Director. 
On 7 December 2008, David Ross 
resigned as Deputy Non-Executive 
Chairman.
Between the period of 30 March 2008 
and 31 July 2008, the Board comprised 
four Executive Directors and eight 
Non-Executive Directors (including the 
Non-Executive Chairman and Non-
Executive Deputy Chairman). Following 
David Goldie, Andrew Harrison and 
Adrian Martin standing down, the number 
of Executive Directors decreased to  
two and the number of Non-Executive 
Directors decreased to seven. Following 
the resignation of David Ross on  
7 December 2008, the number of 
Non-Executive Directors reduced to six.
Between the period of 30 March 2008 
and 31 July 2008, six of the Non- 
Executive Directors (excluding the 
Non-Executive Chairman and the 
Non-Executive Deputy Chairman)  
were considered to be Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. They were  
Sir Brian Pitman, Baroness Morgan, 
David Mansfield, Steven Esom,  
Adrian Martin and David Grigson. 
Following Adrian Martin standing down, 
the number of Non-Executive Directors 
(excluding the Non-Executive Chairman 
and the Non-Executive Deputy Chairman) 
considered to be Independent  
Non-Executive Directors reduced to five.
Charles Dunstone is the Chief Executive 
Officer, John Gildersleeve is Non-
Executive Chairman and Sir Brian Pitman 
is the Senior Independent Director.
All Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting following appointment and 
thereafter to re-election at least every 
three years. Both Executive Directors 
have a service contract that can be 
terminated by either the Company or the 
Director on 12 months’ notice or less.
The Non-Executive Directors have three 
year periods of appointment, the terms  
of which are substantially in the same 
format as suggested by the Code, with 
three month notice periods and no 
compensation for loss of office. Further 
details on each Director’s remuneration, 
including the dates of their contracts  
with the Company, are set out in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 33 to 38.
Board meetings
The Board meets formally at least six 
times a year, with additional meetings  
as required. All Board papers are sent 
out on a timely basis with sufficient 
information for the Directors to be able  
to discharge their duties. The Board met 
formally six times during the period 
(including a strategy day). All Directors 
formally attended these meetings with 
the exception of Steven Esom who  
was absent from the meeting held on  
20 May 2008 due to a prior engagement 
that could not be changed. The Company 
Secretary ensures that all Board papers 
are sent out to non-attending Directors 
and that, where possible, any comments 
they have are received beforehand  
so that they can be expressed at  
the meeting.
Operation of the Board
The wide range of experience and 
expertise of the Non-Executive Directors, 
combined with the skill sets of the 
Executive Directors, provides vast 
experience of retailing, mobile and fixed 
line telecommunications and general 
business experience, strong personal 
skills and independence of thought and 
perspective. The overriding responsibility 
of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial 
and responsible leadership to the Group 
within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls. These controls allow 
for the key issues and risks facing the 
business to be assessed and managed. 
The Board determines the overall 
strategic direction for the Group, reviews 
management performance and ensures 
that the necessary financial and human 
resources are in place to enable the 
Group to meet its objectives. The Board 
is comfortable that the necessary 
controls and resources exist within the 
Group to enable these responsibilities  
to be met. The Board ensures that  
the Directors, and in particular the 
Non-Executive Directors, develop an 
understanding of the views of major 
shareholders about the Company. The 
Company regularly communicates with 
major shareholders and has a dedicated 
internal investor relations department. 
Briefings on market activity, together with 
the views of shareholders and analysts 
on the Company, are also regularly 
provided to the Board.
There is a clear and documented division 
of responsibilities between the roles of 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer. There are also documented 
schedules of matters reserved to the 
Board and matters delegated to 
Committees of the Board. Such reserved 
matters include decisions on strategic 
and policy issues, the approval of 
published financial statements and major 
acquisitions and disposals, authority 
levels for expenditure, treasury and risk 
management policies. Strategic and 
policy issues are reviewed annually at a 
combined Board and senior executive 
strategy day.
Performance evaluation
During the period the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience of the 
Directors was reviewed. The Board, and 
each individual Director, also undertook 
performance evaluations. Using the 
Higgs ‘Suggestions for Good Practice’ as 
guidance, the individual Directors initially 
completed separate questionnaires. The 
results were collated for and analysed by 
the Chairman, the Senior Independent 
Director, the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Board as a whole. The areas covered 
included the roles of the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors, the Board, the 
Board Committees, the Chairman of the  30 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Directors’ Report – Governance
Corporate Governance – continued
Company, preparation for and 
performance at meetings, the 
effectiveness of each Director, 
leadership, culture and corporate 
governance. The results were then 
considered by the Board as a specific 
item of business. The Board intends that 
these exercises or similar ones continue 
to be carried out each year.
Following such performance evaluation 
the Chairman confirms that all those 
Non-Executive Directors seeking 
re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting continue to be effective and 
demonstrate a commitment to the role, 
including having time to attend all 
necessary meetings and to carry out 
other appropriate duties.
The Chairman meets regularly with all the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors 
usually in the evening prior to a Board 
meeting. This provides the opportunity  
to raise any questions regarding the 
performance of the Executive Directors 
or in respect of any other matters.
The Senior Independent Director also 
met with the Non-Executive Directors, in 
the absence of the Chairman, to assess 
the Chairman’s effectiveness, having first 
reviewed the results of a performance 
evaluation questionnaire completed by  
all the Directors apart from the Chairman. 
The Board is of the opinion that the 
Chairman had no other significant 
commitments during the period that 
would have affected his performance  
in his role.
External appointments
The Board supports Executive Directors 
taking up Non-Executive Directorships as 
part of their continued development, and 
the Board believes that this will ultimately 
benefit the Company. Further details are 
provided in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 33 to 38.
Board Committees
There are five key Board Committees: 
Audit, Remuneration, Nomination, 
Insurance Compliance and Consumer 
Regulation Compliance. The Committees 
are provided with sufficient resources  
via the Company Secretary and, where 
necessary, have direct access to 
independent professional advisors to 
undertake their duties.
Audit Committee
The Committee currently comprises the 
following Independent Non-Executive 
Directors: David Grigson (Chairman),  
Sir Brian Pitman, David Mansfield,  
Steven Esom and Baroness Morgan. 
David Grigson served as Chairman 
throughout the year. All of the Committee 
members have extensive commercial 
experience. The Committee met formally 
four times during the year. All members 
attended each meeting, with the 
exception of Steven Esom who was 
absent from the meeting on 20 May 2008 
due to a prior engagement that could  
not be changed. 
The Chairman of the Committee updates 
the Board on any significant issues that 
may have arisen at the Board meeting 
following each Committee meeting. 
During the year, all the requirements of 
the Code in respect of the Committee 
were met. The work undertaken by the 
Committee is described within the 
following sections of this Report.
The Group’s Chief Financial Officer and 
other senior management attend 
Committee meetings by invitation of the 
Committee. Representatives of the 
Company’s external auditors and the 
other senior executives from Finance, Tax, 
Treasury, Legal and Risk and Business 
Assurance also attend these meetings by 
invitation of the Committee. The external 
and internal auditors have direct access  
to the Committee during formal meetings 
and time is set aside for them to have 
private discussions with the Committee,  
in the absence of management.
The Committee’s terms of reference, 
which are available on request from  
the Company Secretary and are 
published on the Group’s website  
(www.cpwplc.com), comply with the 
Code. During the period, the formal 
calendar of items considered at each 
Audit Committee meeting within each 
annual cycle embraced the Code 
requirements to: 
▪
 monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Company, and any 
formal announcements relating to  
the Company’s financial performance, 
including reviewing significant financial 
reporting judgements contained  
in them;
▪
 review the Company’s internal financial 
controls and its internal control and 
risk management systems and to make 
recommendations to the Board;
▪
 review the Company’s arrangements 
by which employees may raise 
concerns in confidence;
▪
 monitor and review the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal audit function;
▪
 make recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment,  
re-appointment and removal of 
external auditors and to approve  
their remuneration and terms of 
engagement;
▪
 review and monitor the external 
auditors’ independence and objectivity 
and the effectiveness of the audit 
process, taking into consideration 
relevant UK professional and 
regulatory requirements; and
▪
 review the Company’s policy on the 
engagement of the external auditors  
to supply non-audit services. In this 
context the Committee’s remit requires 
it to report to the Board identifying any 
matters in respect of which it considers 
that action or improvement is needed 
and to make recommendations as to 
the steps to be taken.
In light of the assessments and  
review undertaken, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that  
Deloitte LLP be retained as auditors  
of the Company. This recommendation 
was endorsed by the Board.
The policy relating to the provision of 
non-audit services by the external 
auditors specifies the types of work from 
which the external auditors are excluded; 
for which the external auditors can be 
engaged without referral to the Committee; 
and for which a case-by-case decision  
is required. In order to safeguard the 
auditors’ objectivity and independence, 
the ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees is 
monitored by the Committee within an 
overall limit set by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Committee.  www.cpwplc.com 31
Directors’ Report –  
Governance
A statement of fees paid or accrued for 
services from the external auditors 
during the period is set out below:
 2009 2008
 £m  £m
Audit services:
– statutory audit*  0.9 1.6
Tax services 1.1  0.3
Other services 0.4 0.3
Total  2.4 2.2
*  The Group’s share of audit fees for joint ventures 
and associates was £0.6m in the year.
Certain non-audit services are pre-
approved by the Committee depending 
upon the nature and size of the service. 
Tax services principally comprise 
technical advice associated with  
relevant UK and international fiscal  
laws and regulations and, in particular, 
assessment of the potential implications 
of proposed corporate transactions or 
restructuring. Having undertaken a 
review of the non-audit related work, the 
Committee has satisfied itself that the 
services undertaken during the period 
did not prejudice the external auditors’ 
independence.
At each of its meetings the Committee 
reviewed and considered reports on Risk 
and Business Assurance on the status of 
the Group’s risk management systems, 
findings from the internal audit function 
concerning internal controls, and reports 
on the status of any weaknesses in 
internal controls identified by the internal 
or external auditors.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee currently comprises the 
following independent Non-Executive 
Directors: Sir Brian Pitman (Chairman), 
David Mansfield, Steven Esom,

each member attended the meeting.
The Committee’s terms of reference 
comply with the Code and are available 
from the Company Secretary on request 
and are published on the Group’s 
website (www.cpwplc.com). The 
Committee is responsible for succession 
planning at Board level, overseeing the 
selection and appointment of Directors, 
regularly reviewing the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and making  
its recommendations to the Board.  
It assists in evaluating the commitments 
of individual Directors and the balance  
of skills, knowledge and experience  
on the Board.
Insurance Compliance Committee
The Committee is chaired by Baroness 
Morgan and is attended by senior 
executives. The role of the Committee is 
to review the Group’s compliance with 
regulatory matters concerning the sale of 
insurance products to customers and to 
provide the Non-Executive Directors, 
through Baroness Morgan, with visibility 
of compliance issues. The Committee 
met formally four times during the period. 
The Chairman of the Committee also 
updates the Board following each 
Committee meeting.
Consumer Regulation Compliance 
Committee
The Committee is chaired by David 
Mansfield and is attended by senior 
executives. The role of the Committee is 
to review the Group’s compliance with 
fixed line regulatory matters, consumer 
regulation across the fixed and mobile 
businesses including Trading Standards, 
Data Protection and Advertising 
Standards, and to provide the Non-
Executive Directors, through David 
Mansfield, with visibility of these 
compliance issues. The Committee met 
formally three times during the period. 
The Chairman of the Committee also 
updates the Board following each 
Committee meeting.
Risk management and internal control
The Company has established a risk 
management programme that assists 
management throughout the Company  
to identify, assess and mitigate business, 
financial, operational and compliance 
risks. The Board views management of 
risk as integral to good business 
practice. The programme is designed to 
support management’s decision making 
and to improve the reliability of business 
performance.
The risk management programme is 
supported by a dedicated team of risk 
specialists, including internal auditors, 
who comprise the Group Risk and 
Business Assurance function. To ensure 
that all parts of the Group have a good 
understanding of risk, members of this 
team have conducted risk workshops 
and reviews within each of the main 
operating divisions in the past year, 
culminating in an assessment of key 
business risks by the Executive  
Directors and senior management.  
These risk assessments have been 
wide-ranging, covering risks arising from 
the regulatory environment, strategy, 
counter-parties and organisational 
change associated both with major 
projects and with acquisitions. The  
risk management process operates 
throughout the Group, being applied 
equally to the main business divisions 
and corporate functions.
The output from each annual assessment 
is a list of key strategic, financial, 
operational and compliance risks. 
Associated action plans and controls  
to mitigate them are also put in place 
where this is possible and to the extent 
considered appropriate by the Board 
taking account of costs and benefits. 
Changes in the status of the key risks 
and changes to the risk matrix are 
reported regularly to the Audit 
Committee and at each Board Meeting. 32 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Directors’ Report – Governance
Corporate Governance – continued
The Directors have overall responsibility 
for the Group’s systems of internal control 
and for reviewing their effectiveness.  
The Board delegates to executive 
management the responsibility for 
designing, operating and monitoring 
these systems. The systems are based on 
a process of identifying, evaluating and 
managing key risks and include the risk 
management processes set out above.
The systems of internal control were  
in place throughout the period and up  
to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and financial statements. The 
effectiveness of these systems is 
periodically reviewed by the Audit 
Committee in accordance with the 
revised guidance in the Turnbull Report. 
These systems are also refined as 
necessary to meet changes in the 
Group’s business and associated risks. 
The systems of internal control are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. They can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material errors, losses, fraud or 
breaches of laws and regulations.
The Board has conducted an annual 
review of the effectiveness of the 
systems of risk management and internal 
control in operation during the year and 
up to the date of the approval of the 
Annual Report and financial statements 
and this was approved by the Audit 
Committee and the Board.
This is supported by an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the risks faced by the Group, by the 
Group Risk and Business Assurance 
function.
Communication with investors
The Board believes it is important to 
explain business developments and 
financial results to the Company’s 
shareholders and to understand any 
shareholder concerns. The principal 
communication media used to impart 
information to shareholders are news 
releases (including results 
announcements) and Company 
publications. In all such communications, 
care is taken to ensure that no price 
sensitive information is released.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer have lead responsibility 
for investor relations. They are supported 
by a dedicated investor relations 
department that, amongst other matters, 
organises presentations for analysts and 
institutional investors. There is a full 
programme of regular dialogue with 
major institutional shareholders, fund 
managers, analysts, retail brokers and 
credit investors, upon which the 
Chairman ensures that the Board 
receives regular updates at Board 
meetings. The Board also receives 
periodic reports on investors’ views  
of the performance of the Company.  
All the Non-Executive Directors and,  
in particular, the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director, are available to 
meet with major shareholders, if such 
meetings are required.
The Company also communicates with 
shareholders through the Annual General 
Meeting, at which the Chairman gives an 
account of the progress of the business 
over the last year, and a review of current 
issues, and provides the opportunity for 
shareholders to ask questions.

Remuneration Report
Compliance
This Remuneration Report has been 
prepared in accordance with the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 (“Regulations”) and  
the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (“Code”). The constitution 
and operation of the Remuneration 
Committee are in compliance with  
the Code. In framing its remuneration 
policy the Committee has given full 
consideration to the matters set out in 
Schedule A of the Code. As required by 
the Regulations, a resolution to approve 
this Report will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on  
23 July 2009 (“AGM”). The Regulations 
require the Company’s auditors to report 
to the members on the “auditable part” 
of this Report (marked *) and to state,  
in their opinion, that this part of the 
Report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 
1985 (as amended by the Regulations).
Remuneration Committee
Responsibility for the establishment of 
overall remuneration policy for the Group 
lies with the Board of Directors. The 
Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for making recommendations to the 
Board on the remuneration of the 
Chairman, Executive Directors and senior 
managers. The terms of reference of the 
Committee are available on the Group’s 
website (www.cpwplc.com) or on request 
from the Company Secretary.
The Committee’s current composition  
is Sir Brian Pitman (Chairman), Steven 
Esom, David Mansfield, Baroness 
Morgan and David Grigson, all of whom 
are Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. None of the members of the 
Committee has any personal financial 
interest, other than as shareholders,  
in the matters to be decided by the 
Committee, no potential conflicts of 
interest arising from cross-memberships 
and no day-to-day involvement in running 
the Group’s business. The members of 
the Committee met four times during the 
year to consider matters relating to the 
remuneration of Executive Directors as 
well as the terms and conditions of their 
service with the Company. Adrian Martin 
attended the first meeting before 
standing down on 31 July 2008.
Mercer Ltd (“Mercer”) act as lead 
advisors to the Committee. Advice has 
been sought from Mercer on matters 
surrounding remuneration policy design 
and benchmarking for individual 
Executive Directors and members of 
senior management and the design of 
remuneration packages and medium- 
and long-term incentive plans based on 
current market trends. Mercer has no 
other connection with the Group. Deloitte 
LLP (“Deloitte”) provided advice to the 
Committee on employment tax and the 
administration of share option and SAYE 
schemes. Deloitte are the Group’s 
auditors and provide other services to 
the Group as set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 29 to 32. 
Advice was also provided by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in relation 
to the valuation of share option schemes. 
The Group Director of Human Resources 
and the Company Secretary also 
provided internal advice in respect  
of matters raised by the Committee.  
No Director nor any person advising the 
Committee plays a part in any discussion 
about his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee seeks to ensure that 
remuneration and incentive schemes are 
in line with best practice, providing a 
strong link to individual and business 
performance and ensuring alignment 
between employees and shareholders.
Rewards are designed to attract and 
retain individuals of high quality who 
have the requisite skills and who are 
incentivised to achieve levels of 
performance that exceed those of 
competitor companies. This requires 
packages to be market-competitive  
and capable of rewarding exceptional 
performance. The approach is to set fixed 
remuneration at market median levels and 
to offer variable rewards, linked to the 
performance of the Group, which can 
provide significant overall levels of 
remuneration for exceptional performance 
and shareholder value creation. 
In order to closely align the interests of 
Executive Directors and shareholders, 
the Company requires Executive 
Directors to build up and retain a 
shareholding in the Company of at least 
200% of their annual salary. 
Components of Remuneration
The main fixed and performance-related 
elements of remuneration that can  
be awarded to Executive Directors are  
as follows:
▪ 
basic salary, benefits and pension 
contribution (fixed);
▪ 
annual performance bonus 
(variable); and
▪ 
share options and performance 
shares (variable).
Salaries and Benefits
A pay freeze has been introduced for  
the forthcoming year. As a result 
Executive Directors will receive no 
increase to their basic salary this year.
Annual Performance Bonus
Bonuses are governed by performance 
conditions set by the Remuneration 
Committee to ensure that maximum 
variable rewards are paid only for 
exceptional performance. The bonus 
scheme for the period ended 31 March 
2009 was based on Headline EPS  
(see notes 11 and 12 to the financial 
statements) before tax. The target has 
not been met and accordingly no 
bonuses will be paid to Executive 
Directors this year.
The bonus scheme for Executive 
Directors for the period ending  
31 March 2010 will have targets based  
on improvements in Headline EPS before 
tax, together with specific business unit 
targets based on a balanced scorecard 
approach, with a maximum payment of 
200% of annual salary.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied 
that this bonus structure will provide  
an excellent link between reward  
and improved performance for all 
stakeholders and the creation of further 
shareholder value.
Medium-Term Incentive Plan
The Company has introduced a medium-
term incentive plan for Executive 
Directors measured against a 10%  
to 30% increase in the total market 
capitalisation of the Company between 
June 2009 and December 2010, with a 
maximum payment capped at 250% of 
annual salary. The share price for the 
start of the plan will be the average 
closing price of the Company’s shares 
during the 30 day period immediately 
prior to the announcement of the 
Company’s preliminary results in June 
2009. The share price for the end of the 
plan will be the average closing price  
of the Company’s shares during the  
30 day period immediately prior to the 
announcement of the Company’s  
trading update in January 2011. The 
Remuneration Committee believes that 
this plan is directly related to an increase 
in shareholder value and is for the benefit 
of all stakeholders. Charles Dunstone will 
not participate in the plan. 34 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

Remuneration Report – continued
Annual Deferred Bonus Plan
As bonus targets have not been met  
it has not been necessary to review  
this scheme.
Share Options
The Company has a share option scheme 
for Executive Directors and senior 
managers both in the UK and overseas. 
No options were granted to Executive 
Directors in the period ended 31 March 
2009. A UK savings-related share option 
scheme is open to all eligible Group 
employees including Executive Directors. 
No Executive Directors are currently in 
this scheme. 
Performance Share Plan
Awards of Performance Shares pursuant 
to the Performance Share Plan approved 
at the Annual General Meeting on 28 July 
2004 were made to certain individuals in 
the period ended 1 April 2006. These 
awards were subject to a mixture of 
Headline EPS and Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) performance targets 
measured over a three or four year 
performance period. In December 2006 
the Remuneration Committee awarded  
a further grant under the Performance 
Share Plan. This award is subject to  
TSR performance targets measured 
against an initial performance period to  
4 June 2010 and a subsequent 
performance period to 4 June 2011.  
The TSR calculation is independently 
calculated for the Remuneration 
Committee by Mercer. Details of the 
grants to Executive Directors and the 
performance targets are set out in the 
share tables later in the Report.
No awards were made to Executive 
Directors during the year ended  
31 March 2009.
Value Enhancement Scheme
It will be proposed at the AGM that  
the Company introduce two separate 
Value Enhancement Schemes. One is a 
long-term incentive scheme for Executive 
Directors and senior executives of the 
Company. Under the scheme employees 
will initially receive shares in the 
Company’s two main businesses, being 
the TalkTalk Group businesses and the 
Best Buy Europe businesses, that will 
only vest and convert into shares of the 
Company if certain performance targets 
have been achieved. Further details of 
the scheme are contained in the Notice 
of the AGM accompanying this Report. 
Major institutional shareholders and the 
Association of British Insurers have been 
consulted about the proposed scheme.  
A similar long-term incentive scheme  
for senior executives of the TalkTalk 
Group businesses will also be proposed 
and further details of this scheme are 
also contained in the Notice of the  
AGM. It is the intention that relevant 
employees will not be granted awards 
under both schemes in any one year. 
Charles Dunstone will not participate  
in this scheme.

Pension Contributions*
The schedule below sets out payments by the Group to defined contribution pension schemes on behalf of Executive  
Directors. Roger Taylor has a Self Invested Pension Plan. Under both schemes, a fixed proportion of salary is paid by the 
Company together with a fixed proportion by the Executive Director and both amounts are invested on behalf of the Executive 
Director. Pension benefits are then funded by the total investment. Levels are reviewed annually against published market data. 
None of the Directors was a member of a defined benefit pension scheme during the period. Pension entitlements are based  
on basic salary only.

Directors’ Report –  
Governance
External Appointments
The Board supports Executive Directors 
holding Non-Executive Directorships of 
other companies and believes that such 
appointments are part of the continuing 
development of the Executive Directors 
from which the Company will ultimately 
benefit. The Board has reviewed all such 
appointments and those appointments 
that the Board believes require disclosure 
pursuant to the Code are set out below. 
The Board has also agreed that the 
Directors may retain their fees from  
such appointments.
Currently, Charles Dunstone is a  
Non-Executive Director of The Daily Mail 
and General Trust PLC and Independent 
Media Distribution PLC, for which the 
annual fees are £34,167 and £20,000 
respectively. During the period he was a 
Non-Executive director of HBOS PLC  
for which he received £7,167. He does  
not currently intend to take on any 
additional responsibilities. David Goldie 
was a Non-Executive Director of the 
Cheshire Building Society during the 
period, for which he received £10,358.
Fees for Non-Executive Directors
The fees for each of the Non-Executive 
Directors are determined by the Board 
after considering external market 
research. Non-Executive Directors,  
other than John Gildersleeve, receive a

Other Statutory Information
Employment of disabled people
It is the Group’s policy to encourage application for 
employment from disabled people and to assist with their 
training and career development, having regard to particular 
aptitudes and abilities. Every endeavour is made to find 
suitable alternative employment and to re-train any employee 
who becomes disabled while serving the Group.
Employee involvement
The Group places significant emphasis on its employees’ 
involvement in the business at all levels. Managers are 
remunerated according to results wherever possible and all 
employees are kept informed of issues affecting the Group 
through formal and informal meetings and through the Group’s 
internal publications. Members of the management team 
regularly visit all Group locations and discuss matters of 
current interest and concern with employees.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of transactions, including 
payment terms, with suppliers and, provided that suppliers 
perform in accordance with the agreed terms, it is the Group’s 
normal practice that payment is made accordingly. Details of 
the average credit period taken on trade payables are provided 
in note 20 to the financial statements.
Donations
The Group made charitable donations of £217,000 during the 
year (2008: £220,000). No political donations were made

capital during the year are provided in notes 24 and 25 to  
the financial statements.

Directors the current open market value of the Group’s 
interests in freehold land and buildings exceeds the book value

Directors’ Report – Governance
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial period. The Directors are required 
by the International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) Regulation  
to prepare the Group financial statements under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”). The financial statements are also 
required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ requires that 
financial statements present fairly for each financial year the 
Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with 
the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and 
Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors  
are also required to:
▪ properly select and apply accounting policies;
▪ present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
▪ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance.
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval  
of this Report confirms that:
▪ so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
▪ the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditors are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies 
Act 1985.
The Directors have elected to prepare the individual company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). The individual 
Company financial statements are required by law to give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company.  
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
▪ select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
▪ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
▪ state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
▪ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 
and the effective provisions of the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
corporate website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm to the best of our knowledge: 
▪ the Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
▪ the Business Review, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties they face.

Independent Auditors’ Report
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of  
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of  
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2009 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, and the related notes 1 to 33. These Group financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies 
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual Company 
financial statements of The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC 
for the year ended 31 March 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements  
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial 
statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group 
financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report described as having been audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies  
Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with  
the Group financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for  
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions  
of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we  
report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether 
the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks  
and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of  
the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk  
and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it  
is consistent with the audited Group financial statements.  
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the Group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made 
by the Directors in the preparation of the Group financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give 
reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the Group financial statements and the part  
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
▪ the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March  
2009 and of its profit for the year then ended;
▪ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation; 
▪ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described 
as having been audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
▪ the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the Group financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements
through amortisation expense in the income statement over  
the minimum subscription period. The Group has changed its 
policy to expense these costs in operating expenses as the 
costs are incurred. Having undertaken a comprehensive review 
of the accounting policies of other businesses operating in  
the telecommunications sector, the Directors believe that the 
change in policy will provide greater comparability with such 
businesses and will therefore provide reliable and more 
relevant information to shareholders and other users of the 
financial statements.
In accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors’ comparative information  
has been restated to reflect this change in policy, as detailed  
in note 33.
d) Foreign currency translation
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using 
forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies and are 
recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rates 
thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Material 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are hedged, mainly using forward foreign exchange 
contracts to create matching liabilities and assets, and are 
retranslated at each balance sheet date. Hedge accounting  
as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ has been applied in the current period by 
marking to market the relevant financial instruments at the 
balance sheet date and recognising the gain or loss in reserves 
in respect of cash flow hedges, and through the income 
statement in respect of fair value hedges.
Financial instruments are also used for the purposes of net 
investment hedging. Hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges  
in that the gain or loss on the effective portion of the  
hedges is recognised in equity, while any gains or losses  
on any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the  
income statement. 
The results of overseas operations are translated at the 
average foreign exchange rates for the period, and their 
balance sheets are translated at the rates prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. Goodwill is held in the currency of the 
operations to which it relates. Exchange differences arising  
on the translation of opening net assets, goodwill and results  
of overseas operations are recognised in the translation 
reserve. All other exchange differences are included in the 
income statement.
The principal exchange rates against Sterling used in these 
financial statements are as follows:

1 Accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC (“the Company”) is 
incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (“the Group”) have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 
and the effective provisions of the Companies Act 2006. These 
financial statements therefore comply with Article 4 of the 
European Union International Accounting Standard regulation. 
The Company continues to apply United Kingdom GAAP in the 
preparation of its individual financial statements, which are 
contained on pages 88 to 92.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis. Details of the considerations undertaken  
by the Directors in reaching this conclusion are set out on  
page 22 within the Business Review. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments and investments. The financial statements are 
presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest million.  
The Group’s principal accounting policies are set out below.
b) Basis of consolidation
The financial statements reflect the Group’s results for the 
period from 30 March 2008 to 31 March 2009 (“the year”). 
Comparative information is provided for the 52 week period 
ended 29 March 2008. In prior periods, the Group reported 
using a weekly financial (“retail”) calendar under which the 
financial statements were drawn up to the closest Saturday to 
31 March. Following the part-disposal of the Group’s retail and 
distribution business on 30 June 2008 the Group elected to 
move to a fixed period end of 31 March, which is better suited 
to the operating cycles of the Group’s telecoms business, 
TalkTalk Group. From 30 June 2008 the retail and distribution 
business is reported as a joint venture. This business continues 
to report to a retail calendar and its results are drawn up to  
4 April 2009.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates 
acquired or sold during the year are included from or to the 
date on which control or significant influence passed. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between subsidiaries 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to 
bring accounting policies used into line with those used by  
the Group.
c) Change in accounting policy – subscriber  
acquisition costs
Subscriber acquisition costs comprise the direct third-party 
costs of recruiting and retaining customers, net of incentives 
from network operators and provision for in-contract churn. 
In prior years these costs were capitalised as an intangible 
asset, to the extent that they were supported by expected 
future cash inflows, and amortised on a straight-line basis   www.cpwplc.com 47
Financial Statements
For schemes with external performance criteria, the number of 
options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of 
leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative expense 
since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the income 
statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves. 
If a share-based payment scheme is cancelled, any  
remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed 
through the income statement. If a share-based payment 
scheme is forfeited, no further expense is recognised and  
any charges previously recognised through the income 
statement are reversed.
g) Pensions
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to 
the income statement as they become payable in accordance 
with the rules of the schemes.
h) Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when payment has been 
received. Final dividend distributions are recognised as a 
liability in the financial statements in the period in which they 
are approved by the Group’s shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recognised in the year in which they are paid.
i) Leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of  
the lease.
Lease incentives and rent-free periods are amortised through 
the income statement over the period of the lease.
Gains or losses from sale and leaseback transactions are 
deferred over the life of the new lease to the extent that the 
rentals are considered to be above or below market rentals. 
The remaining gain or loss is recognised within operating 
expenses in the period in which the sale is completed.
j) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax,  
is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences 
between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the 
balance sheet and its tax base. 
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in 
respect of taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets 
represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of 
deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of 
unused tax losses and credits. Deferred tax is determined 
using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax 
liability is settled. 
Deferred tax is provided on the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries, except where the timing of the  
reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and  
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. 
e) Revenue and supplier bonuses
Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales-related taxes.
The following accounting policies are applied to the Group’s 
revenue streams:
▪ Revenue generated from the provision of fixed and mobile 
network services is recognised as it is earned over the lives 
of the relevant customers. 
▪ Revenue arising on the sale of mobile and other products 
and services is recognised when the relevant products or 
services are provided.
▪ Commission receivable on sales, being commission which is 
contractually committed, and for which there are no ongoing 
performance criteria, is recognised when the sales to which 
the commission relates are made, net of any provision for 
promotional offers and network operator performance 
penalties. Commission includes the Group’s share of 
customer airtime spend, to the extent that it can be reliably 
measured and there are no ongoing service obligations.
▪ Other ongoing revenue, including customer retention and 
customer spend bonuses, is recognised as it is earned over  
the lives of the relevant customers.
▪ Volume bonuses receivable from network operators are 
recognised when the conditions on which they are earned 
have been met.
▪ Volume bonuses received from suppliers of products are 
recognised as an offset to product cost when the conditions 
on which they are earned have been met, and are 
recognised within cost of sales when the products to which 
the volume bonus relates have been sold.
▪ Insurance premiums are typically paid monthly or quarterly 
in advance. Initial administration fees, which are specified  
in the contract, are recognised at the point of sale; 
insurance premium income is recognised over the lives  
of the relevant policies.
▪ All other revenue is recognised when the relevant goods 
or services are provided.
f) Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant, and expensed over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model for share-
based payments with internal performance criteria (such as 
Earnings Per Share targets) and a Monte Carlo model for those 
with external performance criteria (such as Total Shareholder 
Return targets). 
For schemes with internal performance criteria, the number of 
options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet 
date, based on expectations of performance against target  
and of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative 
expense since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the 
income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves. 48 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Notes to the Financial Statements – continued
is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, 
of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful 
life from the date it is brought into use, as follows:
Freehold buildings 2-4% per annum
Short leasehold costs 10% or the lease term if less
Network equipment  
and Computer hardware 12.5-50% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 20-25% per annum
Motor vehicles  25% per annum
m) Recoverable amount of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is 
any indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an 
indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal 
estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset 
is considered to be impaired and is written down through an 
accelerated amortisation charge to its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, and is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets.
n) Investments
Investments, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures and 
associates, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value 
of the consideration given plus any transaction costs 
associated with the acquisition.
Investments are categorised as available-for-sale and are then 
recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value, together with any 
related taxation, are taken directly to reserves, and recycled to 
the income statement when the investment is sold or 
determined to be impaired.
o) Interests in joint ventures and associates
Interests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for 
using the equity method. The consolidated income statement 
includes the Group’s share of the post-tax profits or losses of 
the joint ventures and associates based on their financial 
statements for the year. In the consolidated balance sheet, the 
Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates are shown as 
a non-current asset in the balance sheet, representing the 
Group’s investment in the share capital of the joint ventures 
and associates, as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the 
Group’s share of the net assets or liabilities less provision for 
any impairment. Any associated goodwill is included within the 
carrying value of the investment and is assessed for 
impairment as part of that investment.
Where a joint venture has net liabilities, any loans advanced to 
the venture are included in the Group’s equity-accounted 
investment in it. Where a venture has net assets, any loans 
advanced to it are shown separately in the balance sheet, as a 
receivable to the Group.
p) Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost, net of discounts and volume bonuses from product 
suppliers (see note 1e), includes all direct costs incurred in 
bringing stock to its present location and condition and 
represents finished goods and goods for resale. Net realisable 
value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs 
1 Accounting policies – continued
j) Taxation – continued
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Current and deferred tax is 
recognised in the income statement except where it relates  
to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is 
recognised directly in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is  
a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
k) Intangible assets
Goodwill:
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings 
and businesses, representing the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities acquired, is recognised initially as an asset at cost 
and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. At the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to 
benefit from the combination and held in the currency of the 
operations to which the goodwill relates. Goodwill is reviewed 
at least annually for impairment, or more frequently where there 
is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. Impairment is 
determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGUs to 
which the goodwill relates. Where the future cash flows are less 
than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is 
recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill 
is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Software and licences:
Software and licences includes internal infrastructure and 
design costs incurred in the development of software for 
internal use. Internally generated software is recognised as an 
intangible asset only if it can be separately identified, it is 
probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, 
and the development cost can be measured reliably. Where 
these conditions are not met, development expenditure is 
recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
Software and licences are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful economic lives of up to 8 years. 
Key money:
Key money paid to enter a property is stated at cost, net of 
amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is 
provided on key money at rates calculated to write off the cost, 
less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over 10 
years or the lease term if less.
Acquisition intangibles:
Acquired intangible assets (“acquisition intangibles”) such as 
customer bases, customer revenue share agreements, brands 
and other intangible assets acquired through a business 
combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and 
amortised over their expected useful lives of up to 6 years on a 
straight-line basis. The value attributed to such assets is based 
on the future economic benefit that is expected to be derived 
from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows 
after a deduction for contributory assets.
l) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation    www.cpwplc.com 49
Financial Statements
u) Discontinued operations
Further to the sale of 50% of the Group’s retail and distribution 
business on 30 June 2008, the income statement and cash 
flow statement for the year ended 29 March 2008 have been 
restated to reclassify profits and losses and cash flows 
associated with this business as discontinued operations.  
A reconciliation of restated results to the financial statements 
previously published is provided in note 33.
v) Use of critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are continually reviewed and revised as 
necessary. Whilst every effort is made to ensure that such 
estimates and assumptions are reasonable, by their nature 
they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and 
assumptions may have a material impact in the financial 
statements.
The principal balances in the financial statements where 
changes in estimates and assumptions may have a material 
impact are as follows:
Recoverable amount of non-current assets:
All non-current assets, including goodwill and other intangible 
assets, are reviewed for potential impairment using estimates 
of the future economic benefits attributable to them. In the 
case of customer bases, such estimates involve assumptions 
in relation to future customer margins and average customer 
lives. Any estimates of future economic benefits made in 
relation to non-current assets may differ from the benefits that 
ultimately arise, and materially affect the recoverable value of 
the asset.
Trade and other receivables:
Provisions for irrecoverable receivables are based on extensive 
historical evidence, and the best available information in 
relation to specific issues, but are unavoidably dependent on 
future events.
Commission receivable within Best Buy Europe depends for 
certain transactions on customer behaviour after the point of 
sale. Assumptions are therefore required, particularly in relation 
to levels of customer default within the contract period, and 
minimum levels of customer spend. Such assumptions are 
based on extensive historical evidence, and provision is made 
for the risk of potential changes in customer behaviour, but 
they are nevertheless inherently uncertain.
Current taxation:
The complex nature of tax legislation across the tax 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates necessitates the use 
of many estimates and assumptions, where the outcome may 
differ from that assumed.
Deferred taxation:
The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the 
extent to which taxable profits are generated in the relevant 
jurisdictions in the foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation 
then in force, and as such the value of associated deferred tax 
assets is uncertain.
Provisions:
The Group’s reorganisation provisions are based on the best 
information available to management at the balance sheet 
date. However, the future costs assumed are inevitably only 
estimates, which may differ from those ultimately incurred.
expected to be incurred to disposal. Provision is made for 
obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
q) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand 
deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
r) Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings represent committed and 
uncommitted bank loans, and bank overdrafts.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of 
external financing are capitalised and amortised over the term 
of the relevant facility. All other borrowing costs are recognised 
in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
s) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the 
time value of money is considered to be material.
Provisions are categorised as follows:
Insurance:
Full provision is made for the estimated cost of all claims 
notified but not settled at the balance sheet date. Provision  
is also made for the estimated cost of claims incurred but  
not reported at the balance sheet date, based on historic 
experience of the value of such claims. Any differences 
between original claims provisions and subsequent 
settlements are reflected in the income statement in the 
relevant period.
Reorganisation:
Reorganisation provisions relate principally to redundancy 
costs and are only recognised where plans are demonstrably 
committed and where appropriate communication to  
those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet  
date. Provisions are not recognised in respect of future 
operating losses.
Sales:
Sales provisions relate to “cash-back” and similar promotions, 
product warranties, product returns, and network operator 
performance penalties. The anticipated costs of these items 
are assessed by reference to historic trends and any other 
information that is considered to be relevant.
Other:
Other provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property 
costs, and all other provisions, principally being the anticipated 
costs of unresolved tax issues and legal disputes, and costs 
associated with onerous contracts. All such provisions are 
assessed by reference to the best available information at the 
balance sheet date. 
t) Headline results 
Headline results are stated before the amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles and goodwill expense. Headline results 
also exclude any exceptional items that are considered to be 
one-off and so material that they require separate disclosure to 
avoid distortion of underlying performance. 50 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

v) Use of critical accounting estimates and  
assumptions – continued
Sales provisions are based on historical patterns: of redemption 
for promotions, product return rates for returns and warranties, 
and penalty rates from network operators. The Group has 
extensive data in all areas; however, if the historical patterns  
on which the provisions are based change significantly in the 
future, the financial statements may be materially impacted.
w) Recent accounting developments
The only standard or interpretation which has become effective 
during the year ended 31 March 2009 is as follows:
▪ IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’ 
states that when an entity buys its own instruments to settle 
a share-based payment obligation it should be accounted 
for as an equity-settled award. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following standards, amendments and interpretations (none of 
which is expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
results or financial statements except where noted) had been 
adopted by the European Union but have not been applied by 
the Group:
▪ IFRS 1 (Amendment) ‘First-time Adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards’ and IAS 27 (Amendment) 
‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’ on the 
‘Cost of an investment in a subsidiary, jointly controlled 
entity or associate’. The Group will adopt the amendments 
for the period ending 31 March 2011. 
▪ IFRS 2 (Amendment) ‘Share-based Payment’ clarifies 
the treatment of certain conditions when accounting for 
share-based payments. The Group will adopt the 
amendments for the year ending 31 March 2010.
▪ IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ updates segmental reporting 
requirements but is expected to have little impact on the 
Group’s future disclosures, results or financial position.  
The Group will adopt the standard for the year ending  
31 March 2010.
▪ IAS 1 (Amendment) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ 
affects certain disclosures within the financial statements 
especially in relation to the income statement and statement 
of changes in equity but will have no effect on the financial 
results of the Group. The Group will adopt the amendments 
for the year ending 31 March 2010.
▪ IAS 23 (Amendment) ‘Borrowing Costs’ requires the 
Group to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable  
to a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.  
The Group will adopt the amendments for the year ending 
31 March 2010.
▪ IAS 32 (Amendment) ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ 
and IAS 1 (Amendment) ‘Presentation of financial 
statements’ on ‘Puttable financial instruments and 
obligations arising on liquidation’. The Group will adopt  
the amendments for the year ending 31 March 2010.
▪ IAS 39 (Amendment) ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’, and IFRS 7 (Amendment) ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’, on the ‘Reclassification of

a) Net gain on disposal and indirect costs of the transaction
On 30 June 2008, the Group completed the disposal of 50% of its retail and distribution business to Best Buy Co., Inc.  
(“Best Buy”). 
The net assets of the business at the date of disposal were as follows:
        £m
Goodwill        383
Other intangible assets       128
Property, plant and equipment      182
Stock        272

Provisions       (68)
Total liabilities       (1,046)
Net assets       783
Net assets disposed of (50%)      391
The gain on disposal was as follows:
        £m
Cash consideration, net of costs      1,041
Net assets disposed of       (391)
Liabilities retained       (14)
Cumulative reserves recycled on disposal      12
Gain on disposal       648
Taxation        (40)
Net gain on disposal after  taxation      608
Cash flows associated with the disposal were as follows:
        £m
Cash consideration, net of costs      1,041
Cash disposed of       (104)
        937
Other costs arising indirectly from the transaction principally comprise £3m in relation to the accelerated vesting of a retail share 
option scheme that was of no value to option-holders, and £3m arising on the write-down of unamortised bank facility fees.   www.cpwplc.com 57
Financial Statements
b) Other costs arising from the transaction
Further to the transaction with Best Buy, Best Buy Europe commenced the disposal of approximately 100 stores, primarily in the 
UK and France. Costs of £19m have been recognised in the year in relation to the disposal programme, comprising fixed asset 
write downs of £7m and provision for disposal costs of £12m. 
Also as a result of the transaction, Best Buy Europe accelerated a shift in its range of retail stock away from mobile phones towards 
laptops and other non-mobile products, resulting in an exceptional clearance exercise. Losses of £8m have been incurred in 
disposing of the products that have been de-ranged. 
A tax credit of £4m has been recognised in respect of these charges.
c) Divisionalisation costs
Prior to the transaction with Best Buy, the Group conducted a comprehensive reorganisation of its central support structures, 
particularly in relation to its retail and distribution business, to achieve greater divisional autonomy and efficiency. This 
reorganisation resulted in redundancy and other restructuring costs of £12m. These costs are expected to attract tax relief at 
28% and a tax credit of £3m has been recognised against them.
d) AOL integration
The Group acquired AOL ’s UK internet access business in December 2006. Since this time the Group has been working on the 
reorganisation of the business through a programme to transfer network operations, hosting, billing and customer management 
away from a transitional platform provided by AOL Time Warner onto the Group’s own systems and infrastructure. The transition 
has been completed during the year at a cost of £16m, against which a tax credit of £4m has been recognised.
e) TalkTalk Group reorganisation
Further to the divisionalisation process detailed in note c above, TalkTalk Group has undertaken a comprehensive reorganisation 
of its structure and operations, which resulted in redundancy and other restructuring costs of £10m. These costs are expected to 
attract tax relief at 28% and a tax credit of £3m has been recognised against them.
f) Best Buy Europe reorganisation
At the same time, Best Buy Europe has undertaken a similar comprehensive reorganisation of its structure and operations,  
which resulted in redundancy and other restructuring costs of £18m, against which a tax credit of £4m has been recognised.
g) Foreign exchange losses
An exceptional foreign exchange loss of £85m has arisen in the year following a change in the functional currency of the  
Group’s brand company from Swiss Francs to Sterling. The transaction with Best Buy necessitated a change in the operations  
of the brand company, which in turn made Sterling the appropriate functional currency. As a result of the change, movements  
on the brand company’s Swiss Franc borrowings, which would previously have been recognised through reserves, were 
thereafter reflected in the income statement. These borrowings were converted into Sterling before 31 March 2009. A tax  
credit of £24m has been recognised in respect of this loss. 
h) Impairment of non-current asset investments
The Group has fully impaired its legacy wireless internet investments, resulting in a charge of £5m through exceptional  
operating expenses. 
5 Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations reflect the results of the Group’s retail and distribution business prior to its part-disposal to Best Buy  
on 30 June 2008 (see note 4). Prior year results have been restated to present the results of the retail and distribution business 
on the same basis.
A reconciliation of reclassifications made from previously reported results is provided in note 33.

31 March 2011. There were no loans outstanding from Group executives at 29 March 2008.   www.cpwplc.com 59
Financial Statements
7 Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees, through the following schemes:
a) Performance Share Plan:
The Group has a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) which uses share options to provide long-term incentives to senior 
management. Awards made under the PSP in the years ended 31 March 2007 and 29 March 2008 are subject to Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance targets and are measured over an initial performance period to 4 June 2010 and a 
subsequent performance period to 4 June 2011. Details of performance targets are provided in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 33 to 38. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
Awards made in earlier years were subject to a mixture of Headline earnings per share (see note 12) and TSR performance 
targets measured over a three or four year performance period. The performance period for all such awards has been completed 
and where targets have been met the relevant share options have vested. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten 
years from the date of grant, the options expire. 
Following the transaction with Best Buy, employees of the Group’s retail and distribution business were deemed to have left the 
Group, and any unvested PSP share options were therefore forfeited under the rules of the scheme. At the discretion of the 
Company’s Remuneration Committee, share options that were due to vest in July 2008 were not forfeited. 
The following table summarises the number and weighted average exercise prices (“WAEP”) of share options for the scheme:
      2009  2008
     Number WAEP Number WAEP
     million £ million £
Outstanding at the beginning of the year   43 – 52 –

Exercised during the year    (6) – (5) –
Outstanding at the end of the year   22 – 43 –
Exercisable at the end of the year   13 – 6 –
The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.3 years (2008: 8.3 years).  
The options exercised during the year were exercised at a weighted average market price of £1.54 (2008: £3.51).
Within options outstanding at 31 March 2009 were 8m options (2008: 25m) held by employees of discontinued operations,  
of which 8m (2008: 3m) were exercisable at the end of the year.
b) Executive Share Option Scheme:
The Group has an Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) under which share options have been issued at market value in 
previous years. All ESOS options have already vested. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the  
date of grant, the options expire.
The following table summarises the number and WAEP of share options for the scheme:
      2009  2008
     Number WAEP Number WAEP
     million £ million £
Outstanding at the beginning of the year   9 1.02 21 1.11

The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.5 years (2008: 3.6 years).  
The options exercised during the year were exercised at a weighted average market price of £1.64 (2008: £3.31).
Within options outstanding at 31 March 2009 were 4m options (2008: 4m) held by employees of discontinued operations,  
of which 4m (2008: 4m) were exercisable at the end of the year. 
The summary above includes 5m (2008: 5m) options that were granted before 7 November 2002. In accordance with IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payment’, no cost has been recognised in respect of these options. 60 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Notes to the Financial Statements – continued
7 Share-based payments – continued
c) Retail Share Option Scheme:
Prior to the transaction with Best Buy, the Group operated a Retail Share Option Scheme, which provided market price share 
options to senior employees in the UK retail and distribution business. Following the transaction, all unvested options were 
allowed by the Company’s Remuneration Committee to vest early and the scheme was terminated. The expiry dates of these 
options were changed to the later of three years from the last date of exercise, where an option-holder had previously exercised 
under the scheme, and 31 December 2008. 
The following table summarises the number and WAEP of share options for the scheme:
      2009  2008
     Number WAEP Number WAEP
     million £ million £
Outstanding at the beginning of the year   6 2.90 4 1.82

The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.4 years (2008: 8.5 years).
During the year 0.1m options with a WAEP of £1.72 were exercised. These options were exercised at a weighted average market 
price of £2.41 (2008: £3.07).
Within options outstanding at 31 March 2009 were 2m options (2008: 6m) held by employees of discontinued operations,  
of which 2m (2008: 2m) were exercisable at the end of the year. 
Of the 2m (2008: 6m) options that were outstanding at 31 March 2009, there were none (2008: 1m) with an option price between 
£1.00 and £2.00, 1m (2008: 1m) between £2.01 and £3.00 and 1m (2008: 4m) above £3.01.
d) Share gift:
In December 2008, 3.6 million shares were gifted by the Group’s Employee Share Ownership Trust to certain senior employees 
within the Group and Best Buy Europe. The shares are restricted until 30 June 2010, and will be forfeited if various internal 
performance conditions, principally in relation to earnings and cash generation, are not met.
e) Other employee share option schemes:
The Group has a savings-related share option scheme which permits the grant to employees of options linked to a bank  
save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of between £5 and £250 per 
month. Options may be exercised at the end of the three or five year period at a subscription price not less than 80% of the 
middle market quotation on the date of grant.
After the transaction with Best Buy all employees of the retail and distribution business were required to leave the scheme and 
all unvested options were allowed to vest immediately. The expiry date on all vested options was changed to the later of three 
years from the last date of exercise, where an option-holder had previously exercised under the scheme, and 31 December 2008.
In addition, options were granted to UK employees at the time of the Group’s admission to the London Stock Exchange.
Market priced options were also granted during the current year to certain senior employees within the Group and Best Buy 
Europe. These awards are subject to internal performance conditions, principally in relation to earnings and cash generation, 
over a period to June 2010.
The following table summarises the number and WAEP of share options for the scheme:

Financial Statements
The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 8.2 years (2008: 2.1 years).  
The options exercised during the year were exercised at a weighted average market price of £1.87 (2008: £3.33).
The summary above includes 0.6m (2008: 0.6m) options that were granted before 7 November 2002. In accordance with IFRS 2, 
no cost has been recognised in respect of these options.
Within options outstanding at 31 March 2009 were 4m options (2008: 4m) held by employees of discontinued operations,  
of which none (2008: none) were exercisable at the end of the year.
f) Fair value models:
Nil cost options with internal performance targets were valued using the market price of a share at the date of grant, discounted 
for expected future dividends to the date of exercise. The fair values of other options with internal performance targets have 
been estimated at the date of grant using a Binomial model. The inputs into the Binomial model were as follows:
       2009 2008
Expected volatility (%)      35.0 29.2
Risk free rate (%)      3.1 5.8
Dividend yield (%)      2.0 2.0
Expected volatility has been arrived at by using the historical volatility of the Group’s share price, and the volatility of the share 
price of similar companies, whose shares have been listed for longer than those of the Group, over a period comparable with  
the expected lives of the options. The assumptions made in relation to the timing of exercises are based on historical exercise 
patterns for each option scheme.
The fair values of options with external performance targets were estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model.  
The model combines the market price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based 
on the historical performance of the Group’s shares. The historical performance period reflects a volatility of 27.4%. A dividend 
yield of 2.0% was assumed in the model.
g) Charge to income statement:
During the year the Group recognised a charge of £6m (2008: £9m) within continuing operations in respect of equity settled 
share-based payments. The net charge in the year for share-based payments in relation to discontinued operations was  
£nil (2008: £nil).

The tax charge relating to Headline earnings (see note 11) for the year is £19m (2008: £5m) representing an effective tax rate on 
pre-tax profits or losses before share of results of joint ventures and associates of 17% (2008: 50%). The tax credit relating to 
statutory earnings for the year is £31m (2008: £22m). 
The principal differences between the tax credit shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK 
corporation tax of 28% (2008: 30%) to loss before taxation are as follows:

No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either year, except where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant 
jurisdictions.
From 1 April 2008, the UK statutory rate of corporation tax reduced from 30% to 28%. The impact of this change on the value  
of deferred tax assets was recognised at 29 March 2008.
At 31 March 2009 the Group had unused tax losses of £307m (2008: £357m) available for offset against future taxable profits.  
A deferred tax asset of £74m (2008: £65m) has been recognised in respect of £263m (2008: £216m) of such losses, based on 
expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £44m (2008: £141m) as there is insufficient evidence that 
there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered. All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 March 2009 the Group has unrecognised deferred tax liabilities of £20m (2008: £46m) in respect of temporary differences 
associated with the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries of £78m (2008: £240m). No liability has been recognised in respect of 
these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that they will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.

Following the disposal of 50% of the Group’s retail and distribution business the Group’s goodwill is associated with only two 
CGUs, being TalkTalk Group and Best Buy Europe. Goodwill relating to Best Buy Europe is included in the Group’s interests in 
joint ventures and associates (see note 16).
The cash flows of TalkTalk Group are not separable into individual CGUs as its cash flows are derived from shared assets and 
infrastructure.

Total       304 677
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts 
derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows  
in perpetuity based on a country-specific growth rate for the UK, where all goodwill is now located, of 1.8%. The average pre-tax 
rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.7% (2008: 10.0%).
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those in relation to the discount rates, growth rates and expected 
changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period, all of which are based on historical patterns and expectations of 
future market developments. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Due to the substantial headroom provided by TalkTalk Group’s cash flow forecasts, the Directors do not consider it likely that key 
assumptions may change to such an extent that it would lead to a significant impairment loss.  www.cpwplc.com 67

At 29 March 2008, software and licences included assets with a cost of £60m on which amortisation had not yet been charged 
as the assets had not yet been brought into use. There were no such assets at 31 March 2009.

Customer bases relate primarily to AOL ’s UK internet access business which was acquired in December 2006. The valuation of 
customer bases is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a deduction for contributory assets.
Customer revenue share agreements again arose on the acquisition of AOL ’s UK internet access business, and represent rights, 
subject to performance criteria, to a share of transactional revenues generated by AOL access customers and TalkTalk 
customers on AOL sites. The valuation of these rights was again derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from 
the agreement, after a deduction for contributory assets.
Other acquisition intangibles primarily represent a licence to continue to use the AOL brand for a limited time period, valued 
using the relief from royalty method.

Following the part-disposal of its retail and distribution operations on 30 June 2008, the Group’s remaining share in the business  
is presented as a joint venture, Best Buy Europe. The Group’s initial investment in the joint venture was £391m. As explained in 
note 1, loans to Best Buy Europe are shown separately in the Group balance sheet. Disposals relate to Geek Squad UK and  
The Phone House Services Telecoms SAS, both of which were transferred to the retail and distribution business.
Group committed debt facilities have been used to fund loans at a floating rate to Best Buy Europe under a £475m  
revolving credit facility (“RCF”). The RCF has terms that are broadly similar to the Group’s own committed facilities, including  
a debt:EBITDA covenant, and its final maturity date is 13 March 2013. Under the RCF, 50% of drawings are guaranteed by  
Best Buy Co., Inc.
Loans are provided to Virgin Mobile France under a shareholder agreement that matures in April 2010; funding requirements are 
agreed between the shareholders on a regular basis and are provided equally between the shareholders.

Details of the current and non-current borrowing facilities of the Group are set out below.
Bank overdrafts and other uncommitted bank loans:
Overdraft facilities (some multi-currency) are held at a variety of UK banks to assist in short-term cash management. These 
facilities bear interest based on a margin over base rate or LIBOR for the relevant currency.
£550m revolving credit facility (“RCF”):
The Group has a committed RCF of £550m, which matures in March 2013. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under 
this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to 
any drawing depends on the ratio of debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period. A non-utilisation 
fee is payable in respect of amounts available but undrawn under this facility. Covenants are included in this facility that limit the 
ratio of debt to EBITDA, interest cover and fixed charges (interest and operating lease expenditure) cover. The Group was in 
compliance with these covenants at the year end.
£375m term loan:
The Group also has a term loan facility of £375m, which matures in October 2012. The terms of this facility are similar to the 
Group’s RCF, with an identical covenant package. This facility was fully drawn in Sterling at 31 March 2009, and was fully drawn 
in Swiss Francs at 29 March 2008.
The average maturity of all non-current borrowings is 3.5 years (2008: 4.0 years) and the weighted average interest cost was 
3.8% (2008: 4.5%).
Borrowing facilities:
The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 March 2009, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been 
met, as follows:
       2009 2008
       £m £m
Maturing in 2009      – 200
Maturing in 2013      500 315
       500 515
The undrawn committed facilities at 31 March 2009 are the undrawn portion of the £550m RCF maturing in 2013.
Loans to joint ventures:
The Group provides loan facilities to Best Buy Europe and Virgin Mobile France. The terms of these loans are set out in note 16.  www.cpwplc.com 75

Securities and guarantees:
None of the borrowings are secured over Group assets. Although some guarantees are given by Group companies, these 
guarantees are to cover commercial obligations and, as such, create no additional credit risk.
Functional currency:
At the end of the year, all of the Group’s subsidiaries prepared accounts in either Sterling or Euro, further to the change in the 
functional currency of the Group’s brand company detailed notes 4 and 22 and the disposal of the Group’s South African 
subsidiary. Prior to the disposal of Best Buy Europe, the Group also had subsidiaries that prepared accounts in Swiss Francs 
and Swedish Krona.

The fair value of available-for-sale investments at 29 March 2008 was provided by third-party fund managers. Other fair values 
have been arrived at by discounting future cash flows, assuming no early redemption, or by revaluing forward currency contracts 
to year-end market rates or rates as appropriate to the instrument. 76 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Notes to the Financial Statements – continued
22 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments – continued 
Forward currency contracts – net investment hedges:
The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge balance sheet assets and liabilities and also for short-term liquidity 
management. The Group currently holds no currency option contracts.
Forward currency contracts – cash flow hedges:
The Group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge transactional exposures. These contracts are mainly denominated  
in Euros, South African Rand and US Dollars and primarily cover costs of sales and operating expenses. 
At 31 March 2009, the total notional principal amount of outstanding currency contracts was £344m (2008: £333m). Within this 
balance, £17m (2008: £31m) is held in relation to cash flow hedges, for which the associated fair value gains and losses will be 
transferred to the income statement when the transactions occur over the next 12 months. The remainder of the outstanding 
currency contracts relates to investments in and loans to the Group’s non-Sterling operations. An expense of £3m was 
transferred to income in respect of forward currency contracts in the year ended 29 March 2008, which was offset by the foreign 
exchange movements of the financial instruments that they hedged. All cash flow hedges will reverse within the next financial year.
Embedded derivatives:
No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted  
for separately.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk (such as currency risk and interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group Treasury function, which operates under approved treasury policies, uses certain 
financial instruments to mitigate potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from these risks. These financial 
instruments primarily consist of bank loans and deposits, spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, and foreign exchange 
swaps. Other products, such as interest rate swaps and currency options, can also be used depending on the risks to be 
covered. The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments. 
Foreign exchange risk:
The Group is exposed to limited cross-border transactional commitments and, where significant, these are hedged at inception 
using forward currency contracts. These exposures arise mainly through costs of sales and operating expenses. The Group’s 
foreign exchange position is calculated daily and any positions are closed out immediately unless the exposure is immaterial.  
In some circumstances, the Group also hedges future currency commitments, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
Group policy permits the use of long-term derivative treasury products (such as cross-currency swaps) for the management  
of currency risk although none are currently held. The principal currency in which Group exposures arise is the Euro.
Translational currency risk (for example, investments in overseas assets or the funding of subsidiaries) is ordinarily hedged using 
foreign exchange swaps or currency borrowings. The translation risk on converting overseas currency profit is not hedged and 
such profits are converted into Sterling at average exchange rates throughout the year.
Funding to Group subsidiaries is ordinarily denominated in the functional currency of each subsidiary. As detailed in note 4,  
the functional currency of CPW Brands Limited changed during the year from Swiss Francs to Sterling. As a result, foreign 
exchange movements arose in CPW Brands Limited on its Swiss Franc borrowings, prior to their redenomination to Sterling. 
These movements are reflected in the profit and loss account of CPW Brands Limited.
Currency loans and deposits and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates; this 
sensitivity can be analysed in comparison to year-end rates (assuming all other variables remain constant) as follows:
        2009  2008
        Income  Income 
       statement Equity statement Equity
       movement movement movement movement
       £m £m £m £m
10% movement in the Sterling/Euro exchange rate    – 3 – 43
Changes in the value of currency loans and foreign exchange contracts would not be expected to have an impact in the income 
statement, as they match currency assets, the value of which would rise or fall correspondingly, with net investment hedges 
assumed to remain fully effective.
The impact on equity of revaluations would be partially offset on consolidation by the revaluation of any net assets that are 
hedged by these borrowings and derivatives.  www.cpwplc.com 77

Total    414 45 – (1) 458 19 433 447 34 933
Interest rate risk:
The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at floating rates of 
interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate 
bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency. Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on 
interest periods agreed at the time of rollover. Group policy permits the use of long-term interest rate derivatives in managing the 
risks associated with movements in interest rates although the Group holds none of these products at present.
Since all cash, cash equivalents and borrowings are at floating rates of interest, no further disclosure on the effect of interest rate 
derivative products has been provided.
Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and such 
movements have been analysed in the chart below by calculating the effect on the income statement and equity of 1% 
movements in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and borrowings are denominated. Funding to joint 
ventures and associates has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating these sensitivities. This analysis has been 
prepared on the assumption that the year-end positions prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of 
fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

Liquidity risk:
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long- and short-term cash flow projections for the 
business against facilities and other resources available to it. Regular reports are made to the Audit Committee assessing 
current facilities and debt and, in the shorter-term, weekly reports are circulated to senior management showing variances 
against the Group’s cash flow budget. Headroom is assessed based on historical experience as well as by assessing current 
business risks, including foreign exchange movements. Existing facilities do not expire for more than three years; it is Group 
policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings. The amounts disclosed in the table are 
the contractual undiscounted cash flows assuming interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year 
of maturity.

Credit risk:
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored and the Group’s policy updated as appropriate. Debt, investments, 
foreign exchange and derivative transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks all of which have short- or long-term 
credit ratings appropriate to the Group’s policies and exposures. Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from 
residential and corporate fixed line customers, and provision is made for any receivables that are considered to be irrecoverable.

Independent Auditors’ Report on the Company  
Financial Statements
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of The 
Carphone Warehouse Group PLC (“the Company”)
We have audited the Company financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the balance sheet and 
the related notes 1 to 14. These financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2009 and on the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)  
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities  
on page 40.
Our responsibility is to audit the Company financial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Company 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the Company financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether  
it is consistent with the audited Company financial statements.  
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures  
in the Company financial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made 
by the Directors in the preparation of the Company financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give 
reasonable assurance that the Company financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the Company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
▪ the Company financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2009;
▪ the Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
▪ the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the Company financial statements.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards under 
the historical cost convention, as modified by FRS 26 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Measurement’. The following principal accounting 
policies have been applied consistently throughout the current 
and preceding year.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis. Details of the considerations undertaken  
by the Directors in reaching this conclusion are set out on  
page 22 within the Business Review.
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2009 contain a 
consolidated statement of cash flows. Consequently, the 
Company has applied the exemption in FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow 
Statements’ not to present its own cash flow statement.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are recognised 
at cost, being the fair value of consideration, acquisition 
charges associated with the investment and capital 
contributions by way of share-based payments, less any 
provision for permanent diminution in value.
Investments held in non-Group companies are treated as 
available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Changes in fair 
value, together with any related deferred taxation, are taken 
directly to reserves, and recycled to the profit and loss account 
when the investment is sold or is determined to be impaired.  
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant, and expensed over 
the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest. 
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model for  
share-based payments with internal performance criteria  
(such as Earnings Per Share targets) and a Monte Carlo  
model for those with external performance criteria (such  
as Total Shareholder Return targets).
For schemes with internal performance criteria, the number of 
options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet 
date, based on expectations of performance against target and 
of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative 
expense since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the 
profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with external performance criteria, the number of 
options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of 
leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative expense 
since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the profit and 
loss account, with a corresponding entry in reserves. 
Share-based payments issued by the Company to its 
subsidiary undertakings are treated as additions to 
investments based on the fair value of the grant, spread over 
the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding credit to 
reserves. Where the Company recharges the cost of share-
based payments to its subsidiary undertakings the investment 
is reduced accordingly.
Dividends
Dividends receivable from the Company’s subsidiaries and 
joint venture investments are recognised only when they  
are approved by shareholders.
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period 
in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they  
are paid.
Foreign currency translation
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using 
forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies and are 
recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rates 
thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Material 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are hedged, mainly using forward foreign exchange 
contracts to create matching liabilities and assets, and are 
retranslated at each balance sheet date. Hedge accounting  
as defined by FRS 26 has been applied in the year.
Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings represent committed and 
uncommitted bank loans, and bank overdrafts.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of 
external financing are capitalised and amortised over the term 
of the relevant facility. All other borrowing costs are recognised 
in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a legal  
or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it  
is probable that an outflow of resources will be required  
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made  
of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted 
where the time value of money is considered to be material.
2 Profit and loss account
In accordance with the exemption permitted by section 230  
of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the 
Company is not presented separately. The profit recognised  
for the year was £1,607m (2008: £15m).
Audit fees for the audit of the Company financial statements 
are £10,000 (2008: £10,000). 90 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The expected cost of this dividend reflects the fact that the Group’s Employee Share Ownership Trust has agreed to waive its 
rights to receive dividends.

investment fund. During the year a dividend was received from one of the Group’s subsidiaries. As a result of this dividend the 
investment held in the subsidiary became impaired by £4m, being the amount of the dividend received. 
Additions and disposals relate primarily to the reorganisation of the Group in preparation for the sale of 50% of its retail and 
distribution business.
Additions include £5m (2008: £4m) of capital contributions to subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates by way of 
share-based payments in accordance with UITF 44 ‘FRS 20 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’. 
Details of the Company’s investments in material subsidiary undertakings are provided in note 15 to the Group’s financial 
statements.

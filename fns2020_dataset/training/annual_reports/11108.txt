CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The year to January 2013 was another good year for NEXT.  Underlying earnings per share before exceptional gains 
grew by 16.6% to 297.7p and we propose to increase our full year dividend to 105p.  This is the fourth consecutive 
year that our earnings per share and dividend have grown by over 15%, at a time when the UK economy has 
continued to struggle for growth.
NEXT Directory, our online and catalogue business, continued to grow and its sales increased by 9.5%.  The growth 
differential between NEXT Directory and NEXT Retail, where sales were level, narrowed.  The two businesses continue 
to work well together and support each other in many ways.  For example, over 20% of Directory sales are delivered 
through our stores and over 60% of the returns come back that way.  Both businesses increased their operating 
margins during the year and the Group’s underlying profit before tax rose by 9.0% to £622m.
Cash flow was particularly strong, helped by the timing of capital expenditure and stock intake at the year end.  
We continued with share buybacks, buying 7.5 million shares at an average price of £32.13.  During the year we 
returned £390m to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.
Our share price again performed well during 2012, in both absolute and relative terms.  Over the last two financial 
years the share price has risen by over 100%.
As ever, our success is built on the stability and effectiveness of our management across the Group.  They 
performed well in challenging economic conditions.  I would like to thank them and all the NEXT employees for 
their outstanding contribution during the year.
We anticipate another challenging year ahead, with little if any growth in the UK retail economy.  In these 
circumstances we again aim to achieve growth by investing in the Brand, improving our products, controlling costs 
and returning cash to our shareholders.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
The Directors present their annual report and audited accounts for the financial year ended 26 January 2013.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS MODEL
NEXT is a predominantly UK based multi-channel retailer offering exciting, beautifully designed, excellent quality 
clothing, footwear, accessories and home products.  The Group is primarily comprised of:
 ❚ NEXT Retail, a chain of more than 500 stores in the UK and Eire.
 ❚ NEXT Directory, a home shopping catalogue and website with over 3 million active customers and international 
websites serving approximately 60 countries.
 ❚ NEXT International Retail, with almost 200 mainly franchised stores around the world.
 ❚ NEXT Sourcing, which designs, sources and buys NEXT branded products.
 ❚ Lipsy, which designs and sells its own branded younger women’s fashion products.
A review of the Group’s businesses is set out in the Chief Executive’s Review and in the sections headed Business 
Strategies & Objectives, Key Performance Indicators, Risks & Uncertainties, Employees and Social & Environmental 
Matters.
Business strategies & objectives
The primary financial objective of the Group is the delivery of sustainable long term growth in earnings per share 
(“EPS”), a key driver of shareholder value.  Underlying EPS increased by 16.6% from last year, and over the last 
ten years both EPS and share price have increased by more than 300%.  This long term value has been created 
through the consistent pursuit of the following strategies:
 ❚ Improving and developing NEXT product ranges, success in which is measured by sales performance.
 ❚ Profitably increasing retail selling space.  New store appraisals must meet demanding financial criteria before 
the investment is made, and success is measured by achieved sales and profit contribution against appraised 
targets.  The store portfolio is actively managed, with openings and closures based on store profitability and 
cash payback.
 ❚ Increasing the number of NEXT Directory customers and their spend, both in the UK and through international 
online sales.
 ❚ Managing gross and net margins through efficient product sourcing, stock management and cost control.
 ❚ Maintaining the Group’s financial strength through an efficient balance sheet and secure financing structure.
 ❚ Generating cash to increase dividends and purchase NEXT shares, when it is earnings enhancing and in the 
interests of shareholders generally. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OVERVIEW
NEXT has had a good year, achieving 3.1% growth in sales and 9.0% growth in underlying profit before tax.  Strong 
cash generation allowed us to buy back 4.5% of shares outstanding which, along with a lower tax rate, resulted in 
EPS growing much faster than profits.  
In the year to January 2013 post-tax EPS grew by 16.6%.  Our full year dividend has been increased in line with EPS 
to 105p.

Five straightforward profit drivers
The table below sets out the five main drivers of the Group’s Profit and Loss account.  It shows how the profit from 
(1) new Retail space and (2) Online sales, more than offset the profit lost as a result of (3) declining sales in the 
existing store base.  It also shows how (4) cost inflation has been more than offset by (5) cost savings.

Five straightforward objectives
The Company has five core operational objectives, as set out below.  Underlying these operational goals is the 
ever present and overriding financial objective of delivering long term, sustainable growth in earnings per share.
Develop the NEXT 
Brand
Develop, improve and expand our product ranges, focusing on being better by design.
Rigorously control 
costs
Control costs through constantly developing more efficient ways of operating.  This must be 
done without detracting from the quality of our products and services.  
Invest in profitable 
new space
Open profitable new retail space, maintaining the Company’s strict payback and 
profitability hurdles of 15% net store profit (before central overheads) and payback on net 
capital invested in 24 months.  
Invest in online 
growth
Invest in growth from our online business, through improving UK services and new overseas 
markets.  
Generate and return 
cash 
Focus on cash generation.  Return funds that are not needed to develop the business 
to shareholders through share buybacks.  This must be earnings enhancing and in the 
interests of shareholders generally.  
PRODUCT AND THE NEXT BRAND
Without great product, all our other activities are in vain.  We believe there is the opportunity to further improve and 
expand our product ranges, particularly at the more aspirational end of our collections.
NEXT has always maintained that, if we are to succeed, our products must be better by design.  Additional time and 
money has been invested in the design process for Autumn Winter 2013.  We hope to see continuing improvements 
in the fashion content and quality of our ranges as the year progresses.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
COST INFLATION AND COST CONTROL
We are very clear that we must not compromise service or quality to save money, nor should we stop taking on 
new costs that improve our service offer.  So we must control costs through operational innovation and improved 
purchasing.  The tables below outline the main contributors to cost increases and cost savings over the last year.
Cost Increases £m
Cost of living awards and other wage related inflation 17
Costs of Directory delivery service improvements 15
Rent, rates & other occupancy inflation 7
Retail in-store design, online overseas and additional brochure 6
Systems investments and other 5
Total 50
Cost Savings £m
Gross margin improvements 22
Retail manpower efficiencies and other cost savings 19
Directory operating efficiencies 10
Lower freight costs 3
Non-stock purchasing improvements (e.g.  paper) 3
Other 7
Total 64
Looking at the year ahead we expect cost inflation to be less challenging at around £35m.  Once again, we 
believe that we can offset all these increased costs through saving initiatives.
RETAIL
Retail sales were level with last year.  New space added 3.2% to Retail sales and 2.1% to total Brand sales.  Retail 
profit of £331m was 2.3% higher than last year, representing a 0.3% improvement in the Retail net margin.
RETAIL SPACE
Retail Expansion in 2012/13
During the year we added 250,000 square feet to our store portfolio.  This was less than the 300,000 we had 
budgeted at the start of the year.  The shortfall was because it has taken longer than expected to get planning 
permission for new projects and because a fire delayed one of our new large sites.
The table below sets out the change in store numbers and space since January 2012.

Space Expansion in the Year Ahead
There continue to be good opportunities to profitably increase UK retail selling space.  Our expansion programme 
is built bottom-up, on a location by location basis, and there remain many towns and cities where we believe there 
is the potential to offer wider ranges in larger stores.  
Planning remains a problem, though often more of a delay than a brick wall.  We are actively working with planning 
officers, councillors and local communities to deliver new shops, investment and jobs.  We continue to make a 
greater investment in the external architecture of our new stores, particularly on Retail Parks.  Our aim is to transform 
the quality of construction associated with out-of-town retail and create the sort of buildings that communities will 
see as an asset, not an eyesore.
In our dealing with local councils it is noticeable that some are much more pro-growth and pro-jobs than others.  
Many local councils are enthusiastic and efficient; but a few remain an unhealthy mix of Luddite intransigence 
and incompetence.  Going forward, in areas where councils traditionally have got away with just saying “no”, we 
will be more active in harnessing the law and the full weight of public opinion to campaign for growth.
Next year we expect to add at least 250,000 sq. ft. of trading space (net of closures).  
Store Portfolio Profitability
We continue to closely monitor the profitability of our store portfolio.  Underperforming stores are actively managed 
with a view to possible closure before they become uneconomic.  On average our store leases have 7 years to run 
before expiry or a break clause.  
Our portfolio remains extremely profitable, with 89% of our sales coming from stores delivering more than 15% profit 
contribution on sales.

Over the last five years the steady process of opening new space and refitting existing stores has transformed our 
portfolio.  Of the 6.7 million square feet of trading space we have today, 3.7 million (54%) is in stores that are either 
brand new or enlarged.  Of the remaining 3 million square feet, 2.2 million has been refitted, leaving just 800,000 
(13%) square feet of the portfolio unchanged from 2007. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
RETAIL PROFIT ANALYSIS
Operating margin improved slightly on last year.  The table below details the margin movement by the major 
heads of costs.
Net operating margin last year 14.8%
Increase in bought-in 
gross margin
The improvement in bought-in gross margin was driven by an improved USD 
exchange rate.  This improvement was partly offset by selling a higher 
proportion of Home and Childrenswear; these product categories have a 
lower gross margin than the average.
+0.3%
Reduction in freight 
and faulty
The cost of freight fell and in addition we used less unplanned air freight.  
Faulty stock rates also reduced.
+0.3%
Increase in store 
payroll
The annual cost-of-living pay award and staff bonus would have pushed 
wage costs up by 0.5%, however this cost was almost completely offset by 
in-store efficiency initiatives.
- 0.1%
Increase in store 
occupancy
Rents and rates increased as a percentage of sales mainly as a result of 
negative like for like sales.  Rental inflation was minimal and continued to 
decline.  Business rates inflation, which is linked to September RPI, was very 
high at 5.6%.  
Electricity costs also increased significantly in the first half.

Net operating margin this year 15.1%
DIRECTORY
NEXT Directory sales were up 9.5% and profit increased by 15.1%.
UK SERVICE
NEXT Directory continues to provide good opportunities for growth.  In the UK, growth is driven by the wider online 
market and by improving delivery services.  Last year we added Same-Day, Evening, Sunday and Next-Day to Store 
delivery services, all at a £2.99 premium to the standard service.
In 2013 we have already improved our delivery services further:
 ❚ The cut off for standard next day delivery to home has been moved back to 10pm.  
 ❚ Next-Day delivery to stores has been improved to allow collection after 12.30pm (as opposed to 4.00pm) and 
the price of this service has been reduced from £2.99 to 50p.  
INTERNATIONAL ONLINE
International sales grew from £33m to £54m.  We now sell direct to 60 international territories, and also through 6 
partners in 14 of those countries.  Our international online business contributed £10m to profit.  In the year ahead 
we expect our overseas online business to grow to at least £70m, adding a further £4m to profit. Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Business reports

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
INTERNATIONAL RETAIL
We have a profitable franchise business, with partners operating 170 stores in 33 countries.  Our 19 directly owned 
stores (in 7 countries) made a small loss.  We do not intend to open any new directly owned international stores 
going forward.  Revenue and income for our international business is set out below.

Franchise income 61.5 58.7
Owned store sales 16.2 17.6
Total revenue 77.7 76.3 +1.8%
Operating profit 8.4 7.9 +6.2%
We are budgeting for International Retail to make a profit of £10m in the year ahead, the improvement coming 
mainly from the closure of loss making stores.
NEXT SOURCING
NEXT Sourcing profit recovered from the previous year, when a significant provision was required against unshipped 
faulty stock.  That issue has been resolved and £1m of excess provision has been released this year.  NEXT Sourcing 
competes for business against the many other suppliers to NEXT Retail and NEXT Directory, it provides around 40% 
of NEXT Brand stock.

LIPSY
The full year sales of £58m and profit of £4m, before amortisation and profit share of £2m, was the best performance 
under the four years of our ownership.  Internet sales, through Lipsy’s own site and the NEXT Directory, doubled to 
£17m and are now ahead of wholesale sales.  Lipsy’s retail sales were £22m, taken from 51 stores trading 60,000 sq.  ft.
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
Underlying profit was down by £2m to £3.5m.  We now own very few retail freeholds.  At the end of the year we 
sold a development property occupied by Ventura (a business we divested in 2011): the £9m profit is shown as 
exceptional.  We do not anticipate any property management profit in the year ahead.   Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Business reports
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

CENTRAL COSTS
The charge has increased by £5m mainly due to performance-related pay and Company wide share-based 
incentives.  We expect central costs to decrease by £1m in the year ahead.
PENSION SCHEME
The actuarial pension credit fell from £7m to £4m.  We expect this credit to be around £3m in the coming year.  
During the year we made changes to our final salary pension scheme (which has been closed to new entrants 
since 2000).  This change gave a credit adjustment which was partially offset by the cost of hedging out a tranche 
of pension liabilities.  The net effect of these two changes was an exceptional post-tax credit of £28m.
INTEREST AND TAXATION
The interest charge was £28m.  For the year ahead we expect net debt to range between £400m and £600m, 
resulting in a similar interest charge.
Our tax rate reduced as expected to 23.9%, following the reduction in headline UK corporation tax rates.  On the 
assumption that tax rates continue to reduce as announced, we expect our effective rate to be no higher than 
23% in each of the next two years.
BALANCE SHEET
The balance sheet remains strong with year end net debt of £493m and forecast peak borrowing requirements 
being very adequately financed by our bonds and bank facilities of £923m, as set out in the table below.
 
£m
2013 bonds – repayment due September 85
2016 bonds 213
2021 bonds 325
Total bonds nominal value 623
2016 committed bank facility 300
Total debt facilities available 923
We believe NEXT will generate around £250m of cash in the year ahead after capital expenditure, interest, tax and 
dividends, but before share buybacks.
CASH GENERATION, NET DEBT AND SHARE BUYBACKS
STRONGER THAN EXPECTED CASH FLOW 
Cash generation was significantly ahead of our expectations.  Operational cash flow, before buybacks and before 
additional cover in the ESOT, was £376m.  This was a long way ahead of our original £240m forecast, the variance 
has been driven by higher profits, lower capital expenditure and year end stock levels, higher Directory customer 
payments and a number of other one off factors.
During the year we used surplus cash to buy 7.5 million shares (4.5% of shares outstanding as at Jan 2012) at an 
average price of £32.13 and a cost of £241m.  In addition we used £52m to increase the share option cover in our 
Employee Share Ownership Trust: this had the effect of reducing net shares in issue by a further 0.7%. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
BUYBACKS, EPS AND SHARE PRICE
Despite their increasing popularity, share buybacks are still widely misunderstood.  There are still those who wrongly 
believe that they are some sort of share support scheme.  This, of course, would be futile as any attempt to support 
a share price would evaporate as soon as the money ran out.
The only reason share buybacks can deliver long term value is because they permanently reduce the number 
of shares in issue and so increase the amount of profit attributable to each share (EPS).  An important part of the 
logic of share buybacks is the implied link between growth in EPS and growth in share price.  Whilst, in the short 
term there might appear to be no link, in the long run share prices tend to reflect the fundamental value of the 
earnings and dividend stream.  If the share price did not rise with EPS, the buyback programme would eventually 
leave a single share owning all the profits and dividends!
The graph below illustrates the long term correlation of share price to EPS for NEXT plc over the period we have 
been buying back shares.  The blue boxes indicate earnings per share and the black line shows the share price.  
The boxes at the top of the chart show the historic price/earnings (PE) ratio.

THE LONG GAME – THE NEXT PLC RULES OF BUYBACKS
Over the long term, we have been following these rules when considering buybacks:
1.  Share buybacks must be earnings enhancing and make a healthy Equivalent Rate of Return (see below).
2.  Only use the cash the business does not need.  NEXT has always prioritised investment in the business over 
share buybacks.
3.  Use surplus cash flow, not ever-increasing amounts of debt.  We have never allowed our share buyback 
programme to threaten our investment grade credit status and will not do so going forward.
4.  Maintain the dividend at a reasonable level through growing dividends in line with EPS.  NEXT will continue to 
increase dividends in line with EPS.
5.  Be consistent.  NEXT has been buying shares every year for more than 10 years, reducing the shares in issue by 
more than 50%.
6.  For share buybacks to be an effective use of shareholder cash, the core business must have the prospect of 
long term growth.

EFFECT ON BUYBACKS OF A RISING SHARE PRICE 
The graph above demonstrates that the relationship between our EPS and share price has recently returned to its 
near historical average.  It is important to recognise that this relative rise in the PE ratio reduces the benefit of share 
buybacks.  The more expensive the shares become, the smaller the share of the business can be bought with the 
same amount of surplus cash.  
For example, two years ago when our share price was £21, our operational free cash flow of £200m enabled us 
to buy 5.2% of the Company.  Today with the shares around £40 our expected surplus cash flow of £250m will only 
buy 3.9%.
The overall effect is simple: as the PE ratio rises the earnings enhancement of buybacks falls.  So, given our current 
PE ratio, how should NEXT assess the desirability of share buybacks? 
Essentially there are two measures we look at.  The first is the earnings enhancement of a buyback when compared 
to the enhancement to earnings from keeping the cash in the bank and earning interest.  The second is the 
comparison between the earnings enhancement of a buyback compared to the return that would have to be 
achieved from investing the cash in an alternative investment, the equivalent rate of return (ERR).
With long term borrowing rates for NEXT at around 4%, a share buyback of £250m at £40 would be 2.5% earnings 
enhancing.  The problem with this method of assessing buybacks is that at low interest rates buybacks remain 
earnings enhancing beyond £60, so we consider the equivalent rate of return measure to be more helpful.
EQUIVALENT RATE OF RETURN (ERR)
The tables below set out the maths used to calculate ERR.  The top table shows the enhancement achieved from 
acquiring £250m of shares at £40, which is 4%.  The second table shows that if we were to increase our profits by 4% 
we would have to invest in an asset yielding 10%.  Given that share buybacks carry no additional operational risk, 
the returns at 10% remain very attractive.
 
Enhancement £250m Buyback (pre interest costs) 
Share price £40.00
Market capitalisation £6,400m
Cash used for buyback £250m
% Acquired (250/6400) 3.9%
EPS Enhancement 1/(1–3.9%) 4.1%
Calculating ERR
Company profits £622m
Additional profit required for 4% growth in EPS £25.3m
Additional profit as a percentage of £250m invested in buyback (ERR) 10.1%
(These workings are shown as an explanation of Equivalent Rate of Return.  Of course, a simpler way of calculating 
ERR is to divide profit before tax into market capitalisation!) ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
14
The graph below shows how ERR falls as the share price rises.  As the yield approaches the Market’s expected 
return on equity (say 8%), the buyback becomes less attractive.  If the returns dropped much below 9% we would 
become less enthusiastic, so to a certain extent the share price provides a natural moderator of a disciplined 
buyback programme.

OUTLOOK FOR 2013
THE CONSUMER ECONOMY
The consumer environment looks set to remain subdued.  The inevitable deleveraging of public and private 
finances means that the nation must slowly work its way back to affording the lifestyle it was already enjoying 
before the financial crisis.  
This process of retrenchment is manifesting itself in earnings growth running below the rate of inflation.  This decline 
in real earnings looks set to continue for at least one, if not several more years to come.  Indeed the outlook for 2013 
inflation has worsened since this time last year.  
The graph below shows the difference in CPI and wages.  The black dotted line is the Bank of England central 
inflation forecast as at January 2013, the grey dotted lines are the equivalent estimates in January and November 
2012.  Estimates for inflation steadily rose last year, leaving the outlook for real earnings as difficult as 2012, if 
not slightly worse.  So we are planning on there being very little if any improvement in the underlying consumer 
economy.

OUTLOOK FOR NEXT BRAND SALES 2013
In this environment we will continue to budget for our existing stores to take moderately less than the previous year.  
Any growth in sales must come from investment in profitable new space and the continuing growth in the online 
market, both in the UK and overseas.  In the year ahead we expect these avenues of growth to continue to exceed 
underlying declines.  
We are budgeting for total NEXT Brand sales for the full year to rise within a range of +1% to +4%.
The first few weeks of the year have been quiet and serve to reinforce a more cautious approach.  At present, 
sales are at the bottom of our target range, though we expect this situation to improve.  We will get a better 
understanding of the underlying consumer environment once temperatures return to seasonal levels.  We will issue 
further guidance with our May trading statement.
OUTLOOK FOR GROUP PROFITS AND EPS
Assuming sales fall within our budgeted range, we expect Group profits before tax, for the full year, to be in a 
range of £615m to £665m, which would represent a year on year movement of between -1% to +7%.  Assuming we 
achieve our buyback plan, EPS would rise by between +4% and +13%.  The table below sets out our guidance for 
the full year:
Lower 
end of 
guidance
Upper

Total Brand sales % growth (E) +1% +4%
Profit before tax (E) £615m £665m
Profit before tax % growth (E) -1% +7%
EPS % growth (E) +4% +13%
OUTLOOK FOR RETAIL SELLING PRICE INFLATION 2013 AND BEYOND
Overall factory gate prices are stable.  Any increases in Far Eastern wages have generally been offset by 
manufacturing productivity improvements or the development of new Far Eastern sources of supply, in particular 
Bangladesh and Cambodia.
The recent sharp fall in the value of sterling will have very little impact on this year’s pricing as we have bought 
forward most of our foreign currency requirement for the current year.  If the pound remains at its current rate of 
exchange against the dollar, we would expect our prices to rise in 2014.
INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT
Our next statement will cover the first fourteen weeks of the year, to 4 May 2013, and is provisionally scheduled for 
Wednesday 8 May 2013.
IN SUMMARY
NEXT has performed well in a difficult year, delivering good growth in sales and profits along with exceptional 
advances in earnings per share and dividends.  The year ahead looks no less challenging but the Group is well 
prepared and has further opportunities for growth.  We remain strongly cash generative and have every chance 
of delivering another year of increased sales and earnings per share.

RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES
The Board has a policy of continuous identification and review of key business risks and oversees the development of 
processes to ensure that these risks are managed appropriately.  Executive directors and operational management 
are delegated with the task of implementing these processes and reporting to the Board on their outcomes.  The key 
risks identified by the Board are summarised below:
 ❚ Business strategy development & implementation 
If the Board adopts the wrong business strategy or does not implement its strategies effectively, the business may 
suffer.  The Board needs to understand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long term growth 
for the benefit of NEXT’s stakeholders.  The Board reviews business strategy on a regular basis to determine how 
sales and profit budgets can be achieved or bettered and business operations made more efficient.  This process 
involves the setting of annual budgets and longer term financial objectives to identify ways in which to increase 
shareholder value.  Critical to these processes are the consideration of wider economic and industry specific 
trends that affect the Group’s businesses, the competitive position of its product offer and the financial structure 
of the Group.  
 ❚ Liquidity & credit risk 
The Group has adequate medium and long term financing in place to support its business operations.  The Board 
continues to assess its exposure to counterparty risk in the light of the prevailing economic climate both in the 
UK and globally and its treasury policy is amended as necessary to manage counterparties with which deposits, 
investments and other transactions may be made.  
NEXT is exposed to credit risk in respect of its Directory and other business customers.  Rigorous procedures are 
in place with regard to the Group’s credit customers and these are regularly reviewed and updated as required.  
Key suppliers whose services are essential to the successful running of the business also face credit risk.  These 
include the production of the Directory, provision of IT systems and certain systems and suppliers to the Group’s 
warehouse and distribution network.  The Group’s risk assessment procedures for key suppliers identify alternatives 
and develop contingency plans in the event any of these suppliers fail.
 ❚ Management team 
The success of NEXT relies on the continued service of its senior management and technical personnel and on its 
ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees.  The retail sector is very competitive and 
NEXT staff are frequently targeted by other companies.  The Remuneration Committee identifies senior personnel, 
reviews remuneration at least annually and formulates packages to retain and motivate these employees.  In 
addition, the Board considers the development of senior managers to ensure adequate career development 
opportunities for key personnel, with orderly succession and promotion to important management positions.  
 ❚ Product design & selection 
The success of NEXT depends on providing exciting, beautifully designed, excellent quality clothing and homeware.  
Success also depends upon its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and trends.  
Many of NEXT’s products represent discretionary purchases and demand for these products can decline in periods 
of negative consumer confidence.  As a consequence, NEXT may be faced with surplus stocks that cannot be sold 
at full price and have to be disposed of at a loss.  Executive directors and senior management continually review 
the design and selection of NEXT’s product ranges.  This ensures, so far as possible, that there is a well-balanced 
product mix that is good value for money, and available in sufficient quantities and at the right time to meet 
customer demand.
 ❚ Key suppliers & supply chain management 
NEXT relies on its supplier base to deliver products on time and to the quality standards it specifies.  It continually 
seeks ways to develop its supplier base so as to reduce over-reliance on individual suppliers of product and 
services, and to improve the competitiveness of its product offer.  If input costs rise, for example raw materials or 
labour costs, NEXT will work with existing suppliers to mitigate the inflationary impact.  New sources of supply will be 
developed in conjunction with NEXT Sourcing, external agents and direct suppliers.  
Non-compliance by suppliers with the NEXT Code of Practice may increase reputational risk.  NEXT carries out 
regular inspections of its suppliers’ operations to ensure compliance with the standards set out in this code, 
covering production methods, employee working conditions, quality control and inspection processes.  NEXT also 
monitors and reviews the financial, political and geographical aspects of its supplier base to identify any factors 
that may affect the continuity or quality of supply of its products.   ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
18
RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES (CONTINUED)
 ❚ Retail store network 
Growth of NEXT Retail is dependent upon developing the trading space within its store network and customers 
spending more.  NEXT will continue to invest in new stores where its financial criteria are met and refurbish its 
existing portfolio when appropriate.  New store appraisals estimate the effects of sales deflection from existing 
stores, although the performance of new stores and sales deflection may differ from estimates.
Successful development of new stores is dependent upon a number of factors including the identification of suitable 
properties, obtaining planning permissions and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms.  Notwithstanding there 
have been a number of retail failures in recent years, prime sites will generally remain in demand, and increased 
competition can result in higher future rents.  
 ❚ Directory customer base 
Growth of the NEXT Directory depends upon the recruitment and retention of customers and increasing the 
average spend per customer.  NEXT will continue to recruit new credit customers where they satisfy its credit score 
requirements.  However, there can be no assurance that new customers will result in higher sales per customer or 
lower incidence of bad debts, compared with the existing customer base.
In addition, NEXT requires its internet website to attract new customers and encourage existing customers to 
continue ordering from the Directory.  Management continually review the configuration, content and functionality 
of the website to ensure it provides a positive customer shopping experience.  Service levels and response times 
are monitored to ensure that the website is both resilient and secure at all times.
 ❚ Warehousing & distribution 
NEXT regularly reviews the warehousing and distribution operations that support the business.  Risks include 
business interruption due to physical damage, access restrictions, breakdowns, capacity shortages, inefficient 
processes and delivery service failures.  Planning processes are in place to ensure there is sufficient warehouse 
handling capacity for expected future business volumes over the short and longer terms.  In addition, service levels, 
warehouse handling and delivery costs are monitored continuously to ensure goods are delivered to Retail stores, 
Directory customers and third party clients in a timely and cost-efficient manner.  
 ❚ IT systems & business continuity 
NEXT is dependent upon the continued availability and integrity of its IT systems, which must record and process 
a substantial volume of data and conduct inventory management accurately and quickly.  The Group expects 
that its systems will require continuous enhancement and investment to prevent obsolescence and maintain 
responsiveness.  Back up facilities and business continuity plans are in place and are tested regularly to ensure 
that business interruptions are minimised and data is protected from corruption or unauthorised access or use.
 ❚ Call centre capacity & service levels 
NEXT is dependent on the efficient operation of its own and third party call centres to receive and respond to 
customer orders and enquiries.  Insufficient manpower, supplier failures and interruption in the availability of 
telephony systems to meet customer service requirements are the principal risks.  The Group continuously monitors 
call centre operations that support the business to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to handle call volumes.  
Capacity forecasting is used to manage peak demands and growth in business volumes, and customer satisfaction 
is measured on a regular basis.  Business continuity plans minimise the risk of business interruption.  
 ❚ Treasury & financial risk management 
The main financial risks are the availability of funds to meet business needs, default by counterparties to financial 
transactions (see Liquidity & credit risk), and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.  In addition, 
business expansion and share buybacks may necessitate the raising of additional finance, which can in turn 
increase interest costs and give rise to fluctuations in profit.  Higher debt could also increase the proportion of 
cash flow required to service debt and potentially increase exposure to interest rate fluctuations.  NEXT operates a 
centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing its liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.  The 
Group’s treasury policy allows the use of derivative instruments provided they are not entered into for speculative 
purposes.  Further details of the Group’s treasury operations are given in Notes 27 to 30 of the financial statements.

In addition, NEXT has to fund its defined benefit pension scheme and ensure that sufficient contributions are made 
to meet outstanding liabilities as they fall due.  If NEXT fails to provide sufficient and timely funding, action may be 
taken by the pension scheme trustees, or the Pensions Regulator, which could result in an acceleration and/or 
an increase in overall contributions towards any deficit.  Management meets regularly with the trustees to assess 
fund performance, as well as to agree future contribution levels and any necessary changes to members’ future 
benefits.
EMPLOYEES
People are key to achieving business objectives.  NEXT has established policies for recruitment, training and 
development of personnel and is committed to achieving excellence in the areas of health, safety, welfare and 
protection of employees and their working environment.  
Equal opportunities
NEXT is an equal opportunities employer and will continue to ensure it offers career opportunities without 
discrimination.  Full consideration is given to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to 
their particular aptitudes and abilities.  The Group has continued the employment wherever possible of any person 
who becomes disabled during their employment.  Opportunities for training, career development and promotion 
do not operate to the detriment of disabled employees.  
Training and development
NEXT aims to realise the potential of its employees by supporting their career progression and promotion wherever 
possible.  It makes significant investment in the training and development of staff and in training and education 
programmes which contribute to the promotion prospects of employees.  
Employee communication
NEXT has a policy of providing employees with financial and other information about the business and ensures 
that the suggestions and views of employees are taken into account.  NEXT has an employee forum made up of 
elected representatives from throughout the business who attend meetings at least twice a year with directors and 
senior managers.  This forum enables and encourages open discussion on key business issues, policies and the 
working environment.
Employee share ownership
Approximately 8,200 employees held options over 8.6 million shares in NEXT at January 2013, being 5.3% of the total 
shares in issue.  Its employee share ownership trust (“ESOT”) purchases shares for issue to employees when their 
options are exercised.  At the year end the ESOT held 6.5 million shares, the voting rights of which are exercisable 
by the Trustee.
Pension provision
The NEXT Group Pension Plan provides valuable pension benefits to participating employees, details of which are 
set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 47 and in Note 21 to the financial statements.  At January 2013, 
there were 1,242 (2012: 1,337) active members in the Defined Benefit Section and 2,375 (2012: 1,935) members in 
the Defined Contribution Section.  The Group has also made arrangements for auto-enrolment and contributions 
commenced in February 2013.
SOCIAL & ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
NEXT is committed to the principles of responsible business.  This means addressing key business related social, 
ethical and environmental matters in a way that aims to bring value to all of its stakeholders, including customers 
and shareholders.  Continuous improvement lies at the heart of NEXT’s approach and is achieved by acting 
in an ethical manner, developing positive relationships with suppliers, recruiting and retaining successful and 
responsible employees, taking responsibility for our impact on the environment and through contributions to 
charities and community organisations. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
20
SOCIAL & ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS (CONTINUED)
NEXT has a Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) forum of 15 senior managers and directors representing key areas 
of the business to develop and implement strategy.  The forum identifies potential issues and opportunities and 
evaluates the success of NEXT’s response.  The CR Manager holds regular updates with the executive director 
responsible for CR.
A third party provides independent assurance on the Group’s CR report which is published on the Company’s 
website each year.  Commitment to CR matters is recognised externally by its membership of the FTSE4Good  
Index Series.
Suppliers
NEXT is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and operates its Code of Practice (“COP”), an established set of 
ethical trading standards, as an integral part of its operations.  The NEXT COP has ten key principles that stipulate 
the minimum standards with which suppliers are required to comply in relation to workers rights and conditions 
of work including working hours, minimum age of employment, health, safety, welfare and environmental issues.  
NEXT seeks to ensure all products bearing the NEXT brand are produced in a clean and safe environment and in 
accordance with all relevant laws.  
NEXT is committed to its supplier audit and management programme and has a COP audit team of 44 staff 
(2012: 45).  The COP team works directly with suppliers to identify and address causes of non-compliance.  Each 
audited factory is measured against the COP’s six tier rating system.  The supplier is made aware of its rating and 
what is required to improve via a corrective action plan.  This direct approach allows NEXT to build knowledge and 
understanding in local communities and monitor suppliers through its auditing process.
NEXT’s supplier payment policy is to agree terms of payment at the start of business or to ensure that the supplier 
is aware of the Group’s payment terms.  Payment is made in accordance with contractual and other legal 
obligations.  Trade creditor days of the NEXT Group at January 2013 were 27 days (2012: 27 days) based on the 
ratio of the trade creditors at the end of the year to the amounts paid during the year to trade creditors.  The 
Company had no trade creditors at January 2013 or January 2012.
Customers
NEXT is committed to offering stylish, excellent quality products to its customers, which are well made, functional, 
safe and are sourced in a responsible manner.  Its team of technologists works closely with buyers, designers and 
suppliers to ensure NEXT products comply with all relevant legislation, and its own internal standards where these 
are higher.  The expertise of independent safety specialists for clothing, footwear, accessories, beauty and home 
products is used where required.
NEXT endeavours to provide a high quality service to all customers, whether they are shopping through its stores, 
catalogues or website.  These different ways of shopping must be easily accessible for all customers and be 
responsive to their needs.
NEXT Customer Services interacts with Retail and Directory customers to resolve enquiries and issues.  Findings are 
recorded and the information is used by other areas of the business to review how a product or service can be 
improved.
Health and safety
NEXT recognises the importance of health and safety and its management is designed to contribute to business 
performance.  Policies and procedures are reviewed and audited regularly to make safety management more 
robust and current.
The Group’s objective is to manage all aspects of its business in a safe manner and take practical measures to 
ensure that its activities and products do not harm the public, customers, employees or contractors.  Procedures 
exist to enable two way communication and consultation about health, safety and welfare issues in order to 
achieve a high level of safety awareness.

In accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of the persons who is a director 
at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
 ❚ so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; 
and
 ❚ each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.  
Authority to allot shares
Ordinary resolution 15 will, if passed, renew the directors’ authority pursuant to section 551 of the Companies 
Act 2006 to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares until the conclusion of 
the AGM in 2014 or, if earlier, 1 August 2014.  This resolution will allow the directors to allot ordinary shares up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £5,300,000, representing approximately one third (33.33%) of the Company’s existing 
issued share capital as at 19 March 2013.  In accordance with the latest institutional guidelines, resolution 15 will 
also allow directors to allot further ordinary shares, in connection with a pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue, 
up to a total maximum nominal amount of £10,600,000, representing approximately two thirds (66.67%) of the 
Company’s existing issued share capital as at that date.  As at 19 March 2013 (being the latest practicable date 
prior to publication of this document) the Company’s issued share capital amounted to £16,123,424, comprising 
161,234,237 ordinary shares of 10 pence each, none of which are held in treasury.  The directors have no present 
intention of exercising this authority.  
Authority to disapply pre-emption rights
Special resolution 16 will, if passed, renew the directors’ authority pursuant to sections 570 to 573 of the Companies 
Act 2006 to allot equity securities for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to 
their holdings.  This resolution limits the aggregate nominal value of ordinary shares which may be issued by the 
directors on a non pre-emptive basis to £806,000, being less than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 
19 March 2013.  This authority also allows the directors, within the same aggregate limit, to sell for cash, shares 
that may be held by the Company in treasury.  The directors do not have any present intention of exercising this 
authority which will expire at the AGM in 2014 or, if earlier, 1 August 2014.  The directors do not intend to issue more 
than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the Company for cash under this or previous authorities in any rolling three 
year period without prior consultation with shareholders and the Investment Committees of certain shareholder 
representative organisations.
On-market purchase of own shares
NEXT has been returning capital to its shareholders by share repurchases as well as dividend since March 2000 
as part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share.  Over this period, and up 
to 19 March 2013, NEXT has returned over £2.8bn to shareholders by way of share buybacks and almost £1.4bn in 
dividends.  This buyback activity has enhanced earnings per share, given shareholders the opportunity for capital

23
(as well as revenue) returns and has been transparent to the financial markets.  Share buybacks have not been 
made at the expense of investment in the business.  Over the last five years, NEXT has invested over £570m in 
capital expenditure to support and grow the business.
Special resolution 17 will renew the authority for the Company to make market purchases (as defined in Section 
693 of the Companies Act 2006) of its ordinary shares of 10p each provided that:
(a) the aggregate number of ordinary shares authorised to be purchased shall be the lesser of 24,169,000 ordinary 
shares of 10p each (being less than 15% of the issued share capital at 19 March 2013) and no more than 
14.99% of the issued ordinary share capital outstanding at the date of the AGM, such limits to be reduced by 
the number of any shares to be purchased pursuant to special resolution 18: Off-market purchases of own 
shares, see below;
(b) the payment per ordinary share is not less than 10p and not more than 105% of the average of the middle 
market price according to the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of purchase or, if higher, the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy-
back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003; and
(c) the renewed authority will expire at the AGM in 2014 or, if earlier, 1 August 2014.
The directors intend that this authority to purchase the Company’s shares will only be exercised if doing so will 
result in an increase in earnings per share and, being in the interests of shareholders generally, it is considered to 
promote the success of the Company.  The directors will also give careful consideration to financial gearing levels 
of the Company and its general financial position.  The purchase price would be paid out of distributable profits.  
It is the directors’ present intention to cancel any shares purchased under this authority.  
The repurchase of ordinary shares would give rise to a stamp duty liability of the Company at the rate of 0.5% of 
the consideration paid.
The total number of employee share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 19 March 2013 was 8,468,294.  
This represents 5.3% of the issued share capital at that date.  If the Company were to buy back the maximum 
number of shares permitted pursuant to both the existing authority granted at the 2012 AGM (which will expire at 
the 2013 AGM) and the authority sought by this resolution, then the total number of options to subscribe for shares 
outstanding at 19 March 2013 would represent 7.2% of the reduced issued share capital.
Off-market purchases of own shares
The directors consider that share buybacks are an important means of returning value to shareholders and 
maximising sustainable long term growth in EPS.  Contingent contracts for off-market share purchases are an 
integral part of the Company’s buyback strategy and offer a number of additional benefits compared to on-
market share purchases:
 ❚ Contingent contracts allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price prevailing at 
the date each contract is entered into.  Pursuant to the authority granted at the 2012 AGM, and up to 19 March 
2013, the Company bought back 650,190 shares for cancellation under such contracts at discounts of up to 
6.4%.
 ❚ Low share liquidity can often prevent the Company from purchasing sufficient numbers of shares on a single day 
without risk of affecting the prevailing market price.  Contingent contracts enable the Company to purchase 
shares over time without risk of distorting the prevailing share price, and also spreads the cash outflow.
 ❚ Contingent contracts entered into prior to any close period allow the Company to purchase shares off-market 
during these periods.  Clearance from the FSA for use of contingent contracts, including for settlement in close 
periods, has been obtained.
 ❚ Competitive tendering involving up to five banks is used which minimises the risk of hidden purchase costs.  The 
pricing mechanism ensures the Company retains the benefit of declared and forecast dividends.
As with any share buyback decision, the directors would use this authority only after careful consideration, taking 
into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities and the overall financial 
position of the Company.  The directors will only purchase shares using such contracts if,  based on the contract  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
24
discounted price (rather than any future price), it is earnings enhancing and promotes the success of the Company 
for the benefit of its shareholders generally.  It is the directors’ present intention to cancel any shares purchased 
under this authority.  
Special resolution 18 will give the Company authority to enter into contingent purchase contracts with any of 
Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc under which 
shares may be purchased off-market at a discount to the market price prevailing at the date each contract is 
entered into.  The maximum which the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority would 
be the lower of 5,000,000 shares or a total cost of £200 million.
The principal features of the contracts are set out in Appendix 1 to the Notice of the AGM.  Copies of the agreements 
the Company proposes to enter into with any of the banks (the “Programme Agreements”) will be available for 
inspection at the registered office of the Company, and at the offices of Pinsent Masons, 30 Crown Place, Earl Street, 
London EC2A 4ES during normal working hours from the date of the Notice of the AGM up to the date of the AGM 
and at the Meeting itself.
Notice of General Meetings
The notice period required by the Companies Act 2006 for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless 
shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days.  However, the 
Company’s AGM must always be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.  At the AGM of the Company held in 2012, 
shareholders authorised the calling of general meetings other than an AGM on not less than 14 clear days’ notice 
and it is proposed that this authority be renewed.  The authority granted by special resolution 19, if passed, will be 
effective until the Company’s AGM in 2014.  In order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear 
days’ notice, the Company will make electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.  The flexibility 
offered by this resolution will not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings, but only where the directors 
consider it appropriate, taking account of the business to be considered at the meeting and the interests of the 
Company and its shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation
Your directors are of the opinion that all resolutions which are to be proposed at the 2013 AGM will promote the 
success of the Company and are in the best interests of its shareholders as a whole and, accordingly, unanimously 
recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions.  
 
Share capital and major shareholders
Details of the Company’s share capital are shown in Note 23 to the financial statements.
The Company was authorised by its shareholders at the 2012 AGM to purchase its own shares.  During the year 
the Company purchased 7,509,924 ordinary shares with a nominal value of £750,992 (of which 1,825,190 were 
purchased off-market), at a cost of £241.3m, representing 4.5% of its issued share capital at the start of the year.  
These shares were cancelled.
On 26 January 2013 the Company had 161,234,237 shares in issue, which remained the same as at 19 March 2013.
The following information has been received from holders of notifiable interests in the Company’s issued share

Additional information
Shareholder and voting rights
All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM.  On a show of hands at a 
general meeting every member present in person and every duly appointed proxy shall have one vote and on a 
poll, every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held or represented.  
It is intended that voting at the 2013 AGM will be on a poll.  The Notice of Meeting on pages 96 to 101 specifies 
deadlines for exercising voting rights.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities and voting rights.  There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other 
than certain restrictions imposed by laws and regulations (such as insider trading laws and market requirements 
relating to close periods) and requirements of the Listing Rules whereby directors and certain employees of the 
Company require Board approval to deal in the Company’s securities.
The Company’s articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting.  
Directors are elected or re-elected by ordinary resolution at a general meeting; the Board may appoint a director 
but anyone so appointed must be elected by ordinary resolution at the next general meeting.  Directors retire 
and may offer themselves for re-election at a general meeting at least every three years.  However, in line with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors will stand for election at the 2013 AGM.  
Change of control
The Company is not party to any significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate solely upon a change 
of control of the Company following a takeover bid.  However, in the event of a change of control, the Company’s 
medium term borrowing facilities may be subject to early repayment if a majority of the lending banks give written 
notice to the Company within 30 days of the change of control.  In addition, should a change of control cause a 
downgrading in the credit rating of the Company’s 2013, 2016 and 2021 corporate bonds to sub-investment grade 
which is not rectified within 120 days after the change in control, holders of the bonds have the option to call for 
redemption of the bonds by the Company at their nominal value together with accrued interest.  This option is only 
applicable to a downgrade which occurs as a direct consequence of a change in control.
The Company’s share option plans, and its long term incentive and share matching plans, contain provisions 
regarding a change of control.  Outstanding options and awards may vest on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any relevant performance conditions.
Directors’ service contracts are terminable by the Company on giving one year’s notice.  There are no agreements 
between the Company and its directors or employees providing for additional compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union.
Under company law the directors must not approve the Group financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company and the Group for 
that period.  In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
 ❚ select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors and then apply them consistently;
 ❚ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
 ❚ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial 
position and performance; and
 ❚ state that the Company and the Group have complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements.
The directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:

adopted for use in the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
results of the Company and the Group; and

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Chairman’s introduction
Effective corporate governance is essential to the success of our business.
As Chairman, my role is to manage the Board, ensuring it operates effectively and contains the right balance of 
skills and experience to successfully execute the strategy.  The Board is collectively responsible for the long term 
success of the Company and for setting and executing the strategy.
Over many years, NEXT has successfully grown its business and created significant shareholder value against the 
backdrop of a challenging external environment.  This is the ultimate measure of our success and reflects our 
strong corporate governance structure and the stable, effective management team we have in place.  We remain 
committed to the robust approach to governance which has served the business well.
Code compliance
The Group complied throughout the year under review with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the UK FSA Disclosure and Transparency Rules.  Disclosures required by DTR7.2.6 with regard to share 
capital are presented in the ‘Share capital and major shareholders’ and ‘Additional information’ sections of the 
Directors’ Report.
Board composition and succession
The Board includes five independent non-executive directors and the Chairman who bring considerable knowledge, 
judgement and experience to the Group.  The Board has a good record of recruiting new non-executive directors 
at regular intervals to achieve appropriate rotation and continuity.  The UK Corporate Governance Code states 
that Boards should pay particular attention to the independence of non-executives if they have served on the 
Board for more than nine years from the date of their first election.  Jonathan Dawson is the longest serving non-
executive director, having been first elected at the AGM in 2005 following his appointment the previous year.  The 
ninth anniversary of his first election is therefore May 2014, although he will have served as a director for nine years 
in May 2013.  The Board considers that all of its non-executive directors remain independent in character and 
judgement, and their knowledge, experience and other business interests continue to enable them to contribute 
significantly to the work of the Board.  Terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours.
Appointments to the Board, as with other positions within the Group, are made on merit according to the balance 
of skills and experience offered by prospective candidates.  Whilst acknowledging the benefits of diversity, individual 
appointments are made irrespective of personal characteristics such as race, religion or gender.  The Board is 
comprised of eight male directors and two female directors.  Below the Board, at senior management level there 
are 13 male directors and 11 female directors.  NEXT has a successful history of promoting internal candidates to 
most senior management and executive Board positions through career development; it is expected that most 
future appointees will come from within the Group.  
The Company’s Articles of Association require directors to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at 
least once every three years, however the Board has determined that all directors will stand for election at each 
AGM in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Board responsibilities
The Board is responsible for major policy decisions whilst delegating more detailed matters to its committees 
and officers including the Chief Executive.  The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and 
for monitoring implementation of its policies by the Chief Executive.  The system of internal control is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Additional information Parent Company accounts
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports
The Board holds regular meetings where it approves major decisions, including significant items of capital 
expenditure, investments, treasury and dividend policy.  Board papers including reports from the Chief Executive 
and Finance, Property and Product Directors are circulated in advance of each Board meeting.  The Board is 
responsible for approving semi-annual group budgets.  Performance against budget is reported to the Board 
monthly and any substantial variances are explained.  Forecasts for each half year are revised and reviewed 
monthly.  Certain other important matters are subject to weekly or monthly reporting to the Board or Board 
Committee, including sales, treasury operations and capital expenditure.  There is a regular flow of written and 
verbal information between all directors irrespective of the timing of meetings.
All new directors receive a personalised induction programme, tailored to their experience, background and 
understanding of the Group’s operations.  Individual training needs are reviewed regularly and training is provided 
where a need is identified or requested.  All directors receive frequent updates on a variety of issues relevant to the 
group’s business, including regulatory and governance issues.
Meetings of the non-executive directors without the executive directors being present are held at least annually, 
both with and without the Chairman.  The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and is responsible for 
advising the Board on corporate governance matters and facilitating the flow of information within the Board.
The Board has appointed committees to carry out certain of its duties, three of which are detailed below.  Each of 
these is chaired by a different director and has written terms of reference which are available for inspection on the 
Company’s website (www.nextplc.co.uk) or on request.  
Attendance at meetings
The Board held seven formal meetings during the year and these were fully attended with the exception of 
one meeting which Mr Angelides was unable to attend.  The Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and 
Nomination Committee held four, five and three meetings in the year respectively and all serving members 
attended with the exception of one Remuneration Committee meeting which Ms Goodall was unable to attend 
and one Nomination Committee meeting which Mrs Cross was unable to attend.
Audit Committee and external audit
The Committee consists of the five (previously four) independent non-executive directors including the senior non-
executive director and at least one member (Steve Barber, the Committee Chairman) with recent and relevant 
financial experience.
The Committee holds regular, structured meetings and consults with external auditors and senior management, 
including internal audit, where appropriate.  The Chairman of the Group, executive directors and other members 
of senior management attend meetings by invitation or as required.
The Committee’s review of the interim and full year financial statements focused on the following significant areas:
(a) Directory receivables and related provisions for doubtful debts which, at £601m, represent the largest asset on 
the Group’s balance sheet.
(b) Pension fund accounting and actuarial reports.  Prepared in accordance with International Accounting 
Standards, the Group’s balance sheet shows a pension asset of £66m, and the income statement includes 
exceptional pension items of £36m as a result of events during the year.  The assumptions underlying these 
calculations are highly sensitive to small changes, particularly in respect of discount rates (see Note 21 to the 
accounts).
(c) Treasury transactions.  The Group buys currencies forward in order to hedge its future product purchases, 
which in turn enables it to set its prices and margins.  A number of different instruments are used to provide 
such cover and their valuation and accounting treatment is reviewed.
(d) Provisioning.  There is a need to make industry specific and other judgmental provisions, including against 
stocks, rates of customer returns, liabilities in respect of onerous leases, gift card redemptions, taxation and 
share schemes. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

These items were also addressed at the planning stage of the external audit and there were no significant 
disagreements between management and the external auditor’s conclusions.
The Committee received reports and presentations from senior management on various activities of the Group, 
including international Directory operations, warehousing and distribution, Directory credit risk management, 
treasury, tax and corporate responsibility matters including the Code of Practice.  The Group’s internal control 
functions in areas such as finance, IT, security and product are regularly reviewed by the Committee.  The 
Committee receives frequent briefings on health and safety, risk management, business continuity, whistle blowing 
and corporate governance generally.  
The Committee had discussions with the external auditor on audit planning, fees, accounting policies, internal 
control and audit findings.  Meetings were also held with the auditor without management present, and the 
effectiveness and independence of the auditor has been assessed.
The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending the appointment, reappointment and removal of the 
external auditor.  Consideration is given each year to putting the audit out to tender, however it was not considered 
necessary during the current year.  Ernst & Young has been the Group’s auditor for over 20 years with regular 
partner rotation, most recently in 2012.  The Committee is satisfied that they continue to possess the skills and 
experience required to fulfill their duties effectively and efficiently.  The appointment of the external auditor will 
continue to be reviewed annually and a tendering process will be undertaken to coincide with the rotation of the 
current audit partner in 2017, or earlier if the Committee considers it appropriate.  
Ernst & Young have reported to the Committee that, in their professional judgement, they are independent within 
the meaning of regulatory and professional requirements and the objectivity of the audit engagement partner 
and audit staff is not impaired.  The Audit Committee has reviewed this statement and concurs with its conclusion.
In order to ensure the continued independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditor, the Board has 
policies regarding the provision of non-audit services by the auditor.  The Audit Committee’s approval is required in 
advance for any non-audit services to be provided where the fees exceed £100,000 for an individual assignment 
or £150,000 in aggregate for the year.  The Committee reviews details of audit and non-audit fees twice a year.  
Proposed assignments of non-audit services with anticipated fees in excess of £50,000 are generally subject 
to independent tender, and decisions on the allocation of work are made on the basis of competence, cost-
effectiveness and relevant legislation.  A tender process is not always undertaken where the auditor’s existing 
knowledge of the Group enables them to provide the required services more cost-effectively than other parties, 
for example certain overseas taxation compliance services.  The Group’s auditor is prohibited from providing any 
services that would conflict with their statutory responsibilities.  
The Committee has reviewed its terms of reference and composition and believes that both are appropriate.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee consists of the Chairman and five independent non-executive directors.  The Committee, which is 
chaired by the senior non-executive director, determines the remuneration of the executive directors and reviews 
that of senior management.  A Remuneration Report is included in this Annual Report which summarises the 
activities of the Committee.  
Nomination Committee
The Committee consists of the Chairman and five independent non-executive directors, including the senior non-
executive director.  The Committee meets whenever necessary to consider succession planning for directors and 
other senior executives, to ensure that requisite skills and expertise are available to the Board to address future 
challenges and opportunities.  
External consultants have been used to assist in identifying suitable Board candidates, based on a written 
specification for each appointment.  The Chairman is responsible for providing a shortlist of candidates for 
consideration by the Committee which then makes its recommendation for final approval by the Board.

Chairman
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive, which is set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board.  The Chairman manages the Board to ensure; that the Group has appropriate 
objectives and an effective strategy, that there is a Chief Executive with a team of executive directors able to 
implement the strategy, that there are procedures in place to inform the Board of performance against objectives, 
and that the Group is operating in accordance with a high standard of corporate governance.
The current Chairman was an independent non-executive director of the Company prior to his appointment as 
Chairman on 17 May 2006.  His other significant commitments are noted on page 27 and the Board considers that 
these are not a constraint on his agreed time commitment to the Company.
Chief Executive
The Board sets objectives and annual targets for the Chief Executive to achieve.  The Board is responsible for general 
policy on how these objectives are achieved and delegates the implementation of that policy to the Chief Executive.  
The Chief Executive is required to report at each Board meeting all material matters affecting the Group and  
its performance.
Management delegation
The Chief Executive has delegated authority for the day to day management of the business to operational 
management drawn from executive directors and other senior management who have responsibility for the 
respective areas.  The most important management meetings are the weekly NEXT Brand trading and capital 
expenditure meetings which consider the performance and development of the NEXT Brand through its different 
distribution channels.  These meetings cover risk management of all business areas in respect of the NEXT Brand 
including product, sales, property, warehousing, systems and personnel.  Key performance indicators are monitored 
daily and weekly.  
Directors’ conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board has a formal system in place for directors 
to declare situational conflicts to be considered for authorisation by those directors who have no interest in the 
matter being considered.  In deciding whether to authorise a situational conflict, the non-conflicted directors 
consider the situation in conjunction with their general duties under the Companies Act 2006.  They may impose 
limits or conditions when giving an authorisation, or subsequently if they think appropriate.  Any situational conflicts 
considered by the Board, and any authorisations given, are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of 
conflicts which is reviewed annually by the Board.  
Performance evaluation
The performance of the Board was formally and independently evaluated during the year by Pricewaterhouse 
Coopers.  The review concluded that there were no significant weaknesses or risks that required attention.
The senior independent non-executive director appraises the performance of the Chairman through discussions 
with all the directors individually and, together with the Chairman, appraises the performance of the Chief 
Executive.  The performance of the executive directors is monitored throughout the year by the Chief Executive 
and the Chairman.  The Chairman also monitors the performance of the non-executive directors.
Risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management process and has delegated responsibility for its 
implementation to the Chief Executive and senior management best qualified in each area of the business.  
The Board sets guidance on the general level of risk which is acceptable and has a considered approach to 
evaluating risk and reward.
The Board confirms that it has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
including financial, operational, compliance and risk management.  This includes identifying and evaluating key 
risks, determining control strategies and considering how they may impact on the achievement of the business 
objectives.  The risk management process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
32
Risk management and internal control is a continuous process and has been considered by the Board on a 
regular basis during the year.  The Board promotes the development of a strong control culture within the business.  
During the year the Board addressed the business risks which had been identified as key, taking into account any 
changes in circumstances over the period.  The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of internal audit resource 
available within the Group and believes that it is adequate for the size, structure and business risks of the Group 
and is supplemented with appropriate external resources where needed.
The Board considers that the Group’s management structure and continuous monitoring of key performance 
indicators provide the ability to identify promptly any material areas of concern.  Business continuity plans, 
procedures manuals and codes of conduct are maintained in respect of specific major risk areas and business 
processes.  Through these measures the management of business risk is an integral part of Group policy and the 
Board will continue to develop risk management and internal controls where necessary.
The use of a Group accounting manual and prescribed reporting requirements for finance teams throughout the 
Group ensures that the Group’s accounting policies are clearly established and consistently applied.  Information 
is appropriately reviewed and reconciled as part of the reporting process and the use of a standard reporting 
package by all entities in the Group ensures that information is presented consistently to facilitate the production 
of the consolidated financial statements.
Personal use of company assets
The Board carried out a review during the year and confirmed that there has been no improper personal use of 
company assets by directors.  Policies are in place to ensure approval procedures are applied to expense claims 
and that these are in accordance with service agreements.  The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the level 
of benefits in kind provided to executive directors.
Relations with shareholders
The Board’s primary role is to promote the success of the Company and the interests of shareholders.  The Board is 
accountable to shareholders for the performance and activities of the Group.
The Board communicates with its shareholders in respect of the Group’ s business activities through its Annual Report, 
yearly and half yearly announcements, interim management statements and other regular trading statements.  
Full year, interim and other public announcements are presented in a consistent format with a particular focus on 
making the presentations as meaningful, understandable and comparable as possible.  This information is also 
made publicly available via the Company’s website.  
All shareholders have an opportunity to ask questions or represent their views to the Board at the Annual General 
Meeting.  The Company’s largest shareholders are invited to the annual and interim results presentations, at 
which executive and non-executive directors are present.  Non-executive directors attend other meetings with 
shareholders if requested.  Shareholder views are also communicated to the Board through the inclusion in Board 
reports of shareholder feedback and statements made by representative associations.
The Board takes care not to disseminate information of a share price sensitive nature which is not available to the 
market as a whole.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Directors’ Report and Business Review.  The Directors’ Report also describes the Group’s 
financial position, cash flows and borrowing facilities, further information on which is detailed in the financial 
statements.  Information on the Group’s financial management objectives, and how derivative instruments are 
used to hedge its capital, credit and liquidity risks is provided in Notes 27 to 30 of the financial statements.
The Directors report that, having reviewed current performance and forecasts, they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.  For this reason, they 
have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

REMUNERATION REPORT
This report sets out the remuneration of NEXT’s directors for the year to January 2013 and is in three parts: (1) 
overview of the year, (2) remuneration strategy, and (3) regulatory disclosures under Schedule 8 to the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the UK Listing Rules and the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.  The Board confirms that the Company has complied with these regulations 
throughout the year.  We have also included some of the new disclosures proposed by the Department for Business 
Innovation & Skills (BIS), notably a table showing a single total figure for remuneration and a summary of the 
Company’s remuneration policy in tabular format.  
PART 1: OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR 
Information not subject to audit
Company performance
NEXT has again achieved record pre-tax profits and earnings per share (EPS).  Underlying pre-tax profits of £622m 
were 9% higher than last year and underlying EPS of 298p were 16.6% higher.  The key financial objective remains 
long term sustainable growth in EPS.  Therefore EPS is used to determine the executive directors’ annual bonus and 
the level of any entitlement under the Share Matching Plan (SMP).  The Committee also assesses EPS performance 
and other factors in evaluating whether the general economic underpin test for the Company’s Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) has been satisfied.  The Committee considers that this strong EPS performance fully justifies the bonuses 
and long term incentives earned by the executive directors and other senior executives during the year.  
Annual bonus and base salaries
At the start of the year, the Committee set targets for EPS growth, details of which are shown on page 39.  This 
year’s strong growth in EPS resulted in annual bonus for executive directors of 99% of the maximum potential 
award.  It should also be noted that, like last year, we excluded exceptional gains of £45m from this EPS calculation  
(2012: exceptional gains of £47m excluded).  
Base salaries for executive directors were increased by 2.0% in February 2013 (having increased by 1.2% in 2011 
and 2.5% in 2012) in line with wider company cost of living awards.  We consider that increases in base salaries 
should continue to be restrained given the potentially significant multiplier effect of such increases on future costs.
LTIP
Under the LTIP a variable percentage of a maximum number of shares granted at the start of each performance 
period can vest, depending on NEXT’s relative TSR performance against a comparator group of some 20 other 
UK retailers.  The maximum number of shares that may be granted is a percentage of each director’s base salary, 
divided by NEXT’s average share price over the three months prior to the start of the performance period.  Details 
of grants and of the comparator group are set out on pages 44 and 45.  
Since 2008 NEXT has made grants twice a year, rather than annually, and two awards matured in the year.  Over 
the performance periods of these grants, i.e.  between August 2009 to January 2013, NEXT’s share price rose from 
1705p to 4059p and market capitalisation grew from £3.4 billion to £6.5 billion, a further £855m was returned 
through share buybacks and £449m paid in dividends.  
The LTIP that matured in July 2012 vested 96% when NEXT’s TSR ranked fifth against the comparator group and 98% 
of the January 2013 LTIP is expected to vest as its TSR also ranked fifth against the comparator group.  This vesting 
is subject to the Committee’s review of the economic underpin performance condition in April.
The value of these two LTIPS’s is high; this is largely due to the rise in the Company’s share price over the performance 
periods as there was no increase in the maximum number of shares originally granted.  Last year, we decided that 
the maximum value of LTIP’s vesting for any participant in any one year should be capped at £2.5m and the Chief 
Executive’s LTIP payments last year were reduced by £704k.  This year the £2.5m cap will again be applied and, 
assuming the Committee confirms the grant maturing in January 2013 has vested, payments to Lord Wolfson and 
Christos Angelides will be reduced by an estimated £327k and £11k respectively.
After applying this cap, the total value to the executive directors of the two LTIPs is estimated at £7.5m, of which 
approximately 51% or £3.8m is attributable to the growth in share price over the performance periods.   ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
34
SMP
Shareholders approved the SMP in 2010.  The purpose of the plan is to encourage ownership of NEXT shares 
amongst executive directors and other senior executives, and thereby further align their interests with shareholders.  
For the 2010 grant, which is due to vest in June 2013, some 25 senior executives were able to reinvest part, or all, of 
their annual bonus in NEXT shares.  Subject to growth in fully diluted EPS over three years, participants are eligible 
to receive matching shares for every share bought.  
Fully diluted EPS for 2012/13 was 280.8p (excluding exceptional gains).  This compares with 176.0p for 2009/10, 
and represents growth of 60% over the three year period.  As a result of this strong performance, the 2010 SMP 
will vest in full in June 2013, subject to the continued employment of participants.  Lord Wolfson has waived his 
potential entitlement under this SMP on the understanding that all NEXT employees who have been employed 
since January 2010 will share an equivalent amount by way of a special bonus in July 2013, pro rata to their annual 
salary.  The estimated value of the amount waived by Lord Wolfson (based on the methodology proposed by BIS) 
is £2.4m.  The estimated total pre-tax value for other executive directors is £4.6m, of which £2.1m (46%) derives from 
the growth in NEXT’s share price since buying their SMP shares.
Total performance-related remuneration
The aggregate performance-related remuneration of the executive directors has increased from £8.7m last year to 
approximately £9.9m (see pages 49 and 50).  This remuneration is directly linked to strong profits and EPS growth, 
which have been reflected in NEXT’s increased share price and therefore the value of shares in the LTIP .  
The Remuneration Committee has carefully reviewed the level of performance-related remuneration earned by 
the executive directors.  The Committee considers that it is a strong reflection of NEXT’ s operating and financial 
performance over the past three years and that it is aligned with the financial interests of shareholders generally.

Measurement bases for elements of total remuneration
1
  Pension values are calculated using the HMRC method proposed by BIS, i.e. 20 times the post-inflation benefit for defined benefit pensions.  It does not necessarily 
represent the economic value of the pension accrual and is not immediately available to the relevant director.  The increase in pension values for Lord Wolfson and 
Christos Angelides over the two financial years is entirely due to the effect of inflation and not to any change in the underlying accrued annual pre-inflation benefit.  Where 
the accrued value is negative, a value of zero is used.
2
  Supplements of 15% of base salary are paid in lieu of pension provision after the directors became deferred members of the defined benefit section of the NEXT Pension 
Plan.  Andrew Varley and David Keens received this supplement from April and June 2011 respectively and Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides from November 2012.
3
  LTIP values for 2012/13 comprise the actual value of awards that have vested and been paid for the performance period ending in July, together with the estimated value 
of awards that will vest for the performance period ending in January, based on the average NEXT share price over the last financial quarter.  For 2011/12 these are the 
actual value of the LTIP awards.
4
  SMP values for 2012/13 assume a maximum vesting in June 2013 and are based on the average NEXT share price over the last financial quarter.  As detailed above, Lord 
Wolfson has waived his potential entitlement to the June 2010 SMP which will mature in June 2013.
We continue to focus on the alignment of executive remuneration and long term growth in shareholder value.  The 
graph below charts total annual remuneration of Lord Wolfson against TSR over the last 10 years and shows that 
TSR grew by 430% more than the Chief Executive’s remuneration, or by 290% excluding the SMP waiver.

Other Remuneration Committee highlights
In addition, during the year we determined the following:
 ❚ EPS growth targets for executive directors’ annual bonus for 2013/14 and review of consistency with bonus 
targets for other NEXT staff.
 ❚ Additional eligibility criteria for participation in future SMP investments whereby participants who sell their 
investment shares prior to or after a new SMP is made will have restrictions placed on the level of investment 
they can make or the number of matching shares that can vest.  
 ❚ Introduction of a minimum NEXT shareholding for all executive directors; the Chief Executive is required to hold 
shares with a value at least 1.5 times pre-tax salary, with other executive directors holding shares equal to their 
annual salary.  All executive directors currently exceed these requirements.  New executive directors would have 
up to 5 years to achieve the required holding.  
 ❚ In line with changes to the defined benefits section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan set out on page 47, 
the pension entitlements of Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides under the unfunded unapproved pension 
arrangement have been amended to freeze the accrual of future benefits under the unfunded arrangement 
based on their base salaries at 31 October 2012.  From that date, Lord Wolfson and Mr Angelides have received 
an annual salary supplement of 15% of their base salary, which does not attract bonus.
The Committee believes NEXT’s remuneration strategy, and the structures implementing that strategy, have 
contributed positively to maintaining the stable and highly motivated management team at NEXT who have 
continued to deliver consistently strong performances for shareholders.  
PART 2: REMUNERATION STRATEGY AND POLICY
Information not subject to audit
The Committee’s objective is to ensure that the remuneration paid to senior executives is appropriate in both 
amount and structure, is directly linked to the Company’s annual and longer term performance and in alignment 
with the interests of shareholders.  We believe that stable and transparent remuneration structures are key elements 
in a fair system for rewarding personal and collective contribution across the business.  There are bonus structures 
throughout the Company, including Head Office, stores, call centres and warehouses.  The focus is on ensuring 
that a competitive and appropriate base salary is paid to directors and senior managers, together with incentive 
arrangements that are:
 ❚ aligned with shareholders’ interests and with long term business strategies;
 ❚ measured against challenging benchmarks, including both absolute financial targets (which are set in 
advance) and relative share price performance;
 ❚ a mix of annual and three year performance periods;
 ❚ paid in a combination of cash and shares; and
 ❚ transparent and without ‘soft’ non-financial targets which could otherwise allow undue discretion to award 
bonuses that do not reflect actual financial performance.  
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group are considered to ensure that any differences for directors 
are justified.  Remuneration policy does not conflict with the Company’s approach to environmental, social and 
corporate governance matters and we believe the current arrangements do not encourage directors to take 
undue business risks.
REMUNERATION REPORT Additional information Parent Company accounts
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
37
Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports
We aim to maintain a stable remuneration structure whereby directors and senior management know at the 
start of each year the potential rewards available to them, and the performance thresholds, without awarding 
significant increases in base salaries.  Over the past three years, general salary levels for all grades across NEXT, 
including directors, have risen by an annual average rate of 1.9%.  Individual merit awards are only given after 
a careful assessment of personal performance.  No executive director has received a merit or promotion award 
during the last three years.  For the current year, base salaries across NEXT and for directors will rise by 2.0%, which 
is again below the level of inflation.  
We give careful consideration to ensuring that there is an appropriate balance in the remuneration structure 
between annual and long term rewards, as well as between cash and share-based payments.  We recognise that 
corporate performance and share price performance may not be correlated in any single accounting period.  
Notwithstanding this, we believe that the present weighting towards rewarding sustainable long term performance 
is well aligned with shareholders’ interests.  This is evident from the high proportion of directors’ performance-related 
pay in the year that derived from growth in EPS and share price, as opposed to increases in salaries or annual 
bonus.
EPS and performance measurement
The Committee reviews each year the basis of annual bonus and performance thresholds for the SMP .  We have 
again concluded that EPS remains the most appropriate measurement for the following reasons:
 ❚ We have used EPS as the determining measurement for many years; it is therefore consistent and transparent 
to participants and shareholders.  The Committee will exercise discretion if required to adjust EPS to reflect what 
it considers to be a fairer outcome for shareholders and executives.  Thus, last year the Committee decided to 
exclude from the calculation of EPS the exceptional profit achieved on the sale of Ventura and the proceeds of 
a refund of VAT.  This year we have excluded the exceptional profit on the sale of a development property and 
the accounting gain resulting from changes to the defined benefit pension scheme.  
 ❚ NEXT is predominantly a single business selling products through a number of channels under the NEXT brand.  
No significant earnings are derived from uncorrelated businesses and therefore a group metric such as EPS is 
logical and consistent with strategy;
 ❚ EPS continues to be the core financial measure by which the Board assesses overall performance; and
 ❚ the use of EPS in determining annual bonuses and the SMP is complemented by the application of TSR for  
the LTIP .
We consider it right that the impact of share buybacks on EPS should be included in performance measurement 
as, for more than a decade, share buybacks have been one of NEXT’s primary strategies in generating value 
for shareholders.  Share buybacks are regularly considered by the Board and are subject to prior approval as 
to timing, price and volume.  Shares are only bought after the Board is satisfied that the ability to invest in the 
business and to continue to grow the dividend would not be prejudiced.  Consistent with the clear focus on long 
term growth in EPS, the Board takes great care to manage the dilutive impact on shareholders of the various 
share-based schemes available to directors and other employees.  The Company regularly purchases shares in 
the market and holds them in NEXT’s Employee Share Option Trust (ESOT) for reissue to satisfy option exercises and 
other share-based payments.   ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE
The following table summarises the objectives and policies with regard to each of the elements of executive 
remuneration and the approach to payments on external recruitment and termination.
REMUNERATION REPORT
Element 
of pay Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential value 
Salary To provide a satisfactory base salary 
within a total package comprising 
salary and performance-related pay.  
Performance-related components 
and certain benefits are calculated 
by reference to base salary.  The level 
of salary broadly reflects the value 
of the individual, their role, skills and 
experience.  
Reviewed annually, effective 
February.  The Committee focuses 
particularly on ensuring that an 
appropriate base salary is paid to 
directors and senior managers.  The 
Committee considers salaries in the 
context of overall packages with 
reference to market data, individual 
experience and performance, 
and the level and structure of 
remuneration for other employees 
and the external environment.  
External benchmarking analysis is 
occasionally undertaken.
There is no guaranteed or maximum 
annual increase.  The Committee 
considers it important that base 
salary increases are kept under 
tight control given the potential 
multiplier effect of such increases 
on future costs.  In the last 3 years, 
salaries have been increased in 
line with the wider company cost of 
living awards.  
Annual 
bonus
To incentivise annual delivery of 
stretching financial goals.  Provides 
focus on the Company’s key 
financial objective of sustainable 
growth in EPS.  
To provide a retention element in 
the case of the Chief Executive 
as any annual bonus in excess of 
100% of base salary is payable in 
shares, deferred for a period of two 
years and subject to forfeiture if he 
voluntarily resigns prior to the end 
of that period.
Based on stretching pre-tax EPS 
targets set annually, taking account 
of a range of factors including the 
company’s own internal budgets 
and the wider background of the 
UK economy.  Pre-tax EPS has been 
chosen as the basic metric to avoid 
executives benefitting from external 
factors such as reductions in the rate 
of corporation tax.  The philosophy 
has been to structure targets such 
that there has to have been growth 
in EPS before any annual bonus is 
payable to executive directors.  By 
contrast we have set the threshold 
for staff bonuses at a lower level 
than for directors.  We have the right 
to apply discretion in the interests of 
fairness to both shareholders and 
executives by adjusting the basis 
for calculating EPS, e.g.  to take 
account of any exceptional items.
A maximum bonus of 150% of salary 
for the Chief Executive and 100% of 
salary for other executive directors.
Long Term 
Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
To incentivise three year total 
shareholder return relative to a 
selected group of retail companies.
Provides focus on delivering 
superior returns to shareholders.
Retention of key employees over 
three-year performance periods.
A variable percentage of a pre-
determined maximum number 
of shares can vest, depending 
on relative total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance against 
a comparator group of retail 
companies (shown on page 44).
The maximum number of shares 
that may be awarded to each 
director is a percentage of each 
director’s base salary at the date 
of each award, divided by NEXT’s 
average share price over the three 
months prior to the start of the 
performance period.
LTIP awards are made twice a year 
to reduce the volatility inherent in 
the TSR performance measure and 
to enhance the portfolio effect for 
participants of more frequent, but 
smaller LTIP grants.
The Chief Executive, other executive 
directors and senior management 
receive grants equal to 100%, 
75% and 60% of annual salary 
respectively every six months.
For Christos Angelides, in recognition 
of the strategic importance of his 
product skills, each of the four 
semi-annual LTIP awards with 
performance periods ending July 
2012 through to January 2014 were 
increased from 75% of salary to 
125%.
The maximum aggregate 
annual award allowed under 
the current plan rules is 200% of 
base salary (300% in exceptional 
circumstances).  With effect from 
2011/12 the maximum value of 
any LTIP awards that vest for a 
participant in a year has been 
capped at £2.5m. Additional information Parent Company accounts

Performance targets Changes for 2012 and 2013
Not applicable In line with the current policy, base salaries of the executive 
directors increased by 2.0% in February 2013, in line with the 
wider company cost of living awards.  
The base salaries for the executive directors with effect from 
February 2013 will be:
 £’000
Lord Wolfson 729
Christos Angelides 529
David Keens 487
Andrew V arley 362
For the year to January 2013, performance targets were set 
requiring pre-tax EPS of 357.4p before any bonus became 
payable, growth of 5% on the prior year.  At this point bonus 
would be 30% of salary in the case of the Chief Executive 
and 20% of salary for other executive directors.  A maximum 
bonus of 150% and 100% of salary for the Chief Executive and 
the other executive directors respectively was payable if pre-
tax EPS exceeded 391.4p, growth of 15%.  A straight sliding 
scale of payments operated for performance between the 
minimum and maximum levels.  
For 2012/13 actual pre-tax EPS achieved, excluding £44.9m of 
exceptional gains, was 391.1p, growth of 14.9%.  Accordingly, 
a bonus of 149% of salary for the Chief Executive and 99% of 
salary for the other executive directors was earned.  
Bonus performance targets for the year ahead have been set 
but are not disclosed in advance for reasons of commercial 
sensitivity.  The targets and performance will be disclosed in 
next year’s Remuneration Report.
Performance is measured over periods of three years, which 
commence in February and August, by comparing TSR 
against some 20 other UK listed retail companies.  
Relative Percentage 
performance vesting
Below median 0%
Median 20%
Upper quintile 100%
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year 
performance period then that award will lapse; there is no 
retesting.
Before any of the awards vest, the Remuneration Committee 
must have regard to the performance of the Company in light 
of underlying economic and other circumstances, including 
EPS performance of the Company and of other UK retailers 
over the period.  Whilst not disclosed in advance, the factors 
taken into account in determining the awards are disclosed 
in the relevant year’s Remuneration Report.
The grant that matured in July 2012 vested 96% as the 
TSR ranked fifth out of 22 in the comparator group.  The 
Remuneration Committee also assessed the performance of 
NEXT during the performance period and determined that 
the economic underpin performance condition had been 
satisfied.
The grant that matured in January 2013 is expected to vest at 
98% as the TSR ranked fifth.  This vesting is subject to review of 
the economic underpin performance condition in April. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

Share 
Matching 
Plan (SMP)
To encourage greater ownership 
of NEXT shares amongst the 
executive directors and other 
senior executives and thereby 
further align their interests with 
shareholders.  
Participants who invest a proportion 
of any annual cash bonus in 
NEXT shares can receive up to a 
maximum of two times their original 
share investment, calculated on 
a pre-tax basis.  Any matching is 
conditional upon achieving fully 
diluted EPS growth targets for the 
following three years.  The executive 
directors and around 20 other 
senior executives participate in the 
scheme.  
Having initiated the SMP in 2010 
with a maximum matching ratio 
of two times, the Committee 
decided in 2012 to cap the level 
of investment for each participant 
and reduce the scale of potential 
matching from a maximum of 
two times to a maximum of one 
times the initial investment.  The 
maximum matching award 
allowed under the plan rules is 
three times.  This may be granted 
if considered appropriate but the 
Committee would consult with 
major shareholders before doing 
so.
Pension To provide post-retirement benefits 
or cash alternative.
All executive directors are deferred 
members of the defined benefit 
section of the NEXT Group Pension 
Plan.
Since becoming deferred members 
of the defined benefit section of 
the Plan, Lord Wolfson and Christos 
Angelides have contributed to the 
unfunded, unapproved pension 
arrangement.  They ceased to 
contribute to this arrangement 
during 2012.  Andrew Varley and 
David Keens ceased to contribute 
to the Plan in October 2008 and 
May 2011 respectively.  Their 
pensions are no longer linked to 
salary and will increase in line with 
statutory deferred revaluation.
Executive directors now receive 
salary supplements of 15% in 
lieu of pension provision.  These 
supplements are less than the 
contributions the Company would 
otherwise make to the defined 
benefit section of the Plan.
Directors and some senior 
managers receive enhancements 
from the Plan,   increasing the 
accrual of their retirement 
benefit up to two thirds of their 
final pensionable earnings 
on completion of 20 years 
pensionable service at age 65.  The 
lump sum payable on death is four 
times base salary.
Other 
Benefits
To provide market competitive non-
cash benefits.
Executive directors receive benefits 
which may include the provision of 
a company car or cash alternative, 
private medical insurance, 
subscriptions to professional bodies 
and staff discount on Group 
merchandise.
Non-executive directors receive staff 
discount on Group merchandise 
but do not participate in any of 
the Group’s bonus, pension, share 
option or other incentive schemes.
Not applicable
Share 
ownership 
guidelines
To align the interests of executive 
directors and shareholders.
For the Chief Executive the 
minimum shareholding is 1.5 times 
his pre-tax salary and for other 
executive directors not less than 
equal to their salary.
Not applicable

Performance targets Changes for 2012 and 2013
Vesting of the awards granted in 2012 is dependent on 
achieving the fully diluted post-tax EPS targets detailed on 
page 45.
The amount of annual bonus that may be invested under the 
SMP in 2013 is the lower of an individual’s post-tax bonus and 
a maximum amount of between £100,000 (2012: £50,000) 
and £200,000 (2012: £125,000).  The matching award remains 
at a maximum of one times the initial investment.
The minimum match of 0.25 of a share requires fully diluted 
EPS growth of 12% and the maximum match of one times 
requires growth of 30% over the three year performance 
period.
 
As noted on page 34, Lord Wolfson has waived his potential 
entitlement to the SMP granted in 2010 and due to mature in 
June 2013.
Not applicable In line with changes to the defined benefits section of the 
NEXT Group Pension Plan, the future pension entitlements 
of Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides under the unfunded 
unapproved pension arrangement will be calculated by 
reference to their base salaries at 31 October 2012, rather 
than final earnings.  From that date, Lord Wolfson and Mr 
Angelides have received an annual salary supplement of 
15% of their base salary.
Not applicable Not applicable
Not applicable This requirement was introduced in 2012, although all 
executives have had significant shareholdings in excess 
of these minimums for many years.  Any newly appointed 
executive director has up to five years to acquire the minimum 
shareholding.  
Performance conditions would normally be based on NEXT 
performance, although any awards made to replace those 
forfeited as a result of joining NEXT may, in exceptional 
circumstances, be made without performance conditions if 
necessary.
No recruitment awards were made during the year. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

Termination 
payments
In line with market practice, to 
ensure NEXT can recruit and 
retain key executives, whilst 
protecting the Company from 
making payments for failure.
In practice, the Committee 
would consider the need 
for and quantum of any 
termination payments 
having regard to all of 
the relevant facts and 
circumstances at that 
time.  
Any future service 
contracts will take 
into account relevant 
published guidance.
Each of the executive directors has a rolling service 
contract which commenced on 14 March 2013 and 
which is terminable by the company on giving one 
year’s notice.  The Company has reserved the right 
to make a payment in lieu of notice on termination 
of an executive director’s contract equal to their 
base salary and contractual benefits (excluding 
performance-related pay).  If notice of termination 
is given immediately following a change of control 
of the Company, the executive director may 
request immediate termination of his contract 
and payment of liquidated damages equal to the 
value of his base salary and contractual benefits.
In normal circumstances executives have no 
entitlement in respect of loss of performance 
bonuses and all share awards would lapse following 
resignation.  However, under certain circumstances 
(e.g.  ‘good leaver’ or change in control), and 
solely at the Committee’s discretion, annual bonus 
payments may be made and would ordinarily be 
calculated up to the date of termination only.  In 
addition, awards made under the LTIP and SMP 
would generally be time pro-rated and remain 
subject to the application of the performance 
conditions at the normal measurement date.  
In the event of any termination payment being 
made to a director (including any performance-
related pay elements), the Committee will take full 
account of that director’s duty to mitigate any loss 
and, where appropriate, the Committee may seek 
independent professional advice and consider the 
views of shareholders as expressed in published 
guidance prior to authorising such payment.
Chairman 
and non-
executive 
director fees
To ensure fees paid to the 
Chairman and non-executive 
directors are competitive 
and comparable with other 
companies of equivalent size 
and complexity.
Additional fees are paid to 
non-executive directors who 
chair the Remuneration and 
Audit Committees, and the 
Senior Independent Director.
Remuneration of the non-
executive directors is 
determined by the Chairman 
and the executive directors.
The Chairman is paid 
monthly and non-
executive directors are 
paid quarterly.
Fee levels for non-
executive directors are 
reviewed bi-annually.
The Chairman was paid a fee of £250,000 per 
annum and the basic non-executive director 
fee was £50,000, with a further £10,000 paid to 
the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees, and to the Senior Independent 
Director.
Claw-back Claw-back provisions are to 
be included in the service 
contracts for all executive 
directors and will be enforced 
where appropriate to 
recover performance-related 
remuneration which has been 
overpaid due to: a material 
misstatement of the Company’ s 
accounts; errors made in the 
calculation of an award; or a 
director’s misconduct.

PART 3: ADDITIONAL REGULATORY DISCLOSURES
Information not subject to audit
Further details of each of the components of the directors’ remuneration are given in the report below.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
During the year the Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors:
Jonathan Dawson (Committee Chairman)
Steve Barber
John Barton
Christine Cross
Francis Salway
Caroline Goodall (from January 2013)
The Committee met five times during the year under review and all meetings were fully attended with the exception 
of one which Caroline Goodall was unable to attend due to other commitments relating to her induction as a 
director of NEXT.  
Role of Remuneration Committee
The Committee determines the remuneration of the Group’s Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of 
senior executives.  It is also responsible for determining the targets for performance-related pay schemes, approves 
any award of the Company’s shares under share option or incentive schemes to employees and oversees any 
major changes in employee benefit structures.  The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.  
The remuneration of non-executive directors is decided by the Chairman and executive directors of the Board.  The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website (www.nextplc.co.uk) or on request from 
the Company Secretary.
Assistance to the Committee
During the period the Committee received input from the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director and retained 
the services of Aon Hewitt and FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP to provide independent external advice regarding 
executive remuneration.  These advisors have no other connection with the Company.  PricewaterhouseCoopers 
provided independent verification services of total shareholder returns for NEXT and the comparator group of 
companies under the long term incentive plan (LTIP).
Additional information on Board remuneration

The comparator group of companies for the three year performance periods to July 2012 and January 2013 was 
as follows:
 
ASOS Findel J Sainsbury N Brown 
Burberry French Connection Kesa Signet
Carpetright Halfords Kingfisher Tesco
Carphone Warehouse HMV Marks & Spencer WH Smith
Debenhams Home Retail Group Morrisons
Dixons Retail JJB Sports Mothercare

Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports
For subsequent performance periods the changes to the comparator group above are:
1.  periods ending July 2013 and January 2014 - Ted Baker added and Findel, French Connection and JJB Sports 
removed;
2.  period ending July 2014 - Supergroup added and Signet removed; and
3.  periods ending January 2015 and July 2015 - Dunelm Group added and HMV removed.
The comparator group consists of UK listed retail companies which are most comparable with NEXT in size or 
nature of their business.  Comparison against such a group of companies is more likely to reflect the Company’s 
relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in grants being made on an appropriate basis.
Details of potential awards granted for outstanding performance periods are as follows:

The Committee has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT shares or cash and to date 
it has allowed participants the choice.  Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and 
share price at the start of the performance period.  No individuals included in the plan have received grants under 
the management share option scheme in the same year.
Share Matching Plan
Vesting of awards is dependent solely on achieving the fully diluted post-tax EPS targets detailed below.  
Required fully diluted EPS (pence)
Date of grant For 0.5:1 match For 1:1 match For 2:1 match
June 2010 191.5 206.5 221.5
April 2011 231.3 240.2 258.1
For 0.25:1 match For 0.5:1 match For 1:1 match
April 2012 267.2 281.5 310.2
These targets require a minimum three year growth in EPS of 8.8% (2010 award) and 12% (2011 and 2012 awards) 
before any shares vest and a maximum award is only achieved if EPS growth reaches 25.8%, 25% and 30% 
respectively over three years.  The effective matching ratio will be calculated on a straight line basis for EPS falling 
between each of the threshold points.  Details of the calculation of fully diluted EPS are provided in Note 9.  The 
Committee has reviewed the performance conditions of awards to be made in 2013 and for the period to January 
2016, the fully diluted EPS hurdle will be 314.5 pence (12% growth) for a minimum match of 0.25 of a share to vest 
and 365.0 pence (30% growth) for the maximum match of one share.   ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

Management share options
The management share option plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years 
following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees.  This plan is primarily aimed at middle management 
and senior store staff.  No options were granted to any directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the 
year under review.  No employee is entitled to be granted options under the scheme and be included in the LTIP 
or the SMP in the same year.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash 
settlement alternatives.  Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant, which are generally 
made annually.  The maximum total market value of shares (i.e.  the acquisition price of shares) over which options 
may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary.  This limit may be 
increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on 
the grant of options following recruitment.  The maximum grant during the year was 120% of salary.  
Sharesave options
Executive directors can participate in the Company’s Save As You Earn (Sharesave) scheme which is open to 
all employees.  Grants are generally made annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules which limit the 
maximum monthly savings to £250.  Options are granted at a discount of 20% to the prevailing market rate and are 
exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.  Sharesave options granted to, or exercised by, directors 
in the year are detailed on page 52.
 
Dilution of share capital by employee share plans
The Company monitors and has complied with dilution limits in its various share scheme rules and has not issued 
a significant number of new or treasury shares in satisfaction of share schemes in the last 10 years.  Share-based 
incentives are usually satisfied from shares held by the ESOT – see Note 26.  
Group pension plan 
Executive directors are members of the NEXT Group Pension Plan (the “Plan”) which has been approved by HM 
Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.  
The trustee of the Plan is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited (the “Trustee”).  The Board of the Trustee 
includes members of the Plan, a pensioner member and an independent director who is also the Chairman of 
the Trustee.  Two of the directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by NEXT; the other 
directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can be removed by NEXT.  All directors of the 
Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.  No director of the 
Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plan’s investments are kept separate from the business of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.  
Responsibility for investment of the Plan’s funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment 
managers.
The Group operates a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a 
reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.  The participation of members 
in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section
Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the Plan.  Members elect to pay either 3% or 
5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.  For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of 
three times the member’s base salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the member’s 
fund.  
REMUNERATION REPORT Additional information Parent Company accounts
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports
Defined benefit section
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000 and during the current year the Group reviewed 
its operation for remaining employee members.  Following a consultation process with those employees, from 
November 2012 the future accrual of pension benefits will be based on pensionable salary frozen at that time, 
rather than final earnings.  In addition, those employees can elect to receive either a salary supplement or 
additional contributions to a defined contribution scheme.  From November 2012, the defined benefit section 
provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth (depending on the member’s chosen 
contribution rate) of pensionable earnings at 31 October 2012 for each year of pensionable service.
 
This section provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants’ pensions on death in service or 
following retirement.  Pensions are only payable to deceased members’ children after death in service.  In the 
case of ill-health retirement, only the accrued pension is payable.  All benefits are subject to Plan limits.  Increases 
to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to 
limited price indexation.  From 2006, sales and profit related bonuses were excluded from pensionable earnings 
and the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.  
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the 
rate of 17.5%.  The last full triennial valuation of the Plan was carried out as at March 2010, the next will take place 
as at March 2013.  As calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the surplus in 
the Plan at January 2013 was £65.6m; further details are given in Note 21 to the financial statements.
Certain members whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance 
are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement.  The relevant members contribute 
towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by a deduction of 5% on all pensionable earnings.  Since 
April 2011, where existing members have reached either the annual or lifetime pension contributions limits, the 
Company has offered those members the choice of leaving the defined benefit section and either joining the 
defined contribution section (with an enhanced Company contribution) or taking a salary supplement, in both 
cases equal to 10% or 15% of their salary (depending on their existing contributions and benefits).  
Auto-Enrolment
Following the introduction of Auto-Enrolment (A-E) in 2012, most employees now have the option of joining the 
NEXT plan, the statutory A-E plan or opting out of pension provision through the Company.  Contributions to A-E 
commenced in February 2013.
Specific information in respect of executive directors’ pension entitlements is detailed on page 53.  
Service contracts
Executive directors
Apart from service contracts (detailed in the Remuneration Policy Table on page 42), no director has had any 
material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Non-executive directors

they are appointed in the expectation that they will serve for a minimum of six years, subject to satisfactory 
performance and successful re-election at Annual General Meetings.   ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

  Directors received a salary supplement of 15% in lieu of pension provision from April 2011 (Andrew Varley), June 2011 (David Keens) and November 2012 (Lord Wolfson 
and Christos Angelides).
Lord Wolfson was the highest paid director in the current and previous year; £350,000 of his annual performance-
related bonus is payable in NEXT shares (2012: £56,000), deferred for a period of two years and will be forfeited if 
he voluntarily resigns prior to the end of that period.
The Company paid a pension under the unfunded, unapproved arrangement to a former director of the Company 
of £36,496 (2012: £35,606).   ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

Long term incentive plans
For the three year performance period to July 2012, TSR ranked fifth in the comparator group of 22 and 96% of 
the grant made in July 2009 vested.  Before allowing the award to vest the Remuneration Committee assessed 
the performance of the Company during the performance period in light of underlying economic and other 
conditions (‘the economic underpin’).  The Committee noted that EPS compound growth of 19.7% and pre-tax 
profit compound growth of 10.4% over the three year period, was well ahead of RPI compound growth of 4.3%.  In 
addition, dividends had grown in line with EPS and £727m had been returned to shareholders through buybacks.  
The Committee also assessed earnings growth against selected comparable major UK retailers and concluded 
that NEXT had performed favourably.  Taking these factors into account, the Committee determined that the 
economic underpin performance condition for the July award had been satisfied.  Details of the amounts that 
vested for each executive director are detailed in the table below.  The awards were cash settled for all executives 
except David Keens who received shares.
 
For the performance period to January 2013, TSR ranked fifth against the comparator group of 22 which corresponds 
to an expected vesting of 98% of the maximum award made in January 2010.  The Remuneration Committee will 
formally assess the performance of the Company for this period in April on the same basis as the grant made in 
July 2009 before determining whether the economic underpin performance condition has been satisfied.  If the 
condition is satisfied, the January 2013 award will be settled in April, and based on the share price of £41.10 on 19 
March 2013, awards for each executive director for the year are detailed below:

 Full details of deferred bonus are set out on pages 38 and 49.

  See page 50 for details of the performance conditions and vesting levels applicable to the LTIP schemes vesting in the year, including the restriction on the maximum 
value that could vest.
4
  The maximum value of LTIP awards that vest for a participant in a year is capped at £2.5m.  This cap was applied to Lord Wolfson’s awards that vested in the year to January 
2012.  The impact of the cap was to reduce shares vested and increase shares lapsed by 23,344 shares.

The LTIP performance periods which mature after January 2013 are not yet complete and no entitlement has yet 
been earned.  A charge of £23,368,000 for the year (2012: £17,159,000) has been made in the accounts in respect 
of these LTIP grants, of which approximately £9,554,000 (2012: £7,956,000) related to the executive directors.
For all LTIP participants, the total maximum shares receivable at January 2012 was 1,364,175 (January 2011: 
1,776,284).  During the year, grants over 517,192 shares vested (2012: 615,044), grants over 57,545 shares lapsed 
(2012: 189,723) and further grants over 295,033 shares were issued (2012: 392,658).  At January 2013 the total 
maximum shares receivable was 1,084,471 (excluding the impact of any cap on the total value which may apply) 
with an average remaining contractual life of 1.6 years (2012: 1.6 years).

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF NEXT PLC
We have audited the financial statements of NEXT plc for the 
year ended 26 January 2013 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity ,  the 
Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements, Accounting 
Policies and the related Notes 1 to 32 and C1 to C7. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the 
parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’ s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and 
auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement on page 26, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 ❚ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 26 January 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
 ❚ the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union; 
 ❚ the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 ❚ the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 ❚ the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 ❚ the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 ❚ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 ❚ the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ❚ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
 ❚ we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 ❚ the directors’ statement, set out on page 32, in relation to 
going concern; 
 ❚ the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; 
and
 ❚ certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on directors’ remuneration.

Basis of preparation
The financial statements of NEXT plc (“the Company”) and NEXT plc and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use in the 
European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.   The financial statements have been prepared 
on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, pension assets and liabilities and share-based 
payment liabilities which are measured at fair value.   The financial statements are for the 52 weeks to 26 January 
2013 (last year 52 weeks to 28 January 2012).
There have been no changes in accounting policies this year or last year and the principal policies adopted are 
set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings.   All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of any subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal.   The results and net assets of 
associated undertakings are incorporated into these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.   The Group includes foreign entities whose functional currencies are not Sterling.  On 
consolidation, the assets and liabilities of those entities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date and income and expenses are translated at weighted average rates during the period.   Translation 
differences are recognised in equity.
Transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate on the 
transaction date, whilst assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet date.   Exchange 
differences are recognised in the income statement.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services and is stated net of sales taxes 
and returns.  Sales of goods are recognised on delivery.   Directory service charge income is accrued on a time 
basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.   Revenue from the sale of gift cards 
is deferred until their redemption.
Underlying profit and exceptional items
Exceptional items are significant items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which are shown separately in the 
income statement to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying financial performance during the year.  
Further details are given in Note 6.
Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Depreciation is charged so as to write down the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their remaining 
useful lives on a straight line basis.  Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and 
are summarised as follows: 
Freehold and long leasehold property 50 years
Plant and fittings:
 Plant, machinery and building works 10 – 25 years
 Fixtures and fittings 6 – 15 years
 Vehicles, IT and other assets 2 – 6 years
 Leasehold improvements the period of the lease, or useful life if shorter

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

Business reports Consolidated accounts
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the acquisition cost over the Group’s interest in the assets 
and liabilities recognised.  Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever there is 
an indication of impairment.
Other intangible assets
Separately identifiable intangible assets obtained in a business acquisition are initially recognised at fair value, if 
this can be measured reliably and the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights.  Other intangible assets 
are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
Lipsy brand names and trademarks 10 years
Lipsy customer relationships 4 years
Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies and equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active 
market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, subject to review for impairment.
Impairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment.  If any impairment loss arises, the asset value is adjusted to its estimated recoverable 
amount and the difference is recognised in the income statement.
Pension scheme
The Group operates a pension plan which consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.  The 
assets of the plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.  The Group also provides other, unfunded, 
pension benefits to certain plan members.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit and unfunded arrangements are determined using the 
projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.  The net 
defined benefit pension asset or liability represents the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets less the present 
value of the defined benefit and unfunded liabilities.  A net pension asset is only recognised to the extent that it is 
expected to be recoverable in the future.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which 
they occur.  Other income and expenses are recognised in the income statement.
The cost of the defined contribution section is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Inventories 
Inventories (stocks) are valued at the lower of standard cost or net realisable value.  Net realisable value is based 
on estimated selling prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.
Directory and other receivables
Directory customer receivables represent outstanding customer balances less any allowance for impairment 
which is based on objective evidence and recent default experience by customer account category.  Other trade 
receivables are stated at invoice value less any allowance for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short 
term deposits, less bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand.  Short term deposits are those with an original 
maturity of three months or less. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
62
Corporate bonds and bank borrowings
Corporate bonds and bank borrowings are recognised at the net proceeds received and subsequently adjusted 
where hedge accounting applies (see interest rate derivatives below).  Accrued interest is included within other 
creditors and accruals.
Share-based payments
The fair value of employee share options is calculated when they are granted using a Black-Scholes model.  The 
resulting cost is charged in the income statement over the vesting period of the option, and is regularly reviewed 
and adjusted for the expected and actual number of options vesting.
For cash-settled share-based payments (including the long term incentive plan), the fair value of the liability is 
determined at each balance sheet date and the cost is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period.  
Taxation
Taxation, comprised of current and deferred tax, is charged or credited to the income statement unless it relates to 
items in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.  In such cases, the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is calculated using rates of taxation 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the asset or 
liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.  Deferred tax assets are 
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.  Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of investments in subsidiaries and 
associates where the reversal of any taxable temporary differences can be controlled and are unlikely to reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
Other financial assets and liabilities: derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates relating to the purchase of overseas sourced products and changes in interest rates relating to 
the Group’s debt.  In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative 
purposes.  Foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are stated at their fair value, being the estimated amount 
that the Group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date based on prevailing foreign 
currency and interest rates.
Foreign currency derivatives
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are designated and effective as hedges of future 
cash flows are recognised in equity in the fair value reserve, and subsequently transferred to the carrying amount of 
the hedged item or the income statement.  Realised gains or losses on cash flow hedges are therefore recognised 
in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or 
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.  If the hedged transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the 
income statement.
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting in IAS 39 are recognised in the income statement.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
63
Business reports Consolidated accounts
Interest rate derivatives
The Group uses interest rate derivatives to hedge part of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s 
corporate bonds.  The carrying values of the relevant bonds are adjusted only for changes in fair value attributable 
to the interest rate risk being hedged.  The adjustment is recognised in the income statement and is offset by 
movements in the fair value of the derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting in IAS 39 are recognised in the income statement.
Share buybacks
The Group has regularly returned surplus cash to shareholders through share buybacks.  Shares purchased for 
cancellation are deducted from retained earnings at the total consideration paid or payable.  The Company also 
uses contingent share purchase contracts and irrevocable closed period buyback programmes.  The obligation 
to purchase shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract, even when that obligation is conditional 
on the share price.  Any subsequent reduction in the obligation caused by the expiry or termination of a contract 
is credited back to equity at that time.
Shares held by ESOT
The NEXT Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, principally 
under share option schemes.  Shares in the Company held by the ESOT are included in the balance sheet at cost 
as a deduction from equity.  The ESOT may also use contingent share purchase contracts and irrevocable closed 
period share purchase programmes which are accounted for as described above.
Provisions
A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Leasing commitments
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the period of the 
lease.  Contingent rentals payable based on store revenues are accrued in line with the related sales.
Premiums payable, rent free periods and capital contributions receivable on entering an operating lease are 
released to income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
The Group does not have significant finance leases.
Significant areas of estimation and judgement
The preparation of the financial statements requires judgements, estimations and assumptions to be made that 
affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  The nature of estimation means that actual 
outcomes could differ from those estimates.  Significant areas of estimation for the Group include the expected 
future cash flows applied in measuring impairment of Directory customer receivables (Note 14), estimated selling 
prices applied in determining the net realisable values of inventories (Note 13 and inventories policy above) 
and the actuarial assumptions applied in calculating the net retirement benefit obligation (Note 21).  The Audit 
Committee section of the Corporate Governance Report (page 29) contains further information on the judgmental 
areas considered by the Committee during the year.  
Future changes to accounting standards 
An amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits was published in June 2011 and will first apply to the Group next year.  
It is not expected to have a significant impact.
Various other new accounting standards and amendments were issued during the year, none of which have had 
or are expected to have any significant impact on the Group. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

1. Segmental analysis
The Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on management accounts reviewed 
by the Board.  The performance of operating segments is assessed on profits before interest and tax, excluding 
equity settled share option charges recognised under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment and unrealised foreign 
exchange gains or losses on derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.  The activities, products and 
services of the operating segments are detailed in the Directors’ Report on page 3.  The Property Management 
segment holds properties and property leases which are sub-let to other segments and external parties.

(a) During the year the Group reviewed the operation of the defined benefit section of its pension plan, which was 
closed to new members in 2000.  From November 2012, the future accrual of benefits for remaining employee 
members is based on pensionable earnings at that time, rather than final earnings.  This change gave rise to 
a one-off accounting gain of £42.1m.
(b) In June 2012 a second tranche of pensions in payment were subject to a buy-in arrangement.  The Plan 
paid £23.4m to an insurance company and in return will receive payments equal to those pensions.  This 
eliminates the Plan’s exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks of those pensions.  The contract also 
allows for the buy-in to be converted to a buy-out, following which the insurance company would become 
directly responsible for those pensions, and steps are being taken to proceed on this basis.  Accordingly, the 
transaction has been accounted for as a settlement, with the £6.3m accounting charge presented in the 
income statement as an exceptional item.
(c) During the year the Group sold its last remaining stock from its property development activities for £15.0m 
which had a book value of £5.9m.  The £9.1m gain is presented as an exceptional item because of its size 
and non-recurring nature.  
(d) Last year, the Group reached agreement with HM Revenue & Customs for the recovery of overpaid VAT on 
product sales made during the period from 1973 to 1988.  The total amount recoverable was £9.2m, comprising 
£3.1m of VAT and interest of £6.1m.
(e) The Group sold its customer services management business, Ventura, which resulted in an exceptional gain of 
£38.0m last year.  Net cash proceeds of £63.0m were received on completion and the final balance of £1.5m 
was received in the current year.

 Discontinued operations – 24.1p
 Total 320.1p 282.0p
 Underlying basic earnings per share 297.7p 255.4p
Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the parent company 
and the weighted average number of shares ranking for dividend less the weighted average number of shares 
held by the ESOT during the period.
Underlying earnings per share is based on profit before the exceptional items described in Note 6. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

 Discontinued operations – 23.5p
 Total 311.7p 275.1p
 Underlying diluted earnings per share 289.9p 249.1p
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic 
earnings per share as increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.  Dilutive shares arise from 
employee share option schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s 
ordinary shares during the period.  Their dilutive effect is calculated on the basis of the equivalent number of nil-
cost options.  Where the option price is above the average market price, the option is not dilutive and is excluded 
from the diluted EPS calculation.  There were no such share options in the current year (2012: nil).

 Discontinued operations – 22.5p
 Total 301.9p 263.4p

Fully diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of 
basic earnings per share, increased by the weighted average total employee share options outstanding during 
the period.  Fully diluted earnings per share is used for the purposes of the Share Matching Plan, described further 
in the Remuneration Report.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date on the basis of value in use.  As this exceeded carrying 
value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised (2012: £nil).
NEXT Sourcing
The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT 
Sourcing to meet these requirements based on past experience.  In assessing value in use, the most recent financial 
results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent 
growth assumed, and discounted at 10% (2012: 10%).
Lipsy
In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangibles, the five year business plan for Lipsy was used 
and cash flows beyond this period extrapolated using a growth rate of 2% (2012: 2%), and discounted at 15% 
(2012: 15%).  The key assumption is the net contribution margin from sales.
For both NEXT Sourcing and Lipsy, the calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of the 
goodwill and other intangible assets and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to conclude that there 
was no impairment.

Expected irrecoverable amounts on overdue balances are provided for based on past default experience.  
Receivables which are impaired other than by age or default are separately identified and provided for as 
necessary.
The credit quality of customer receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed by reference to the 
historical default rate for the preceding 365 days of approximately 1% (2012: 1%), although default rates over 
shorter periods may show significant variations.
Other debtors and prepayments do not include impaired assets.  The maximum exposure to credit risk at the

21. Pension benefits
The Group operates a pension plan in the UK which consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.  
The assets of the Plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.  The Plan has equal pension rights with 
respect to members of either sex and complies with the Employment Equality Regulations (2006).  The defined 
benefit section was closed to new members in 2000 and is a funded arrangement which provides benefits based 
on pensionable earnings.  The Group also provides unfunded retirement benefits to plan members whose benefits 
would otherwise be restricted by the lifetime allowance.
In June 2012, the Plan purchased a second buy-in contract for £23.4m in respect of pensions which had come 
into payment since the first buy-in in 2010.  The contract allows for the transaction to be converted to a buy-out, 
following which the insurance company would become directly responsible for the pension payments, and it is 
intended to proceed on this basis.  Accordingly, the transaction has been accounted for as a settlement and the 
accounting charge of £6.3m is included in the income statement as an exceptional item.
From November 2012 the future accrual of benefits for remaining employee members is based on pensionable 
earnings frozen at that time rather than final earnings.  Those employees receive either additional contributions 
to the defined contribution section or a salary supplement.  This change resulted in an accounting gain in the 
current year of £42.1m which is included in the income statement as an exceptional item.
The defined contribution section is for all members who joined after 2000, and benefits are based on each individual 
member’s personal account.  The Group has also made arrangements for auto-enrolment and contributions 
commenced in February 2013.

The IAS 19 valuation of the defined benefit section was undertaken by an independent qualified actuary as at 26 
January 2013 using the projected unit credit method.  As a substantial majority of pensions in payment are now 
insured, this year we have adopted separate assumptions for pensioner and non-pensioner liabilities.  Changes 
in the assumptions for pensioner members covered by insurance (which now represent approximately 27% of the 
gross pension liabilities) have a neutral effect on the net IAS 19 balance sheet position.

 Gilts N/A 2.65%
 Property N/A 5.55%
 Insurance contracts N/A 5.00%
 Other N/A 2.65%
 Average N/A 5.18%
The adoption of IAS 19 (revised) from the beginning of the 2013/14 financial year means that it is not necessary to 
set assumptions for expected asset returns as at 26 January 2013.
Expected rates of return on plan assets are based on external historical and forecast market information, and 
actual rates will most likely vary from those shown above.  The key sensitivity in the calculation is the discount rate.  
A decrease of 0.25% in the discount rates used would increase the gross liabilities by approximately £29m, which 
would be partly mitigated by an increase of approximately £5m on the insurance assets.
Members of the defined benefit section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently 
makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.  The most recent full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at March 
2010.  The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at March 2013 and future funding requirements will be 
determined taking into account recent plan changes.  Members of the defined contribution section contribute 3% 
or 5% of pensionable earnings, which is matched by the Company.
Total employer contributions of £24.3m (2012: £13.1m) were made during the year, including a special contribution 
of £11m in respect of the buy-in and £5.4m (2012: £4.2m) in respect of the defined contribution section.

Fair value calculation
The fair value of management, sharesave and share matching plan options granted is calculated at the date of 
grant using a Black–Scholes option pricing model.  Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical 
volatility of the Company’s share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.  The expected life 
applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for options granted in the years ended 26 January 2013 and 
28 January 2012 based on information at the date of grant:

26.   Shares held by ESOT
The NEXT 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) has an independent professional trustee resident in 
Jersey and provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options, at 
the discretion of the Trustee.  All management and sharesave options which were exercised during the year were 
satisfied by shares issued from the ESOT.
At 26 January 2013 the ESOT held 6,531,837 (2012: 5,637,388) ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company, the 
market value of which amounted to £265.1m (2012: £148.8m).  Details of outstanding share options are shown in 
Note 25.
The consideration paid for the ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company held by the ESOT at 26 January 2013 
and 28 January 2012 has been shown as an ESOT reserve and presented within equity for the Company and the 
Group.  All other assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT have been incorporated into the accounts of the 
Company and the Group.

balance sheet date and had been satisfied by ordinary shares issued by the ESOT.
27.   Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities
NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign 
currency risks associated with the Group’s activities.  As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the 
Group uses derivative financial instruments.  In accordance with the Group’s treasury policy, derivative instruments 
are not entered into for speculative purposes.  Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies 
the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument 
types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank 
overdrafts and loans, and corporate bonds.  The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance 
for the Group’s operations.  In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within 
risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the 
operating needs of its businesses.  The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure 
that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows (including 
interest) of the Group’s financial liabilities:

At 26 January 2013 the Group had borrowing facilities of £300m (2012: £300m) in respect of which all conditions 
precedent have been met and which are committed to December 2016 (2012: December 2016).  None of this 
facility was drawn down at 26 January 2013 (2012: £nil).
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk 
on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.  The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored 
regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where 
appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.

The Group has interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of part of the interest rate risk associated 
with the Company’s corporate bonds.  Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the 
bonds, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest equivalent to the relevant coupon rate, and pays a variable rate.  
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 20.  
The fair values of the Group’s interest rate swaps, including accrued interest, are as follows:
2013
£m
2012
£m
Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 34.0 31.4
Other interest rate derivatives 4.3 8.8
Total interest rate derivatives 38.3 40.2
Other interest rate derivatives relate to economic hedges of variable rate interest payments due under swaps 
relating to the 2013 corporate bond which are not able to be hedge accounted for under IAS 39.
The fair values of derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.  Group 
policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to 24 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.  This 
hedging activity involves, inter alia, the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed 
in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and 
manage the Group’s ongoing exposure.

27. Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities (continued)
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas 
investments and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.  The Group’s net exposure to foreign currencies, 
taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 30.

Credit risk
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies 
which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.  Concentrations of risk are mitigated 
by the use of various counterparties at any one time.  All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject 
to credit verification procedures.  Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.  The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base 
being large and diverse.  The Group’s outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 14.
Capital risk
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 31, and equity attributable to the equity 
holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity.  The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities 
within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of 
capital.  The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share, the Group has been returning 
capital to shareholders by way of share buybacks in addition to dividends.  Share buybacks are transacted through 
both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share purchases. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

30.  Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.  The table below illustrates the 
hypothetical sensitivity of the Group’s reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the 
US Dollar/Sterling and Euro/Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain 
unchanged.  The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change, 
based on historic volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash 
flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.  For 
foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income 
statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

Sterling weakens by 10%
US Dollar (0.8) (8.0) 36.5 35.5
Euro (1.0) (1.2) 1.9 4.1
Year end exchange rates applied in the above analysis are US Dollar 1.58 (2012: 1.57) and Euro 1.17 (2012: 1.19).  
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and 
nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Group’s reported profit and closing equity to a 0.5% 
increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.  The sensitivity rate of 0.5% 
represents the directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions:
 ❚ For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is 
assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
 ❚ Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the 
purpose of this analysis.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

C1.  Accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted for the parent company, NEXT plc, are the same as those used for the Group 
which are set out on pages 60 to 63.  As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income 
statement of the Company is not presented as part of the financial statements.  The profit after taxation dealt with 
in the accounts of the holding company was £478.7m (2012: profit of £179.1m).
C2. Investments in subsidiaries
The Company has taken advantage of Section 410(2) of the Companies Act 2006 to list only its principal subsidiary 
and associated undertakings at 26 January 2013.  All of these are wholly owned by the Company or its subsidiary 
undertakings, registered in England and Wales, and operate predominantly in the United Kingdom unless otherwise 
stated.

C3. Other financial assets
Other financial assets comprise interest rate derivatives as detailed in Note 15 of the consolidated financial 
statements, which are carried at their fair value.
C4. Current and non-current liabilities
Details of the terms of bank overdrafts and unsecured bank loans are given in Note 17.  Further information on the 
Company’s corporate bonds is given in Note 20.
Trade and other payables comprise £286.1m (2012: £235.5m) of amounts due to subsidiary undertakings and £11.6m 
(2012: £11.9m) of other creditors and accruals.  Other current financial liabilities include interest rate derivatives 
carried at fair value (Note 19) and amounts payable under the Company’s closed season buyback arrangements 
and contingent purchase contracts, including those entered into by the ESOT for the Company’s own shares.  Other 
non-current financial liabilities comprise interest rate derivative instruments carried at fair value (Note 19).
C5. Share capital, ESOT and other reserves
Details of the Company’s share capital and share buybacks are given in Note 23.  ESOT transactions are detailed 
in Note 26.  Other reserves in the Company balance sheet of £985.2m (2012: £985.2m) represent the difference 
between the market price and the nominal value of shares issued as part of the capital reconstruction on 
acquisition of NEXT Group plc which has been subject to Section 131 Companies Act 1985 merger relief.
C6. Financial instruments
The Company is exposed to liquidity, interest rate, credit and capital risks and adopts the same approach to the 
management of these risks as the Group, as detailed in Note 27.  The Company is not exposed to foreign currency 
risk as it has no foreign currency assets or liabilities.  
Trade and other receivables primarily comprise amounts due from Group companies and therefore the Company’s 
exposure to credit risk is limited; none of these assets are overdue or impaired.
The Company hedges its exposure to interest rate risk associated with its corporate bonds as detailed in Notes 20 
and 27.  The fair values of the Company’s corporate bonds are shown in Note 29.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON RESOLUTION 18: OFF MARKET PURCHASES OF OWN SHARES
As noted on pages 23 and 24 in the Directors’ Report and Business Review, approval will be sought from shareholders to renew 
the Company’s authority to make off-market purchases of its shares. 
By virtue of special resolution number 16 passed at the Company’s 2012 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) shareholder authority 
was given to the Company to make on-market purchases of shares. This authority was limited to a maximum of 24.95 million 
shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM held in 2013 or 1 August 2013. At the same AGM, authority was granted 
to the Company to make off-market purchases of shares for cancellation under contingent purchase contracts to be entered 
into with any of Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc (the “Bank(s)”). 
This authority was limited to a maximum of 8 million shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM to be held in 2013 
or 1 August 2013. Pursuant to those authorities and up to 19 March 2013, the Company has bought back 4,767,669 shares for 
cancellation, representing 2.9% of its issued share capital as at the date of the 2012 AGM, at a total cost of £162.9 million. Of 
these, 650,190 shares were bought back under contingent purchase contracts.
Under Sections 693 and 694 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), the Company is not permitted to make off-market purchases or 
contingent purchases of its shares unless it obtains advance shareholder approval to the proposed contract terms. Furthermore, 
under the rules of the UK Listing Authority (the “Listing Rules”) the Company may not purchase its shares at a time when any 
director is in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information about the Company. Accordingly, no purchases of shares would 
normally be made in periods when the directors might be in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information (“Close Periods”). 
Typically, these include the periods from the Company’s half year end up to the announcement of its interim results in September 
and the January year end up to the announcement of full year results in March each year. These Close Periods inevitably reduce 
the number of shares the Company is able to purchase.
In order to achieve maximum flexibility in its share purchase activities, the Company is able to enter into irrevocable and non-
discretionary programmes to allow it to buy shares during Close Periods. Another method of providing flexibility in its share 
purchase activities, and reducing the cost of share buybacks, is for the Company to enter into contingent forward purchase 
contracts outside of Close Periods. Pursuant to the authority granted at the 2012 AGM, the Company entered into agreements 
with the Banks (the “Existing Agreements”) and the Company intends to terminate the Existing Agreements and enter into new 
agreements with each of the Banks. Under these agreements (the “Programme Agreements”), the Company may (although it is 
not obliged to) enter into contingent forward trades (“Contingent Forward Trades” or “CFT”) from time to time. The terms of each 
CFT will provide for the Company to purchase a fixed number of shares each week over a period of between 20 to 30 weeks. The 
maximum number of shares that can be purchased under each CFT is limited to 50,000 shares per week. Details of each CFT will 
be announced to shareholders on the day it is entered into by the Company.
Whether or not the Company purchases shares in a particular week during the term of a CFT is dependent upon the Company’s 
share price not reaching a level set at the time that contract is entered into (the “Suspension Level”). The Suspension Level is 
determined by the Company and must be between 104% and 110% of the Company’s share price as at the start of the CFT. 
The price at which the Company may purchase shares during the term of a CFT (the “Forward Price”) shall also be fixed at the 
start of the CFT. The Forward Price is subject to a maximum of 99% of the share price at the start of the contract and a minimum 
of 10 pence (the par value of an ordinary share). 
This structure would allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price (as at the time each CFT 
commences), for so long as the Suspension Level is not reached, without breaching the Listing Rules. If the Suspension Level is 
reached, the CFT would terminate automatically at that time and no further shares would be purchased under that contract. 
Under the provisions of sections 693 and 694 of the Act, the Programme Agreements and Contingent Forward Trades are 
contingent purchase contracts to purchase shares by the Company off-market. Accordingly resolution 18, which will be proposed 
as a special resolution, seeks shareholder approval to the terms of the Programme Agreements to be entered into between the 
Company and each of the Banks. The Programme Agreements will have a duration of the shorter of the period to the date of the 
next AGM to be held in 2014 or 1 August 2014 and will incorporate the terms of an ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule. The 
Programme Agreements will be entered into and each CFT will be effected outside a Close Period but shares may be purchased 
during a Close Period by the Company. The minimum and maximum amount of time between a CFT being effected and shares 
being purchased is 5 days and 30 weeks respectively.

Business reports Additional information
Should shareholder approval be granted, any number of CFT may be effected with the Banks at any time, provided that: 
 ❚ the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority would be  
5.0 million, representing circa 3% of its issued share capital at 19 March 2013;
 ❚ the total cost of shares that the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority may not exceed  
£200 million (including costs);
 ❚ the Forward Price may not exceed the higher of 105% of the average middle market closing price of the Company’s shares as 
derived from the Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five days immediately preceding the day on which the CFT 
was effected and the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003; 
 ❚ the Forward Price will be no more than 99% of the share price at the time the Contingent Forward Trade was effected;
 ❚ the minimum price that can be paid for any share is £0.10; and
 ❚ only one Contingent Forward Trade will be entered into on any particular day. 
Subject to the limits set out above, the Company will select the Suspension Level and the duration of each CFT, and the Forward 
Price will be determined by the relevant Bank. Shares purchased via the Programme Agreements will reduce the number of 
shares that the Company may purchase under any authority granted at the AGM on 16 May 2013 for on-market purchases. No 
shares will be purchased under that authority on the same day that a CFT is entered into. The authority granted to the Company 
under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company held in 2014 or on 1 August 2014, whichever is the 
earlier, unless such authority is renewed prior to that time (except in relation to the purchase of shares under any CFT effected 
before the expiry of such authority and which might be completed wholly or partly after such expiry). The purchase of shares 
under the Programme Agreements will always be physically settled by delivery of shares to the Company (except in the case of 
certain events of default or termination events). 
A copy of each of the Programme Agreements will be available at the AGM on 16 May 2013. Copies will also be available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office at Desford Road, Enderby, Leicester LE19 4AT and at the offices of Pinsent Masons, 
30 Crown Place, Earl Street, London EC2A 4ES during usual business hours until the date of the AGM and at the Meeting itself.
The total number of employee share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 19 March 2013 was 8,468,294. This represents 
5.3% of the issued share capital at that date. If the Company were to buy back the maximum number of shares permitted 
pursuant to both the existing authority for off-market purchases granted at the 2012 AGM (which will expire at the 2013 AGM) and 
the authority sought by this special resolution, then the total number of options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 19 March 
2013 would represent 5.7% of the reduced issued share capital.
Attendance, voting and questions
All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. A member who is entitled to attend and vote 
may appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote instead of him, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights 
attached to a different share or shares held by him. A proxy need not also be a member. A proxy may vote on any other business 
which may properly come before the meeting. If you do not intend being present at the meeting please either sign and return 
a hard copy form of proxy so as to reach the Company’s registrars at least 48 hours before the meeting or follow the instructions 
for electronic proxy appointment through CREST or through www.sharevote.co.uk set out below. The return by a member of a fully 
completed form of proxy will not preclude any such member from attending in person and voting at the meeting.
A person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information 
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between them and the shareholder by whom they were nominated, 
have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the AGM. If a Nominated Person has no such 
proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, they may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to 
the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statements of the rights of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in the above paragraph and in the paragraphs 
headed “Electronic proxy appointment through CREST” and “Proxy card” below do not apply to a Nominated Person. The rights 
described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by registered members of the Company. Nominated persons are reminded 
that they should contact the registered holder of their shares (and not the Company) on matters relating to their investments in 
the Company. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
100
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted 
by the most senior holder will be accepted, the senior holder being the first named of the joint holders to appear in the Company’s 
share register.
A member who appoints as their proxy someone other than the Chairman, is responsible for ensuring that the proxy attends 
the meeting and is aware of the voting intention of the member. If no voting instruction is given, the proxy has a discretion on 
whether and how to vote.
If a member submits more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt 
of proxies will take precedence. 
The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and its articles of association, specifies 
that only those shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company as at 6pm on 14 May 2013 shall be entitled 
to attend or vote at the aforesaid general meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. 
Changes to entries on the relevant register of securities after 6 pm on 14 May 2013 (or 6 pm on the day that is two days before 
any adjourned meeting) shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
All resolutions will be put to poll votes. This means that the votes of all shareholders, including those who cannot attend the 
meeting but who validly appoint a proxy, are counted. The procedures for the poll votes will be explained at the AGM.
In respect of resolution 18 on off-market share purchase contracts, the Companies Act 2006 provides that this resolution will not 
be effective if any member of the Company holding shares to which it relates (i.e. those which may be purchased pursuant to 
the Programme Agreements) exercised the voting rights carried by any of those shares in voting on the special resolution and 
the resolution would not have been passed if they had not done so. Therefore, NEXT intends to disregard any poll votes which are 
cast in favour of resolution 18 attaching to 5.0 million shares (being the total maximum number of shares which the Company 
is permitted to purchase pursuant to the Programme Agreements) from both the total number of votes cast in favour of this 
resolution and the total number of votes cast.
As at 19 March 2013 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice) the Company’s issued share capital 
consists of 161,234,237 ordinary shares. All of the ordinary shares carry one vote each and there are no shares held in treasury. 
A member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must ensure any such question relating to the 
business being dealt with at the meeting is answered but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly 
with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the answer has already been given 
on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the company or the good order of 
the meeting that the question be answered.

Electronic proxy appointment through CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for 
the AGM to be held on 16 May 2013 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. 
CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on 
their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications 
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of 
whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy 
must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt 
of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as 
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to 
retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations 
will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to 
take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), 
to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a 
message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The CREST Manual is available at www.euroclear.com/CREST.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
Documents available for inspection
The following documents will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business hours and 
will be available for fifteen minutes prior to and for the duration of the AGM:

Spirax Sarco is the global leader in the supply of engineered 
solutions for the efficient design, maintenance and operation  
of industrial and commercial steam systems. As a heat source, 
steam is the natural choice in most industrial processes due to  
its high heat-carrying capacity, controllability, sterility and efficiency 
as a heat transfer fluid. With our specialist knowledge, technical 
expertise and wide range of products, as well as our extensive 
global presence, Spirax Sarco is uniquely positioned to provide  
a broad range of environmentally-friendly engineered solutions  
to the many industries using steam.
Our customers face a variety of challenges including high energy 
costs, pressure to improve the efficiency and capacity of existing 
processes and the need to comply with increasingly stringent 
health, safety and environmental legislation. Our direct sales force 
is trained at length in product application, system performance 
and troubleshooting of steam systems. The Spirax Sarco 
offering is very wide, from single products through to complete 
turnkey bespoke packages that can include design, fabrication, 
installation, commissioning and maintenance. All of this creates  
a compelling and attractive one-stop approach for our customers. 
Watson-Marlow is the global leader in peristaltic pumping and 
specialises not only in the design and manufacture of the most 
advanced peristaltic pumps, but also in the application of those 
pumps to customers’ processes. Our peristaltic pumps are ideal 
for difficult pumping applications. They are highly accurate and 
controllable and virtually maintenance-free, making them a very 
reliable and cost-effective solution. 
Operating a make-to-order manufacturing system and 
uniquely extruding our own pump tubing, we have the leading 
position in the supply of peristaltic pumps to the biotechnology, 
pharmaceuticals, wastewater treatment, mining and food 
industries. The peristaltic pumping market is a small part of the 
global pump market but it is one of the fastest growing segments.

Chairman’s statement
Bill Whiteley
Given the challenging global 
economic environment, I am 
pleased to report a good result 
for 2009, with record sales and 
profits that demonstrate the quality 
and resilience of our business, 
and reflect the investments and 
improvements we have continued 
to make. We generated a significant 
underlying cash inflow and the 
dividend has again been increased.
Sales at £518.7 million were up 3% 
from £502.3 million in 2008, with 
improving year-on-year comparisons 
in the last few months of the year in 
all segments. Sales included a small 
contribution from acquisitions and a 
benefit of over 10% from favourable 
average exchange rates.
Adjusted operating profit at  
£89.9 million increased by 5% from  
£85.7 million in 2008 due to reduced 
headcount and costs, especially in 
the second half-year, good pricing 
dynamics and the benefit of favourable 
exchange rates. This was reflected in 
the trading margin that improved to 
17.3% (2008: 17.1%). Operating profit 
was ahead in all segments except 
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
Net finance charges were £2.5 million 
compared with net income of  
£1.7 million in 2008, with the 
deterioration due largely to the  
impact of a turnaround in the net 
finance income related to defined 
benefit pension funds. The Group’s 
share of the after-tax profits of our 
Associate companies was unchanged 
at £2.8 million.
Adjusted pre-tax profit increased to 
£90.2 million (2008: £90.1 million) 
and earnings per share were 82.2p 
(2008: 83.4p). Cost reduction actions 
included reducing the total employee 
headcount by 7% during the year and, 
in December, we also announced  
a reduction in our French factory. 
As a result the total headcount 
reduction costs charged in 2009  
were £11.4 million with further efficiency 
gains expected in 2010. The pre-tax 
profit after charging these costs  
and including the amortisation of 
acquisition-related intangible assets 
was £76.4 million (2008: £85.2 million).
As previously reported, in October 2009 
the Group completed the acquisition of 
the Maso and Sine business from Maso 
Process-Pumpen GmbH (MasoSine) 
for £21.9 million and the integration into 
Watson-Marlow Pumps is progressing 
well. In October we also completed the 
acquisition of our Turkish distributor, 
Inter Valf, for an initial consideration of 
£2.8 million. We are pleased with the 
performance of these businesses since 
acquisition and with their small positive 
contributions to our earnings per share 
for the year.
The Board is recommending a 10% 
increase in the final dividend of 25.6p 
per share payable on 21st May 2010 
to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 16th April 2010. 
This, together with the interim dividend 
of 10.5p per share paid in November 
2009, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 36.1p per share. This compares 
with a total dividend of 33.3p per share 
last year, an increase of 8%. The cost 
of the interim and final dividends is 
£27.6 million which is covered 2.3 times 
by earnings. No scrip alternative to the 
cash dividend is being offered. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 3
“ We have made a positive 
start to the year. In the first 
two months of 2010, sales 
in constant currency have 
increased by 2% compared 
with 2009.” 
Mike T ownsend retired as Chairman 
following the AGM in May 2009 and  
we thank him for his contribution  
over his 12 years on the Board as 
a non-executive director. I have 
succeeded Mike as Chairman on  
1st July 2009 following seven years  
as a non-executive director. Upon  
the retirement of Einar Lindh at the  
end of 2008, Dr Krishnamurthy 
Rajagopal was appointed as an 
independent non-executive director on  
10th February 2009. Executive director 
Alan Black retired from the Board on 
30th April 2009. Mike Gibbin joined 
the Board as an executive director on 
1st May 2009, with responsibility for 
our Supply operations and our North 
American steam business companies. 
Clive Watson joined the Board as an 
independent non-executive director on 
17th July 2009 and is Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. We thank our retiring 
Board members and welcome the new 
members to the Board.
Prospects
There is increasing evidence that the 
global economy has started to recover. 
Industrial production rates are now 
positive across most of Asia and are 
improving in Europe and the Americas. 
However, in our view the economic 
upturn remains fragile and we are  
not expecting a rapid rebound in  
our markets.
We have continued to invest in the 
business through the recession to 
improve manufacturing efficiency, 
accelerate new product development 
and increase penetration of our 
markets. In 2010, we will capture the 
full-year benefit of last year’s cost 
reductions, but will reinvest some of 
these savings to increase investment  
in the business to enhance future 
growth and margin prospects.
We have made a positive start to 
the year. In the first two months of 
2010, sales in constant currency have 
increased by 2% compared with 
2009. We remain vigilant and given no 
renewed weakness in our markets or 
significant negative currency impact, 
we expect to make further progress  
in 2010.

Chief Executive Officer
Sharpening  
our edge
What makes Spirax Sarco different?
We are a niche industrial engineering group that supplies  
a very broad base of customers around the world in a  
wide range of industries. We concentrate on assisting our 
customers achieve process efficiency, increased production 
output, energy savings and regulatory compliance. We go to 
market through an extensive network of outstanding local 
sales and service engineers that are highly trained and 
singularly focused on providing the knowledge and expertise 
to understand the challenges facing steam and pump users. 
Our application and systems knowledge, breadth of products 
and services, experience and global presence all enable us 
to offer the most extensive range of engineered solutions to 
our customers. The position of Spirax Sarco and  
Watson-Marlow as world leaders is founded on our  
long-held strategy of investing for growth both organically 
and by complementary acquisitions.
The Group is very international. We have 49 operating 
companies in 34 countries around the world. Our 
headquarters are based in the UK and we have sizeable 
manufacturing and selling operations on nearly every 
continent. Our manufacturing operations are strategically 
located in all key market regions with major facilities in the 
UK, France, Italy, USA, Brazil, Argentina, and China. We  
also manufacture in South Africa, Mexico, Netherlands,  
India, Germany, Sweden, Korea and Denmark. Amongst  
our competitors, we have generally been first to build a  
direct selling and trading organisation in new markets and, 
within the past year, we acquired our Turkish distributor, 
giving us a direct presence in this important country that 
boasts the world’s 16th largest economy.
The resilience of our business was readily visible in the past 
year, as our total sales at constant currency declined less 
than 7%, as compared to falls of typically 15% to 20% or 
more for many other international industrial engineering 
businesses. This resilience stems from a large portion of 
our revenues being derived from product replacements and 
spares, the diverse range of industries served, the breadth 
of product solutions we bring to our customers and good 
geographic distribution of sales, well spread between 
developing and developed markets.
We serve a very broad range of industries including: foods, 
brewing & distilling, dairies, oil refining & petrochemicals, 
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, fine chemicals, mining, 
printing, water & wastewater treatment and many other 
general process industries. We also work with hospitals and 
commercial buildings by supplying solutions for sterilisation, 
space heating, hot water generation and laundering. It is 
important to note that no single industry represents more 
than 10% of sales and no single customer accounts for more 
than 1% of sales – in short, our sales are very well spread.
We have remained focused on our niche businesses and 
their development through geographic expansion, new 
product developments, acquisitions and expanding our 
range of products and service solutions. This has enabled us 
to increase market share and to generate steady, profitable 
growth for a long period of time, evidenced by our excellent 
42 year dividend record. Although we are the market 
leader in both our businesses, there remain considerable 
opportunities available to us in our fragmented markets.
How does Spirax Sarco create value? 
The Spirax Sarco and Watson-Marlow businesses are 
anchored on the philosophy of understanding the detail 
of the customers’ processes and the ability to apply the 
properly engineered solutions. T o do this we go to market 
using mostly direct sales people – about 70% of our sales 
are generated through our direct selling approach. In doing 
so we form strong, long-term customer relationships. The 
Group employs nearly 1,200 direct sales and service people 
working in 56 countries in the world. 
Our sales people are highly skilled in both product 
applications and, perhaps even more importantly, in system 
understanding and troubleshooting for unique customer 
applications and industrial processes. We train our sales 
engineers in our 38 training centres located around the world,  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 5

Sharpening our edge  
through being the best in  
our field
Spirax Sarco beat international 
competition to win the 2009 IChemE 
Innovation and Excellence Award in 
Energy, with a Flash Recovery Energy 
Management Equipment (FREME) 
system that enables customers to 
recover waste heat. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 7
most of which are equipped with live steam that facilitates 
hands-on training. These centres are also used to train our 
customers’ technical staff. 
This product and systems application knowledge, combined 
with local availability of products, engineered packages 
and on-site services, enables our customers to achieve 
meaningful energy savings, comply with increasingly 
stringent health, safety and environmental regulations,  
reduce emissions and achieve more efficient processes. 
It is not our products alone that provide the value to our 
customers; it is the application of our extensive knowledge.
How is Spirax Sarco managing the business through this 
difficult economic period?
Like other industrial businesses, we took early action and 
made the appropriate decisions to reduce our operating 
costs. Whilst needing to address the abrupt decline in 
economic activity, we largely protected our global network  
of highly skilled and trained sales engineers. 
As a result, we reduced our workforce by 7% through  
the year, most of which came as part of an announced  
5% headcount reduction in early 2009, with the balance  
coming from natural attrition throughout the year. Most of the 
headcount reductions were in back-office support functions 
and manufacturing. Additionally, our local operating company 
management teams were vigilant in controlling other operating 
costs. The announced general headcount reduction was the 
first ever for Spirax Sarco – indicative of the unprecedented 
global economic downturn – but it was managed effectively 
by our management teams around the world. 
We took steps to size our manufacturing operation in 
Cheltenham, not only for the decline in volume resulting  
from the global economic recession but also in anticipation  
of the volume transfer to our new manufacturing plant in 
China. Additionally, we recently announced a reduction in  
our manufacturing footprint at Châtellerault, France, also in  
line with our global manufacturing strategy.
We continued to invest in key growth programmes for the 
future. In China, we selectively added sales people for the 
steam business. We also invested in our Watson-Marlow 
business to continue developing new markets, adding  
sales people in Russia and Mexico. We believe that our  
sales teams are well positioned to handle the eventual 
rebound in our end markets. Also, we increased the  
amount of direct R&D investment, virtually the only area  
of the business that was allowed increased expenditure.  
New product development is a key activity that will drive 
longer-term growth and therefore we have continued to 
invest through the downturn. We have also sustained  
capital expenditure at a high level in the year as we  
invest in delivering our manufacturing strategy.
What are the key business drivers and trends?
Our business is well spread geographically, across the 
product range and over a diverse range of industries.  
The following key factors have the primary influence  
on the underlying demand in our markets:
Global economic growth. • 
Industrial production and investment. • 
Capacity utilisation. • 
Energy costs. • 
Increasing customer outsourcing of design  • 
and maintenance.
Regulatory legislation (eg, emissions, hygienic  • 
standards, plant safety).
Looking ahead how do you plan to take the business 
forward?
Our business strategy remains focused on achieving  
long-term, steady and profitable sales growth. The industrial 
and commercial steam-using market is highly fragmented 
and although Spirax Sarco is the market leader, we still have 
significant growth opportunities. 
“ It is not our products alone that provide the 
value to our customers; it is the application 
of our extensive knowledge.” 8 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009

Sharpening our edge  
by investing in our  
manufacturing processes
We completed the construction of a 
completely sterile £6.3 million silicone 
tubing extrusion plant in Falmouth, 
enabling Watson-Marlow to offer 
high purity pumping solutions to its 
customers in the biopharm sector. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 9
We believe the underlying industry drivers are favourable for 
long-term growth. For the steam business, energy prices are 
at historic highs and the emphasis on reducing emissions 
is becoming increasingly important; these factors provide 
a nice tailwind. We are reaping the benefits of our solutions 
approach to problem solving as customers increase the 
outsourcing of design and maintenance; customers are 
looking for simple, single-source transactions to solve their 
local maintenance, operations, product quality and capacity 
expansion issues. Our ability to effectively bundle a wide 
range of products and pre-fabricated engineered packages 
backed up by our installation and commissioning services,  
is simply the best and is unmatched by any competitor.  
We increasingly expand on a simple troubleshooting sales 
call, to audit an entire steam system and provide a range  
of engineered solutions in a single transaction that  
customers value. 
We are widening our range of products and site services  
to expand our market reach. Our technically expert direct 
sales force allows us to leverage our brands into new 
products and applications. This increases the amount  
of plant spend that we can capture in small-scale capital 
projects and maintenance activities that are at the heart of 
our business. There remains good growth potential, whether 
in the developing economies of Asia and South America or  
in the large and more mature markets of western Europe  
and North America, as we apply tailored market  
development strategies.
One of our major tasks at our Watson-Marlow business 
is to educate customers about the intrinsic advantages 
of peristaltic pumps so that they will increasingly be used 
to solve difficult pumping problems. The product range 
is being progressively widened and developed, making 
use of improved electronics and materials to broaden the 
addressable market by taking business from other pump 
types. All these factors make peristaltics one of the fastest 
growing sectors of the global positive displacement pump 
market. As we widen the possible applications for our 
pumps, we see increasing opportunities, including hygienic 
applications in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and the  
food industries. 
We continue to make complementary bolt-on acquisitions 
to build our product portfolio, introduce new technologies 
and speed access to geographic markets. During 2009 
we acquired MasoSine, a supplier of unique sinusoidal 
pumps that extends the application range of our existing 
line of Watson-Marlow hygienic pumps. We also acquired 
the business of our Turkish distributor, Inter Valf Sanaya 
ve Ticaret, to build a direct presence in this important and 
developing market.
How is Spirax Sarco sharpening its edge?
The Group is making a significant investment in 
modernising its manufacturing processes and facilities 
to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs. We 
are midway through a four-year £50 million capital 
investment programme, having recently completed the 
new tube extrusion facility in Falmouth, England. The new 
manufacturing plant in China will begin production late 
Q2 2010. The consolidation of the three manufacturing 
facilities onto one site at our major manufacturing location in 
Cheltenham, England will be mostly completed by year-end 
2010. Some production has already been transferred into 
the first refurbished buildings and we should see the cost 
reduction, efficiency and stock reduction benefits from this 
site consolidation starting in 2011.
Despite the challenging market environment in 2009, we 
increased our investment in R&D by over 20% and have 
begun to generate a stronger flow of new products whilst 
shortening the time to market. There are a number of  
exciting new product development programmes underway  
in both the steam business and Watson-Marlow, and we 
expect new products to make an increasing contribution to 
sales growth. We were particularly pleased to win the UK’s 
IChemE 2009 ‘Innovation and Excellence Award in Energy’ 
with a packaged Flash Recovery Energy Management 
Equipment system. The Board has approved the creation of 
a new R&D development and test centre at our Cheltenham 
manufacturing site that will increase our testing capability to 
much higher live steam temperatures, pressures and flow 
rates – we believe this new test centre will be the world’s 
largest and most advanced facility of its type.
We are taking advantage of our global purchasing power  
to consolidate purchasing volumes with fewer key suppliers 
of our cast, wrought and forged metals. This has resulted in 
material cost benefits in the past several years, and we expect 
further benefit in 2010 to our materials and freight costs.
We have developed online based tools to improve the 
technical training of our sales engineers around the world 
and speed up their development process. Additionally, we 
are implementing information collection and sharing software 
to improve our ability to utilise application knowledge and 
provide a forum to accommodate greater knowledge sharing 
amongst work groups across our global sales network.
People lie at the core of every business and we have high 
expectations of performance from our people. We have 
taken steps to upgrade the quality of professional human 
resource leadership in guiding our progression to a more 
performance-based culture throughout the organisation. We 
have articulated a concise set of core values and leadership 
competencies that are being implemented worldwide.

“ T otal Group sales increased by 3%  
to £518.7 million.” 
Spirax Sarco helps Campil  
to reduce energy 
consumption, down time  
and maintenance costs.
The customer
Campil is based in Portugal and makes 
tomato pastes at a tomato pulp plant.
The challenge
The plant has several water evaporators 
that use steam to concentrate tomato 
pulp.
Peak loads made it difficult to achieve 
the stringent steam quality required and 
at times the boilers tripped out causing 
shut down of the entire plant. 
Our solution 
We provided a complete control 
sequencing and supervision system, 
including steam meters, control 
valves, controllers, modulating feed 
water controls and other equipment 
to improve steam quality, all linked by 
central software supervision.
Results
The plant now runs efficiently with 
improved steam quality, lower fuel 
consumption and reduced maintenance 
costs. The expected payback period is 
two years. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 11
Current environment
The abrupt decline in world economic 
activity impacted our business starting  
in late 2008 and the rate of sales decline 
accelerated until mid-year 2009. Since 
then, market conditions in most 
geographic regions have generally 
stabilised and in recent months sales 
growth has turned positive versus the 
early months of 2009. Whilst conditions 
vary considerably from market to market, 
taken as a whole, market conditions 
have slowly improved throughout much 
of Asia, South America and the USA  
but conditions in Europe continue to  
be challenging.
Energy prices remain comparatively high 
and we are encouraged that our energy 
saving initiatives and, perhaps more 
importantly, the companion emissions 
reductions that are achieved through 
improved system efficiency, continue  
to be of value to our customers.
Trading
T otal Group sales increased by 3% to 
£518.7 million (2008: £502.3 million). 
The Group benefited from favourable 
movements in exchange rates. Sales 
at constant currency declined less than 
7% for the year , recovering from the 9% 
decline reported in the 9th November 
2009 Interim Management Statement 
covering sales year-to-date through 
October. The constant currency sales 
decline was widespread across all 
geographic regions, indicative of the 
wide-ranging impacts of the global 
economic recession. Acquisitions 
contributed less than 1% to sales growth. 
For the Spirax Sarco steam business, 
sales increased 2% (down 8% at 
constant currency). Sales increased 
in both the Asia Pacific region and the 
Americas, although sales declined 
slightly in the Europe, Middle East and 
Africa (EMEA) geographic segment. 
In constant currency, sales declined 
across all geographies and nearly 
all product segments. However, we 
achieved constant currency sales 
growth in our heat exchange solutions 
business by refocusing our sales 
engineers and from winning good 
projects in China, Korea and Italy. 
Watson-Marlow sales increased 11%

currency), benefiting from currency 
movements and a 3% contribution  
from the acquisition of MasoSine in  
late August.
The Group’s adjusted operating profit 
was £89.9 million (2008: £85.7 million), 
giving an increase of 5% in sterling 
and down 12% at constant currency 
– a very good overall result against 
the record operating profit achieved 
in 2008. The increase in operating 
profit arose from cost reductions, 
pricing, limited pay increases, global 
resourcing of materials and favourable 
exchange rates, offset by decreased 
manufacturing efficiency from lower 
volumes. Higher material prices in 
the first half-year were matched by 
falling prices in the second half, leaving 
material prices broadly flat for the 
year. All of this resulted in the adjusted 
operating profit margin improving to 
17.3% from 17.1% in 2008.
Europe, Middle East and Africa 
(EMEA)
2009 2008 Change
Revenue £225.5m £226.1m 0%
Operating profit £35.6m £39.2m -9%
Operating margin 15.8% 17.3%
Sales were broadly unchanged at 
£225.5 million (down 8% at constant 
currency) as deteriorating market 
conditions impacted virtually all our 
companies in the region. Exchange 
movements had a positive effect with 
the average sterling exchange rate 13% 
weaker against the euro than in 2008. 
Our larger companies in Italy, France 
and Germany did well and increased 
sales in sterling terms due to good 
day-to-day maintenance activities 
and the shipment of several projects 
from backlog in Italy that carried over 
from the prior year. Additionally, after 
a slow start in the first half-year for 
our Russian company, market activity 
improved markedly in the second 
half-year and for the full year we saw 
sales growth in local currency. Sales in 
the UK domestic market suffered from 
a decline in spending by the National 
Health Service but there were some 
good project wins in December. The 
decline in the global export markets 
served by many of our European OEM 
customers impacted sales at several 
of our companies that depend more 
heavily on OEMs.
Shipments from our main factories in 
the UK and France fell more sharply 
early in the year due to lower demand 
from our sales operations worldwide 
as they reduced local inventories, but 
improved in the second half-year as 
market conditions stabilised.
Operating profit of £35.6 million was 
down 9% from £39.2 million in 2008.  
At constant currency the operating 
profit was down 18%, spread across 
most companies but mitigated by tight 
cost control and temporary government 
employment support measures. The

Business review continued
performance in South Africa improved 
markedly following the restructuring in 
late 2008. Operating profit fell at our 
major factories due to lower volumes, 
although this was somewhat offset  
by the cost reduction actions and  
the benefit of our global materials  
resourcing programme. The operating 
margin was 15.8% (2008: 17.3%). 
The underlying headcount, excluding 
acquired businesses, was down 8% 
across the EMEA segment at year-end 
2009 compared with the prior year.
Americas
2009 2008 Change
Revenue £104.6m £101.9m +3%
Operating profit £13.9m £12.1m +14%
Operating margin 13.2% 11.9%
Sales in the Americas increased 
modestly in sterling by 3% to  
£104.6 million from £101.9 million in 
2008. Sales benefited from average 
sterling exchange rates weakening by 
19% against the US dollar and by 7% 
against the Brazilian real. At constant 
currency, sales declined 9% from  
2008 spread across all our operations  
in the region. Sales in the US did 
relatively well from stabilising market 
conditions and higher shipments 
from backlog in the second half-year, 
although market conditions have 
remained weak in Canada. Sales in 
South America were down from the 
effects of the decline in demand from 
export-oriented customers.
Operating profit in the Americas 
increased 14% to £13.9 million, which 
compares with £12.1 million in 2008; at 
constant exchange the operating profit 
was down just 5%. Y ear-on-year, 
operating profit was buoyed by 
favourable exchange transaction 
benefits on imports into the region,  
cost reduction actions taken early in the 
year and the elimination of the closure 
costs of UltraPure (£1.1 million in 2008) 
and its operating losses. Profit declined 
in Brazil from competitive pressures as  
the currency strengthened in the 
second half-year. For the region, the 
operating profit margin improved to 
13.2% as against 11.9% in 2008. 
Headcount in the Americas was down 
13% at year-end 2009 as compared 
with the prior year.
Asia Pacific
2009 2008 Change
Revenue £104.7m £98.9m +6%
Operating profit £23.1m £21.1m +9%
Operating margin 22.1% 21.4%
Sales increased in Asia Pacific by 6% 
to £104.7 million (2008: £98.9 million). 
Favourable exchange rates had a 
positive effect on sales, as the Chinese 
renminbi strengthened 21% on average 
against sterling; the Japanese yen was 
32% stronger. At constant exchange, 
Asia Pacific sales were down 5%. 
Market activity in the region was mixed, 
although local currency sales increases 
were achieved in China, Korea and 
“ We have continued to increase sales 
coverage in China by adding a number  
of new sales people.” 16 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009
Business review continued
Malaysia. As expected, the second  
half-year benefited from higher 
shipments, particularly in Korea, 
and the backlog was reduced at our 
Chinese operation. We have continued 
to increase sales coverage in China by 
adding a number of new sales people.
The operating profit was £23.1 million, 
which compares with £21.1 million in 
2008, an increase of 9%. At constant 
currency operating profit declined 14%. 
We saw good profit gains from China, 
which again produced the largest profit 
in the region, and from Malaysia. The 
good second half in Korea recovered 
the profit decline seen in the first 
half-year. Our India operation (reported 
as an Associate) achieved both a sales 
and profit increase, and did well to 
improve the volume of small ticket 
maintenance purchases to replace the 
sales value of the large Reliance refinery 
project shipped in the prior year. The 
overall operating profit margin in Asia 
Pacific was therefore 22.1% in 2009 
(2008: 21.4%). Headcount in Asia 
Pacific was down 3% at year-end 2009 
as compared with the prior year, despite 
a 7% increase in employees in China.
Watson-Marlow MasoSine 
replaces gear pumps at 
chocolate factory
The customer
Kinnerton, part of Zetar plc, is a 
confectionery specialist based in 
Norfolk, UK.
The challenge
Like many other ingredients, caramel is 
very viscous when cool and Kinnerton 
required pumps which would perform 
effectively in a new line for caramel 
production. 
Our solution
In place of the gear pumps already used 
by Kinnerton in similar applications we 
recommended the MasoSine SPS2 
sanitary pump, which is part of a range 
that can handle flow rates up to 90,000 
litres per hour and pressures up to  
10 bar . MasoSine pumps have a 
very gentle pumping action which is 
frequently used in sanitary applications 
to handle chocolate, cheese curd, 
yogurt, concentrates, yeast, batter  
and stews. 
Results
Kinnerton have now standardised  
on MasoSine pumps. “Not only 
does the SPS2 handle all its pumping 
requirements without problem”, says 
plant engineering supervisor Phil 
Barwick, “once again ease of cleaning 
is very impressive. Even after pumping 
glucose a simple but thorough  
flush-through is all that is required.”  
This means that hygiene standards  
are consistently met. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 17
Watson-Marlow
2009 2008 Change
Revenue £83.8m £75.4m +11%
Operating profit £22.3m £18.4m +21%
Operating margin 26.6% 24.4%
Sales increased at Watson-Marlow  
by 11% to £83.8 million (2008:  
£75.4 million). Sales benefited from  
the weakness of sterling against the US 
dollar and were down 1% at constant 
currency. The acquisition of MasoSine 
in late August 2009 added 3% to  
sales. The geographic sales trends  
at Watson-Marlow were similar to the 
steam business, with sales growth 
weakest within the EMEA region but 
with similarly good performances from 
the French and German operations. 
Strong year-on-year growth in tubing 
shipments contributed positively to 
EMEA sales and provides a good  
base for the new tubing extrusion plant 
completed in December 2009. Bredel 
product shipments were particularly 
impacted by exposure to the weaker 
mining and general industrial markets. 
Sales in the Americas region of 
Watson-Marlow benefited from several 
biopharmaceutical projects in the US. 
Our developing sales teams in the 
Asia Pacific region performed strongly, 
with sales well ahead on a relatively 
small base, highlighting the good 
opportunities for growth in China  
and Korea in particular.
The operating profit was £22.3 million, 
which compares with £18.4 million in 
2008, an increase of 21%. At constant 
currency, operating profit was down 
3%, including a small contribution from 
the MasoSine acquisition. Operating 
profit benefited from exchange 
transaction effects of weaker sterling 
and the stronger US dollar. Constant 
currency operating profit was nicely 
ahead in the US and in Asia. The 
operating profit margin was 26.6% 
in 2009 (2008: 24.4%). Underlying 
headcount at Watson-Marlow, excluding 
acquisitions, was 2% lower at year-end 
2009 as compared with the prior year. 18 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009
Financial review
David Meredith FCMA
2009 was another good performance 
against the background of a world 
economic recession. We achieved 
record sales and adjusted pre-tax 
profit, and delivered an improved 
operating profit margin and good 
cash generation.
Spirax Sarco uses adjusted figures as 
key performance measures in addition 
to those reported under IFRS. Adjusted 
figures are used unless otherwise 
stated and they exclude the amortisation 
or impairment of acquisition-related 
intangible assets and exceptional 
headcount reduction costs, including 
the associated tax effects. We have 
adopted the new accounting standard 
IFRS 8 Segmental Reporting for 2009. 
The new segmental disclosure gives 
greater visibility and is more consistent 
with management reporting. The new 
segments comprise the Steam 
Specialties business, geographically 
split into Europe, Middle East and  
Africa (EMEA), Americas (North and 
South America) and Asia Pacific, and 
the Watson-Marlow Pumps business. 
Restated disclosures for the full year 
2007, half-year 2008 and full year 2008 
were published in August 2009.
Sales of £518.7 million were a  
record and up 3% compared with  
£502.3 million in the prior year.  
Currency movements were favourable 
and added over 10% to sales on 
translation. Average exchange rates  
for sterling were weaker against most 
currencies and in particular versus the 
US dollar, euro and Chinese renminbi 
which are important currencies for the 
Group. Acquisitions during the year 
added less than 1% to sales. 
Underlying sales, excluding currency 
and acquisition effects, were down  
7% for the year but with improving 
year-on-year comparisons in the last 
few months of the year.
Adjusted operating profit of  
£89.9 million increased by 5% over  
the previous year profit of £85.7 million.  
We acted early in the year to reduce 
operating costs, including a reduction  
in our global workforce of 7% during 
the year, largely in back-office, support 
functions and manufacturing; a further 
reduction in our French manufacturing 
unit will take effect in 2010. These 
actions benefited the second half of 
2009 and we expect further benefit in 
2010. Favourable currency movements 
improved the profit on translation and 
also on transaction, where the Group 
gained from the weakness of sterling 
against most other currencies. At 
constant exchange rates, the operating 
profit was down 12%. The adjusted 
operating profit margin increased from 
17.1% to 17.3%, despite the impact of 
lower sales volumes and some internal 
destocking by our sales companies  
that reduced the demand on our 
manufacturing plants.
Interest
Net finance expense of £2.5 million 
compares with net finance income 
of £1.7 million in the prior year. As 
expected and previously reported,  
the net finance income in respect  
of defined benefit pension schemes 
deteriorated, mainly due to a reduction 
in the expected return on pension fund 
assets in 2009 (under IAS 19) following 
the drop in pension asset values in 
2008. Net bank interest deteriorated 
due to the fall in interest rates on cash 
deposits and the funding cost  
of acquisitions.
Associates
We have minority shareholdings in our 
operations in India and Mexico, which 
means that our share of the after tax 
profits is reported as Associates outside 
the operating profit. Associates’ profit 
was overall unchanged at £2.8 million, 
comprising an increased contribution  
in India offset by slightly lower profit  
in Mexico.
Profit before tax
The adjusted pre-tax profit increased to 
£90.2 million (2008: £90.1 million). The 
actions to reduce our global workforce 
necessitated a one-off charge against 
the 2009 profit of £11.4 million, which 
includes the cost of the recently 
announced reduction in France. About 
£3.5 million of this charge will be a cash 
outflow in 2010. The pre-tax profit after 
charging these costs and including 
the amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangible assets was £76.4 million 
(2008: £85.2 million). Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 19
T axation
The tax charge, excluding Associates, 
was 31.4% compared with 30.0% 
in 2008. The increase reflects an 
unfavourable change in the mix 
of taxable profits, exchange rate 
movements and the introduction of 
withholding tax in relation to dividends 
from China. The tax rate in 2010 is 
expected to be broadly in line with 2009. 
Earnings and dividends per share
The Group’s prime financial objective 
is to provide enhanced value to 
shareholders through consistent growth 
in earnings per share and dividends 
per share. Adjusted earnings per share 
were 82.2p (2008: 83.4p). Earnings per 
share including exceptional headcount 
reduction costs and the amortisation 
of acquisition-related intangible assets 
were 69.6p (2008: 78.0p).
The proposed final dividend is increased 
by 10% to 25.6p per share which, 
together with the interim dividend of 
10.5p per share paid in November 
2009, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 36.1p per share. This represents 
an increase of 8% over the 33.3p 
per share last year and continues the 
Group’s very long history of increasing 
dividends. The compound annual 
growth in dividends over the last  
42 years has been 11%.
Acquisitions
As previously reported, in October 2009 
the Group completed the acquisition of 
the Maso and Sine business from Maso 
Process-Pumpen GmbH (‘MasoSine’) 
based in Germany for £21.9 million. 
MasoSine extends the application 
range of our existing Watson-Marlow 
hygienic pumps and the integration into 
Watson-Marlow Pumps is progressing 
well. In October we also completed the 
acquisition of our Turkish distributor, 
Inter Valf based in Istanbul, for an initial 
consideration of £2.8 million. We are 
pleased with the performance of these 
businesses since acquisition and with 
their small positive contributions to 
our earnings per share for the year. 
Intangible assets amounting to  
£14.8 million were recognised in 
respect of acquisitions during the year, 
largely relating to MasoSine, which 
will be amortised over the respective 
useful lives of the individual assets. 
Goodwill amounting to £9.8 million was 
also recognised. Amortisation of total 
acquisition-related intangible assets 
was £2.4 million (2008: £1.9 million)  
of which £0.4 million (2008: £0.3 million) 
related to Associates. In the prior  
year there was also an impairment  
of goodwill and intangible assets  
of £3.1 million.
Research and development
Despite the economic downturn,  
we have continued to invest in the 
business and increased R&D spending 
by over 20% to £8.0 million for the year, 
including capitalised development costs 
under IFRS increasing to £2.1 million 
(2008: £1.5 million). We plan again to 
increase our investment in 2010 to 
take advantage of the development 
opportunities available and to 
accelerate the flow of new products  
to the market.
Capital employed
Capital employed at £267.8 million 
increased by only 2% during the year 
(at constant currency and excluding 
acquisitions), despite the substantial 
investments in capital expenditure. 
Currency movements, using  
year-end exchange rates, lowered 
capital employed on translation by  
£12.0 million. Working capital was 
brought down by £11.4 million at 
constant currency and excluding 
acquisitions, largely due to the 
reduction we achieved in stock levels, 
which were down by 13%. Acquisitions  
during the year added £1.7 million to 
capital employed.
Investment in fixed assets continued 
at a historically high level and net 
capital expenditure at £32.6 million 
was two times depreciation. Significant 
investment projects included the 
completion of our new premises in 
Korea and the new tubing extrusion 
plant at Watson-Marlow in Falmouth. 
The investment in new premises  
and manufacturing plant in China  
is progressing well, as is the project 
to consolidate onto one expanded 
manufacturing site in Cheltenham.

Finance review continued
Return on capital employed
The return on capital employed (ROCE), 
which is a key performance indicator, 
declined from 35.5% to 33.3%. 
Average capital employed (using the 
average of the opening and closing 
sterling balance sheets for the year) 
increased by 12% whereas adjusted 
operating profit was ahead 5%. Capital 
investment is planned to continue 
at a high level in 2010 and these 
investments will deliver good benefits 
in future years including scope for 
progressive reductions in stock levels.
Post-retirement benefits
The net post-retirement benefits  
liability shown on the balance sheet 
was broadly unchanged for the year  
at £73.8 million (£53.2 million net of 
deferred tax) but was lower than the 
£90.7 million net liability at the half-year. 
Pension fund asset value increased 
strongly reflecting the recovery in  
equity markets and also the payment  
of special deficit reduction payments  
of £7 million. However, liability values 
rose by a similar amount due to an 
increase in inflation expectations  
and a fall in corporate bond yields  
that pushed up the discounted  
present value of liabilities.
Most of the asset and liability values 
relate to the main UK defined benefit 
pension schemes. The triennial 
valuations of these schemes were 
carried out as at 31st December 2007 
and resulted in agreed additional cash 
contributions of £3.7 million per annum 
for up to six years that commenced in
the second half of 2008. The interim 
actuarial valuation as at 31st December 
2008 resulted in further additional cash 
contributions of £4.2 million per annum 
for up to 12 years that commenced in 
the second half of 2009. The interim 
actuarial valuation as at 31st December 
2009 is not yet complete but is 
expected to show a reduction in the 
deficit of the main UK schemes.
Cash flow
There was an excellent cash flow 
performance for the year. Adjusted 
operating cash flow increased to 
£117.9 million (2008: £91.1 million) 
reflecting an inflow from working  
capital with stocks reduced by 13% in 
the year. T axation payments were higher 
at £29.9 million (2008 £22.1 million) 
reflecting currency movements and  
the settlement of higher 2008 tax 
liabilities following the profit increase 
that year. Capital expenditure, including 
capitalised development costs, 
increased to £34.7 million (2008:  
£26.5 million). Free cash flow was 
broadly unchanged at £37.7 million 
even after the cash outflow of nearly  
£8 million in respect of headcount 
reduction costs and £7 million of 
special pension contributions.
Dividend payments were up 7% in line 
with the increased dividends per share. 
Acquisitions absorbed £27.2 million of 
cash due largely to the purchase of 
MasoSine in August for £21.9 million. 
We also acquired our Turkish distributor, 
Inter Valf, in October for an initial 
consideration of £2.8 million.
Overall there was a net cash outflow  
of £11.8 million. Excluding acquisitions, 
shares issued, headcount reduction 
costs and special pension contributions, 
there was a strong underlying cash 
inflow of £28.4 million (2008:  
£19.0 million). Exchange gains on 
translation were £2.5 million, which 
means we finished the year with a net 
cash balance of £8.0 million (2008: net  
cash £17.4 million).
Capital structure
We continue to operate with a very 
strong balance sheet. In addition to the 
net cash balance, the Group had various 
undrawn, committed borrowing facilities 
at year-end of £28.6 million. Treasury 
and currency exchange exposures are 
handled by the Group Treasury function 
in the UK which manages the exposures 
from our worldwide geographic spread. 
This is not a profit centre and no 
speculative transactions are undertaken; 
typically, simple forward contracts are 
used when appropriate to match known 
cash flows. The Group has operations 
around the globe and therefore its 
balance sheet can be significantly 
affected by movements in exchange 
rates, particularly in relation to the 
euro, US dollar , Chinese renminbi and 
Korean won. Where appropriate, the 
Group uses local currency borrowings 
to mitigate this structural currency 
exposure, consistent with maintaining 
a low cost of debt. The Group keeps 
the structure of its balance sheet under 
regular review.

Risks and uncertainties
The Group has well established risk 
management processes, including 
insurance cover , which are an integral 
part of the operation of our business 
and which are outlined in the Corporate 
Governance report on pages 35 to 38. 
Whilst risk can never be eliminated,  
our processes allow us to identify and 
appropriately manage and mitigate risks 
and uncertainties. These mainly arise 
from the inherent risks of operating a 
worldwide business largely using our 
own local sales companies to sell in 
local currency, direct to end-user 
customers, distributors, OEMs and 
contractors, a very wide range of 
products, mostly designed and 
manufactured in our own facilities  
in a number of different countries. The 
business is well spread geographically, 
across tens of thousands of customers 
and across most industrial and 
commercial sectors. This means that  
we do not rely excessively on any one 
customer, product application or 
industrial sector .
The principal risks and uncertainties  
are strategic, commercial, operational 
and financial. Ultimately these  
affect our ability to deliver our prime 
financial objective, which is to provide 
enhanced value to shareholders through  
consistent growth in earnings per  
share and dividends per share as a 
result of maintaining our world leading 
position and investing in our businesses 
for growth.
Strategic risks and uncertainties include 
customer relationships, the competitive 
environment, political and economic 
upheaval, technological changes, the 
regulatory and legal environment, and 
investment in acquisitions. These relate 
to maintaining our market and 
technological leadership including 
branding and reputation.
Commercial risks and uncertainties 
include issues such as product design 
and performance, product liability, 
competitor activity, relations with 
customers and suppliers, pricing and 
profit margins. Our employees are key 
to managing and mitigating risks and 
uncertainties and we therefore invest 
significant resources in the training  
and development of our people.
Operational risks and uncertainties 
include health and safety and 
environmental issues; employee 
relations; mitigation of, and recovery 
from, major disasters; product quality 
and customer service. We have for 
many years complied with recognised 
quality, health and safety and 
environmental standards and regulations 
and have applied project management 
disciplines in our business. The Group’s 
approach to the health and safety of 
employees is more fully described on 
page 28. Appropriate measures are 
implemented locally, particularly in the 
manufacturing companies, and there 
were further improvements in health and 
safety in our operations in the year. The 
environmental benefits from the use of 
Group products are more fully described 
on pages 23 and 24. General managers 
of operating companies are responsible 
for local compliance with the Group’s 
policy and with local legislation, and are 
required to report regularly.
The Group is committed to observing 
the highest standards of ethics in all 
its dealings with customers, suppliers, 
employees and all other stakeholders 
in the business. The Group Business 
Code sets out very clearly the standards 
expected of all employees and it is the 
responsibility of all managers within 
the Group’s businesses both to abide 
by those standards and to ensure 
that employees for whom they are 
responsible adhere to the standards. 
The Chief Executive writes annually to all 
general managers of Group businesses 
to remind them of the importance which 
the Group attaches to the Code and of 
their obligations to ensure compliance 
with the Code. Additionally, general 
managers are regularly required to 
certify compliance with the Code.
Financial risks and uncertainties include 
exchange rate exposures, interest rate 
movements, financial instruments, 
financial irregularities and protection of 
assets including pension fund assets. 
The Group has a comprehensive 
T reasury Policy covering many of these 
issues and defining our approach to 
minimise and mitigate such risks.
“ Our employees are key to managing and 
mitigating risks and uncertainties and we 
therefore invest significant resources in the 
training and development of our people.” 22 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009

“ The Group has developed further its 
awareness of CSR issues and has 
continued to make improvements, 
particularly in the areas of health,  
safety and environmental matters.” 
Southern Cross Hospital 
Group improves steam  
quality by 7% with the help  
of Spirax Sarco.
The customer
Southern Cross Hospital Group is 
New Zealand’s largest private  
hospital network.
The challenge
T o improve steam quality and upgrade 
steriliser steam reticulation systems to 
ensure full compliance with Australasian 
steam dryness standards. 
Our solution 
Spirax Sarco upgraded the Central 
Sterile Services Department (CSSD) 
system by designing and installing a 
new steam reticulation system including 
steam generation plant. This feeds 
steam to the steriliser at a guaranteed 
dryness value of 97% or better. 
Results
Final steam quality tests confirmed full 
compliance with Australasian standards, 
with a dryness value of 98%. Steriliser 
validation was completed without 
problem and the refurbished CSSD  
can now operate under full load without 
affecting steam quality. The elimination 
of system failures and downtime has 
boosted steriliser productivity and 
improved staff morale.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 23
The objective of the Group’s Spirax 
Sarco business is to provide steam 
users with energy efficient, safe, 
environmentally friendly and  
cost-effective solutions for the use of 
steam and other related industrial fluids. 
Steam itself is an environmentally 
friendly medium, being non-toxic and 
non flammable. Although system leaks 
are avoidable, when they do occur, 
they pollute the environment less than, 
for example, oil, gas and refrigerants. 
Steam is still the prime medium used 
for power generation and for product 
processing across a significant range  
of industries.
The Group’s technical advice and 
expertise on the application of its 
products, services and engineered 
solutions in relation to steam systems 
and services is the key to maximising 
the benefit of the products we supply.
These benefits include improved 
overall boiler efficiency, improved 
energy efficiency of plant processes, 
reduced consumption of water and 
water treatment chemicals and lower 
production of effluent and emissions,  
all of which have a significant and 
positive impact on the environment.
The Group has always believed that 
this significant and positive impact 
outweighs the environmental issues 
associated with the production of  
the products and, in 2009, more 
work was done to measure the 
environmental benefits achieved by  
our customers in using our products. 
The focus was on the energy saving 
aspect of those products which, if not 
installed, would result in a significant 
increase in energy consumption and 
hence CO
2
 production.
The results indicated a potential saving 
of 2,540,000 tonnes of CO
2
, far in 
excess of the quantity produced in 
manufacture. The methodology used 
to determine this external impact has 
been independently assessed with the 
assistance of the AEA Group, a world 
leading energy and climate change 
consultancy. The methodology remains 
unchanged but is reviewed annually 
by the Group, taking revised emission 
factors into account. The calculation is 
based on a selected range of energy 
saving products. The overall impact, 
taking into account all products and 
services supplied, will be higher.
An example of a newer product that has 
a major impact on energy consumption 
/ CO
2
 production is Flash Recovery 
Energy Management Equipment 
(FREME). This is a packaged  
solution to recover valuable heat from 
flash steam and use it to pre-heat boiler 
water. In 2009, FREME was awarded 
the Institute of Chemical Engineering’s 
‘Innovation and Excellence Award in 
Energy’ prize as “the best project or 
process to demonstrate innovation in 
renewable energy, alternative energy 
sources, efficient energy use or the 
development of energy production 
methods that reduce energy and  
water intensity”.
The Group’s Product Research and 
Development programme has been 
assisted through collaboration with the 
UK’s Carbon Trust, which aims to bring 
new and innovative energy saving 
solutions to customers globally, 
enabling their CO
2
 emissions to be  24 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009

further reduced. Design engineers are 
constantly challenged to enhance the 
environmental performance of future 
products both in manufacture and 
lifetime use.
Many applications for Watson-Marlow 
pumps are those where environmental 
improvement is the main aim. These 
pumps are particularly well suited 
to applications such as wastewater 
treatment, where difficult fluids must  
be handled safely and reliably.
The Board has continued to embrace 
and apply the general Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) principles 
in conducting its business in a socially 
acceptable and sustainable way 
having due regard to the relationship 
of the Company to its employees, 
customers, investors, suppliers and 
society generally. In particular the 
Board focuses on social, ethical and 
environmental (SEE) matters and  
health and safety issues. 
This report follows the practice 
in recent years of illustrating the 
Board’s commitment to meeting 
the requirements laid down by the 
Association of British Insurers and the 
reporting procedures and actions taken 
within the Group in this connection. 
The Group has developed further its 
awareness of CSR issues and has 
continued to make improvements, 
particularly in the areas of health and 
safety and environmental matters. 
The Board achieves compliance 
with the principles of CSR by the 
management of the risks concerned 
within the normal operations of the 
Group such that the necessary policies, 
systems and procedures are embedded 
in Group practice. The importance 
of involvement of employees and 
suppliers in meeting the standards 
required by the Board is inherent in 
the day-to-day business operations. 
Meeting the standards required in the 
operation of our business as it affects 
communities and customers is also 
a specific objective reflected in our 
strategic plans and annual planning. 
The Group’s operations are carried 
out under the Group’s long standing 
Business Code with which general 
managers are required to certify 
compliance. A copy of this is  
posted on the Group website:  
www.SpiraxSarcoEngineering.com.  
This Code formalises policies followed 
over many years by the Group, the 
main areas being: 
•  Compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations.
•  Operation of the internal controls 
established by the Group.
•  Having proper regard for all 
stakeholders in the business. 
•  Prohibition of bribery or corrupt 
practices. 
•  Commitment to fair treatment of all 
employees.
•  Recognition and improvement of 
all health, safety and environmental 
matters. 
The standards required in the practical 
management of the Group are set 
out in a separate Management Code 
issued by the Chief Executive with 
which general managers and the 
finance managers in each Group 
company provide written confirmation 
of compliance for each year. 
The Group also recognises that the 
achievement of good quality products 
and services, the maintenance of  
health and safety, and the achievement 
of good environmental practices are an 
integral part of running the business 
and require consideration as part of the 
day-to-day operations of the Group and 
are reflected in the Group’s performance. 
The responsibility held by Board 
members for the entirety of the  
Group’s operations, including the 
implementation of its policies, enables 
the Group’s Business Code and Group 
policies to be applied on a consistent 
basis. The Group’s decentralised 
structure provides for detailed local 
management of SEE matters by the 
general manager in each Group 
company, who reports to, and is 
monitored by, the appropriate executive 
director and regional general manager. 
These reporting procedures within the  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 25

who have direct responsibility for 
implementing policy, to monitor,  
report and take any appropriate  
action. SEE training is provided for 
newly appointed directors appropriate 
to their experience, knowledge and 
previous training. 
As part of the risk management process 
explained on pages 37 and 38, the risks 
involved in not achieving appropriate 
SEE standards are assessed and any 
significant risk is monitored by the 
Board following half yearly reports  
from all Group companies.
The Group considers and applies 
appropriate policies through the 
Group’s Business Code in the  
following areas: 
(i) Employment policies 
The Group supports and applies 
the principles of human rights 
in its operations including equal 
opportunities for employees regardless 
of sex, race, religion, age or disability. 
Board members and Human Resources 
satisfy themselves that the terms of 
employment in Group companies 
worldwide are appropriate. The Group 
has a policy of non-discrimination 
and does not tolerate bullying and /
or harassment in any form. The 
recruitment procedures throughout 
the Group avoid employment of 
underage staff. Care has been taken 
to provide for a culture of openness 
and honesty. The Group operates 
personnel policies designed to meet 
the needs of its Group companies and 
employees around the world. Channels 
of communication appropriate to the 
local operation have been established 
to allow employees to be properly 
informed and voice their views and 
concerns. Recognition is given to 
individual employees’ needs and 
requirements throughout the Group 
and, where possible, flexible working 
arrangements are considered where  
the circumstances are justified. 
Employees are encouraged to apply 
their skills, knowledge and energy.  
The Group recognises the importance 
of its employees and their training as a 
competitive advantage. 
The Group is committed to equality 
of opportunity for all regardless of

to recruitment and to the promotion, 
development and training of people 
who are already part of the Group.  
The Group takes seriously its 
obligations to the disabled and  
gives full and fair consideration 
to applications for new positions 
or employment from current or 
prospective employees regardless of 
any disability and having due regard  
to the individual’s particular aptitudes 
and abilities. 
The Group is willing to make 
reasonable adjustments to premises 
or employment arrangements if these 
substantially disadvantage a disabled 
employee or prospective employee. 
Every effort is made to find a suitable 
alternative job and, as necessary, 
training for those who are unable  
to continue in their existing role due  
to disability. 
The Group’s newsletter is distributed 
by electronic mail to all Group 
companies monthly and is made 
available to employees. Individual 
Group companies have either a local 
newsletter, intranet site or a regular 
communication informing employees 
on the progress of their company.  
The Group encourages the growth  
of employee share ownership. 
(ii) Community involvement 
The Group has a Charitable Trust  
which makes donations both to 
registered charities and in response 
to appropriate requests for support 
from bodies which are not registered 
charities both in the UK and overseas. 
In the case of overseas donations the 
decision to donate is made by the 
local general manager. In total in the 
UK the Group donated approximately 
£86,250 in 2009 to registered charities 
and other good causes, including the 
National Star College, the County Air 
Ambulance, the Alzheimer’s Society, 
Winston’s Wish, the Parkinson’s 
Disease Society and Sue Ryder Care.

Spirax Sarco provides 
QuickHeat heat exchange 
system to biopharm  
company Gilead.
The customer 
Gilead Alberta based in Canada is  
a world leader in the provision of 
therapies for life-threatening diseases 
such as HIV/AIDS and serious 
cardiovascular conditions.
The challenge
The customer required a compact  
heat transfer solution for a glycol  
heating system servicing a critical air 
handling installation. It was essential 
to have easy access for future 
maintenance purposes. 
Our solution 
In detailed discussions with the 
customer we identified fundamental 
design parameters that changed the 
initial specification. Making use of our 
cutting-edge 3-D design technology we 
configured a packaged, skid-mounted 
QuickHeat system to meet the precise 
system requirements, pre-assembled  
for easy installation and efficient use  
of space. 
Results
The customer required a competitive 
and reliable solution for this critical 
process and these needs were fully 
met. Spirax Sarco’s total steam system 
capability enabled it to engineer a 
unique design that fully accommodated 
the complex and challenging  
operating conditions.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 27
donations, employee organised 
charitable activities, donation of 
equipment no longer required and

Black Economic Empowerment, 
Spirax-Sarco South Africa (Pty) Ltd 
pays the school fees of children 
whose parents are employees of  
the company and who qualify for  
such assistance. In addition the  
South African company has 
sponsored the expansion of a small 
contractor’s business who is used as 
a sub-contractor when the company 
requires installation work to be  
carried out.
•  Spirax-Sarco (Private) Ltd, Singapore, 
donated the sum of US $5,000 to

•  Spirax-Sarco (Korea) Ltd contributes 
to local social welfare institutions, 
including those helping the aged,  
and supports a small group within  
the company whose purpose is 
to help a local community by, for 
example, delivering briquettes for 
heating to poor neighbourhoods.
•  In India the local company continues 
to support a hospital it established 
many years ago making provision for 
both company employees and the 
local community. Both benefit from 
an established welfare programme 
based in company provided premises 
supporting community initiatives, 
particularly for women and pre-school 
provision for children.

of goods and services which maintain 
appropriate quality standards in their 
operations. Suppliers must consistently 
achieve the standards required by  
ISO 9001. 
(iv) Product stewardship 
Information and support is given 
through appropriate technical advice to 
provide a solution to customers’ needs 
with installation and after-sales service 
being integral to the Group’s business.

Corporate social  
responsibility continued
(v) Corruption 
The Company’s policy prohibits  
bribery or corrupt or anti-competitive 
practices. In addition to provisions 
within service contracts, general 
managers, who head Group 
companies, are required to certify 
personally that all laws and regulations 
have been met in their territory. 
(vi) Health and safety 
The Company has a clear attitude 
to health and safety, which is that 
each operation will maintain a healthy 
and safe environment. The Group is 
committed to managing its activities 
around the world so as to safeguard 
the health and safety of its employees, 
customers and local community. 
In the first instance the general 
manager of each company has the 
responsibility for ensuring that this is 
effectively managed at the local level. 
Each major manufacturing site has 
its own Health and Safety Committee 
advised by a safety officer. 
General managers report the health 
and safety record of each Group 
company in a standard form to the 
responsible executive director in an 
exercise co-ordinated and monitored 
by Mr. M. E. Gibbin who is responsible 
for overseeing all health and safety 
matters. In addition to the site Health 
and Safety Committees referred to 
above, a separate UK Health and 
Safety Audit Committee composed 
of UK based directors and senior 
managers meets every six months to 
verify the performance of the UK Spirax 
Sarco business on health and safety 
and environmental issues. 
The Group ensures that the necessary 
resources are available for health 
and safety training and companies 
within the Group seek, as necessary, 
professional advice regarding the 
implementation of safety programmes. 
For example, in the UK Spirax Sarco 
has an established training programme 
which is provided to new shop floor 
employees and refresher courses are 
provided to all existing shop  
floor employees. 
Regular reviews are conducted to 
ensure that employees have up-to-date 
knowledge of health and safety matters 
relevant to them. 
In the UK Spirax Sarco has carried out 
various reviews and in particular has 
extended the measures for the welfare 
of employees by providing: 
•  Automatic external defibrillators for 
use in heart attack situations – all first 
aiders have been trained in their use. 
•  Training for all managers in the 
recognition and prevention of work 
related stress. 
•  Y early risk review of all processes and 
support functions.
•  The appointment of an occupational 
health service including the regular 
attendance of an on-site health 
adviser to support managers and 
employees on health related matters. 
(vii) Environmental 
Commensurate with its commitment 
to CSR and in line with its strategic 
competence in energy management, 
the Group is proactive worldwide in 
environmental energy best practice.  
An Energy Manager has been 
appointed to ensure Group operational 
energy efficiency.
The Group is externally and internally 
benchmarking its energy performance. 
Since 2007, the Group has had a policy 
of reporting its carbon footprint to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project and has 
been awarded a Carbon Disclosure 
Leadership Index of 54. This score 
represents a slightly above average 
performance for the disclosure and 
management of energy. The carbon 
disclosure reporting by industrial 
companies is a relatively new metric 
and in 2009, only 67% of companies in 
the industrial sector (Global 500, S&P 
500 and FTSE 350) published this data.
The Group’s annual review of the 
greenhouse gas emissions are shown 
on page 26.
Examples of actions to support national 
initiatives include: 
•  Actively participating in the UK’s first 
Low Carbon Partnership Scheme  
run by the Cheltenham Borough 
Council. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 29
“ The Company has a clear 
attitude to health and safety, 
which is that each operation 
will maintain a healthy and 
safe environment.” 
•  In the USA, participation by Spirax 
Sarco Inc. in the US Department 
of Energy’s Save Energy New 
Leadership pledge, committing to 
reducing energy intensity by 25% 
over ten years.
As a manufacturing company, 
production resources generate 65% of 
the business’s carbon footprint and are 
a target for greater efficiency. Examples 
of actions taken in 2009 include:
•  The consolidation of three UK 
manufacturing sites to reduce 
unnecessary transportation of  
people and products. Features of  
the refurbished building include:
 –  New roofs and wall cladding 
surpassing building regulations by 
25% – excellent thermal properties 
and skylights reduce the need for 
space heating, forced ventilation  
and artificial light, whilst providing  
an improved working environment  
for employees.
 –  Additional electricity sub metering, 
which will ensure the measurement 
and management of energy usage 
and the use of Spirax products  
will efficiently control steam usage 
and waste heat recycling in  
our processes.
 –  A rainwater harvesting system, 
which will save over 1 million litres  
of water per annum.
•  Watson-Marlow’s new tubing 
extrusion plant in Falmouth, 
completed in 2009, is the first 
BREEAM (Building Research 
Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Method) Excellent 
industrial building in Cornwall having 
been designed for sustainability and 
to have the lowest possible energy 
costs throughout its life.
•  Our focus on resource efficiency and 
waste reduction continues. Waste to 
landfill is being reduced through the 
adoption of a single waste contractor 
for Cheltenham operations.
•  The Group’s progressive adoption 
of ISO 14001 continues with the 
Spirax Sarco UK management team 
preparing for approval in 2010.
•  All future investments now include  
an environmental consideration  
as standard.
General managers of operating 
companies remain responsible for 
local compliance with the Group’s 
policy and with local legislation. In 
Germany, MasoSine has reduced its 
environmental impact over the past 
year by reducing water consumption  
by 17%, electricity by 20% and waste 
by 22%.
Watson-Marlow Ltd in the UK and 
Spirax-Sarco SAS in Châtellerault, 
France are certified to the Environmental 
standard ISO 14001. It is the intention 
for the whole Group to be accredited to 
ISO 14001. In the USA, Watson-Marlow 
Inc. complies with US OSHA regulations 
and strives to be environmentally 
conscious through a paper recycling 
programme and implementing energy 
efficient and green technologies. 30 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009

Compliance
Corporate governance has been and remains the responsibility of the whole Board. This statement describes how the Company applies the principles 
and complies with the provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in June 2008 (the Combined Code), which applied to 
the Company in respect of the financial year ended 31st December 2009 and is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk. The Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority require UK listed companies to report on the manner in which they apply the Combined Code. The Board considers that, subject 
to the ratio of executive and non-executive directors and the composition of the audit and remuneration committees from the beginning of the year 
until 9th February 2009 and from 1st July to 16th July (each of which is explained below), the Company met the requirements of the Combined Code 
throughout the year ended 31st December 2009. The Board assesses on an on-going basis its practices to ensure continued compliance with the 
Combined Code and has allocated responsibility for compliance to appropriate directors or officers. Contact has been made with major shareholders 
to allow discussion of the Company’s governance policy and strategy with the Chairman and three major shareholders availed themselves of the 
opportunity to meet the Chairman. 
Disclosures required under DTR 7.2.6 can be found on page 34.
Board composition and procedures
During the year the Board comprised the non-executive Chairman, three independent non-executive directors, including a Senior Independent Director, 
and five executive directors, details of whom are set out on pages 30 and 31. During the year the positions of Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior 
Independent Director were held by separate individuals. There is a clear written division of responsibility between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. 
The ratio of executive to non-executive directors is currently considered to be the best structure for the Company. The Board is responsible for the 
Group’s business operations and five executive directors are present on the Board in order to provide first-hand information and contributions to the 
running of the business. The executive directors control the Group’s devolved management structure which requires local management initiative across 
the Group’s global spread of operating companies, its broad product range and wide customer base. Board membership of the executives is key to 
the overall management of the Group which employs a relatively flat management structure. This also provides the non-executive directors with regular 
direct access to the full executive management team. The Company views this to be a very appropriate and successful mix; appointing additional 
non-executive directors would make the Board more cumbersome and would not add to the quality of the Board’s performance. The divisional 
structure will be retained with regional general managers providing support in each of the divisions.
The Board applies an appropriate policy in the recruitment of independent non-executive directors to meet the particular requirements of the Board. 
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment which meets the requirements of the Combined Code. The non-executive directors 
all have or have had senior executive experience and offer independent judgement on Board matters. The non-executive directors of the Company, 
including the Chairman, do not participate in any bonus, share option or share ownership schemes and their appointments are non-pensionable. 
The Board met six times in the year to consider strategic developments and to review trading results and operational and business issues. All directors 
attended all meetings either in person or by telephone in 2009, with the exception of Mr. C. G. Watson who was unavailable for two meetings. In

meet together without any executive directors present (both with and without the Chairman).
All other matters not reserved to the Board for decision are delegated appropriately.
Utilising a format created with the advice of Towers Perrin (now Towers Watson), the Board again carried out a rigorous evaluation of Board performance 
in accordance with the Combined Code requirements which confirmed the effective operation of the Board and reflected the importance of strategic 
matters. The evaluation process comprises a review conducted by the Company Secretary and reported to the Chairman of all directors’ views on the 
operation of the Board and the performance of the Chairman, the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s review of the Board performance of each director, the 
Chairman’s review of the non-executive directors and the review by Committee members and attendees of the operations of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees and the performance of the Chairman of each of those Committees. The evaluation confirmed a continued high rating for the 
Board’s operations and encompassed Board constitution, Board meetings, Board functionality, communication and knowledge management, Company 
secretariat performance, assessment of the Chairman’s performance and the effectiveness of the Board’s Committees. Improvements are made to the 
Board’s operation as a result of the evaluation. 
There are procedures for individual Board members to receive induction and training as appropriate and provision to solicit independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense where specific expertise is required in the course of exercising their duties. All directors have access to the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable legislative and regulatory requirements. 
The Company provides directors’ and officers’ insurance for Board members and the directors of Group companies, together with senior officers. 
All directors are subject to re-appointment by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment and thereafter at intervals of no more than 
three years.
Conflicts
From 1st October 2008, the directors became subject to a statutory duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation where they have, or 
could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company. Directors of public companies may 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate, if the articles of association contain a provision to this effect. The Company amended its 
articles of association in May 2008 to deal with, amongst other things, the provisions on conflicts of interest in the Companies Act 2006. The Company 
has established formal procedures for the disclosure and review of any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest which the directors may have and for 
the authorisation of such conflict matters by the Board. In deciding whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict the directors must have regard 
to their general duties under the Companies Act 2006. The authorisation of any conflict matter, and the terms of authorisation, may be reviewed at any 
time and will be reviewed formally by the Board on an annual basis. The Board believes that the procedures established to deal with conflicts of interest 
are operating effectively.
Senior independent director
Mr. G. Bullock succeeded Mr. W. H. Whiteley as the Senior Independent Director on 1st July 2009.
Committees
The Board delegates specific responsibility to Board Committees, notably the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees, in line with best 
practice. The terms of reference for these Committees are posted on the Group website: www.SpiraxSarcoEngineering.com. In the period from the 
beginning of the year until 30th June 2009 the Finance Committee comprised Mr. M. Townsend (Chairman), Mr. M. E. Vernon and Mr. D. J. Meredith.

Rules. In particular major shareholders have been approached with a view to discussing the Company’s governance and strategy with the Chairman 
and Mr. G. Bullock, the Senior Independent Director. As required by major shareholders, the Senior Independent Director is available to listen to 
their views on any areas of concern they may have. Following his appointment as Chairman, Mr. W. H. Whiteley offered major shareholders the 
opportunity of a meeting and, as a result, meetings were held with three major shareholders. Reports are made to the Board of all meetings with 
major shareholders and analysts including, in particular, briefings after half year and final results. 
The preliminary results announcement may be accessed by investors on the Group website: www.SpiraxSarcoEngineering.com. The Annual Report

All shareholders are invited to participate in the annual general meeting, where the chairmen of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees 
will be available to answer questions. The results of proxy votes are declared at annual general meetings after each resolution has been dealt with on 
a show of hands. Details of the proxy votes received will be published on the Group website: www.SpiraxSarcoEngineering.com following the annual 
general meeting.
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role of management is to implement 
Board policies on risk and control. There is an ongoing process for identifying and managing risks faced by the Group which has been in place for the 
year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The reviews cover, and assess the effectiveness of, all material 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. This ensures that proper accounting records have 
been maintained, that financial information used within the business is reliable and that the consolidated accounts preparation and financial reporting 
process comply with all relevant regulatory reporting requirements. The system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve the business objectives. 
The Board believes from its annual reviews that the system of internal controls is embedded in the business and regular review allows for assessment 
of new and changing risks in the Group’s business. 
In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied throughout the year and up to the date of this report with the Combined Code 
provisions on internal controls having established the procedures necessary to implement the guidance issued by the Turnbull Committee and by 
reporting in accordance with that guidance (which is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk). 
(i) Risk management
The Group has operated procedures for considering risks in the normal operations of the Group and with regard to significant transactions. Strategic 
and annual planning also encompass consideration of business risks. The Risk Management Committee specifically reviews any risks facing the 
business which could give rise to a material loss. 
The Risk Management Committee carried out a review with external consultants, Marsh Ltd, of the risk register and risk management process in the 
context of the current business structure and operations with the aim of validating the risk register and the general risk management process and  identifying any additional new risks which could involve a significant risk to the Group’s business. This exercise was completed early in 2008 and 
consisted of a review of the risk magnitude and risk likelihood. Significant potential new risks were assessed and countermeasures established. The 
Board, on Marsh Ltd’s advice, is satisfied that the system of management for significant risks is appropriate for the Group and is properly executed.  
The Board plans to conduct an updated externally facilitated risk review in 2010. 
As part of the risk management process, Group companies are required to report on a six monthly basis their position with regard to implementing 
identified countermeasures to address the Group’s significant business risks. The six monthly returns are assessed by the Risk Management Committee 
and the results of that assessment are reported by the Company Secretary to the Board. The Risk Management Committee carries out an annual 
review of the business risks. The Board monitors the system of reporting and its effectiveness as a whole and reviews the assessments made by the 
Risk Management Committee and any recommendations for improvements to the process. 
In the UK the operation of the Incident Management Team, which deals with the situation immediately after any major incident, was reviewed and the 
Team strengthened. Spirax Sarco Inc. in the USA has successfully completed its business continuity planning exercise.
(ii) Financial
The Finance Committee of the Board considers financing and investment decisions concerning the Group, including the giving of guarantees and 
indemnities, and monitors policy and control mechanisms for managing treasury risk within the limits laid down by the Board. 
Financial reporting systems include comprehensive annual plans approved by the Board and monthly reporting of actual results with appropriate 
comparisons against plan and previous year’s results. Forecast operating results for the year are regularly updated. Capital investment is subject to 
approval under a clear policy. This includes annual plans, appropriate authorisation, detailed investment appraisal, post-investment review and due 
diligence requirements where businesses are being acquired. Forward currency contracts are implemented centrally under the control of the Group 
Treasury Function.
(iii) Operational
All Group companies are required annually to complete self-certification questionnaires regarding compliance with the policies, procedures and minimum 
requirements for an effective system of internal controls. Self-certification is given by both the general manager and the finance manager of the operation. 
(iv) Audit committee
The Audit Committee considers the appropriateness and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, policies and procedures and the outcome of the 
external audit for the year. The Committee also reviewed the outcome of internal audit reports during the year. Its meetings are normally attended by 
the Finance Director, the external auditors and, at the invitation of the Committee, the Chairman. There is provision for the Committee to confer with the 
auditors without the attendance of executive directors. The Audit Committee reviews the independence of the external auditors on an annual basis. 
The Committee considers in detail reports prepared by the auditors in relation to the final accounts and accounting practices and developments. It also 
considers reports and explanations provided by the Finance Director. 
The Board has approved terms of reference for the Audit Committee meeting the requirements of the Combined Code. The Audit Committee’s 
responsibilities include:
●  monitoring the integrity of the accounts and in particular reviewing the Group’s internal controls, risk management framework and internal 
 audit reports; 
●  reviewing the scope and results of the auditors’ work, their independence and objectivity particularly relating to the provision of additional 
 services to the Company and audit fee; 
●  recommending the appointment, re-appointment or removal of external auditors; and 
●  reviewing the accounting policies and practices of the Company and, at the end of the annual audit cycle, assessing the effectiveness of the 
 audit process. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and noted compliance with the good practice list of matters established by the Audit Committee Institute in all material 
matters.
(v) Non-audit services
A policy on non-audit services provided by the auditors in line with professional practice has been established and approved by the Audit Committee. 
The external auditors have undertaken non-audit work (in regard to taxation and acquisition due diligence) and the fees paid by the Company for it are 
set out in Note 6 on page 59. The scope and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the Company’s auditors is carefully controlled in line with the 
written terms provided by the Company to the auditors with the objective of avoiding impact on their independence and objectivity. In particular, the 
auditors are prohibited from providing services in relation to valuations, recruitment, dispute resolution and accounting services. The Audit Committee 
monitors the scope of the auditors’ work, and specific approval from the Committee Chairman or the full Audit Committee is required for fees over 
established thresholds.
(vi) Whistle blowing
If any employee in the Group has reasonable grounds for believing that the Group Business Code or Management Code is being breached by any 
person or group of people and does not feel able to voice the matter with his or her manager, he or she is able to contact the Company Secretary in 
Cheltenham with full details. The Company Secretary will ensure that (a) the circumstances are properly investigated and (b) the employment of the 
person contacting the Company Secretary will be protected appropriately.
Internal audit
Following a review in 2006, the Board established an enhanced internal audit function which allows each of the Group companies to be audited at least 
every four years. All businesses acquired by the Group are subject to internal audit within one year from the date of acquisition. Internal audit resource 
is supplemented by experienced qualified accounting staff from principal Group companies and a professional auditing firm, BDO Stoy Hayward LLP . 
Reports are made to the Audit Committee and the Board as a whole. No significant matters were raised in the reports made in the 11 operating 
companies audited during the year.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, and the financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, are set out in the Business Review and Financial Review on pages 10 to 
21.  In addition Note 32 on pages 77 to 81 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with contracts with a diverse range of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas 
and industries. No one customer accounts for more than 1% of Group turnover. As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook. 
After making enquiries and after conducting a formal review of the Group’s financial resources at their March Board Meeting, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Directors’ responsibilities

The Board presents the following report on directors’ remuneration and the work and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration committee
This Committee has been established for many years and operates under terms of reference agreed by the Board and which can be found on the 
Group website: www.SpiraxSarcoEngineering.com. 
From 1st January until 9th February 2009, the Committee comprised Mr. W. H. Whiteley (Chairman) and Mr. G. Bullock; from 10th February until 
30th June, the Committee comprised Mr. W. H. Whiteley (Chairman), Mr. G. Bullock and Dr. K. Rajagopal.  From 1st July to 16th July, the Committee 
comprised Mr. G. Bullock (Chairman) and Dr. K. Rajagopal and from 17th July to 31st December 2009, the Committee comprised Mr. G. Bullock 
(Chairman), Dr. K. Rajagopal and Mr. C. G. Watson. Each Committee member is an independent non-executive director. They bring independence to all 
aspects of Board remuneration and in the application of professional advice to matters of remuneration. 
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf of the Board, the Company’s remuneration policy, the employment conditions and 
remuneration packages (comprising salary and benefits) of individual executive directors and the fees for the Chairman. The Committee also administers 
and determines the grant of options under the Group’s share option schemes for senior employees and administers and determines the grants of 
awards under the Performance Share Plan. 
The Committee obtains independent professional advice from Towers Perrin (now Towers Watson) to ensure that the Company’s remuneration policy 
is appropriate and competitive. Towers Perrin was appointed by the Committee and has not provided other services to the Company during the year.  
The Chairman (Mr. M. Townsend up to 30th June 2009 and Mr. W. H. Whiteley since that date) and Mr. M. E. Vernon, the Chief Executive, attend 
meetings at the invitation of the Committee to provide information requested by it. However, the invitees do not participate in any discussions involving 
their own remuneration. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee consulted with Towers Perrin in arriving at the remuneration packages paid to directors during 2009.  
The Company has throughout the year complied with the provisions of the Combined Code with regard to directors’ remuneration. The Committee has 
given full consideration to the Combined Code in establishing the remuneration policy and packages for directors.
Policy on executive directors’ remuneration
The Company’s policy is to reward directors competitively and on the broad principle that their remuneration should be comparable with remuneration 
in other similar public companies. Further, the total remuneration package is designed in a way which is appropriate and necessary to attract, retain 
and motivate directors of the calibre required to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives. It is anticipated that this policy will continue to govern the 
Company’s approach to executive directors’ remuneration in subsequent financial years. 
In order to align the interests of directors and shareholders, the Committee has structured the total remuneration package to provide a material 
performance-related element through the annual bonus and the Group’s Performance Share Plan. 
The structure of the directors’ remuneration package has been established, subject to appropriate modifications, for many years and has regard to pay 
and conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
The Company’s policy on directors’ remuneration and the structure of their remuneration package are kept under review to ensure the directors’ overall 
package remains competitive and shareholders will be informed of any resulting change. The remuneration package comprises:
Basic salary
The Committee obtained independent professional advice from Towers Perrin using published information for comparable public companies. Salaries 
are reviewed annually as at 1st January taking into account the experience, responsibility and performance of the individual.
Benefits
The Company operates company car, life assurance and private health insurance schemes in which the executive directors are eligible to participate. 
These benefits are reviewed annually to ensure they remain comparable with benefits provided by other similar public companies and to ensure they are 
purchased by the Company at a competitive market rate.
Annual bonus
The Company operates a non-pensionable annual bonus scheme for executive directors. The bonus is determined as a percentage of salary. For 2009, 
maximum available bonus remained at 100% of salary (as in prior years). 
The bonus was made up as follows:
(i)  a component of up to 65% of salary was determined on a sliding scale by reference to the operating profit of the Group including the Group’s  
 associate companies in India and Mexico; and
(ii)  a component of up to 35% of salary was determined on a sliding scale by reference to the return on capital employed (ROCE).
The application of the above formula resulted in a bonus equal to 37% of salary being payable to all executive directors in respect of the Group’s 2009 
performance. The auditors confirmed the calculation was made in line with the rules. 
For 2010, the Committee plans to base the bonus for Mr. M. E. Vernon and Mr. D. J. Meredith on the same two measures with the same relative weight 
as in 2009 and the maximum bonus payable will remain a sum equal to 100% of base salary. For Mr. N. H. Daws, Mr M. E. Gibbin and Mr. A. J. Scrivin, 
the maximum profit component of the bonus will be split so that 35% of salary will be paid based on Group operating profit and 30% of salary will be 
paid based on their respective divisional profit performances, for a total maximum bonus of 65% of salary based on the profit component.
The Committee has offered to executive directors in a UK defined benefit scheme a cash alternative to pension contributions equal to 25% of 
pensionable salary. The level of this cash alternative was confirmed by Watson Wyatt LLC (now Towers Watson). The cost of the alternative to the 
Company would be no greater than the cost of the pension contributions. The cash alternative has not so far been adopted by any of the executive 
directors in the scheme.
 
The directors’ remuneration report Options
Spirax-Sarco Engineering 1992 UK and global share option schemes
Spirax-Sarco Engineering approved and global share option schemes
The Company operates share option schemes administered by the Committee which determines the grant of options under the schemes, usually 
once per year. These are designed to align the longer term interests of participants with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added 
shareholder value. Following the introduction of the performance share plan in 2005, it is intended that, ordinarily, executive directors will be granted 
awards under that plan rather than be granted options. 
Executive directors, senior executives and management hold options granted in previous years and it is currently intended that options will continue 
to be granted to senior executives and management. Options granted to each director from 1997 are subject to a performance condition which is 
described below.
Performance condition for share option schemes
In accordance with market practice, options granted are normally specified to be exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant 
and, for grants from 1997, only if a specified performance condition is satisfied. In line with the then established market practice, the performance 
condition for options granted from 1997 up to 2001 requires an increase in earnings per share (EPS) of more than 6% greater than the increase in the 
UK retail prices index over a period of three consecutive years between grant and ten years from grant. For options granted from and including 2002 
the performance condition requires an increase in EPS of more than 9% greater than the increase in the UK retail prices index over a period of three 
consecutive years between grant and ten years from grant. For grants from and including 2005, the performance condition will, ordinarily, need to be 
met over the three-year period from the 1st January prior to the date of grant in order for the option to become exercisable. If the condition is not met 
at the end of the three-year period, the option will lapse. The same performance condition applies to each director. The performance condition chosen 
was considered appropriate because it ensured increases in the EPS were achieved having taken account of UK inflation. The auditors are asked 
to confirm whether the performance condition has been met. The method of assessment is considered appropriate to confirm compliance with the 
condition. The performance condition requires a comparison with a factor external to the Company, namely the growth in the UK retail prices index over 
the performance period. 
Details of total share options outstanding are set out in Note 24 on page 66. The above performance conditions apply to other relevant options granted 
to all other participants in the share option schemes.
Spirax-Sarco performance share plan (PSP)
The PSP for executive directors, senior executives and management was adopted at the 2005 annual general meeting. Following the introduction 
of this PSP no further option grants have been made to executive directors. Details of options that were awarded prior to this and which remain 
outstanding are provided on page 43. 
The PSP allows for awards to be made each year with a market value of up to 150% of base salary although in practice the market value of awards 
has been limited in previous years to 100% of base salary. The market value of awards made to executive directors in 2009 was  limited to 75% 
of base salary. Details are set out on pages 43 and 44. Awards take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of 
performance targets. To the extent they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares at the discretion of the Company. 
The performance target applied to awards granted in 2006, 2007 and 2008 was based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative 
to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Index over the three-year periods commencing with effect from 
1st January 2006, 1st January 2007 and 1st January 2008. For awards made in 2009, the Committee decided to amend the comparator group of 
companies against which the Company’s TSR would be measured to encompass a group of the 27 companies within the overall Industrial Goods and 
Services super sector of FTSE 350. TSR was chosen as the measure of performance as the Committee felt that this achieved an appropriate alignment 
of the interests of the directors with those of the Company’s shareholders. For full vesting, the Company’s TSR must be at or above the upper quartile, 
with 25% of the shares subject to an award vesting if the Company’s TSR is at the median relative to the comparator group. Awards vest on a straight 
line pro-rata basis between median and upper quartile performance. In respect of the awards made in 2007, the Company’s relative TSR performance 
resulted in 100% of the awards vesting.
Following a review of the operation of the PSP and the market competitiveness of awards, the Committee decided in 2008 to adopt a second 
performance measure to determine vesting under the PSP . Although relative TSR was retained as one of the measures to determine the vesting of part 
of the award, a second, separate element of the award was based upon EPS growth. The decision to adopt EPS as a specific measure to determine 
the vesting of part of the future awards was a reflection of the importance the Company gives to continuing growth in earnings.
Specifically, for awards made in 2009, the award was split into two separate parts amounting to 60% and 40% of award respectively. 
The vesting of each part of the overall award will be subject to the satisfaction of separate performance targets as follows:
(i) vesting of the first part, amounting to 45% of salary, will be based on the TSR measure as described above; and
(ii) vesting of the second part, amounting to 30% of salary, will be subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over the whole of the 
 three-year performance period, with growth measured relative to EPS in the year prior to that in which the award is made. For the awards made in 
 2009, 25% of this element of the award will vest if the compound annual growth in EPS over the three-year period 2009 to 2011 is equal to 5%; 
 and 100% of the award will vest if the compound annual growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 11%; there will be pro-rata vesting for actual growth 
 between these two rates. 
No award will vest if the Company’s TSR is below the median. TSR calculations are performed by Towers Perrin. The method of assessment is 
considered appropriate to confirm compliance with the condition.
The Committee reviews the measures annually and is maintaining the same measures and the same performance standards for awards made in 2010. 
The auditors are asked to confirm whether the EPS performance condition has been met.  The method of assessment is considered appropriate to 
confirm compliance with the condition.
 
40 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009
The directors’ remuneration report  
continued Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc employee share ownership plan (the plan)
The executive directors, with the exception of Mr. M. E. Vernon, participate in the plan, as described on page 44. Participation in the plan is open to all 
eligible UK employees. No employee’s entitlement under the plan is subject to performance conditions, as the aim of the plan is to encourage increased 
shareholding in the Company by all eligible UK employees. 
There are no other long-term incentives or share-based arrangements provided to directors.
Share ownership policy
It is the policy of the Board of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc that executive directors should have a significant shareholding in the Company. The Board 
expects that executive directors will accumulate, following appointment to the Board, a shareholding equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary and 
should retain a shareholding of at least this amount whilst remaining on the Board. 
T o achieve this level of share ownership the Board expects that executive directors will retain shares acquired under the Company’ s share-based incentive 
schemes (after sales of such shares as are needed to settle relevant tax and national insurance charges) until the required level of shareholding is achieved. Any 
shares held in trust for an executive director or in the name of a connected person, e.g. spouse, will be considered as part of an executive director’ s shareholding. 
The Board will exercise discretion in implementing this policy where the personal circumstances of an individual executive director make that appropriate. 
The policy does not require any shareholdings by non-executive directors.
Pensions
The UK executive directors, other than Mr. M. E. Vernon and Mr. M. E. Gibbin, are members of an HMRC-registered, non-contributory defined benefit 
pension scheme based on 1/60th of pensionable salary, for each year of pensionable service. Up to 31st March 2010, the maximum pension is two-
thirds of pensionable salary. Mr. N. H. Daws and Mr. D. J. Meredith accrue pro-rata additional service at a rate which gives a further two and a half years 
of service at age 62
1
⁄2 although their normal retirement age is 65. The same provision applied to Mr. A. D. H. Black who retired on 30th April 2009. This 
additional service provision does not apply to Mr. M. E. Vernon, Mr. M. E. Gibbin and Mr. A. J. Scrivin who have a normal retirement age of 65.
In April 2010 the terms of the defined benefit pension scheme will change in that the scheme will no longer be non-contributory. The change allows 
members to choose to:
(i) continue to build up future benefits as previously in return for sharing some of the cost by way of making member contributions.  Under this option 
 members retain the 1/60th rate of accrual and contribute 3% of their pensionable salary from 1st April 2010 to 31st March 2011 and then 6% of 
 their pensionable salary from 1st April 2011 onwards; or
(ii) build up future benefits at a lower rate of 1/80th accrual without having to make contributions. 
The UK scheme also provides lump sum death-in-service benefit of four times pensionable salary and spouses’ pensions are payable where death 
occurs in service or in retirement. 
Mr. M. E. Vernon, in addition to membership of the Spirax Sarco Inc. defined benefit scheme, has a defined contributions pension scheme as set out 
on page 45. In total, pension contributions at the rate of 25% of pensionable pay were payable from 12th June 2007. A lump sum death-in-service 
benefit of four times salary is also provided for Mr. M. E. Vernon. 
Mr. M. E. Gibbin has a defined contributions pension scheme as set out on page 45. From 1st January 2009 to 30th April 2009 contributions at the 
rate of 10% of pensionable pay were payable, increasing to 25% of pensionable pay with effect from 1st May 2009. A lump sum death-in-service 
benefit of four times salary is also provided for Mr. M. E. Gibbin.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of non-executive directors is approved by the full Board within the limits set out in the Company’s articles of association. Their 
remuneration reflects the amount of time spent on the Company’s business. The non-executive directors do not participate in the bonus, share option 
or share ownership schemes and do not participate in the Performance Share Plan. Non-executive directors’ appointments are non-pensionable.
Service contracts
The Committee applies a policy on directors’ contracts reflecting established practice and reviews the content from time-to-time on professional advice. 
The executive directors have rolling service contracts with no fixed expiry dates which are subject to 12 months’ notice.

(1) Mr. A. D. H. Black retired from the Board on 30th April 2009. No compensation for loss of office was made on his retirement.
The service contract of Mr. M. E. Vernon was amended on 4th March 2009.  Pursuant to the amendment, the Company agreed to pay on behalf of 
Mr. M. E. Vernon any UK or US tax liabilities which arise on his earnings under his service contract over and above the amount of UK tax liabilities 
which would have been payable had Mr. M. E. Vernon only been liable to pay UK tax on such earnings.  The Company also agreed to pay the 
reasonable costs incurred by Mr. M. E. Vernon of obtaining full tax advice in respect of his employment with the Company for the duration of his 
employment and, save in certain bad leaver circumstances, for a period of two years after termination of employment.
Termination payments reflect the circumstances leading to termination of employment and excessive compensation will not be paid. Professional advice 
will be obtained by the Committee to ensure legal obligations and good practice are followed. 
Executive directors’ contracts may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as 
gross misconduct. If, however, the Company were to terminate an executive director’s contract without cause and without due notice, it would pay a 
sum equal to the value of the salary and benefits to be received during the notice period, but taking into account the director’s duty to mitigate his loss. 
Any rights to pensions would be dealt with under the rules of the pension scheme applicable to the director and any rights under the Company’s share 
plans would be dealt with in accordance with the rules of each plan. 
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 41 The executive directors’ contracts contain no provisions regarding material non-statutory redundancy payments, rights to compensation on change of 
control of the Company or entitlement to early retirement benefits.
The non-executive directors, including the Chairman, Mr. W. H. Whiteley, do not have service contracts. They have appointment letters for three-year 
periods, and re-appointment is not automatic.  No compensation for loss of office is payable to non-executive directors under their appointment letters.

cumulative shareholder return for the five-year period ended 
31st December 2009 compared with the total cumulative

 to that award were met, namely that the TSR performance of the Company during the period 1st January 2006 to 31st December 2008 placed 
 the Company within the upper quartile of the TSR performance of the companies in the FT250 All-Share Industrial Engineering Index over the 
 performance period. The award vested on 4th March 2009 and the mid-market price of the shares on that date was 808.0p.
(2)  The mid-market price of the shares on 26th March 2007 was 1020.0p.  The period over which performance conditions are measured is 
 1st January 2007 to 31st December 2009.

 as the performance conditions applicable at that date were met.  The 2007 award was reduced by applying a factor of 28/36 due to the shortened 
 performance period of 28 months from 1st January 2007 to 30th April 2009.  The 2008 award was reduced by applying a factor of 16/36 due to 
 the shortened performance period of 16 months from 1st January 2008 to 30th April 2009. The awards vested on 8th May 2009 and the 
 mid-market price of the shares on that date was 862.0p.  Mr. A. D. H. Black requested that the awards be satisfied in shares. Mr. A. D. H. Black

(iii) Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc employee share ownership plan (the plan)
The Company operates the plan in which all the executive directors, with the exception of Mr. M. E. Vernon, are eligible to participate on the same 
basis as all other eligible UK employees. For the plan period the individual director’s contributions are limited to a maximum of £1,500 per annum 
under HMRC rules. The trustee of the plan provides a matching share for each share purchased under the plan on behalf of the director which is the 
same basis as for other participating employees. Dividends paid on the partnership and matching shares, up to a maximum of £1,500 per tax year, are 
reinvested and held by the trustee as dividend shares. Matching shares and dividend shares may generally only be released three years after they were 
purchased by the trustee.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 45 Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report 
and Accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.  In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
● Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
● Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
● State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
● Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will 
 continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website: 
www.SpiraxSarcoEngineering.com. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 
(1) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
 financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
(2) the Business Review and Financial Review, which are incorporated into the Directors’ Report, include a fair review of the development and 
 performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
 a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Cash ﬂow statements
for the year ended 31st December 2009  1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The parent company and consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been adopted by the European 
Union (EU).
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are 
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The most significant effect on the financial 
statements from accounting policies requiring judgement are in the areas of research and development, and revenue.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if 
the revision affects both current and future periods. The key areas where estimates have been used and assumptions applied are in 
provisions, impairment testing of goodwill and in assessing the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a diverse range of products and customers across wide geographic 
areas and industries. As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully 
despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
Further information on the Group's business activities, performance and position, together with the financial position of the Group, its 
capital structure and cash flow are included in the Business Review and Finance Review on pages 10 to 21. In addition, note 32 to the 
financial statements discloses details of the Group's financial risk management and credit facilities. 
Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements and IFRS 8, Operating segments were adopted in the period. IAS 1 has 
resulted in format changes to the primary statements and IFRS 8 has resulted in a change in segmental analysis, which is further 
described in note 2.
The following adopted IFRS were available for early application but have not been applied by the Group in these accounts:
● Amendment to IFRS 3, Business Combinations and IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
 The revised standards introduce changes to acquisition accounting, notably in respect of treatment of acquisition costs, step 
 and partial acquisitions, minority interests and contingent consideration.
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company's functional currency, rounded to the 
nearest thousand.  
Basis of accounting
(i) Subsidiaries
The Group accounts include the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.  Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the 
Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.  In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are 
taken into account. The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that control commences 
until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities for which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
The accounts include the Group's share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from 
the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the accounts. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's 
interest in the entity.
(iv) Company
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
Notes to the accounts

54 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Foreign currency
(i) On consolidation
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The 
revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to a seperate translation reserve 
within equity. They are recycled and recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the operation. In respect of all foreign 
operations, any differences that have arisen before 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are not presented as a separate 
component of equity.
(ii) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective currencies of the Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date denominated in a currency other than the functional 
currency of the entity are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates fair value was determined.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted transaction, 
the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. The associated gain or loss is 
removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the period in which the transaction to which it relates occurs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an 
effective hedge is recognised directly in a separate translation reserve within equity. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1st January 2004, the date of transition to 
IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis at rates which write down the value of assets to their residual 
values over their estimated useful lives.  Land is not depreciated.  The principal rates are as follows:
Freehold buildings  1.5% Office furniture and fittings  10%  Motor vehicles  20%
Plant and machinery  10 - 12.5% Office equipment  12.5 - 33.3% Tooling and patterns  10%
The depreciation rates are reassessed annually.
Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations after 1st January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents the 
difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually 
for impairment. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which 
represents the amount recorded under previous UK GAAP .
(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred except that, 
development expenditure is capitalised where the development costs relate to new or substantially improved products that are 
subsequently to be released for sale and will generate future economic benefits. The expenditure capitalised includes staff costs 
and related expenses. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and any 
impairment losses.
(iii) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and 
any impairment losses. (iv) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other 
than goodwill, from the date they are available for use. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment annually. The principal 
amortisation rates are as follows:
Capitalised development costs 20%  Manufacturing designs and
ERP systems and software 12.5 - 20%     core technology   10%
Customer relationships 20%  Non compete undertaking 50%
Brand names and trademarks 10 - 20%
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including overheads where appropriate, and estimated net realisable value. Provision is 
made for slow-moving and obsolete items based on an assessment of technological and market developments and on an analysis of 
usage.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts 
that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purpose of the of cash flow statements.
Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries 
and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees' services. The Group's net obligation 
in respect of defined benefit pensions is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted at rates reflecting the yields on 
AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations to determine its 
present value. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses, differences 
between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the year they arise. Any scheme surplus (to the extent it is considered recoverable) or deficit is recognised in 
full in the balance sheet.
The cost of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the 
period which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees' services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
(iii) Employee share plans
Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes. The fair value of these 
options and awards at their date of grant is charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
(iv) Long term share incentive plans
The fair value of awards is measured at the date of grant and the cost spread over the vesting period. The amount recognised as 
an expense is not adjusted to reflect market based performance conditions, but is adjusted for non-market based performance 
conditions.
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer. Revenue from projects or service contracts is recognised as income in proportion to the stage of completion 
of the transaction at the balance sheet date. The stage of completion is assessed depending on the specific circumstances of each 
case. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or associated costs, or 
there is the possibility of return of the goods. No revenue is recognised if there is significant continuing management involvement with 
the goods.
As soon as the outcome of a project or service contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and expenses are recognised in the income 
statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project or service contract. An expected loss on a project or service contract 
is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Leases
(i) Operating leases
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(ii) Finance leases
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset 
had been purchased outright. Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital elements 
of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors. Depreciation is charged on a consistent basis with similar owned 
assets or over the lease term if shorter. The interest element of the lease payment is charged to the income statement on a basis 
which produces a consistent rate of charge over the period of the liability.

56 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Taxation
The tax charge comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the Income Statement unless it relates to 
items recognised directly in equity, when it is also recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the profit for the year 
and any adjustments in respect of previous years using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax 
is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and 
liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the accounts. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax is provided using rates of tax that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date or the date that the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Share capital
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is 
recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from 
total equity.
Share options granted to subsidiary employees
The Parent company grants share options over its own ordinary shares directly to employees of subsidiary companies. These 
employees provide services to the subsidiary companies. The cost of these shares is not recharged and therefore the fair value of 
the share options granted is recognised as a capital contribution to the subsidiary companies. This is accounted for as an increase in 
investments with a corresponding increase in a non-distributable component of equity.
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
As a result of the introduction of IFRS 8, Operating Segments, which introduced a management approach to segment reporting, the 
Group's segments have been changed to disclose information that is more consistent with management reporting. All 2008 figures 
previously presented in old segmental format have been restated to reflect the new presentation.

Factors that may affect the future tax charges:
The Group’s tax charge in future years is likely to be affected by the proportion of profits arising and the effective tax rates in the various 
territories in which the Group operates. No UK tax (after double tax relief for underlying tax) is expected to be payable on the future 
remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries.

Impairment
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash generating units, or 
groups of cash generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the 
goodwill as analysed in the table below.

Other cash-generating units   5,505 5,314
    38,150 29,908 
The goodwill balance has been tested for annual impairment on the following basis:
● The carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows 
 based on forecast information for the next financial year which has been approved by the Board and in the case of recent 
 acquisitions on detailed annual forecasts. 
● The key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows. 
● Pre-tax discount rates range from 13-25%.  
● Growth rates vary between 1-5% depending on detailed forecasts. These rates of growth are conservative when compared to the 
 annualised profit growth of the group over the last few years. 
● No impairments were identified as a result of this exercise.
The principal value in use assumptions for the Flexicon A/S Denmark goodwill balance were as follows:
● Annual monetary growth of 5%.
● Pre-tax discount rate of 13%. 
The principal value in use assumptions for the MasoSine goodwill balance were as follows: 
● Long term revenue growth of 2.5-3.5%. 
● Pre-tax discount rate of 18%.
As expected there is little headroom in the case of recently acquired businesses, which have not yet had time to develop under the 
management of the Group. The businesses are performing in accordance with expectations and the key assumptions used above are 
appropriate at the year-end. As an indication of the headroom limits, the impairment charge that would be required if the discount rate 
were increased by 1% is £900,000 and that required if long-term revenue growth were decreased by 1% is £700,000. 14 LOANS TO SUBSIDIARIES

Pension plans - The Group
The Group is accounting for pension costs in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19.
The disclosures shown here are in respect of the Group’s Defined Benefit Obligations. Other plans operated by the Group 
were either Defined Contribution plans or were deemed immaterial for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
The total expense relating to the Group’s Defined Contribution pension plans in the current year was £5,215,000 
(2008: £4,485,000).
Of the Defined Benefit plans, the plans in the UK and USA hold most of the liability. The post-retirement mortality assumptions in 
respect of these plans may therefore be considered material. The UK schemes assume that post-retirement mortality follows the PA00 
series tables, with medium cohort improvements subject to minimum improvements of 1% per annum, and depending on a member's 
year of birth. An adjustment is then made for each plan to reflect the profile of membership. This basis gives a life expectancy of 
20 years and 22 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65. These figures reflect the generally recognised trend of 
increased longevity. The USA schemes use the RP-2000 mortality table with AA scale projected through 2010. Life expectancy under 
this table is 19 years and 21 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65. These assumptions are regularly reviewed in 
light of scheme specific experience and more widely available statistics.

a) Share Option Scheme
The Group operates equity settled share option schemes for employees. Awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee 
whose objective is to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder 
value. Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth 
anniversary of the date of grant. For options granted from 1995 to 2001 the performance condition is an increase in EPS of more than 
6% greater than the increase in the UK retail prices index over a consecutive three year period between grant and ten years from date 
of grant. From and including the 2002 options the increase in EPS was revised to 9% greater than the increase in the UK retail price 
index over a three year consecutive period and from 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three year period from 
1st January prior to the date of the grant.  If the condition is not met at the end of the three year period the option will lapse. 
The share options granted have been measured by Towers Watson LLP , Actuaries and Consultants, using the Present Economic Value 
(PEV) valuation methodology. The relevant disclosures in respect of the share option scheme grants are set out below.

b) Performance Share Plan
Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to executive directors and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, 
subject to the satisfaction of a performance target. To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an 
option over shares. For awards granted up to 2007 the performance target is based on the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) 
relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three year performance 
period where awards will vest on a sliding scale. All shares within an award will vest if the Company's TSR is at or above the upper 
quartile. 25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight 
line basis between 25% and 100% if the Company's TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile. No shares will vest if 
the Company's TSR is below the median. The performance criteria for awards from 2008 onwards are split into two separate parts. 
The vesting of the first part, amounting to 60% of the award, is based on the existing TSR measure. The vesting of the second part, 
amounting to 40% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three year performance period. 
25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to 5% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 
11%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these two rates.
Shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan have been valued by Towers Watson using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation 
methodology.  The relevant disclosures in respect of the Performance Share Plan grants are set out below.

c) Employee Share Ownership Plan
UK employees are eligible to participate in the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The aim of the Plan is to encourage increased 
shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions. Employees are invited to join the Plan 
when an offer is made each year. Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower 
of the price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules. The Company provides a matching share for 
each share purchased by the individual.  
Shares issued under the Employee Share Ownership Plan have been measured by Towers Watson LLP , Actuaries and Consultants, 
using the Present Economic Value (PEV) valuation methodology. The relevant disclosures in respect of the Employee Share Ownership 
Plans are set out below.

1  The acquisition of Flexicon A/S, based in Denmark was completed on 11th February 2008. The transaction also resulted in the 
Group obtaining full ownership of Flexicon’s distribution company for the USA, Flexicon America Inc.  The acquisition method of 
accounting has been used. Consideration of £11,422,000 was paid on completion. Separately identifiable intangibles are recorded as 
part of the fair value adjustment. Goodwill reflects the significant synergies in market coverage and cost savings that can be acheived 
by being part of a larger group.      
2 The acquisition of Colima S.r.l., based in Italy was completed on 31st March 2008. The acquisition method of accounting has been 
used. Consideration of £480,000 was paid on completion. Intangibles, inventory, trade receivables and other payables and accruals 
has been adjusted to reflect Spirax Sarco’s accounting policies in order to arrive at fair value.     
    
3  The acquisition of the assets and business of Distant Star CC based in South Africa was completed on 30th June 2008. 
The acquisition method of accounting has been used. Consideration of £90,000 was paid on completion. Separately identifiable 
intangibles are recorded as part of the fair value adjustment.       
   
4 The acquisition of PAK Machinery Limited based in the UK was completed on 3rd November 2008. The acquisition method of 
accounting has been used. Consideration of £450,000 was paid on completion. Separately identifiable intangibles are recorded as part 
of the fair value adjustment.        
 
5 The acquisition of the 4.89% minority share of Spirax Sarco S.A. based in Spain was completed on 19th December 2008. The 
acquisition method of accounting has been used. Consideration of £777,000 was paid on completion.
 Had the acquisitions all taken place on 1st January 2008, rather than the actual acquisition dates, the effect on Group revenue and 
 profit after tax would not have been significant.

76 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 32 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
      
The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions. The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, 
cash and short term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations. The 
Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations. It is, 
and has been throughout the period under review, the Group's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency 
risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have 
remained fundamentally unchanged since the beginning of 2000.
      
Credit risk
The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and it's customer base is varied in size and industry sector. 
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers' credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non 
collectable. Historically losses from trade receivables have been low.
      
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing 
depending on which gives best value.
      
Liquidity risk
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and 
finance leases as appropriate.
      
Foreign currency risk
The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of 
exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of 
this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies. Such exposures 
arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit's functional currency. Net cash flows between any 
two currencies of less than £1m per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover. Forward 
cover is not taken out more than twelve months in advance or for more than 80% of the forecast exposure. 
      
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities
The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31st December was as follows:

Financial assets on which no interest is earned comprise trade and other receivables and cash at bank and in hand.
Floating rate financial assets comprise cash placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates. The average rate of 
interest received on sterling deposits during the year was 0.33% (2008: 3.7%).
Currency exposures
As explained above, the Group's objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas (in other 
words, its structural currency exposures) are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation. All 
gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total comprehensive income.
Transactional (or non-structural) exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the income statement. 
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the 
operating (or 'functional') currency of the operating unit involved. At 31st December the currency exposures in respect of the euro 
was a net monetary liability of £372,000 (2008: £3,000) and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of £2,441,000 
(2008: £1,015,000).
At 31st December the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 22.5% (2008: 1%) for the euro and 34.6% (2008: 38%) 
for the US dollar.

£322,100 with Czech CZK, £400,000 Polish PLN and €120,000 with Chinese RMB.
Borrowing Facilities
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it. The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which 
all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows:
 THE GROUP
   2009 2008
   £000 £000

Expiring in one year or less   20,000 20,000
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact 
that they were at short term rates of interest. Fair values have been assessed as follows:
• Derivatives
 Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using year end exchange rates.
• Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
 Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
• Finance lease liabilities
 The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease 
 agreements. The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
• Trade and other receivables / payables
 For receivables / payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. 
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated 
earnings.
At 31st December, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Group’s profit 
after tax and equity by approximately £50,000 (2008: £120,000).
At the year end borrowings totalled £54,161,000 consequently, in respect of financial liabilities, the Group is not significantly at risk 
from increases in interest rates.
80 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009
Notes to the accounts 
continued For the year ended 31st December 2009, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted 
in relation to the Group's profit and trading flows has increased the Group's profit before tax by approximately £1,200,000 
(2008: £1,000,000). The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements. Forward 
exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
The credit risk profile of trade receivables
The aging of trade receivables at the reporting date was:
    Gross Impairment Gross Impairment
    2009 2009 2008 2008
Not past due date    97,447 (271) 97,608 (310)
0-30 days past due date    10,904 (239) 15,588 (390)
30 days-1 year past due date    15,434 (4,440) 14,704 (2,605)
More than one year    3,171 (3,171) 2,778 (2,778)
    126,956 (8,121) 130,678 (6,083)
Based on past experience the Group believes no further impairment allowance is required for receivables that are past their due date.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:
     2009 2008
Balance at 1 January     6,083 2,806
Movement in Impairment     2,038 3,277

Spirax Sarco is the global leader in the supply of engineered 
solutions for the efficient design, maintenance and operation  
of industrial and commercial steam systems. As a heat source, 
steam is the natural choice in most industrial processes due to  
its high heat-carrying capacity, controllability, sterility and efficiency 
as a heat transfer fluid. With our specialist knowledge, technical 
expertise and wide range of products, as well as our extensive 
global presence, Spirax Sarco is uniquely positioned to provide  
a broad range of environmentally-friendly engineered solutions  
to the many industries using steam.
Our customers face a variety of challenges including high energy 
costs, pressure to improve the efficiency and capacity of existing 
processes and the need to comply with increasingly stringent 
health, safety and environmental legislation. Our direct sales force 
is trained at length in product application, system performance 
and troubleshooting of steam systems. The Spirax Sarco 
offering is very wide, from single products through to complete 
turnkey bespoke packages that can include design, fabrication, 
installation, commissioning and maintenance. All of this creates  
a compelling and attractive one-stop approach for our customers. 
Watson-Marlow is the global leader in peristaltic pumping and 
specialises not only in the design and manufacture of the most 
advanced peristaltic pumps, but also in the application of those 
pumps to customers’ processes. Our peristaltic pumps are ideal 
for difficult pumping applications. They are highly accurate and 
controllable and virtually maintenance-free, making them a very 
reliable and cost-effective solution. 
Operating a make-to-order manufacturing system and 
uniquely extruding our own pump tubing, we have the leading 
position in the supply of peristaltic pumps to the biotechnology, 
pharmaceuticals, wastewater treatment, mining and food 
industries. The peristaltic pumping market is a small part of the 
global pump market but it is one of the fastest growing segments.

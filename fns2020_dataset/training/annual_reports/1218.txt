Results and dividend
The increasingly widespread adoption of ARM technology in consumer
electronic devices was illustrated in 2004 by the 63% increase in the
reported total shipments of ARM Powered® products to 1,272 million
units, up from the reported 782 million units in 2003. The strong cash
generation resulting from this robust operational performance, together
with our confidence in the Company’s long-term prospects, enabled us
to continue to make significant investments in research and development
and to acquire Axys, a provider of electronic system level (ESL) design
tools, in August 2004, and Artisan, which designs physical IP
components, in December 2004.
The combination of ARM microprocessor IP with the physical IP provided
by Artisan, accelerates ARM’s momentum towards becoming the
architecture for the digital world. It is encouraging that we were able 
to complete such a strategically important acquisition at the same time
as achieving a strong financial performance in the underlying business
with a year-on-year dollar revenue increase of more than 30%, operating
margins well ahead and year-end order backlog at record levels. 
The board decided at the end of 2003 to initiate the payment of an
annual dividend. We see a return of cash to shareholders through a
dividend as part of a package of measures to make the best use of the
business’s cash resources. As indicated last year, it is the board’s intention
to increase the dividend over time, taking into account the opportunity
for continued investment in the business and the Company’s underlying
operational performance. With this in mind, the board is recommending
a final dividend of 0.42 pence per share, bringing the total for the year
to 0.7 pence per share, an increase of 17% over the dividend paid in
respect of 2003.
The market
After strong year-on-year growth for the semiconductor industry in
2004, current expectations for 2005 are that there will be little or no
growth over 2004. Despite this flatter trading environment, we expect
2005 to be a year of growth in dollar revenues for the Company,
underpinned by a high order backlog, strong momentum in royalty
revenues and a healthy sales pipeline for our broad technology
portfolio.
New products, including our OptimoDE™ embedded signal processing
technology and our next-generation microprocessor, codenamed “Tiger” ,
are expected to underpin licensing revenue in 2005.
Geographic expansion
ARM’s business is increasingly global. In 2004, the geographic source of
our revenues illustrated the global reach of the semiconductor industry
as well as our role at its heart: 51% of full-year revenues emanated
from North America, 34% from Asia Pacific and 15% from Europe.
During 2004 we established a sales office in Bangalore, India, and our
operations there have been enhanced by the addition of Artisan’s
established design facility in Bangalore. This will be expanded
significantly during 2005. We also opened a second office in China.
Currently most of the chips which are used in China are bought from
our Partners and are designed around our IP , but we are establishing
local relationships as the country’s high-technology industry matures
and its companies begin to develop their own IP . 
People
I thank all employees for the contribution made to the excellent results
achieved in 2004. I also thank the management and employees of ARM
and Artisan who worked tirelessly to make the acquisition happen and
are continuing to do so as we embrace the opportunities that rapid and
full integration of the businesses will bring.
4 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 2004 was a year of strong operational 
performance, which concluded with completion  
of our acquisition of Artisan.
It is much to their credit that this was achieved concurrently with
delivering a strong operational performance in the increasingly
demanding market in which we operate. We were delighted to
welcome 26 new employees to ARM with the acquisition of Axys 
and 347 new employees with the acquisition of Artisan.
Board changes
There have been a number of board changes during 2004 and 2005
which reflect the board’s commitment to maintain an appropriate
balance of skills and experience. Lawrence Tesler retired from the board
at the 2004 Annual General Meeting, having served two three-year
terms as a non-executive director. Jeremy Scudamore, who is CEO of
Avecia Group (formerly the speciality chemicals business of Zeneca), 
was appointed as a non-executive director in April and has brought 
a broad range of skills to the board that extend beyond the
semiconductor industry.
With the acquisition of Artisan in December 2004, we were delighted to
welcome Mark Templeton and Lucio Lanza to the board. Mark had been
CEO of Artisan since he co-founded the business in 1991. He has joined
the board as an executive director and General Manager of ARM
Physical IP group. Lucio had been a director of Artisan since 1996 
and was Chairman from 1997. He has considerable knowledge and
experience in the field of electronic design automation and of the
semiconductor industry. He has joined the board as a non-executive
director and a member of the nomination committee.
Simon Segars and Philip Rowley joined the board in January 2005.
Simon joined ARM’s engineering team in 1991 and has worked on
many ARM CPU products. He was appointed Executive Vice President,
Engineering in January 2002 and became Executive Vice President,
Worldwide Sales in January 2004. Philip Rowley is President and CEO 
of AOL Europe and has a strong financial background. He is a qualified
chartered accountant and has previously been Group Finance Director 
of Kingfisher plc, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
of EMI Music Worldwide. He joined the board as a non-executive
director and as a member of the audit committee. These appointments
recognise the valuable contribution that Simon is already making to the
direction of the business and Philip’s broad industry experience, which
will further strengthen the non-executive team.
I am delighted that we have been able to recruit such high calibre
individuals with such a breadth of skills and experience to the board.
These appointments bring the number of directors to 14 and there are
no current plans to make further appointments.
Current trading and prospects
The former ARM and Artisan stand-alone businesses both enter 2005
with healthy order backlogs and sales pipelines which underpin
licensing revenues this year. In addition, both companies continue to
enjoy good growth in royalty revenues, based on the increasing
adoption of ARM and Artisan technology by semiconductor and OEM
(Original Equipment Manufacturer) companies in recent years.
Combined with the healthy order backlog and sales pipeline, this gives
us confidence that dollar revenues in both underlying businesses are
capable of growing by at least 20% in 2005.
Sir Robin Saxby Chairman
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 5 Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations
A 32% year-on-year growth in dollar revenues 
in 2004 and the positive trend in our order backlog 
indicate that the ARM stand-alone business is in
robust shape. We look forward to 2005 with confidence 
as we start to realise the benefits arising from the acquisition
of Artisan at the end of the year.
The year was one of growth and achievement for ARM, both
operationally and strategically. Following a year of consolidation 
in 2003, we increased licensing activity and revenues, made two
acquisitions and expanded into new markets. As 2004 ended, the
business community was understandably cautious about external
factors, such as the weak dollar and the global economic climate, 
but our achievements during the year demonstrate that we are 
strongly positioned to continue to flourish in 2005.
Acquisition of Artisan Components, Inc.
We completed the acquisition of Artisan on 23 December 2004; 
the combined company’s product portfolios and sales channel now
provide one of the broadest offerings of system-on-chip (SoC) IP to our
expanded customer base. We expect the amalgamation of the ARM and
Artisan businesses to increase revenue, save costs by consolidating
selected corporate functions, deliver an attractive margin structure and
generate strong cash flow.
The combined company will seek to leverage Artisan’s expertise in
physical IP design – the essential building blocks of integrated circuits –
with ARM’s expertise in designing microprocessors. As a result, we will
be able to develop highly-optimised components for use in, and with,
our microprocessors, creating the potential to produce substantial
benefits for end users, such as reduced power consumption and
increased processor speed.
The integration of the businesses is proceeding as planned. The former
Artisan business now forms our Physical IP group, and one worldwide
sales force is responsible for selling the full range of products. ARM’s
office in Los Gatos, California, closed in February 2005 and employees
relocated to Artisan’s Sunnyvale facility, our new US headquarters.
Shipments and licensing activity
The electronics industry in general had a good year with growth 
across all our key markets. The sales of ARM Powered products 
provide a powerful indicator of our success: shipments in a single 
year exceeded the one billion mark for the first time. Total shipments
increased 63%, from 782 million in 2003 to 1.3 billion. Most new-
generation 3G mobile phones will be ARM Powered and the increasing
adoption of the technology has accelerated shipments in this market.
There were also significant increases in shipments of ARM Powered
digital cameras; storage devices, such as hard disk drives; automotive
products and consumer electronics.
Licensing activity was also strong: 65 licences (31 multi-use licences
and 34 per-use licences) were signed in 2004, compared with 51 in
2003. Of the 65 licences, 15 were for ARM11 products, 31 for ARM9
products, 15 for ARM7 products, three for next-generation ARM
processors and one architecture licence. Fifteen companies became 
new ARM Partners, bringing the total to 140. Two of our new Partners
took multi-use licences and 13 took per-use licences. Total licensing
revenues in 2004 were £59.4 million – 39% of total revenues –
compared with £50.8 million, or 40%, in 2003. 
Licensing activity demonstrated the breadth of our technology offer as
well as the longevity of our products. For example, our Partners have
been licensing products in the ARM7 family for more than 11 years, 
and we expect the licensing of ARM7 family products to continue 
for some time.
The industry’s commitment to ARM11 technology, and to complementary
ARM technologies such as TrustZone™ security software and Jazelle 
Java acceleration technology, was emphasised by the 15 new ARM11
licences signed in 2004 (making a total of 25 to date). As ARM11
family products move into the mainstream licensing phase, it is
encouraging that licensing of the next generation of ARM technology
began in 2004: we signed three Partners for our “Tiger” product. Other
new technologies planned for delivery in 2005 are now available for
licensing, and we will release details of them during 2005.
The strong licensing performance increased the order backlog in 
the fourth quarter of the year, with the result that it was approximately
30% higher at the end of 2004 than at the end of 2003. Revenues
from licensing of products other than microprocessors comprised 18%
of the total in 2004, compared with 17% in 2003.
Product development, new technology and partnerships
The announcement in October 2004 of our new Cortex™ family of
microprocessors received an enthusiastic welcome from Partners. Cortex
products will enable them to benefit from the incorporation of new
features into microprocessors at various performance points. The first
member of the family, the ARM Cortex-M3 processor, is targeted at
extremely cost-sensitive embedded applications, such as microcontrollers,
automotive body systems and white goods. 
A further significant technology was announced in May 2004 at the
Embedded Processor Forum in San Jose, California. Commonly known 
as a “data engine”, the ARM OptimoDE solution enables flexible, low-
cost devices to be designed and developed at performance levels which
6 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 cannot be achieved by conventional design. By the end of 2004, we
had welcomed the first four licencees of OptimoDE technology, which
can be used for any application that requires computationally intensive
data and signal processing, including video, wireless LAN, audio, imaging
and consumer entertainment. Comprising a configurable data engine
(signal processor), together with related IP and tools, it will be used in
systems alongside existing ARM technologies, including the electronic
system level (ESL) design tools from Axys.
The acquisition of Axys, a provider of fast, accurate, integrated,
processor and system modelling and simulation solutions, brings ESL
expertise to our RealView® design tools portfolio. The ESL products
reduce overall system costs by enabling designs to be modelled early 
in the development cycle, speeding time-to-market and minimising
design errors.
In July we established an Embedded Software group to capitalise on
opportunities to generate revenues from software. This team will build
on the foundation of the existing Jazelle
®
Java acceleration technology,
Intelligent Energy Manager (IEM) technology, TrustZone security
software and Swerve (co-developed with Superscape Group plc)
technology. It will bring more focus to the development of enabling
software technology to support growth in microprocessor and physical
IP licensing, Development Systems and data engines revenues.
In October, we held the first ARM Developers’ Conference in Santa Clara.
This epitomised the ARM Connected Community: it brought together
more than 2,000 delegates and 100 exhibitors from across the world.
The attendees all had a common interest – a desire to play a role in 
the development of solutions based on ARM IP . The event was an
unqualified success and we are already organising the 2005 conference. 
Revenue and margins
Healthy licensing activity and significant growth in shipments of ARM
Powered products had a positive impact. In sterling, revenue rose by
19% compared with 2003; in dollar terms, the growth was even more
impressive, at 32%. Effective cost control resulted in our operating profit
margin increasing gradually towards our target of around 30%. On the
basis of our performance over the past 12 months, we are looking
forward with optimism. 
People
In the summer of 2004 we accelerated recruitment and, by the end of
the year, had 1,171 full-time employees, including 347 who joined the
Company as part of the Artisan acquisition, up from 740 in December
2003. The decision to increase headcount was underpinned by our
confidence in our potential for growth. We recruited in most areas 
of the business but, in particular, boosted the Development Systems
team and expanded technical sales and marketing. At the year end, 
the Company had 546 employees in the UK, 454 in the US, 79 in
continental Europe, 51 in India and 41 in the Asia Pacific region.
The future
Our investments in important developing markets, combined with 
the acquisitions of Axys and Artisan, are evidence of our belief that the
future offers great opportunities for the development of our business.
Together, they will facilitate the design of highly-optimised, cost-
effective systems, which incorporate hardware and software, resulting
in faster time to revenue for our Partners, their customers and, of
course, for us.
The two acquisitions we made in 2004 have set us ahead of the
competition. Add to this the momentum from the royalties earned and
licences signed in 2004, our ever-expanding Partner network and the
exciting new applications currently being developed to run on our
processors, and our reasons for optimism are clear.

ARM IP makes 
life easier by being at the heart 
of countless products used at home, 
from plasma TVs to washing machines and 
from gaming consoles to refrigerators
Review of operations/at home
Take a look back over the past five years and ask, “How has technology
improved?” It was not that long ago that all but the most expensive 
TVs were large boxes that took up an entire corner of a room; gaming
machines were slow, and mobile phones had monochrome screens 
and limited battery life. 
Naturally, we only know the shortcomings of past technology in
retrospect. At the time, not even well-informed consumers knew what
future technology would deliver. ARM, on the other hand, had a pretty
good idea. 
This is because ARM has been a part of the technology innovation for 
20 years. Our technology can be found at the heart of countless products.
At home, at work and on the move, our IP is playing a central role in
the quest for ever faster, less power hungry, more secure, increasingly
portable and more compact digital products.
Plasma-screen TVs, for example, are rapidly replacing traditional models.
As well as being more stylish, space efficient and offering high-quality
audio-visual entertainment, they are increasingly affordable. Similarly,
gaming machines offer vastly enhanced performance and capabilities:
vivid sound, high-definition graphics and dynamic gameplay. The
gaming experience – on consoles and on handheld devices – is a huge
improvement over previous models.
The latest generation of mobile phones has redefined the boundaries 
of wireless communications. 3G technology, which is becoming widely
adopted around the world, offers video phone and music download in
the palm of the hand.
We have played a significant role, along with our Partners, in the
development of these and other technology-based products. Although
consumers are unaware of what lies inside the products they use, the
world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers have licensed our IP and it
is their products – the small, yet increasingly powerful, microprocessors
– which have enabled greater innovation by the manufacturers of digital
devices. This has enabled these companies to create products that
appeal to an increasing group of consumers. Whereas technology
products used to be confined to specific niches, microprocessors – 
and, therefore, ARM – are now everywhere.
This is reflected in the royalties that we earn every time an ARM
Powered product is shipped. In 2004, shipments exceeded the one
billion mark per year and, as microprocessors are used in a wider range
of consumer products including white goods such as washing machines
and refrigerators, the number and type of ARM Powered products will
continue to increase. ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 9
Manufacturers of digital products are driven by the need to stay ahead
of the competition and to respond quickly to consumer demand. As 
a result, microprocessors must be faster, more versatile, smaller and
more energy efficient. Development times for new products shorten
every year. Consistently meeting and exceeding such demands is our
speciality and our success is derived from the unique relationships 
we share with our multitude of Partners.
This is illustrated by the ARM Connected Community which now embraces
more than 200 Partners from across the technology spectrum. Bringing
together many types of technology companies including semiconductor
manufacturers, development tools suppliers and operating system (OS)
vendors, we provide the foundation for some of the industry’s most
exciting developments.
Technology is constantly changing, but ARM continues to be devoted 
to its partnership business model. Through interaction, the sharing 
of information and ideas and close collaboration, companies across 
the globe are working with ARM, and one another, to create the next
generation of technology-based products for use at home.
ARM IP is at the heart of many 
of the digital products used in
everyday life. Our technology 
enables innovative new developments
in home entertainment and
communications, and can be found in
everything from feature-rich mobile
phones to next-generation plasma-
screen TVs, stereo systems and
gaming consoles – even concept
products such as an ARM Powered
DVD coffee maker.
Our technology is not only present in
products used for entertainment, it can 
be found in many household items that 
we take for granted such as washing
machines, refrigerators and home security
systems. ARM IP is central to the
microprocessors that power these 
and similar items. 10 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Review of operations/at work
ARM IP makes life more efficient, enabling its
Partners to create more functional products by 
increasing performance and decreasing power 
consumption
Microprocessors have been ubiquitous in the workplace for more than
two decades: virtually everyone now uses microprocessor technology 
on a daily basis. It is not surprising, therefore, that just as our IP powers
countless technology products at home, we have a considerable, and
increasing presence, in the world of work.
Many ARM Powered products are used at home and at work. Personal
digital assistants (PDAs), for example, have become a regular feature 
of many people’s lives and offer a wealth of instantly accessible
information. Like so many other technology products, each generation
of PDAs is smaller, more powerful and offers greater battery life than 
its predecessor, and we continue to play a significant role in the
ongoing revolution.
Mobile devices offer even greater functionality. Some contain multiple
ARM microprocessors: one for processing information, for example, 
and another for networking functions. In addition, the latest handheld
computers are also wireless devices. The adoption of industry standards,
such as Bluetooth and WLAN, has helped narrow the gap between the
capabilities of mobile and wireless and wireline technologies.
One reason for our success in this, and all markets, is our focus on
enabling our Partners to develop increasingly innovative applications
based on our architecture. Although we are committed to introducing
new IP , our reputation is built on much more than the capabilities of 
our designs. ARM Development Systems provides a comprehensive
range of solutions to help developers make the most of ARM IP . These
complement our processors and include software, and hardware tools
which are designed to speed time-to-market, while also reducing the
risk and cost of development. 
In addition, we have partnerships with a wide range of providers 
of complementary solutions, from suppliers of embedded OS and
development environments, to specialists in electronic design automation
(EDA), to application software providers. Our partnerships with the
leaders in these fields give our silicon Partners considerable advantages
in the quest for ever-more innovative products.
By combining our IP with third-party software, our silicon Partners
design microprocessors which push the boundaries of performance 
and power efficiency. The net result for users is greater functionality,
improved efficiency and faster communications. The contemporary
office communicates like never before. Flexibility and mobility are key
factors. Many products, including printers, are now wireless devices. 
At the same time, they combine scanning and photocopying functions, ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 11
The convergence of mobile
communication and PDA computing
technologies, which is being driven
by our Partners’ ARM Powered
solutions, is making information
instantly accessible to everyone,
whether in the home or at work.
and produce high-quality output in a fraction of the time of previous
generations – and at less cost. 
Again, ARM IP is at the heart of the networking and storage markets.
ARM Powered products include the servers, modems and firewalls that
ensure high performance, reliable and secure connections within and
between offices around the world.
Our microproccessors are ideally suited to the storage market, to enable
OEMs to pack increasingly large amounts of media into smaller devices.
Whether it is a hard disk drive, a memory card or a personal storage
device that plugs into a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, performance
and affordability are vital considerations.
With the recent advancements in
wireless technology, ARM IP is able
to play a vital role in bringing freedom
and convenience to the workplace.
Our technology powers a range of
products that can communicate to
each other without wires, and that
increase the scope of where and 
how we do business – from handheld
computers and smart phones to fax
machines and printers.
ARM is also at the heart of the
technology that supports and connects
people in the traditional workplace
environment. Our IP can be found in
the IT servers and modems that are
used everyday and that we rely on to
ensure high-performance and efficiency.
ARM Powered products are also found in other work environments.
From mobile bar code readers, to electronic test and measurement
equipment, and to factory and warehouse automation systems, the
ARM architecture is gaining support across an increasingly diverse range
of applications.
Each new product that incorporates ARM IP strengthens our connection
with the continuing technology revolution that touches everyone’s 
lives. At home and at work, wherever you live and whatever you do, 
it is likely that you will use an ARM Powered product at some point 
in your day.  12 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Review of operations/on the move
ARM IP makes life more fun for 
consumers by enabling our Partners 
to shape tomorrow’s world today: 
now we can take photographs 
with our mobile phones 
and talk to our friends 
through our TVs
Not long ago, pocket-sized video cameras, video phones and biometric
identification systems existed only in futuristic movies. Now, these
products are commonplace and often ARM Powered, and they confirm
that the future of everyday technology is more exciting than ever.
When travelling between work and home, enjoying leisure time or
simply buying groceries, ARM Powered products play an increasing 
role in everyday life.
The automotive market is a prime example. By 2007, it is estimated
that the average mid-range car will contain up to 70 microprocessors.
The latest ARM Powered products in this market include advanced anti-
lock braking systems and GPS navigation that provides a 3D view of the
road ahead. Our IP has also been used by the creators of a solar-
powered car. 
ARM Powered products also protect your money. In the past, bank 
and credit cards, for example, stored data on a magnetic strip. The 
new generation of smartcards takes security to a new level with 
highly-secure microprocessors which greatly reduce the incidence of
fraud. Our architecture is also in electronic point-of-sale (EPoS)
terminals, PinPads and ATMs. 
Security is an increasingly important issue for many people – but so is
having fun. Our technology is used as much in portable audio-visual
products as it is in the security market. 
Some of the world’s most advanced digital cameras, for example, are
ARM Powered. From affordable models for amateur photographers, to
those used by professionals, more and more digital cameras incorporate
our architecture. Our IP makes it possible to hold a video conference
through the family TV; it also makes it possible to produce digital video
cameras the size of a pack of playing cards.
For decades, magnetic tape was a chosen medium for portable sound
and vision. A standard audio tape stored 90 minutes of music; now,
personal audio players give music lovers on the move immediate
access to thousands of songs and hours of enjoyment. The storage
capacity of personal audio players is an important buying criterion, but
so is size and battery life. On all counts, ARM Powered products have
set the standard. Only a few years ago, it would have been impossible
to store more than 2,500 songs on any device but now, products which
do just that are available. And many, including the market leaders, are
based on the ARM architecture. ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 13
Some ARM Powered products combine digital music and still pictures 
in one device. Indeed, convergence is an irresistible trend in the
technology industry. In the same way that technology has crossed 
the divide between home and work, it has also occupied the space 
in between. 
Technology is now so well established that traditional boundaries
between products’ functions and where they are used are becoming
blurred. As a result, the world’s microprocessor manufacturers and 
the OEMs that design the technology products we use every day are
demanding more. These companies need complete solutions which
encompass microprocessor IP , physical IP , development tools, software
and a host of complementary third-party products. For this reason, 
ARM is uniquely positioned for the future. 
Take a look forward over the next five years and ask “How much will
technology change?” Nobody has the definitive answer, but you can be
sure ARM has a good idea. We will continue to be at the heart of
advanced digital devices – at home, at work and on the move.
The ARM architecture is used in many
of the most advanced digital cameras
and camera phones. Our IP is at the
forefront of this field, enabling the
development of ever-faster and more
compact devices.
Our solutions are not only a part of 
the visual technology revolution but
also the audio, with many market-
leading personal audio players now
being ARM Powered. We also play 
a central role in the technology that
enables innovative new products such
as cardio-vascular monitor watches.
Not only is ARM technology at the
heart of your car, it also plays a role 
in protecting your money. Credit and
debit cards, ATMs and PinPads now
use microprocessors, many of which
are ARM Powered, to store data and 
to prevent fraud. 
Our IP is playing an increasingly large
role in the automotive world, especially
in terms of safety. An average car 
may contain up to 70 microprocessors
powering devices from satellite
navigation to anti-lock braking systems. In 2004 revenue growth and careful cost control combined 
to yield strong cash generation from ARM’s business. 
We were also particularly encouraged by the sustained improvement
in licensing revenues, demonstrating that ARM continues to develop 
a broad range of new technologies which bring real benefit to the 
ARM Connected Community and end customers
Operating and financial review
The business, its objectives and strategy
ARM designs reduced instruction set computing (RISC) microprocessors
and related technology and software and sells Development Systems 
to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and power-efficiency 
of high-volume embedded applications. The Group licences and sells 
its technology and products to leading international electronics
companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors,
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application-specific
standard processors (ASSPs) based on the ARM architecture, to systems
companies to incorporate into a wide variety of end products. By
creating a network of Partners and working with them to best utilise
the Group’s technology, ARM’s objective is to become the embedded
microprocessor architecture for the digital world, establishing the ARM
processor for use in many consumer electronic devices, including
mobile handsets, MP3 players, digital televisions, hard-disk drives,
digital cameras and many automotive applications. The Group intends
to grow its revenues and profits by offering an increasingly broad range 
of IP solutions to its Partners, thereby helping them and their customers
to accelerate the time to it takes to get attractive consumer electronic
products to market.
ARM made good progress towards achieving its objectives in 2004. 
As well as reporting strong growth in revenues, profits and cash flows,
the Group made two acquisitions which significantly broaden both the
technology portfolio offered by the Group and the existing and potential
customer base.
Performance
Revenues
Total revenues for the year ended 31 December 2004 amounted to
£152.9 million, an increase of 19% over total revenues of £128.1 million
in the year ended 31 December 2003. The actual average dollar
exchange rate in 2004 was $1.83 (with an effective average exchange
rate for ARM of $1.78) compared with $1.64 in 2003. This had the effect
of reducing total reported revenues by approximately £13.2 million.
Licensing revenues in 2004 were £59.4 million, being 39% of total
revenues, compared with £50.8 million or 40% of total revenues in 
the year to 31 December 2003. Royalty revenues in 2004 were 
£59.6 million, representing 39% of total revenues in the year to 
31 December 2004, compared with £44.3 million or 34% of total
revenues in the year to 31 December 2003. Sales of Development
Systems products in 2004 were £19.7 million, being 13% of total
revenues, compared with £17.9 million, or 14% of total revenues in
2003. Service revenues, which include consulting services and revenues
from support, maintenance and training, were £14.2 million in 2004,
representing 9% of total revenues, compared with £15.1 million or 
12% of total revenues in 2003.
Royalty revenues and unit shipments
Royalty revenues grew strongly in 2004: they were £59.6 million on
1,272 million units shipped compared with £44.3 million on 782 million
units shipped in 2003. Dollar royalty revenues earned in 2004 were
$107.1 million, up 50% on 2003 compared with the increase in year-
on-year unit shipments of 63%. Over the past three years average
royalty rates per unit were 8.4 cents in 2004, 9.1 cents in 2003 and 
8.3 cents in 2002, indicating that whilst average royalty rates may
move up or down in the short term, they tend to remain stable 
over a longer period.
In 2004, the proportion of total unit shipments accounted for by 
the wireless segment was 68%. The 32% relating to the aggregate
shipments in all sectors other than wireless represents more than 
400 million units in 2004, demonstrating the increasing penetration 
of ARM technology in the full range of digital products. In 2004, unit
shipments grew strongly across all segments with particularly strong
growth in the microcontroller, storage and consumer segments.
Gross margin
Gross margin for the year to 31 December 2004 was 92.3% compared
with 91.4% in 2003.
Operating expenses
Total operating expenses in the year to 31 December 2004 were 
£105.9 million compared with £98.6 million in 2003. Operating
expenses in 2004 include total non-recurring and acquisition-related
charges of £6.6 million, being £2.1 million related to the amortisation
of goodwill arising on acquisitions and £4.5 million in respect of a
technology licence agreement. Excluding non-recurring and acquisition-
related charges, total operating expenses in 2004 were £99.3 million. 
Research and development expenses were £50.1 million in 2004,
representing 33% of revenues. This compares with £48.1 million, or 
38% of revenues, in 2003. Sales and marketing costs in 2004 were
£23.9 million, or 16% of revenues, compared with £23.0 million, or
18% of revenues, in 2003. General and administration expenses in 2004
were £31.8 million, including a non-recurring charge of £4.5 million in
respect of a technology licensing agreement and £2.1 million of
goodwill amortisation. Excluding these non-recurring and acquisition
related charges, general and administration expenses in 2004 were
14 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 £25.2 million, or 17% of revenues, compared to £19.8 million, or 
15% of revenues, before a non-recurring charge of £6.4 million and
goodwill amortisation of £1.3 million, in 2003.
Operating margin
The operating margin in 2004 was 23.0% compared with 14.4% in 2003.
The operating margin in 2004, excluding non-recurring and acquisition-
related charges of £6.6 million, was 27.4% compared to 20.4%, before
non-recurring and acquisition-related charges of £7.7 million, in 2003.
Earnings and taxation
Profit before tax in 2004 was £42.2 million compared with £23.2 million
in 2003. Profit before tax in 2004, excluding non-recurring and acquisition-
related charges of £6.6 million, was £48.8 million, or 32% of revenues,
compared with £30.9 million, before non-recurring and acquisition-
related charges of £7.7 million, or 24% of revenues, in 2003.
The Group’s taxation rate in 2004 is 24.1%, reduced from 34.3% in
2003. The reduction is due primarily to the lower level of disallowable
items and increased availability of research and development tax credits
in the UK in 2004 compared with 2003. 
Fully diluted earnings per share in 2004 were 3.1 pence compared 
with 1.5 pence in 2003. Earnings per fully diluted share in 2004, 
before non-recurring and acquisition-related charges of £6.6 million,
were 3.6 pence compared with 2.2 pence before non-recurring and
acquisition-related charges of £7.7 million, in 2003.
The acquisition of Artisan Components Inc., was completed on 
23 December 2004. The 2004 profit and loss account does not include
any material trading results in respect of Artisan. However, the balance
sheet at 31 December 2004 does reflect the acquisition of Artisan. 
Balance sheet and cash flow
Intangible assets at 31 December 2004 were £462.4 million compared
with £7.5 million at 31 December 2003, comprising goodwill of 
£459.4 million and other intangible assets of £3.0 million. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Artisan and Axys amounted 
to £451.8 million and £8.1 million respectively.

at 31 December 2004. Deferred revenues were £22.3 million at 
31 December 2004, including £8.2 million relating to Artisan, compared
with £11.1 million at the end of 2003.
Resources available
The consolidated cash, short-term investments and long-term
marketable securities balance was £142.8 million at 31 December 
2004 compared with £159.8 million at 31 December 2003. In 2004,
£122.3 million was paid as the cash element of the consideration 
for the acquisition of Artisan, £3.9 million of fees and expenses were
paid in respect of the acquisition of Artisan prior to 31 December 
2004 and net cash, short-term investments and long-term marketable
securities amounting to £82.6 million were acquired on completion 
of the Artisan transaction. A further £14 million of fees and expenses
related to the Artisan transaction are expected to be paid subsequent 
to 31 December 2004.
Interest receivable
Interest receivable was £6.9 million for the year to 31 December 2004
compared with £4.8 million in 2003, reflecting the benefit of higher
average cash balances and higher interest rates in 2004.
Returns to shareholders
Dividend 
The directors recommend payment of a final dividend in respect of
2004 of 0.42 pence per share, which, taken together with the interim
dividend of 0.28 pence per share paid in October 2004, gives a total
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 15 16 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
dividend in respect of 2004 of 0.7 pence per share, an increase of 17%
over the total dividend of 0.6 pence per share paid in 2003. Subject to
shareholder approval, the final dividend will be paid on 6 May 2005 
to shareholders on the register on 1 April 2005.
Capital structure
The authorised share capital of the Company is 2,200,000,000 ordinary
shares of 0.05 pence each (2003: 1,580,000,000). The increase was
approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held 
on 23 December 2004 to enable the Company to issue ARM shares to
Artisan stockholders as part of the acquisition and to provide a sufficient
level of authorised but unissued capital. The issued share capital at 
31 December 2004 was 1,350,786,975 ordinary shares of 0.05 pence
each (2003: 1,023,345,650). 
Treasury policies and objectives and liquidity
The Group has established treasury policies aimed both at mitigating
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on reported profits and
cash flows and at ensuring appropriate returns are earned on the
Group’s cash resources.
With more than 90% of Group revenues earned in dollars and
approximately 45% of Group costs being incurred in dollars, the Group
has a significant exposure to movements in the exchange rate between
the US dollar and sterling. This exposure is partially mitigated by an
ongoing hedging programme, involving forward contracts and low risk
option contracts where appropriate.
Principal risks and uncertainties
In line with the guidance for the preparation of an operating and
financial review, certain risk factors faced by the Company are identified
below. A more detailed description is included in the Company’s annual
report on Form 20-F and in the Listing Particulars dated 19 November
2004. Details of the Company’s internal control and risk management
procedures are included in the corporate governance report on page 20.
ARM’s quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and be unpredictable
which could adversely affect the market price of ARM ordinary shares.
ARM has experienced, and may in the future experience, significant
quarterly fluctuations in its results of operations. Quarterly results may
fluctuate because of a variety of factors including:
l the timing of entering into agreements with new licencees;
l the mixture of license fees, royalties, revenues from the sale 
of Development Systems and fees from services;
l the introduction of new technology by ARM, ARM’s licensees 
or ARM’s competition;
l the timing of orders from and shipments to systems companies 
of ARM core-based microprocessors from ARM’s semiconductor
Partners;
l sudden technological or other changes in the microprocessor
industry; and
l new litigation or developments in current litigation.
In future periods, ARM’s operating results may not meet the expectations
of public market analysts or investors. In such an event, the market
price of ARM ordinary shares could be materially adversely affected.

ARM may not realise the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
of Artisan
The acquisition involves the integration of two companies that have
previously operated independently. There can be no assurance,
however, regarding when, or the extent to which, the combined
company will be able to realise the benefits anticipated to result from
the acquisition, including increased revenues, cost savings or benefits.
The combined company must integrate numerous systems, including
those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and
finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll and regulatory
compliance. ARM and Artisan have a number of information systems
that are dissimilar, which will have to be integrated, or in some cases,
replaced. Difficulties associated with integrating ARM and Artisan, 
which would be exacerbated because they are headquartered in
different countries, could have a material adverse effect on the combined
company and the value of ARM ADSs or ARM ordinary shares.
General economic conditions may reduce ARM’s revenues 
and harm ARM’s business
ARM is subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic
conditions. Technology purchases and investments may be delayed 
or reduced due to economic uncertainties in ARM’s key markets. 
The impact of this on ARM is difficult to predict but if businesses defer
licensing ARM’s technology, require less services or development tools,
or if consumers defer purchases of new products which incorporate
ARM’s technology (for example, the slower than expected migration to
3G mobile phone technology), ARM’s revenue could decline. A decline
in revenue would have an adverse effect on ARM’s results of operations
and could have an adverse effect on ARM’s financial condition.
ARM operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor market
The semiconductor market is characterised by price erosion, rapid
technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns
and heightened foreign and domestic competition. ARM believes that
its future quarterly operating results will continue to be subject to a
wide variety of risk factors including those set out above.
Other risks include dependence on semiconductor Partners and systems
companies, availability of development tools, systems software and
operating systems compatible with the ARM architecture, dependence 
on a small number of customers and products, dependence on senior
management personnel and on hiring and retaining qualified engineers,
litigation and threats of litigation and protection of ARM IP .

a majority of independent non-executive directors. The board has
considered the overall balance between executive and non-executive
directors and believes that the number of executive directors is fully
justified by the contribution made by each of them. To increase the 
size of the board further following the appointments made in late
December 2004 and early January 2005 to meet this particular provision
is not considered appropriate.
Composition and operation of the board
The board currently comprises seven executive directors, six independent
non-executive directors and the Chairman. The executive directors are
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief
Financial Officer, the Chief Technology Officer, the Executive Vice
President, Marketing, the General Manager, Physical IP division and the
Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales, all of whom play significant
roles in the day-to-day management of the business. The six non-
executive directors are independent in character and judgement and
there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect the
judgement of any of them. The non-executive directors provide a blend
of experience and considerable knowledge to the board’s deliberations.
Peter Cawdron, who is the Senior Independent Director and the
financial expert, has extensive knowledge of UK public group issues and
a strong financial background. Doug Dunn and Jeremy Scudamore both
have experience of running large companies in allied industries. Lucio
Lanza and John Scarisbrick both have a broad understanding of the
Group’s technology and the practices of major US-based technology
companies. Philip Rowley has a strong financial background and
knowledge of internet technologies and e-commerce.
The board had six scheduled meetings during 2004 which were all
attended by all the directors, with the exception of the January 
meeting when Doug Dunn was absent, and the July, November and
December meetings when Jeremy Scudamore was unable to attend.
The Remuneration Committee met on two occasions with all members
present, with the exception of Jeremy Scudamore for the December
meeting. There is a procedure in place for additional meetings on 
any pertinent issues to be organised as necessary during the year. 
In addition, the Chairman held two meetings with the non-executive
directors without the executives present and the non-executive
directors met on one occasion without the Chairman being present, 
to appraise the Chairman's performance. 
The board is responsible for setting the Company’s strategic aims and
ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are in place
for it to meet its objectives. The board has a formal schedule of matters
specifically reserved for its decision, which includes the approval of
major business matters, policies, operating and capital expenditure
budgets, and ensuring high standards of corporate governance are
maintained. The board is also responsible for sanctioning unusual
commercial arrangements such as atypical licence agreements and
investments. 
Before each meeting, the board is furnished with information in a form
and of a quality appropriate for it to discharge its duties concerning the
state of the business and its performance. The ultimate responsibility 
20 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Corporate governance/UK GAAP
for reviewing and approving the annual report and accounts and the
quarterly reports, and for ensuring that they present a balanced
assessment of the Group’s position, lies with the board. The board
delegates day-to-day responsibility for managing the Group to the
executive committee and has a number of other committees, details 
of which are set out below.
During the year, the board undertook a formal evaluation of its own
performance, processes, committees, composition, skills and director
induction, facilitated by external consultants. It is intended that this
evaluation will be reviewed and updated by the board each year. The
Group has a commitment to training and all directors are encouraged 
to attend suitable training courses. A full, formal induction programme 
is arranged for all new directors, tailored to their specific requirements,
the aim of which is to introduce them to key executives across the
business and to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the
Group and its activities. 
Major shareholders are encouraged to meet and talk to the Chairman,
the senior independent director and other non-executive directors at
any time. The Chairman and the senior independent director both had
dialogue with major shareholders during the year.
The board has adopted guidelines for individual directors to obtain
independent professional advice at the Group's expense in appropriate
circumstances and all members of the board have access to the advice
of the Company Secretary. 
Executive committee
The executive committee is responsible for implementing the strategy
set by the board. Among other things, this committee is responsible for
approval of standard licence agreements, ensuring that the Group’s
budget and forecasts are properly prepared, that targets are met, and
generally managing and developing the business within the overall
budget. Variations from the budget and changes in strategy require
approval from the main board of the Group. The executive committee,
which meets monthly, comprises the executive directors (excluding 
the Chairman) and the directors of ARM Limited, and meetings are
attended by the Company Secretary and other senior operational
personnel, as appropriate.
Audit committee 
The audit committee has written terms of reference which were
updated during the year to reflect the requirements of the Combined
Code and Nasdaq. The committee has responsibility for, among other
things, monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the
Company and any formal announcements relating to the Company’s
financial performance, and for reviewing any significant financial
reporting judgements contained in them; reviewing the Company’s
internal controls and risk management systems; making
recommendations to the board in relation to the appointment,
remuneration and resignation or dismissal of the Group’s external
auditors; reviewing and monitoring the external auditors’ independence
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process; developing
and implementing policy on the engagement of the external auditors 
to supply non-audit services; and considering compliance with legal
requirements, accounting standards, the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
  The committee also keeps under review the value for money of the
audit and the nature, extent and cost-effectiveness of the non-audit
services provided by the auditors. The committee has discussed 
with the external auditors their independence, and has received and
reviewed written disclosures from the external auditors as required by
the Auditing Standards Board’s Statement of Auditing Standard No. 610,
“Communication of matters to those charged with governance”, as well
as those required by the US Independence Standards Board’s Standard
No. 1, “Independence discussions with audit committees”. To avoid 
the possibility of the auditors’ objectivity and independence being
compromised, the Group’s tax consulting work is carried out by the
auditors only in cases where they are best suited to perform the work,
for example, tax compliance and advisory work relating to the audit and
in connection with the acquisition of Artisan Components, Inc. In other
cases, the Group has engaged another independent firm of accountants
to perform tax consulting work. The Group does not normally award
general consulting work to the auditors. From time to time, however,
the Group will engage the auditors to perform work on matters relating
to human resources and royalty audits. The Group may also seek
professional advice from another firm of independent consultants 
or its legal advisers. 
The current audit committee comprises Peter Cawdron (Chairman),
Doug Dunn, John Scarisbrick, Jeremy Scudamore and Philip Rowley, 
who joined the committee on his appointment as a director on 
4 January 2005. Peter Cawdron is the financial expert as defined in 
the Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002 and Philip Rowley is also qualified to 
fulfill this role. The committee met on four occasions during 2004, once
before the release of the preliminary announcement of the 2003 results
to review the results and audit findings, once to review the half-year
interim results, once in connection with the Artisan acquisition and once
before the year end to discuss the scope and planning of the audit of
the 2004 results. All members were present at each meeting, with the
exception of Doug Dunn for the January meeting, and Jeremy
Scudamore for the July and November meetings. The external auditors,
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Company
Secretary attend all meetings in order to ensure that all the information
required by the audit committee for it to operate effectively is available.
The representatives of the Group’s external auditors meet with the
audit committee at least once a year without any executive directors
being present.
Remuneration committee
A description of the composition, responsibility and operation of the
remuneration committee is set out in the remuneration report on 
page 27.
Nomination committee
The nomination committee leads the process for board appointments
and makes recommendations to the board in relation to new
appointments of executive and non-executive directors and on board
composition and balance. It is chaired by Sir Robin Saxby, and the other
members are Peter Cawdron, Doug Dunn, John Scarisbrick and Lucio
Lanza, who joined the committee on his appointment as a director on
23 December 2004. The nomination committee met on two occasions
with all members present, with the exception of Doug Dunn for the
January meeting. The Committee considers the roles and capabilities
required for each new appointment, based on an evaluation of the
skills and experience of the existing directors. In relation to the
appointments of Jeremy Scudamore and Philip Rowley, the services 
of external search consultancies were used.
Internal control/risk management 
The board of directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that the
Group maintains an adequate system of internal control and risk
management and for reviewing its effectiveness. The board has
reviewed the system of internal control including internal financial
controls. Such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risks inherent in a fast-moving, high-technology business and can,
therefore, provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
The Company appointed a risk review committee in 2003 consisting of
the Chief Technology Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Financial
Controller and the Company Secretary. The committee receives and
reviews quarterly reports from business unit managers and corporate
functions and its findings are considered and challenged by the
executive committee. The committee is responsible for identifying 
and evaluating risks which may impact on the Group’s strategic and
business objectives and for monitoring the progress of actions designed
to mitigate such risks. The risk review committee reports formally to the
executive committee once a year and, in turn, the executive committee
reports to the board once a year. 
The Company appointed a disclosure committee in 2003, in compliance
with the Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002. The committee, which comprises the
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Financial Controller,
the General Counsel and the Company Secretary, is responsible for
ensuring that disclosures made by the Company to its shareholders and
the investment community are accurate, complete and fairly present
the Company’s financial condition in all material respects.
In addition, there is a series of interconnected meetings that span the
Group from the weekly management meeting chaired by the Chief
Executive Officer, and the weekly business review meeting chaired by
the Vice President, Operations, the purpose of which is to monitor and
control all main business activities, sales forecasts and other matters
requiring approval that have arisen within the week, to the board
meetings of the Group. Each month an operations meeting, chaired 
by the Chief Operating Officer and attended by managers representing
different functions across the Group, is held to review key performance
indicators such as revenues, orders booked, costs, product and project
delivery dates and levels of defects found in products in development.
Once a quarter, the annual operational plans for the different disciplines
within the Group are reviewed at the operations meeting. The outputs
of the weekly business review meeting and the monthly operations
meeting are reviewed by the executive committee which, in turn,
raises relevant issues with the board of the Group. These processes for
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant business, operational,
financial, compliance and other risks facing the Group have been in
place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the
annual report and financial statements. They accord with the guidance
on internal control issued in September 1999 by the Internal Control
Working Party of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England 
and Wales.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 21 As required by the Combined Code, the audit committee has considered
whether it would be appropriate for the Group to have its own financial
internal audit function and has concluded that, taking account of its
relatively small number of employees and a high degree of centralisation
in the way the business is run, this is not appropriate at present. The
Committee has confirmed this view to the board. The Group does,
however, have an operational internal audit function that audits the
Group’s business and product/project management processes. These
processes are documented, maintained and continuously improved, 
for effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, they are audited externally
by independent auditors for compliance with ISO 9001:2000.
Corporate social and ethical policies
While the Group is accountable to its shareholders, it also endeavours 
to take into account the interests of all its stakeholders, including its
employees, customers and suppliers and the local communities and
environments in which it operates. The Chief Financial Officer takes
responsibility for matters relating to corporate, social and ethical policies
and these matters are considered at board level. A corporate social
responsibility report is on pages 23 to 24 of this report and also on 
the Group’s website www.arm.com.
The board codified various existing policies into a Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics, which was adopted in 2004 and is available on the
Group's website.
As a company whose primary business is the licensing of IP , employees
are highly valued and their rights and dignity are respected. The Group
strives for equal opportunities for all its employees and does not tolerate
any harassment of, or discrimination against, its staff. In 2003 ARM was
named Employer of the Year in the UK National Business Awards. The
Group also endeavours to be honest and fair in its relationships with its
customers and suppliers and to be a good corporate citizen respecting
the laws of the countries in which it operates.
Environmental policies
The Group’s premises are composed entirely of offices since it has 
no manufacturing activities. Staff make use of computer-aided design
tools to generate IP . This involves neither hazardous substances nor
complex waste emissions. With the exception of Development Systems
products, the majority of “products” sold by the Group comprise
microprocessor core designs that are delivered electronically to customers.
The Group recognises the increasing importance of environmental issues
and these are discussed at board level where the Chief Financial Officer
takes responsibility for them. A number of initiatives in this area have
continued in 2004. The Group’s environmental policy is published 
on its website. An environmental action plan is implemented through
various initiatives. These include monitoring resource consumption and
waste creation so that targets set for improvement are realistic and
meaningful, ensuring existing controls continue to operate satisfactorily
and working with suppliers to improve environmental management
along the supply chain.
Energy usage and resource consumption data is published in the
Group’s corporate social responsibility report on its website.
Health and safety
Although ARM operates in an industry and in environments which 
are considered low risk from a health and safety perspective, the safety
of employees, contractors and visitors is a priority in all ARM workplaces
worldwide. Continual improvement in safety management systems 
is achieved through detailed risk assessments to identify and eliminate
potential hazards and occupational health assessments for employees.
The UK offices are covered by a health and safety committee, fire
wardens and first aiders. Each year the GoodCorporation verification
ensures that the criteria in its charter are met. The UK offices are also
audited by the British Safety Council, and the Company achieved three
stars in the 2004 audit. Other offices have similar cover dependent on
local needs, practices and customs. 
Relationships with shareholders
The board makes considerable efforts to establish and maintain good
relationships with institutional shareholders. The Group has a regular
dialogue with institutional shareholders throughout the year other than
during close periods. The board also encourages communication with
private investors and part of the Group’s website is dedicated to
providing accurate and timely information for all investors including
comprehensive information about the business, its Partners and products,
including all press releases. At present, around 20 analysts write
research reports on the Group. The Group publishes telephone numbers
on its website enabling shareholders to listen to earnings presentations
and audio conference calls with analysts. Members of the board,
including some of the non-executive directors attend the annual
analysts’ day and develop an understanding of the views of major
shareholders through any direct contact that may be initiated by
shareholders or through analysts' and brokers' briefings and feedback
from the Group's financial PR advisers who obtain feedback from
analysts and brokers following investor roadshows. During 2004, the
Chairman had meetings with major shareholders to discuss governance
and strategy, particularly in relation to the acquisition of Artisan
Components, Inc., and communicated the views of such shareholders 
to the board. All shareholders may register to receive the Group’s press
releases via the internet.
The board actively encourages participation at the Annual General
Meeting, scheduled for 25 April 2005, which is the principal forum 
for dialogue with private shareholders. A presentation will be made
outlining recent developments in the business and an open question-
and-answer session will follow to enable shareholders to ask questions
about the business in general.
By order of the board
Patricia Alsop Company Secretary
22 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Corporate governance/UK GAAP/continued ARM considers itself to be a good corporate citizen. The Group strives 
to reduce the impact it makes on the environment and to increase 
its connections with the communities in which it operates. We 
also work hard to connect and considerable efforts are made to
communicate effectively with the Group’s shareholders, Partners,
suppliers and employees.
The Group is a corporate member of the Institute of Business Ethics
(IBE) and was one of the first members of the GoodCorporation, which
was founded in 2001 to help organisations to develop, manage and
monitor their corporate responsibilities. Based on principles set out by
the IBE, the GoodCorporation charter enables companies to measure
how effective they are in achieving these responsibilities. ARM’s
commitment to the charter includes being verified against a 62-point
charter standard each year covering the fair treatment and protection of
its employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, the community and
the environment. This independent verification process is repeated each
year and, during 2004, the Group successfully retained its membership.
In addition, ARM is listed on the FTSE4Good Index, is a member of
Business in the Community, and takes part in its Business in the
Environment Index and Corporate Responsibility Index each year.
The environment 
The Group’s business focuses on designing IP which enables devices 
to use less power and, as a result, to be more environmentally friendly.
Its activities do not produce harmful waste or emissions and the Ethical
Investment Research Service (EIRIS) grades ARM as an environmentally
“low impact” business. Nevertheless, environmental performance is
monitored to enable targets to be set for reducing paper usage (and
increasing the amount recycled) and controlling water consumption. 
A document output study has been established to examine paper
consumption within the Group and to consider how an extension of its
electronic document management systems might reduce the need for
paper documents. The Group can also demonstrate an increase in paper
and packaging recycling and an improvement in the facilities in place to
promote recycling of more materials. Energy usage is monitored closely
to understand how it is used, which aids the setting of new targets.
Renewable energy sources are also being investigated. There are
recycling bins for aluminium cans in the majority of the Group’s offices,
and air conditioning systems run on less environmentally damaging
refrigerants. The supply of company cars is discouraged and in a group
of approximately 1,200 people, there are less than 30 company cars.
There is a sustainable transport team within the business looking at
ways in which impact on the environment can be reduced. Initiatives
introduced so far include encouraging employees to cycle to work
through the provision of improved facilities at the Group’s offices, or to
share car journeys, or use public transport. Business travel is measured,
and ways in which travel can be reduced while still maintaining our
very effective partnership network, are under constant review, particularly
through the provision of video conferencing equipment. The Group will
work closely with the British Safety Council in 2005 to establish ways 
to formalise our environmental objectives and performance.
Connecting with local communities 
The Group aims to be a good corporate citizen of the communities in
which it operates and supports local initiatives and fundraising. In the
UK, the focus has been on educational projects – particularly for pupils
who are interested in mathematics, science, IT and business subjects.
This support is sometimes financial, sometimes in the form of providing
employees’ time and skills. ARM also connects with the local business
community and is a founding member of The Learning Collaboration
(TLC) within the Cambridge business community in the UK. The TLC
enables member companies to pool resources to collaborate to 
learn, improving the quality, availability and value of training and
related services. 
Supporting education. ARM’s support for education stretches from
funding an information technology centre at a UK junior school, 
to working on specific projects with students at the Judge Institute,
Cambridge University’s business school. The Group has helped four
schools near its Cambridge, UK offices and one near its Maidenhead, 
UK office to achieve specialist school status; the Group supports the
Engineering Education Scheme, Young Engineers and contributes to 
the funding to train the UK team for the International Maths Olympics.
ARM’s University Programme engages universities worldwide, designing
course material, providing technical seminars, donating equipment and
software and offering assistance directly to students. ARM has worked
with a number of engineering schools internationally, including Seoul
National University, Carnegie-Mellon (U.S.), Southeast University (China),
and the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (India). In addition,
the Group has relationships with a number of UK universities. The
Chairman, for example, is a visiting professor at Liverpool and the Group
has worked with Loughborough to design a degree course which is
based on the ARM architecture.
Supporting good causes. ARM encourages employees to support their
local communities. Some are school governors, some help children
improve their reading skills, others support charities. Employees at the
Group’s Austin, Texas, office have, for example, helped with blood drives
and have also collected food and toys for underprivileged families. 
The Group “doubles the efforts” of employees who raise money for
approved charities by matching the funds they raise (with the exception
of political donations or other non-approved causes). Charities for
cancer research, to benefit needy children, to support sufferers of
multiple sclerosis, mental illness and Parkinson’s disease have been
some of the beneficiaries of this scheme. In 2004 a payroll giving
scheme was introduced for employees in the UK to enable them 
to take advantage of UK tax incentives on charitable giving.
The Prince's Trust. In 2004 ARM became a sponsor of the Prince’s Trust
Technology Leadership Group and has participated in events targeted 
at widening the knowledge and understanding of technology and
contributed expertise to the technology networking events. A team 
of five employees from ARM successfully completed the Prince’s Trust
Sahara Challenge raising £12,500 for the Trust.
Connecting with employees
ARM’s aim is to attract and retain the best people available by being 
a good and ethical employer. The skills, knowledge and motivation 
of employees are crucial to ARM’s success. The Group promotes and
supports individuals and teams through on-the-job and formal training,
coaching and mentoring. Every effort is made to keep employees well
informed about the Company and matters that affect them. This is done
through both formal and informal communications methods across all
offices worldwide. The Group also carries out a regular, comprehensive,
global opinion survey to monitor employee views and to provide
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 23
Corporate social responsibility/UK GAAP valuable input on how the Company operates. The Employee Assistance
Programme helps staff and their families with issues such as care for
children or elderly relatives, legal and health advice, and stress or 
other counselling. 
Equal opportunities. The Group needs highly-qualified staff and does 
not see age, colour, disability, ethnic origin, gender, political or other
opinion, religion or sexual orientation as a barrier to employment. 
If any member of staff becomes disabled, their needs and abilities are
assessed with a view to them continuing in their current role. If this is
impossible, every effort is made to offer them alternative employment.
Benefits. Employees receive benefits including private medical/
healthcare; health, travel and life insurance; pensions/401k plan;
sabbaticals; flexible working; stock options and a Save As You Earn
share scheme. The Group supports family friendly initiatives and offers
child care vouchers for UK tax payers. Flexible working arrangements
are available for all employees, regardless of whether they have
children. Understanding and acceptance of national and cultural
diversity is encouraged by giving employees the opportunity to work 
in offices other than in their home country.
Accessibility
The Group endeavours to provide access to all whether through building
design to allow easy disabled access or through improving access to our
website for those with visual impairments.
Health and safety
The safety of employees, contractors and visitors is a priority. ARM
measures and analyses all accidents and “near misses” (there has been
only one RIDDOR reportable accident in the Company’s history) and by
monitoring patterns or trends potential problems can be identified and
avoided. The Group is verified by GoodCorporation each year to ensure
that its health and safety requirements are met and in addition its UK
offices are audited by the British Safety Council. In the UK, there is a
health and safety committee and each office has fire wardens and first
aiders. Overseas offices have the health and safety cover required by
local legislation. Health and safety is high on the agenda and there has
been an increase in the amount of communication with employees on
occupational health issues and other health and safety issues through
different mediums such as intranet pages and company-wide magazine
articles. During 2004 further health and safety training has been
provided to line managers to assist in the development of a safety
culture within the organisation.
24 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Corporate social responsibility/UK GAAP/continued The directors present their annual report and audited financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Principal activities and review of business
The principal activities of the Group and its subsidiaries are the licensing,
marketing, research and development of RISC-based microprocessors
and systems. The nature of the global semiconductor industry is such
that most of its business is conducted overseas and, to serve its
customers better, the Group has sales offices around the world. These
include five offices in the US and offices in Shanghai and Beijing PR
China; Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; Taipei, Taiwan; Kfar Saba, Israel;
Paris, France; Munich, Germany and Bangalore, India. Design offices are
based in Cambridge, Maidenhead, Sheffield, and Blackburn, UK; Sophia
Antipolis, France; Leuven, Belgium; Aachen, Germany; Austin, Texas and
Sunnyvale, California in the US and Bangalore, India. More information
about the business is set out in the Chairman’s statement on pages 4 
to 5, the Chief Executive Officer’s review on pages 6 to 13, and the
operating and financial review on pages 14 to 17.
Future developments 
The Group’s stated objective is to establish a new global RISC
architecture standard for the embedded microprocessor market. The
directors believe that to achieve this goal it is important to expand the
number and range of potential customers for its technology. The Group
intends to enter into licence agreements with new customers and to
increase the range of new technology supplied to existing customers.
Relationships will continue to be established with third-party tools and
software vendors to ensure that their products will operate with the
ARM architecture. As a result of its position as an emerging standard in
its industry, the Group is presented with many opportunities to acquire
complementary technology or resources. It continues to review these
opportunities, and in August 2004, the Group acquired Axys Design
Automation, Inc., which provides integrated processor and system
modelling and simulation solutions. In December 2004 the Group
acquired Artisan Components, Inc. (now known as ARM Physical IP , Inc.)
which provides physical IP components for the design and manufacture
of integrated circuits.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.
Dividends
The directors recommend a final dividend in respect of the year to
31 December 2004 of 0.42 pence per share which, subject to approval
at the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2005, will be paid on 6 May
2005 to shareholders on the register at 1 April 2005. This final dividend,
combined with the interim dividend of 0.28 pence per share paid
during the year, makes a total of 0.7 pence per share for the year
(2003: 0.6 pence).
Research and development (R&D)
R&D is of major importance and, as part of its research activities, the
Group collaborates closely with universities worldwide. Key areas of
product development for 2005 include the development of further low
power, high performance engines for both data and control applications,
such as the OptimoDE technology and ARM cores based on symmetric
multiprocessor and superscalar technology. In addition, improved security
is being developed through the TrustZone and SecurJC™ technologies.
The Group incurred R&D costs of £50.1 million in 2004, compared with
£48.1 million in 2003, which have been charged to the profit and loss
account. 
Donations
During the year the Group made donations for charitable purposes 
of £33,327 (2003: £42,486). The total amounts given for each such
purpose were:
Local Cambridge charities £7,919
Promotion of education £11,979
Wider understanding of science, maths 
and information technology £9,180
Medical research £3,478
Relief of poverty £771
The Group does not make any political donations. ARM employees are
encouraged to offer their time and expertise to help charities and other
groups in need. The Group operates a gift matching system for
employee fundraising.
Impact of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
During the year, the Group continued to consider the impact that
implementing IFRS in 2005 will have on its financial statements and
reporting functions. The project is ongoing and is well progressed, 
and the Group continually monitors the new announcements being made
by the IASB. The Group has performed analyses of the impact of the
current standards, and has accordingly begun to maintain its internal
financial reporting in 2005 in accordance with IFRS. The key areas 
which will affect the financial statements and accounting policies are
derivatives and financial instruments, revenue recognition, intangibles,
share-based payments, acquisition accounting and accounting for R&D
costs. The first results to be announced in accordance with IFRS will be
the Group’s interim statement for the six months to 30 June 2005.

of the Company.
Disabled persons
The Group has a strong demand for highly qualified staff and, as such,
disability is not seen to be an inhibitor to employment or career
development. In the event of any staff becoming disabled while with
the Group, their needs and abilities would be assessed and the Group
would, where possible, seek to offer alternative employment to them 
if they were no longer able to continue in their current role. 
Employee involvement
As the Group is an IP enterprise, it is vital that all levels of staff are
consulted and involved in its decision-making processes. To this end,
internal conferences and communications meetings are held regularly
which involve employees from all parts of the Group in discussions 
on future strategy and developments. Furthermore, employee share
ownership is encouraged and all staff are able to participate in one of
the Group’s schemes to encourage share ownership. The Group has an
informal and delegated organisational structure. It does not presently
operate any collective agreements with any trade unions.
Policy on payment of creditors
The Group’s policy is to pay suppliers before the end of the month
following receipt of the invoice, unless terms have been specifically
agreed in advance. This policy and any specific terms agreed with
suppliers are made known to the appropriate staff and to suppliers 
on request. Trade creditors of the Group at 31 December 2004 were
equivalent to 26 days’ purchases for the Group (2003: 23 days’) and 
nil days for the Company in both years. 
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM will be held at the Group’s offices in Cambridge, UK, on 
25 April 2005 at 2pm. A presentation will be made at this meeting
outlining recent developments in the business. The Group will convey
the results of proxy votes cast at the AGM. Shareholders are invited to
submit written questions in advance of the meeting. Questions should
be sent to The Secretary, ARM Holdings plc, 110 Fulbourn Road,
Cambridge CB1 9NJ.
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the
Group will be proposed at the AGM.
A separate notice of AGM and proxy card will be sent to all shareholders.

Directors’ report/UK GAAP/continued Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Group’s policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors including basic salary and
annual bonuses, the level and terms of grants of options and awards and the terms of any performance conditions to apply to the exercise of such
options and awards, pension rights and any compensation payments. Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate, the committee
will make recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management. The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the
preparation of the board’s annual report to shareholders on the Group’s policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the
directors’ remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority. 
The committee is chaired by Doug Dunn, and Peter Cawdron, John Scarisbrick and Jeremy Scudamore are members. The committee met three
times during 2004 and all meetings were attended by all the committee members, with the exception of the July and December meetings when
Jeremy Scudamore was unable to attend. Given their diverse experience, the four independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced
view with respect to remuneration issues for the Group. The committee has access to professional advice from external advisers, generally
appointed by Bill Parsons, the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such advice. During
2004, Linklaters, Watson Wyatt, Deloitte & Touche and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, have provided advice or services to the
committee. Linklaters provided legal services and Watson Wyatt provided pension advice to the Group during this period. The Chairman, the Chief
Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, normally attend for part of the remuneration committee meetings. No
director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Group’s directors seeks to give full consideration to the principles
set out in the Combined Code. The committee also monitors developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the management skills necessary
for it to remain a leader in its field. This policy seeks to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their
performance and align with the objectives of the Group, and comprise a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration.
The committee believes that a director’s total remuneration should seek to recognise his worth in the external market and, to this end, operates 
a policy of paying base salaries which are in line with the market median, as part of a total remuneration package which is upper quartile. The
committee believes that this is justified, recognising that more than 50% of total remuneration is performance-related. The committee obtains
information about the external market from various surveys, including the Watson Wyatt High Technology and Executive Reward Surveys and the
Deloitte & Touche Executive Directors Remuneration Survey.
The nature of the Group’s development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of short-term objectives with a high
level of variable remuneration. Currently, variable remuneration consists of three elements: annual cash bonus, discretionary share options and
conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan. All these incentives are performance-related and, as a result, more than half of each
executive director’s remuneration is targeted to be performance linked. Following a review of the Group’s variable remuneration structure, the
remuneration committee concluded that, in order to align better the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, and to ensure 
that these key individuals are appropriately incentivised to remain with the Group, a higher proportion of executive directors’ remuneration should
focus on longer-term objectives. As a result, in 2003 a shareholding guideline was introduced under which executive directors and certain senior
managers are required to build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years. The shareholdings may be built up of shares
received under the Company’s discretionary share option schemes and/or the Long Term Incentive Plan and, in the case of executive directors, 
the required holding is equivalent in value to 100% of basic salary.
Incentive arrangements
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group. There is a strong
bonus element to executive directors’ remuneration with a bonus of up to 50% of basic pay being available through the executive bonus plan 
if all targets are met. Payment of bonus is subject to the achievement of revenue and profit targets set by the remuneration committee, which 
are directly related to the Group’s financial results and ensure that the Group's short-term financial goals are met. Full bonuses are payable to
executive directors in respect of performance during 2004.
For the 2005 operation of the bonus plan, the targets set by the remuneration committee are for growth in dollar revenues between an agreed
range with the proviso that no bonus will be payable unless earnings per share exceed a defined target. If these targets are achieved, bonuses 
will be payable on a linear basis between the minimum and the maximum of the agreed range. Any over achievement of the stretching revenue
target will result in the percentage out-performance being applied to the bonus, for example if the revenue target is exceeded by 10% the bonus
will increase by 5%. Annual bonuses can be doubled under the deferred bonus plan if payment is deferred for three years, although there are no
outstanding elections to do so. Details of the deferred bonus plan are set out on page 33.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 27
Remuneration report/UK GAAP 28 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
The Group operates a number of share option plans and employees generally receive a number of share options according to their grade and
performance. Typically, share options are allocated to employees on an annual basis. Discretionary options (under the Approved, Unapproved and
Incentive Stock Option Schemes) are always issued at market value, while options issued under the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the
Savings-Related Share Option Plan are issued at a 15% discount to market value. In line with practice among the Group’s peers in the technology
sector, there are generally no performance conditions attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary options except for those issued to executive
directors where performance conditions based on real EPS apply to drive long-term profitability. Share options issued to executive directors prior 
to their appointment to the board of the Group do not have performance conditions attached to them. However, discretionary options issued to
executive directors after their appointment to the board of the Group will have performance conditions attached to them. Executive directors do
not currently receive options under the Approved Scheme and Incentive Stock Option Scheme. Under the Unapproved Scheme, share options with 
a value of up to five times base salary may be issued on the executive director joining the Group. In addition, discretionary options with a value 
of up to two times base salary may be issued each year. These discretionary options will vest after seven years, but may vest after three years
from grant if the performance conditions are satisfied. 
For options granted before January 2003, the performance condition is that the Group must achieve average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% 
(i.e. 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Prices Index) over a performance period of three years from the start of the
financial year in which the options were granted (the “performance period”). 
For options granted in 2003 under the performance condition, 50% of the shares under option will vest after three years if the Group achieves
average real EPS growth of 9.3% over the performance period. If average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% is achieved over the performance
period, 100% of the shares under option will vest after three years. Where the average real EPS growth over the performance period is between
9.3% and 33.1%, the number of shares which vest after three years increases on a straight-line basis. 
For options granted in 2004 and 2005 under the performance condition, 50% of the shares under option will vest after three years if the Group
achieves average real EPS growth of 12.5% over the performance period. If average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% is achieved over the
performance period, 100% of the shares under option will vest after three years. Where the average real EPS growth over the performance period
is between 12.5% and 33.1%, the number of shares which vest after three years increases on a straight-line basis.
The performance conditions applicable to the Long Term Incentive Plan are described in more detail below and are based on total shareholder
return (TSR), rather than EPS, providing the link to performance against an appropriate peer group.
These performance conditions were selected having regard to the position of the Group within its sector and the nature of the companies against
which it competes to attract and retain high-calibre employees. The Committee believes that the performance conditions represent the correct
balance between being motivational and challenging.
Pensions
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase scheme.
For the UK-based directors, the rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive’s basic salary (25% in the case of the Chairman) subject to the
Inland Revenue salary capping limits. For Mark Templeton (who is based in the US) the rate of Group contribution is 6% of his basic salary.
Service agreements
Executive directors have “rolling” service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one year’s notice. The service contracts also
terminate when executive directors reach age 65. With the exception of the Chairman, these agreements provide for each of the directors to
provide services to the Group on a full-time basis. The agreements contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following
termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group’s customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation
of the Group’s suppliers and employees. In addition, each service agreement contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the
Group’s trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in 
the course of their employment.
Remuneration report/UK GAAP/continued ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 29
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows:
Director Date
Sir Robin Saxby 31 January 1996
Warren East 29 January 2001
Tim Score 1 March 2002
Tudor Brown 3 April 1996
Mike Muller 31 January 1996
Mike Inglis 17 July 2002
Mark Templeton 18 November 2004
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion shall be
entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors
During 2004, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees each received a total fee of £29,000 per annum and the other non-
executive directors each received a total fee of £27,000 per annum. These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies 
of similar size and complexity, and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Group’s activities during
the year, which is around 10 to 15 working days a year. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the board and their term of
appointment is three years. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive
arrangements and their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits. No element of their fees is performance-related. The
options held by Lucio Lanza were granted during his service with Artisan and were rolled over into options over ARM shares under the terms 
of the acquisition.
Performance graphs
A performance graph showing the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) together with the TSR for the FTSE Global Technology Index of 
50 companies from 31 December 1999 is shown below. The TSR has been calculated in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. The TSR for the Company’s shares was -87% over this period compared with -67% for the FTSE Global Technology Index 
for the same period.
ARM share price performance against the FTSE Global Technology Index (£ sterling)
The directors consider the FTSE Global Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies from the US, Asia and Europe
and, therefore, reflects the global environment in which the Group operates. In addition, the Index includes many companies that are currently the
Group’s customers, as well as companies which use ARM technology in their end products.

Conditional awards will vest to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the
year of award, and no re-testing thereafter is possible. The performance conditions are based on the Company’s TSR when measured against that
of two comparator groups (each testing half of the shares comprised in the award). The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors (FTSE
250) and the second comprises predominantly US companies within the Hi Tech sector (FTSE Global Technology Index). For each comparator group,
the number of shares that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the shares if the Company’s TSR ranks in the upper decile, 50% will

Mike Inglis is a non-executive director of Superscape Group plc. The Group holds 12% of the issued share capital of Superscape Group plc and 
more details about this investment are included in note 13 on pages 49 to 50. In this capacity, Mike Inglis received remuneration totalling £15,000
up to 31 December 2004 and was awarded options over 20,000 shares in Superscape Group plc at an option price of 33 pence on 7 January 2004. 
The shares will vest in thirds over the next three years providing that performance targets are met. 
All the executive directors are accruing benefits under a money purchase pension scheme as a result of their services to the Group, contributions
for which were all paid during the year. 34 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the Company, and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are
required to:
l select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
l make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
l state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements; and
l prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will continue 
in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and Company and for ensuring that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Information published on the internet is accessible in many
countries with different legal requirements. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 35
We have audited the financial statements on pages 36 to 63 which have been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting
policies set out on pages 40 to 42. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, contained
in the directors’ remuneration report (“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors’
remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, 
has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Group has not kept proper accounting records, 
if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only ARM at a glance, the Chairman’s
statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations, the operating and financial review, directors and advisers, corporate governance,
corporate social responsibility, the directors’ report and the unaudited part of the remuneration report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s or Company’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company at 31 December 2004 and of the profit
and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended;
l the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
l those parts of the directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Consolidated cash flow statement/UK GAAP
For the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Principal accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in the UK. A summary 
of the more important accounting policies, which have been consistently applied and reviewed by the board of directors in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard (FRS) 18, “Accounting policies”, is set out below.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings made up to 31 December 2004. Intra-Group transactions and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired 
in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date they are acquired. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ assets and
liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill and intangible assets Purchased goodwill, being the difference between the fair value of consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired,
is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from it. Goodwill amortisation periods
are determined on a case-by-case basis (see note 11). Provision is made against the carrying value of goodwill where an impairment in value is deemed 
to have occurred. In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity is the market value of the equity at the date of completion, the fair
value of share options assumed is calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon whether
the directors believe any performance conditions will be met and thus whether any further consideration will become payable.
Licences and patents purchased for the use of technology are capitalised and amortised over the period in which the Group is expected to benefit from
them. These periods range from three to five years.
Where a technology agreement confers both retrospective and prospective rights, each element is valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The
retrospective element is charged to the profit and loss account immediately, whilst the prospective element is capitalised.
Trade investments Trade investments are initially recorded at cost. There is a regular review of the carrying value of investments, with reference to
relevant financial information and industry conditions; impairment charges are recorded if there is evidence of impairment in value to reduce the carrying
value of the investments to the market value of the shares held. If circumstances change such that the market value of the investment exceeds the carrying
value, the impairment charged is reversed.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at cost. Where an acquisition satisfies the provisions of sections 131 to 134 
of the Companies Act 1985 for merger relief, the investment is stated at the nominal value of shares issued plus the fair value of any other consideration.
Short- and long-term investments Bank deposits which are not repayable on demand are treated as short-term investments in accordance with FRS 1,
“Cash flow statements”. Movements in such investments are included under “management of liquid resources” in the Group’s cash flow statement. Money
market instruments are included within short-term investments at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Deposits and marketable securities with
maturity more than one year from the balance sheet date are shown as long-term marketable securities within fixed asset investments and are shown 
at cost less any provision for impairment.
Pension scheme arrangements The Group contributes to defined contribution plans, covering substantially all employees in Europe and the United States,
and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel. The Group contributes to these plans based upon
various fixed percentages of employee compensation, and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
Tangible fixed assets The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected
useful economic lives of the assets concerned. Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated from the date that they come into use. Costs
that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the prior period to the date that the
software is placed into operational use, are capitalised. External and internal costs are capitalised to the extent they enhance the future economic benefits 
of the business. The principal useful economic lives used for this purpose are:
Freehold buildings 25 years
Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter
Computers and software Three to five years
Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years
Motor vehicles Four years
Provision is made against the carrying value of tangible fixed assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments
are not made on such a basis.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport and
handling costs. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks.
40 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Notes to the financial statements/UK GAAP
  1 Principal accounting policies continued
Turnover The Group follows the principles of FRS 5 Application Note G in determining appropriate revenue recognition policies. In principle, therefore,
revenue is recognised to the extent that the Group has obtained the right to consideration through its performance. 
Turnover (excluding VAT) comprises the value of sales of licences, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensees’ ARM-based products, revenues from
support, maintenance and training, and consulting contracts and the sale of boards and software toolkits. Revenue from standard licence products which are
not modified to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised when the product is delivered and accepted by the customer.
Many licence agreements are for products which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer. Revenue from the sale of such licences
is recognised on a percentage-to-completion basis over the period from signing of the licence to customer acceptance. Under the percentage-to-completion
method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognised in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined. The
percentage-to-completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated
project requirement, which approximates to the extent of performance. 
Where invoicing milestones on licence arrangements are such that the proportion of work performed (calculated on the cost basis described above) 
is greater than the proportion of the total contract value which has been invoiced, the Group evaluates whether it has obtained, through its performance 
to date, the right to the uninvoiced consideration and therefore whether revenue should be recognised. In particular it considers:
l whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice will be raised in the expected timeframe, particularly where the invoicing milestone is in some way
dependent on customer activity;
l whether it has sufficient evidence that the customer considers that the Group’s contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled;
l whether there is sufficient certainty that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will indeed be incurred before the customer will accept that a future
invoice may be raised; and
l the extent to which previous experience with similar product groups and similar customers support the conclusions reached.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it has the right to consideration, taking into account these criteria, revenue is not
recognised until there is sufficient evidence that the Group has obtained the right to consideration for its performance under such arrangements. If the
amount of revenue recognised exceeds the amounts invoiced to customers, the excess amount is recorded as amounts recoverable on contracts 
within debtors.
Where agreements involve multiple elements, the entire fee from such arrangements has been allocated to each of the individual elements based on each
element’s fair value. Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value is determined by reference to licence agreements with other customers where
elements are sold separately.
Agreements including rights to unspecified products are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognised over
the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Group and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licences to the product. 
In those cases where the Group makes sales of these products, the total value of the licence is recorded as turnover and the amount payable to the
collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales. Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Group records as turnover the
commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
In addition to the licence fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post-contract support (support, maintenance and training) (PCS) which
consists of an identified customer contact at the Group and telephonic or e-mail support. Fees for post-contract support which take place after customer
acceptance are specified in the contract. Revenue related to PCS is recognised based on VSOE, which is determined with reference to contractual renewal
rates, or, if none are specified, by reference to the rates actually charged on renewal PCS arrangements for the same level of support and for the same 
or similar technologies. Revenue for PCS is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed 
by the Group with the licensee.
The excess of licence fees and PCS invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred income.
Sales of software, including development systems, which are not specifically designed for a given licence (such as off-the-shelf software) are recognised
upon delivery. At that time, the Group has no further obligations except that, where necessary, the costs associated with providing post-contract support
have been accrued. Services (such as training) that the Group provides which are not essential to the functionality of the IP are separately stated and priced
in the contract and, therefore, accounted for separately. Revenue is recognised as services are performed and collectability is probable.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Group’s customers of products containing ARM technology. Revenues are recognised when ARM receives
notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenue from consulting is recognised when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been
fulfilled. For larger consulting projects containing several project milestones, revenue is recognised on a percentage-to-completion basis as milestones are
achieved. Consulting costs are recognised when incurred.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 41 1 Principal accounting policies continued
As disclosed above, in accordance with FRS 18, “Accounting policies”, the Group makes significant estimates in applying its revenue recognition policies. 
In particular, as discussed in detail above, estimates are made in relation to the use of the percentage-to-completion accounting method, which requires
that the extent of progress toward completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty. The use of the percentage-to-completion method 
is itself based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, customer acceptance is not uncertain. In addition, when allocating revenue 
to various elements of multi-element arrangements, it is assumed that the fair value of each element is reflected by its price when sold separately. The
complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition
policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. If different assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported
in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation, using full provision accounting when an event has taken place by the balance sheet date which
gives rise to an increased or reduced tax liability in the future, in accordance with FRS 19, “Deferred taxation”. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currency The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. Profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the monthly exchange rates during the year. Differences 
on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies are taken to reserves and reported in the statement of
Group total recognised gains and losses.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences have
been included in operating profit.
Financial instruments The Group attempts to reduce its foreign currency exposure by entering into forward contracts to sell US dollars and buy sterling. 
The Group accounts for these instruments by revaluing the financial instruments and the associated trade debtors and cash at the year-end rate. The
resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to the profit and loss account for the year.
Research and development All research and development expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Share schemes The Group’s Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (QUEST) are separately administered
trusts which are funded by loans (the ESOP) and loans and gifts (the QUEST) from the Group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company. 
In accordance with UITF 38 “Accounting for ESOP Trusts”, the Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP and the QUEST in its own accounts
and shares held by the trusts are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to
employees (see note 21).
In accordance with the requirements of UITF 17, “Employee share schemes”, a charge is made in the profit and loss account representing the fair value at
the date of grant of shares awarded under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan. As the award is conditional on certain performance conditions being met,
this is reflected in the number of shares on which the charge is calculated. A similar charge arises on the difference between the market value of ARM's
shares and the exercise price of certain options issued as part of the consideration for a business acquisition. The charge is credited back to reserves.
The Company operates a Save As You Earn scheme together with a similar scheme for US employees that allows the grant of share options at a discount 
to the market price at the date of grant. The Company has made use of the exemption under UITF 17 not to recognise any compensation charge in respect
of these options.
Employer’s National Insurance and similar taxes arise on the exercise of certain share options. In accordance with UITF 25, “National Insurance contributions
on share option gains”, a provision is made, calculated using the market price of the Company’s shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting
period of the options.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to the profit and loss account to match the projects’ related expenditure.
Provision for doubtful debts Provision is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.

Included within the amount recognised for losses carried forward is an amount of £6,385,000 (2003: £nil) that is expected to be charged to the profit and
loss account after more than one year.
No provision is made for taxation liabilities which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiaries because there is no intention 
in the foreseeable future that such profits will be remitted. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for the amounts unprovided because of the uncertainty of utilising these losses in the future.
The Company has no potential liability for deferred taxation.
8 Profit for the financial year
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent company’s profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
The parent company’s profit after taxation, including dividends receivable and before dividends payable was £17,279,000 (2003: £10,546,000).

The ESOP trust has waived its right to receive dividends of over 0.01 pence per share, and the QUEST has waived its right to receive any dividends. As such,
dividends will not be payable on the 5,713,034 shares currently held within these trusts.
10  Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the QUEST which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary
shares. The Company had two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares during the year, being those share options granted to employees and directors
where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under
the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). For 2004, no shares that have been allocated for awards under the LTIP have been included in the diluted EPS
calculation as the performance criteria cannot be measured until the conclusion of the performance period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

Listed investments The Group owns a 12% holding in Superscape Group plc, the cost and market value of which as at 31 December 2004 were £2,652,000
and £8,795,000 respectively (2003: £2,652,000 and £4,139,000 respectively). The investment was made in order to broaden the scope of the Group’s
collaboration with Superscape Group plc in the area of 3D technology for wireless devices. In addition, the Group owns a less than 1% holding in CSR plc, 
a company that develops Bluetooth solutions that listed during the year and was owned prior to that listing. The cost and market value of this investment as
at 31 December 2004 were £688,000 (2003: £688,000) and £1,467,000 respectively. There was no readily available market value for CSR plc at 31 December
2003 as the company was an unlisted private company at that time. On flotation, the impairment provision previously booked against this investment was
released, as the flotation price exceeded original cost to the Group and the previous carrying value of the investment. Therefore the total market value of
listed investments held at 31 December 2004 was £10,262,000 (2003: £4,139,000).
Long-term marketable securities This includes all money market deposits and investments (including US government notes and bonds, corporate notes
and bonds and commercial paper) with maturity dates exceeding one year from the balance sheet date.

50 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Notes to the financial statements/UK GAAP/continued 18  Financial instruments
Use of financial instruments – general The Group has three primary objectives in its use of financial instruments, namely the management of foreign
exchange risk, the maximisation of returns on funds held on deposit and the use of strategic trade investments in companies in order to further establish
the ARM architecture. These are managed, respectively, through the use of hedging strategies (primarily forward contracts), money market instruments and
an ongoing process of assessing potential trade investments and current holdings. 
To meet these objectives the Group has used the policies described below which have been applied throughout the current year. On 23 December 2004, the
Group acquired Artisan Components Inc., a company based in the US, who held significant US dollar cash and debtor balances. Most of the policies detailed
below, except where noted, applied for the legacy ARM business prior to the acquisition, and reference to year-end amounts will include Artisan balances.
The harmonisation of the legacy businesses’ treasury policies is ongoing.
Management of foreign exchange risk The Group’s earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in
respect of the US dollar, reflecting the fact that most of its revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while the majority of its costs are
settled in sterling (the proportion of US dollar denominated costs for the Group going forward after the acquisition of Artisan increases from approximately
25% to approximately 45%). The Group seeks to use forward contracts to manage the US dollar/sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing 
and value of anticipated US dollar receipts (which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals and royalty receipts) in comparison with its
requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars. The Group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using forward
contracts for the sale of US dollars as appropriate. Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US dollar
cash receipts. As the timing of large cash receipts cannot be predicted with certainty, the Group enters into forward contracts which allow exercise between
two dates, typically between three and four months from the invoice date. In those cases where customers settle debts before the expiry of the foreign
exchange contract, the Group evaluates whether money market rates available for US dollar investments exceed those for sterling investments. It then seeks
to maximise its returns by remitting US dollars against forward contracts at the beginning or end of the exercise period, depending on the prevailing money
market rates for US dollars and sterling at the time. 
At 31 December 2004 the Group had outstanding forward contracts to sell $50,000,000 (2003: $44,000,000). The Group had $56,205,000 
(2003: $28,591,000) of trade debtors denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar cash balances and short-term investments of $176,464,000
(2003: $26,340,000). Thus 79% (2003: 20%) of the Group’s US dollar current assets were not hedged by matching forward contracts at the year end. 
This has increased in the year due to the acquisition of Artisan which holds significant debtor and cash balances in US dollars.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro. The Group is also required to settle certain expenses 
in euros, primarily in its French, Belgian and German subsidiaries, and as the net amounts involved are not considered significant, the Group does not take
out euro forward contracts.
The Group, where required, invests profits in the subsidiary in which they were earned. The Group does not hedge any foreign net asset investment using
foreign currency loans, as there is currently no requirement for external borrowings.
The Group considers the use of other financial instruments such as currency options but did not enter into any agreements during the year.
Maximisation of return on funds held on deposit The Group’s earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates available on bank deposits. It aims 
to maximise returns from funds held on deposit and uses money market deposits with major financial institutions to do so. Recent maturities during the
year have been up to six months in length (although post-acquisition of Artisan there are some deposits with maturities of up to two years), but this varies
since close consideration is given to the UK and US money market yield curves before contracts are closed. 
Trade investments Investment activity is intended to create long-term strategic alliances with development companies, some of which may be unlisted 
at the time of the investment decision. As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future market for these securities or that the value of such
investments will rise, the directors evaluate each investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARM’s funds. The directors review holdings in such
companies on a regular basis to determine whether continued investment is in the best interests of the Group. Funds for such ventures are strictly limited 
in order that the financial effect of any potential decline in the value of investments would not be substantial in the context of the Group’s financial results. 
The Group holds investments in two listed companies: a 12% holding in Superscape Group plc and a less than 1% holding in CSR plc. The Group holds
investments in five private companies: Pixim, Inc., CoWare, Inc., Palmchip Corporation, Zeevo Inc. and Reciva Limited, which all develop products based 
on ARM technology.
External borrowings At 31 December 2004, the Group owed $3.3 million (£1,732,000) (2003: £nil) extending beyond one year but less than two years
from the balance sheet date being the final payment of a technology license agreement signed in the year. No interest is payable under this arrangement.
The Group had no undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2004 (2003: £nil) or during the financial year. 
Numerical disclosures Numerical disclosures are set out in the tables below. Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following
disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures. These balances are as of 31 December in each year, and the 2004 amounts may not be reflective of the
typical profile of the Group throughout the year due to the significant impact of Artisan balances on the figures at the year end.

The fixed-rate cash and short-term investments in sterling and US dollars were placed with banks for between one week and one year and earn interest 
of between 1.00% and 4.88% (2003: 0.98% and 4.00%). Long-term marketable securities were placed for up to two years and earn interest of between
1.70% and 2.21%. Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalents.
Financial liabilities Provisions for National Insurance and similar taxes of £27,000 (2003: £63,000) are financial liabilities in sterling on which no interest 
is paid. Maturity depends on when certain share options are exercised.
Fair values of financial instruments
Cash and short-term investments The carrying amount approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Long-term investments There is a readily available market for these investments. They are carried at cost unless the market value falls below cost in which
case an impairment charge is made. At 31 December 2004, the fair value approximates to carrying value.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates. The fair value of forward
contracts is estimated at £1,674,000 at 31 December 2004 (2003: £2,015,000). The decrease is due to the number and relative exchange rates of contracts
outstanding compared to 2003.
Investments in unlisted companies Those companies in which ARM has invested are early-stage development enterprises, which are generating value 
for shareholders through research and development activities, and most do not currently report profits. The directors do not consider it possible to estimate
with precision the fair value of the Group’s investments in unlisted companies (carrying value at 31 December 2004: £1,973,000) as they are, by definition,
not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities. However, based on recent fundraising transactions by these companies and, where
possible, following review of relevant financial information prepared by the companies, the directors are of the opinion that the fair value of these
investments approximates to carrying value.
Investments in listed companies The fair value of listed investments is determined with reference to prices quoted on the London Stock Exchange 
at 31 December 2004. On this basis, the fair value of the Group’s listed investments were £10,262,000 at 31 December 2004 (2003: £4,139,000).
Long-term accruals The carrying amount of £1,732,000 approximates to fair value as the effect of discounting to present value is not considered material.
Provisions The carrying amount of £27,000 approximates to fair value as this is the amount which would be payable if the liability had crystallized at the
balance sheet date.

Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan (the “Executive Scheme”), the Company may grant options to directors and employees
meeting certain eligibility requirements. Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time
the options expire.
Under the Company’s Unapproved Scheme (the “Unapproved Scheme”), for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are
exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire. The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially
the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue. Under both of these
schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary,
100% maximum on fourth anniversary. Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met
are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are further schemes for our French and Belgian employees (the “French Scheme” and the “Belgian Scheme”). In the French Scheme, options are
exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third
anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.

Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition. The schemes remained substantially 
the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc. 
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement. The schemes assumed were the
"1993 Plan", the "1997 Plan", the "2000 Plan", the "2003 Plan", the "Director Plan", the "Executive Plan" and the "ND00 Plan".
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods. The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most
common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years. Some options vest on
a monthly basis, and some vest over five years. All options lapse ten years from the date of grant. 
The Group also operates savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Group ("SAYE"). The number of options
granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee. The period of savings is either three or five years, except under the US scheme where 
the period is two years. The option price is normally 85% of the market share price at grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month
period once the savings have been completed, except for the US scheme where the right to exercise only arises for a three-month period.
Under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan, a further 5,003,724 shares could be awarded to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over 
a three-year period as detailed in the remuneration report. These shares will be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and QUEST.

total of 90.4 million options with an exercise price of between 6 pence and 107 pence were granted with fair values of between 61 pence and 104 pence
valued using the Black Scholes valuation model.
Own shares held Offset in the profit and loss reserve is an amount of £7,485,000 representing the cost of own shares held. This balance consists of own
shares held by the Group’s ESOP and QUEST.
Own shares held include £1,438,000 (2003: £1,438,000), being the cost of 5,000,000 (2003: 5,000,000) shares in the Company held by the Group’s ESOP .
The trust was set up in 1998 and purchased shares at the time of the Company’s flotation using funds provided by the Company. Conditional awards 
under the Group’s LTIP have been granted over these shares at 31 December 2004 but no awards have been made since the trust was created. As at 
31 December 2004 and 2003, the trust held 5,000,000 shares (nominal value £2,500) with a market value of £5,525,000 at 31 December 2004 (2003:
£6,425,000). All costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the profit and loss account as they accrue and the trust has waived the right to receive
dividends of over and above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held.

*The contingent consideration will be determined using various stepped criteria based on Axys' revenue bookings to new customers in the first year post-acquisition. The amount varies from $nil to a maximum
of $3 million.
The book value of the assets and liabilities have been taken from the management accounts of each company at the date of acquisition at actual exchange
rates on that date. Adjustments were made to the Artisan intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities to adjust its balance sheet to UK GAAP .
The fair value of options granted on the acquisition of Artisan were calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model with volatility of between 80% and
94%, an average risk-free interest rate of 4.5%, an estimated life of between zero and six years, and a dividend yield of 0.7%.
There were no fair value adjustments for Axys as the fair value of assets and liabilities were deemed to equate to book value.

In May 2002, Nazomi Communications Inc. filed suit against ARM alleging wilful infringement of Nazomi’s US patent No. 6,332,215. ARM answered
Nazomi’s complaint in July 2002, denying infringement. ARM moved for summary judgement and a ruling that the accused technology does not infringe. 
In September 2003, the United States District Court of Northern California granted ARM’s motion, holding that the accused technology does not infringe
Nazomi's patent. Nazomi appealed the District Court’s ruling. On 7 September 2004, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the appeal and the
decision of the Court is expected in the first half of 2005. Based on legal advice received to date, ARM has no cause to believe that the effect of the original
ruling by the District Court will not be upheld.

32 Summary of significant differences between United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP) followed by the Group 
and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP)
The financial information set out in this report has been prepared under UK GAAP which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP . The principal
differences between the Group’s accounting policies under UK GAAP and those that would have been followed had the financial information been prepared
under US GAAP are set out below.
Goodwill Under UK GAAP , goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from it. This was
also the Group’s accounting policy under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, on which date, following the provisions of SFAS 142, “Goodwill and other
intangible assets”, the carrying value of goodwill was frozen and became subject to annual impairment reviews. No write-offs of goodwill have arisen as a
result of the Group’s initial or annual impairment reviews.
Amortisation of intangibles Under UK GAAP , intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination are included within the goodwill balance unless
the asset can be identified and sold separately without disposing of the business as a whole. Under US GAAP , such intangible assets may meet the criteria
set out in SFAS 142, “Goodwill and other intangible assets“, for categorisation as intangible assets other than goodwill and are amortised over their useful
economic lives. A deferred tax liability arises on the intangible assets, and is credited to the profit and loss account proportionately to the amortisation on
the related intangible assets. Under US GAAP , payments made to purchase intangible assets that are still in development are charged directly to the profit
and loss account. Thus differences arise in the amounts of goodwill recognised, the associated amortisation charge and the associated deferred tax liability
and income statement credit.
Valuation of consideration on business combination Under both US and UK GAAP , the fair value of consideration in a business combination includes the
fair value of both equity issued and any share options granted as part of that combination, which are then used in the goodwill calculation. Under UK GAAP ,
any equity issued is valued at the fair value as of the date of completion, whilst under US GAAP , the equity is valued at the date the terms of the
combination were agreed to and announced. For options, under US GAAP , the fair value is based upon the total number of options granted, both vested and
unvested, whilst under UK GAAP the fair value only includes those that have vested, together with a pro-rata value for partially vested options. Furthermore,
where there is contingent consideration for an acquisition, under UK GAAP this is recognised as part of the purchase consideration if the contingent
conditions are expected to be satisfied, whilst under US GAAP it is only recognised if the conditions have actually been met.
Deferred stock-based compensation Under US GAAP , the intrinsic value of unvested stock options issued by an acquirer as part of a business combination
in exchange for unvested share options of the acquiree is recorded as a debit balance within shareholders’ funds. This amount is charged to the profit and
loss account over the vesting period of the share options in accordance with FIN 28. Under UK GAAP , no such adjustment to shareholders’ funds is made on
acquisition. Although the same charge as under US GAAP is subsequently made to the profit and loss account, it is written back through reserves.
Fair values of assets and liabilities acquired The conventions under which the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business
combination is determined differ between UK and US GAAP , eg. in relation to the valuation of deferred revenue and related costs. 
Marketable securities Under US GAAP , investments in available-for-sale securities are marked to market where the market value is readily determinable
and gains and losses, net of deferred taxation, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Where an impairment is considered to be other than
temporary, the security is written down through the profit and loss account to a new cost basis represented by the fair value of the security on the date the
impairment was determined. Under UK GAAP , the Group’s accounting policy is to carry such investments at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Under UK GAAP , the fair value of the shares awarded under the LTIP is charged to compensation cost over the period in respect
of which performance conditions apply. To the extent the award is adjusted by virtue of performance conditions being met or not, the compensation cost is
adjusted in line with this. Under US GAAP , the Group follows variable plan accounting for these grants, measuring compensation expense as the difference
between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at each period end over the vesting period of the options. Increases in fair market value
of the shares result in a charge and decreases in fair market value of the shares result in a credit, subject to the cumulative amount previously expensed. 
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 61 32 Summary of significant differences between United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP) followed by the Group 
and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) continued
Save As You Earn (SAYE) plans Under UK GAAP , the Group has taken advantage of the exemption provided by UITF 17, “Employee share schemes”, not 
to recognise any compensation charge in respect of options granted under SAYE plans. Under US GAAP , the Group follows the requirements of EITF 00-23,
which does not permit such an exemption in respect of plans where the savings period is in excess of 27 months, as is the case with the Group’s Inland
Revenue approved UK SAYE plans. EITF 00-23 applies only to new offers made since 24 January 2002. The compensation charge made under US GAAP is
calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straight-
line basis over the savings period. In addition, certain options attract a charge under variable plan accounting under US GAAP .
Employer taxes on share options Under UK GAAP , employer’s taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are provided for over the vesting
period of the options. Under US GAAP such taxes are accounted for when the options are exercised.
Tax on UK and US share options In the US, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount treated as compensation under US tax rules for certain
employee share options, which have been exercised during the year. Similarly, in the UK, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the profit made by
employees on certain options that have been exercised during the year. In both cases, the amount is equivalent to the difference between the option
exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise. Under UK GAAP the tax benefit arising from this deduction is included in the
tax charge in the profit and loss account whilst under US GAAP , the tax benefit is recorded as an increase in shareholders’ funds.
Embedded derivatives Under US GAAP , where the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency that is neither the functional currency of the
Group nor the functional currency of the customer and where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, such derivatives are carried at fair value. The
resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Embedded derivatives are not revalued to fair value under UK GAAP .
Cash and cash equivalents Under UK GAAP , cash does not include short-term deposits and investments which cannot be withdrawn without notice and
without incurring a penalty. Such items are shown as short-term investments. Under US GAAP , deposits with a maturity of less than three months at
inception which are convertible into known amounts of cash are included as cash and cash equivalents. Deposits with a maturity at inception of between
three months and one year are shown as short-term investments.
Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared under UK GAAP presents substantially the same information as
that required under US GAAP . 
Under UK GAAP cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure
and financial investments, acquisitions and disposals, management of liquid resources and financing activities. US GAAP , however, requires only three
categories of cash flow activity to be reported: operating, investing and financing. Cash flows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of
finance shown under UK GAAP are included as operating activities under US GAAP .
Dividends payable Under UK GAAP , dividends declared after the period end are recorded in the period to which they relate. Under US GAAP , they are
recorded in the period in which they are declared.

Selected consolidated financial data/US GAAP
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The matters addressed in this operating
and financial review and prospects, with the exception of the historical information presented, contain forward-looking statements involving risks and
uncertainties.
Overview ARM designs high-performance, low-cost, power-efficient reduced instruction set computing (RISC) microprocessors and related technology and
software, and licenses this IP to semiconductor companies which, in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs) and application-specific standard products (ASSPs) based on the ARM architecture to systems companies. ARM also licenses and sells
development systems directly to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other system
designers. ARM has developed an innovative, intellectual-property centred and market-driven business model in which it neither manufactures nor sells the
products incorporating ARM technology, but concentrates on the research and development, design and support of the ARM architecture and supporting
development tools and software.
Market conditions After strong year-on-year growth for the semiconductor industry in 2004, current expectations for 2005 are that there will be little or no
growth over 2004. Despite this likely flatter trading environment, we expect 2005 to be a year of growth in dollar revenues for the Company.
Both the former ARM and Artisan stand-alone businesses enter 2005 with healthy order backlogs and sales pipelines which will underpin licensing revenues
in 2005. In addition, both companies continue to enjoy good momentum in royalty revenues based on the increasing adoption of ARM and Artisan
technology by semiconductor and OEM companies in recent years. The healthy order backlog and sales pipeline and strong momentum in royalty revenues
gives confidence that dollar revenues in both underlying businesses are capable of growing in 2005.
The Company remains exposed to any further weakening in the US dollar against sterling given that more than 90% of total Company revenues are earned
in US dollars. Following the acquisition of Artisan, approximately 45% of the Company’s cost base will be incurred in US dollars, compared to approximately
25% for ARM prior to the acquisition of Artisan.
The Company has been profitable and robustly cash generative (before investing activities), with net cash inflows from operating activities of £46.5 million,
giving rise to a year-end cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balance of £142.8 million.
The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the Company’s consolidated
statements of income.

Total revenues Total revenues were £152.9 million in 2004, an increase of 19% from £128.1 million in 2003, which was a 15% decrease from £150.9
million in 2002. Revenues, expressed in dollars using applicable exchange rates for invoicing in currencies other than dollars, were $272.4 million in 2004,
an increase of 32% over the $206.5 million in 2003. The actual average dollar exchange rate in 2004 was $1.83 (compared with the effective average rate
for ARM of $1.78) compared with $1.64 in 2003. This had the effect of reducing total reported revenues by approximately £13.2 million.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 65
Operating and financial review and prospects/US GAAP Product revenues Product revenues consist of license fees, sales of development systems and royalties. Product revenues for 2002, 2003 and 2004 were
£132.9 million, £113.0 million and £138.7 million, representing 88%, 88% and 91% of total revenues respectively.
License revenues decreased from £83.0 million in 2002 to £50.8 million in 2003, and then increased to £59.4 million in 2004 representing approximately
55%, 40% and 39% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. 
Licensing activity in 2004 demonstrated both the breadth of ARM's technology offer as well as the longevity of the products. Our partners have now been
licensing products in the ARM7 family for more than 11 years, including an incremental 15 ARM7 licenses in 2004 and accounting for 9% of licensing revenues
in 2004, compared with 18% in 2003 and 15% in 2002. There have been 31 new licenses for ARM9 products in 2004. Revenues from the ARM9 family have
declined though, accounting for 43% of licensing revenues in 2002, 31% in 2003 and 23% in 2004. Although these proportions for ARM7 and ARM9 have
fallen in 2004, we expect to see the licensing of both families of products for some time, demonstrating the relevance of having leading-edge technology 
at all performance points in the embedded microprocessor space. There are a growing number of cores available to license from the Company, including four
products in the ARM11 family, offering many new security and power management features and OptimoDE™, the embedded signal processing technology
discussed below. The Company has also signed initial partners for the next generation of ARM technologies, currently known as "Tiger" and "ServalE". 
65 new licenses were signed in 2004 (compared to 51 in 2003) comprising 31 multi-use licenses and 34 per-use licenses. 15 of these licenses were for
ARM11 products bringing the total number of ARM11 licenses signed to date to 25. ARM11 accounted for 17% of licensing revenue in 2004, compared 
to 10% in 2003 and 5% in 2002. 15 companies became new ARM partners during 2004 bringing the total number to 140 at the end of 2004. This total
number of semiconductor partners was net of those companies that have signed licenses with ARM in the past but have since been acquired by other
companies or who no longer have access to ARM technology for other reasons.
A significant proportion of licensing was to existing partners taking licenses to new core families not previously licensed or derivatives of cores already
licensed. The sale of non-core licenses, covering items such as platforms, peripherals, embedded trace modules, models, and sub-systems, increased in
2004 to £10.5 million from £8.9 million in 2003 and down from £12.6 million in 2002 representing approximately 18% of license revenues in 2004, 
18% in 2003 and 15% in 2002.
An embedded software group within ARM was established in 2004 in order to capitalize on opportunities to generate revenue from software. This group is
intended to drive growth in embedded software revenue, build on the strong foundation of the existing Java, Intelligent Energy Manager, TrustZone and Swerve
product families and bring more focus to the development of enabling software technology to support further growth of licensing, development systems
and data engines revenues. An example of the initiatives being undertaken by this unit is the announcement in 2004 of the development by ARM and Trusted
Logic, the embedded systems security experts, of a new TrustZone technology optimized software solution to increase security for the mobile industry. ARM
expects the new software to increase electronic transaction security on ARM Powered® mobile phones, set-top boxes and other consumer devices.
Following the acquisition of Adelante Technologies N.V., now ARM Belgium N.V., in July 2003, ARM formally announced the launch of its OptimoDE embedded
signal processing technology at the Embedded Processor Forum in May 2004. ARM has introduced this technology to address the processing requirements 
of very data intensive consumer applications which are often outstripping the capabilities of general-purpose digital signal processors. The OptimoDE product,
which comprises a configurable data engine (signal processor) together with related intellectual property and tools, will be deployed in systems alongside
existing ARM microprocessor cores and other ARM technology, including the Axys electronic system level design tools, acquired in August 2004.
Revenues from the sale of development systems decreased from £23.1 million in 2002 to £17.9 million in 2003, but increased to £19.7 million in 2004
representing approximately 15%, 14% and 13% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. The majority of ARM’s sales of development systems
are in US dollars and the US dollar value of sales of development systems in 2003 was approximately 16% lower than in 2002, but was 24% higher in 2004
compared to 2003. Sales of development systems continued to be affected by increased competition in the debug tools marketplace. The new management
team and increased resources assigned to assist the development of the development systems business have continued to yield improvements in results
through 2004 and this is expected to continue into 2005.
In August 2004, ARM added electronic system level (ESL) expertise to its RealView® design tools portfolio with the announcement of the acquisition of Axys
Design Automation, Inc., a provider of fast, accurate, integrated processor and system modelling and simulation solutions. Axys’ ESL products reduce overall
system costs by allowing designs to be modelled early in the development cycle, decreasing time-to-market and minimizing design errors.
Royalties are either set as a percentage of the licensee’s net sales price per chip or, less frequently, as a fixed amount and are recognized when the Company
receives notification from the customer of product sales. In effect, this means that it is normally in the quarter following the shipments that data is received
and so royalty data for a year reflects actual shipments made from the beginning of October of the previous year to the end of September of the current
year. Royalties increased from £26.8 million in 2002 to £44.3 million in 2003, and increased further to £59.6 million in 2004, representing 18%, 34% and
39% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. Volume shipments increased from 456 million units in 2002 to 782 million units in 2003, mainly
due to increased production of a wide range of electronic devices, including wireless handsets, secure products and automotive products. Unit shipments 
in 2004 were 1,272 million, with the increase in volumes coming from all market segments, especially consumer entertainment and storage products. 
The Company has become less reliant on the wireless sector with more than 400 million non-wireless units being shipped in the year. The Company expects
the trend of increasing proportions of unit shipments into the non-wireless markets to continue into 2005. The Company expects royalty revenues to grow
year on year although they may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter. The total number of partners shipping ARM technology-based
product at the end of 2004 was 60 after taking into account corporate activity within the ARM partnership.
Service revenues Service revenues consist of design consulting services and revenues from support, maintenance and training. Service revenues decreased
from £18.0 million in 2002 to £15.1 million in 2003 to £14.2 million in 2004, representing 12%, 12% and 9% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004
respectively. Consulting revenues decreased from £4.4 million in 2002 to £2.4 million in 2003 and £2.1 million in 2004, as engineering resource was
directed away from consulting projects to research and development activities. Revenues from support, maintenance and training decreased from £13.6
million in 2002 to £12.7 million in 2003 and £12.1 million in 2004. Actual US dollar revenues increased by 3% from 2003 to 2004 but this has been offset
by the weakening of the dollar against sterling in 2004. 
66 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Operating and financial review and prospects /US GAAP/continued Geographic analysis Operating in a global environment, the geographic destinations of the Company’s revenues fluctuate from period to period depending
upon the country of origin of its customers. The pattern of revenues in 2004 was 51% of revenues coming from the US, 21% from Japan, 13% from Asia
Pacific, excluding Japan, and 15% from Europe. In 2003, revenues from the US represented 51%, Japan 19%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 12%, and Europe
18%. In 2002, revenues from the US represented 44%, Japan 25%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 13%, and Europe 18%. 
Product costs Product costs are limited to variable costs of production such as the costs of manufacture of development systems, amortization of our third-
party technology licenses and cross-license payments to collaborative partners. Product costs were £6.5 million in 2002, £6.2 million in 2003 and £6.7 million
in 2004 representing 4%, 5% and 4% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. Approximately two-thirds of total product cost of sales were
made up of development systems costs in 2004, with the balance comprising additional costs related to the costs of third-party licenses and cross-license
payments to collaborative partners. This is comparable to the level in both 2002 and 2003, with the balance being costs associated with third-party licenses.
Product gross margin in 2004 was 95%, compared to 95% in 2003 and 95% in 2002. The Company does not currently expect a significant increase in
product costs in 2005, although this would be subject to significant fluctuations if management were obliged to port further operating systems to run on the
ARM architecture.
Service costs Service costs include the costs of support and maintenance services to licensees of ARM technology as well as the costs directly attributable to
consulting work performed for third parties. Cost of services decreased from approximately £6.7 million in 2002 to £4.9 million in 2003 and was £5.1 million
in 2004. The gross margins earned on service revenues were approximately 63% in 2002, 68% in 2003 and 64% in 2004. In 2003 and 2004, the Company
elected to allocate more engineering resource to research and development activities, thus enabling the Company to develop more innovative products and
technologies during the year.
Research and development costs Research and development costs increased from £47.3 million in 2002 to £48.1 million in 2003 and £50.1 million in
2004, representing 31%, 38% and 33% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. Continued investment in research and development remains
an essential part of the Company’s strategy since the development of new products to license is key to its ongoing success. 
Total engineering headcount increased from 420 at the end of 2002 to 442 at the end of 2003, and was 739 at the end of 2004. The increase in 2003 was
predominantly due to the acquisition of ARM Belgium N.V., whilst the increase in 2004 was due to the acquisitions of both Artisan and Axys as well as some
growth within the existing business.
Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenditure decreased from £24.7 million in 2002 to £23.0 million in 2003 and was £23.9 million in 2004,
representing 16% of total revenues in 2002, 18% in 2003, and 16% in 2004. Headcount in this area decreased from 208 at 31 December 2002 to 203 
at 31 December 2003 and was 282 at the end of 2004. Most of the growth in 2004 has come from acquisitions but there has also been organic growth
with new offices opening in Bangalore, India and Beijing, PR China. The total number of sales offices is currently 19 and this enables improved contact with
the Company’s geographically diverse customer base. 
General and administrative General and administrative headcount at 31 December 2004 was 150, up from 95 at the end of 2003 and 93 at the end 
of 2002. Again, the majority of the increase in 2004 has come from acquisitions. General and administrative costs were £22.5 million in 2002 and increased
to £28.7 million in 2003 and £31.3 million in 2004, representing 15%, 22% and 20% of total revenues respectively. Costs in 2003 included £1.6 million of
impairments made to investments (2002: £0.8 million, 2004: £nil). Legal costs fluctuated from £2.5 million in 2002 to £9.1 million in 2003 and £5.1 million
in 2004, largely as a result of annual variations in the amount of legal expenses relating to patent protection cases and other similar costs. The primary
reason for the increase in legal costs from 2002 to 2003 was the provision in 2003 for settlement of the Herodion arbitration which was paid early in 2004.
£4.5 million of the costs in 2004 related to a technology license agreement signed in the year. Expense in relation to provisions for doubtful debts was 
£1.4 million in 2002, a release of £0.1 million in 2003 and a further release of £0.1 million in 2004. Unrealized future foreign exchange losses on certain
committed but not yet invoiced future revenue streams of £0.7 million (2003: £1.1 million; 2002: £1.0 million) were recorded in accordance with SFAS 133.
There was a gain on foreign exchange of £0.5 million in 2002, a gain of £0.9 million in 2003 and a loss of £1.5 million in 2004. See “foreign currency
fluctuations” below.
In-process research and development During 2004, the Company purchased Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. (now ARM Physical
IP Inc.). Those intangible assets that were still in development (known as in-process research and development) were charged directly to the income
statement, amounting to £0.4 million and £3.2 million for Axys and Artisan respectively.
Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets Various licenses to use third-party technology have been signed over the past several years, with their
values being capitalized and amortized over the useful economic period that the Company is expected to gain benefit from them (generally between three
and five years). In addition to the three licenses purchased in 2000, 2001 and 2002, two licenses were purchased in 2003 totalling £0.7 million and a
further license purchased in 2004 for £0.2 million. Amortization of these licenses amounted to £0.5 million in 2004 (2003: £1.2 million; 2002: £1.1 million).
Following the out-of-court settlement of the Company’s litigation against picoTurbo, Inc. in December 2001, picoTurbo assigned its intellectual property rights
to the Company for a payment of £7.5 million. This is being amortized over four years and £1.5 million was charged to the income statement in 2002, £2.0
million in 2003 and £2.0 million in 2004.
The Company also purchased a patent for £0.7 million in 2002 which is being amortized over five years. The amortization charge was £0.1 million in 2002,
2003 and 2004.
During 2003, the Company purchased Adelante Technologies N.V. (now ARM Belgium N.V.). Included with the assets purchased were £0.3 million of
intangible assets comprising developed technology and customer relationships which are being amortized over five years and two years respectively. 
The amortization charge for the assets during 2004 was £0.1 million (2003: less than £0.1 million).
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 67 Intangible assets acquired and capitalized as part of the Axys and Artisan business combinations totalled £1.9 million and £70.1 million respectively and are
being amortised over five years and between one and six years respectively (see note 6 for further details). The total charge during 2004 was £0.1 million
and £0.3 million for Axys and Artisan respectively.
The adoption of SFAS 142, “Goodwill and other intangible assets”, in 2002 did not result in any impairment of the Company’s goodwill or intangible assets.
During the year, the Company entered into a technology license agreement under which ARM will pay $13.3 million (£6.9 million) in four equal, semi-
annual installments over two years. The first installment was paid during the year and the remainder is included with creditors. The agreement confers both
retrospective and prospective rights, each of which has been valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis, and the arrangement consideration has 
been allocated to each element based on the relative fair values. The retrospective amount, amounting to £4.5 million, has been charged to administrative
expenses in the income statement in the year, and the prospective element, amounting to £2.4 million, has been accounted for as a prepayment at 
31 December 2004.
Interest Interest receivable increased from £4.4 million in 2002 to £4.8 million in 2003 and further to £6.9 million in 2004. The growth in interest in the
periods was due to higher average cash balances and increasing interest rates. The Company invested cash balances over periods of up to six months during
2004 although some marketable securities acquired with Artisan have maturities of greater than one year from the balance sheet date.
Income before income tax Income before income tax was £45.4 million in 2002, £22.0 million in 2003 and £38.5 million in 2004, representing 30%, 17%
and 25% of total revenues respectively. The drop in margins in 2003 was due to lower revenues and higher legal costs (including one-off settlement costs)
not being entirely offset by reduced other operating expenses. The increased margin in 2004 was achieved, notwithstanding non-recurring and acquisition-
related charges of £8.7 million during the year (comprising £4.5 million of a non-recurring technology license charge, £3.6 million of in-process research and
development write-off and £0.6 million of business combination intangible amortization) due to higher revenue and continued cost control. 
Tax charge The Company’s effective tax rates were 30.3% in 2002, 40.7% in 2003 and 27.2% in 2004. The effective tax rate increased in 2003 due to 
the impact of certain cash and non-cash accounting charges not being deductible for tax purposes, but fell in 2004 with additional costs being allowable for
research and development tax credits, additional benefits arising from employee share option exercises and lower non-deductible non-cash accounting
charges in 2004.
Net income Net income was £31.6 million in 2002, £13.0 million in 2003 and £28.0 million in 2004. The changes in net income are as a result of the
combined movements in revenues and costs as discussed above.
Liquidity and capital resources The Company’s operating activities generated net cash of £39.5 million, £38.7 million and £46.5 million in 2002, 2003 and
2004 respectively. Movements of working capital detailed below are per the cash flow and thus exclude balances acquired through business combinations,
except where noted.
Accounts receivable fell by £2.9 million in 2002, a further £4.5 million in 2003 but increased by £1.4 million in 2004. This is partly due to the overall
revenues earned in the periods towards the end of the respective years and also improved credit control throughout the periods. Prepaid expenses
increased by £5.3 million in 2002, fell by £2.8 million in 2003 and increased again by £3.4 million in 2004. The Company entered into several leases for
design automation tools during 2002, which resulted in the large increase in prepaid expenses, but fell in 2003 as a result of the lease payments being for
shorter prepaid periods than in previous years. This has been similar in 2004 and the increase was due to a technology license agreement signed in the
year giving rise to a prepayment as noted above.
Accounts payable increased by £2.4 million in 2002, reduced by £2.5 million in 2003 and increased again in 2004 by £1.2 million, as a result of the timing 
of receipt of supplier invoices in 2004 and a general increase in the Company's cost base. Accrued liabilities reduced by £1.1 million in 2002, increased by
£7.0 million in 2003 and increased by a further £2.8 million in 2004. The significant increase in 2003 was primarily as a result of the provision for the Herodion
legal settlement of £6.4 million which was paid early in 2004, and increased in 2004 as a result of provisions for staff costs and for a technology license
agreement signed in the year. 
At 31 December 2004, the Company recorded approximately £21.4 million in deferred revenues which represented cash or receivables scheduled to be
recognized as revenues in varying amounts after 31 December 2004. At 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002, the Company recorded approximately
£11.1 million and £14.4 million respectively in deferred revenues. Deferred revenues are an element of customer backlog, and represent amounts invoiced
to customers not yet recognized as revenues in the income statement. As such, this balance fluctuates due to the maturity profile of ARM's products, and
invoicing milestones within contracts. The significant increase in 2004 is predominantly due to the acquisition of Artisan.
The Company believes that, given its current level of business, it has sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow from operations has been used to fund the working capital requirements of the Company as well as capital expenditure. Capital expenditure in
2004 was £5.0 million, compared with £3.6 million in 2003 and £15.6 million in 2002. Capital expenditure in 2003 was much lower than in 2002 as a result
of the increased leasing of design automation tools and the much lower level of recruitment (which required computers to be purchased for new staff).
Capital expenditure increased in 2004 with increases in both levels of staff and as a result of the development of a new IT system. In 2002, £8.2 million
was spent on computer equipment and software and £7.4 million on leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings. In 2003, £1.8 million was spent on
computer equipment and software and £1.8 million on leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings. In 2004, £3.5 million was spent on computer
equipment and software and £1.5 million on leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings.
In 2003, the Company acquired the 15% minority interest in ARM Korea Limited for cash consideration of £3.0 million, bringing its holding to 100%. The
Company also acquired the entire share capital of Adelante Technologies N.V. (now ARM Belgium N.V.) for a total consideration of £0.4 million.
68 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Operating and financial review and prospects/US GAAP/continued In 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capital of both Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. for total consideration of 
£6.9 million and £481.7 million respectively with cash consideration comprising £6.9 million and £122.3 million respectively. A further $3 million 
(£1.6 million) may become payable for Axys subject to the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones. Cash acquired with these businesses
amounted to £82.7 million. The Company envisages making further strategic investments in the future, in situations where the Company can broaden its
product portfolio, where it can obtain skilled engineering resources and where the potential for furthering ARM core-based design wins is improved significantly.
In 2002, the Company made one investment in an available-for-sale security, namely Superscape Group plc, for consideration of £1.5 million. In 2003 the
Company invested a further £1.2 million in Superscape Group plc as part of a further funding round, thus maintaining its 12% holding. In 2004, the Company
invested a total of £0.2 million in two small unlisted companies, Zeevo Inc. and Reciva Limited, giving a minority holding of less than 3% in each company.
Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balances at 31 December 2004 were £142.8 million compared to 
£159.8 million at 31 December 2003. Accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful debts were £17.3 million at 31 December 2003 and £34.3 million
at 31 December 2004. The significant increase in 2004 is due to the inclusion of the Artisan accounts receivable at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency fluctuations The Company’s earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the US dollar
rate, reflecting the fact that most of the Company’s revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars while a high proportion of its costs are 
in sterling. 
The Company reduces this US dollar/sterling exposure where possible by currency hedging. Due to the high value and timing of receipts on individual
licenses and the requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars, the Company reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a transaction-by-transaction
basis. It then hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars, which are negotiated with major UK clearing banks. The average size 
of each forward contract was $7.2 million in 2002, $4.6 million in 2003 and $5.1 million in 2004. The Company does not currently use any other financial
instruments or derivatives, although the Company is reviewing the use of other financial instruments such as currency options. The fair values of the
financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2002, 2003 and 2004 are disclosed in note 14 to the financial statements. The settlement period of the
forward contracts outstanding at 31 December 2004 was between 11 January 2005 and 29 March 2005.
Quantitative and qualitative information on market risk During the preceding fiscal year, the Company was exposed to foreign currency exchange risk
inherent in its sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling. ARM
transacts business in approximately eight foreign currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to the Company's operations were the US dollar, the
euro, the Korean won and the Japanese yen in 2004. For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefits from 
a weaker sterling and is adversely affected by a stronger sterling relative to those foreign currencies. The Company has performed a sensitivity analysis at
31 December 2004, 2003 and 2002, using a modelling technique that measures the changes in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse
movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to sterling with all other variables held constant. The analysis covers all of the Company's
foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at 31 December
2004, 2003 and 2002. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a
loss in the fair values of ARM's foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, net of exposures, of £8.6 million at 31 December 2004 (2003: £0.7 million,
2002: £0.2 million). The increase in 2004 is due to the large dollar cash balances within Artisan at the year end.
Risk factors The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change,
short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition. The Company believes that its future operating results
will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors. These include the timing of entering into agreements with new
licensees, the mixture of license fees, royalties and fees from services, the introduction of new technology by the Company, the timing of orders from, and
shipments to, systems companies of ARM core-based microprocessors from the Company’s semiconductor partners and sudden technological change in the
microprocessor industry. 
Other risks include the reliance on semiconductor partners, dependence upon systems companies, patent protection, attraction and retention of employees,
management of growth, competition and vulnerability to general economic conditions. Risk factors are more fully discussed in the Company’s annual report
on Form 20-F.

Consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity/US GAAP 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies
The business of the Company ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies (“ARM” or “the Company”) design reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
microprocessors and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and power-efficiency
of high-volume embedded applications. The Company licenses and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies, which in
turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application-specific standard processors (ASSPs) based
on the Company’s architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products. By creating a network of Partners, and working
with them to best utilize the Company’s technology, the Company is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded
microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including
smart cards and digital video. The Company also licenses and sells Development Systems direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support
services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers. The Company’s principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The Company was formed on 16 October
1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer (UK) Limited and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC Machines
Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc. Its initial public offering was on 17 April 1998.
The Company’s wholly-owned undertakings include ARM Limited (incorporated in the UK), ARM, Inc. (incorporated in the US), ARM Physical IP Inc. (formerly
Artisan Components Inc., incorporated in the US and acquired and renamed during 2004), Axys Design Automation Inc. (incorporated in the US and acquired
during 2004), ARM KK (incorporated in Japan), ARM Korea Limited (incorporated in South Korea), ARM France SAS (incorporated in France), ARM Belgium N.V.
(incorporated in Belgium), ARM Taiwan Limited (incorporated in Taiwan), ARM Consulting (Shanghai) Co. Limited (incorporated in PR China) and ARM Embedded
Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (incorporated in India).
Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP).
The Company maintains its accounting records and prepares its financial statements in UK sterling. Purely for the convenience of the reader, the 31 December
2004 consolidated financial statements have been translated from sterling at the closing rate per the Financial Times on 31 December 2004 of £1.00 = $1.92.
Such translations should not be construed as representations that the sterling amounts represent, or have been or could be so converted into US dollars at
that rate or at any other rate.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates in the
financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, accounting for investments, allowance for doubtful debts, impairment of long-lived
assets, goodwill and purchased intangible assets and contingencies and legal settlements.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. Intra-group
transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are
included in the income statement from the date they are acquired. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities that exist at the date of
acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Investments Publicly traded investments are classed as available-for-sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.115,
“Accounting for certain investments in debt and securities”, and are carried at fair value. Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included,
net of related taxes, in other comprehensive income. Other-than-temporary impairment losses and realized gains and losses of such securities are reported
in earnings. Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at cost less permanent diminution in value; at 31 December 2004 and 2003, the
estimated fair value of these investments approximated their recorded basis, based on estimates determined by management. 
During 2002, the Company made a 12% investment in Superscape Group plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company made 
an additional investment in Superscape Group plc during 2003 maintaining its percentage shareholding. In 2004, the Company made a less than 1%
investment in Zeevo Inc. and a less than 3% investment in Reciva Limited.
Intangible assets Purchased patents and licenses to use technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the
time that the Company is expected to benefit from them. 
Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, management is primarily responsible for
determining the fair value of intangible assets. Such assets are capitalized and amortized over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the
time that the Company is expected to benefit from them, with the exception of in-process research and development which is written off immediately. 
Where a technology confers both retrospective and prospective rights, each element is valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The retrospective
element is charged to the income statement immediately, whilst the prospective element is capitalized.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including
any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired. 
Prior to 2002, purchased goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company was expected
to benefit from it. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, on 1 January 2002, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill. The value of goodwill carried forward at the
end of 2001 has been frozen at £2,274,000 and goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual impairment 
74 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
review at the reporting unit level. For 2004, all the assets and liabilities of the Company were assigned to one reporting unit. An annual impairment review
in 2004 determined, by way of a comparison of the Company’s market capitalization to shareholders’ equity and cash flow forecasts, that there was no
indication of impairment with respect to goodwill.
Impairment charges The Company reviews long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and related goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash 
flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment loss would 
be recognized, and the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
Revenue recognition Revenue consists of license fees received under the terms of license agreements with customers to enable them to use the Company’s
intellectual property (IP), which is customized to each customer’s manufacturing process. The Company receives royalties on sales by the Company’s customers
of products containing ARM technology. It also supplies off-the-shelf software tools, bought-in boards and toolkits, training and consultancy services. 
The Company primarily earns revenues from licensing its IP to leading electronics companies which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors,
ASICs and ASSPs based on the Company’s architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products. The Company’s IP consists
of software and related documentation which enables a customer to design and manufacture microprocessors and related technology and software. Most
licenses are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer and are generally not time limited in their application. In general, the time
between the signing of a license and final customer acceptance is between six and 15 months. Upgrades or modifications to the licensed IP are not
provided. Following customer acceptance, the Company has no further obligations under the license agreement.
In accordance with SOP 81-1, “Accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production type contracts”, when license agreements include
deliverables that require “significant production, modification or customization”, contract accounting is applied. Revenues from license fees are recognized
based on the percentage-to-completion method over the period from signing of the license to customer acceptance and the completion of all outstanding
obligations. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the license agreement and the percentage-to-completion achieved.
The percentage-to-completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project, compared with the total
estimated project requirement. Revenues are recognized only when collectability is probable. If the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts
billed to customers, the excess amount is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable. Estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of
customization, delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management. Under the percentage-
to-completion method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is
determined.
Agreements that include rights to unspecified products (as opposed to unspecified upgrades and enhancements) are accounted for using subscription
accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognized over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered 
if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product. 
In accordance with SOP 97-2, “Software revenue recognition”, where agreements involve multiple elements that do not require “significant production,
modification or customization”, the Company recognizes license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
product has been shipped or electronically delivered, the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Where
agreements include multiple elements, the revenue recognition criteria for each element are typically met within the same reporting period, ie. on delivery
of the elements. If an element is undelivered at a period end, the Company determines whether it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE)
of fair value in order to make an allocation amongst the elements. With the exception of post-contract support (PCS), the Company does not currently
believe that it has sufficient VSOE to make such allocations. Accordingly, no revenue is recognized on arrangements where deliverables other than PCS
remain outstanding.
PCS consists of an identified customer contact at the Company, and telephone or e-mail support (including certain bug fixes). PCS is generally priced
separately from the initial licensing fee. Revenue allocated to PCS is determined based on VSOE. VSOE is determined with reference to contractual renewal
rates, or, if none are specified, by reference to the rate actually charged on renewal for the same level of support and for the same or similar technologies 
for PCS arrangements. PCS revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the
Company with the licensee.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Company and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licenses to the product. 
In those cases where the Company makes sales of these products and considers itself to be the principal under EITF 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as 
a Principal versus Net as an Agent”, the total value of the license is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded 
as cost of sales. Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Company records as revenue the commission it is due when informed
by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
Sales of boards and toolkits are recognized upon delivery. Where necessary, and in the circumstances permitted by SOP 97-2, the costs associated with
providing post-contract support have been accrued. While some arrangements with distributors provide very limited rights of return, the Company’s history 
is that actual returns are negligible and accordingly no provisions are deemed necessary.
Services, such as consulting and training, which are not essential to the functionality of the IP , are accounted for separately based on VSOE. Revenue is
recognized as services are performed and collectability is probable. The excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded
as a deferred revenue liability.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 75 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Company’s customers of products containing ARM technology. Revenues are recognized when ARM receives
notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenues from consulting projects, which are typically of a short duration, are recognized when the service has been provided and all obligations to the
customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled. For longer-term and more complex consulting projects, typically containing several project
milestones, where significant modification to ARM core-based IP is required, revenues are recognized on a percentage-to-completion basis as milestones 
are achieved. This method approximates to percentage to completion based on labor inputs.
Where the Company enters into a license arrangement in exchange for a license to the customer’s technology, in the absence of evidence of fair value 
of the arrangement, the transaction is recorded at carry-over basis.
Research and development All ongoing research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Costs include salaries,
relevant EDA tools costs and other directly related expenditure as well as a proportion of central facilities costs.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are receivable from the European Commission, a European organization which funds
certain research and development activities on application to it for the purposes of furthering research and development activities within the European
Union. The Company retains significant rights to IP developed under projects which are funded under these arrangements. Grants received are intended to
cover 50% of expected project costs. Grant income is recognized over the period of the project in line with the costs incurred. Unconditional undertakings
have been received from the European Commission to provide the funding, and there is no obligation to refund any amounts already received. Amounts
receivable under these arrangements in the year ended 31 December 2004 were £338,000 (2003: £226,000; 2002: £199,000) and were netted against
related research and development costs.
Pension costs The Company contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension
schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel. The Company contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of
employee compensation and such contributions are expensed as incurred. The amount of contributions expensed by the Company for the years ended 
31 December 2002, 2003 and 2004 were £1,894,000, £1,848,000 and £2,067,000 respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments and marketable securities The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three
months but less than one year to be short-term investments. Any investments with a maturity date of greater than one year are classified as long-term. At
31 December 2004 and 2003, all of the Company’s investments were classified as available-for-sale and were recorded on the balance sheets at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are recorded in comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment charge when the decline
in fair value of its investments below cost is judged to be other-than-temporary.
Allowance for doubtful debts Allowance is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management. 
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport
and handling costs. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition. Costs that are directly
attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed
into operational use, are capitalized. External costs and internal costs are capitalized to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the business.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of property and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the
expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal economic lives used for this purpose are:
Freehold buildings 25 years
Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter
Computers and software Three to five years
Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years
Motor vehicles Four years
Provision is made against the carrying value of property and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Currency translation The functional currency for the Company’s operations is the local currency in which each operation operates.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Statements of income of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the monthly exchange rates during the year. Translation differences are taken to the
cumulative translation adjustment.
76 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of the business. The Company’s forward exchange contracts do not subject the Company to risk from exchange
rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged. Because the
Company does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the forward contracts and the related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each
period end. All recognized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative costs in the
income statement. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences have
been included in general and administrative costs.
From time to time, the Company enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency (typically US dollars) that is neither the functional currency of the
Company nor the functional currency of the customer. In accordance with SFAS 133, “Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities”, where
there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Company carries such derivatives at fair value. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income
statement under general and administrative costs. For the year ended 31 December 2004 the loss on exchange was £732,000 (2003: £1,141,000; 2002:
£950,000).
Income taxes Income taxes are computed using the liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the asset will not be realized.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares. Diluted earnings per
common share is computed by including potential common shares where the effect of their inclusion would be dilutive. The diluted share base for the year
ended 31 December 2004 excludes incremental shares of approximately 38,143,000 (2003: 18,948,000; 2002: 19,608,000) related to employee stock
options. These shares are excluded due to their antidilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price. The
ordinary equivalent shares for share options were determined using the treasury stock method.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company has elected to use the intrinsic value-based method to account for all its employee stock-based
compensation plans, under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for stock issued to employees”, and related
interpretations. Stock-based employee compensation cost in respect of certain SAYE options (see below) of £341,000 (2003: £310,000) and in respect of the
LTIP of £619,000 (2003: £241,000) is reflected in net income. No compensation cost is recorded in respect of the other stock option plans, as all options
granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Apart from certain options
issued to executive directors, there are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of options. For executive directors, discretionary share options 
of up to two times base salary may be issued each year that will vest after seven years. If, however, the Company achieves defined levels of EPS growth
above the rate of inflation over a period of three years, then the options are exercisable after three years.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB
Statement No. 123, “Accounting for stock-based compensation”, to stock-based employee compensation.

The fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for
grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002: risk-free interest rate of between 4.0% and 4.5% (2003: between 3.2% and 4.9%; 2002: 5.1%); expected life of between
one and five years; between 44% and 96% (2003: between 60% and 127%; 2002: 80%) volatility; and dividend yield of between 0.5% and 0.7% (2003
and 2002: nil). The grant date fair value of options granted during 2004 ranged from £0.30 to £0.88 (2003: £0.21 to £0.55, 2002: £0.26 to £1.95).
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 77 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
The Company operates Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) in the US. Options under these schemes
are granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue,
which stipulates that the savings period must be at least 36 months. During 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus, contained
within EITF 00-23, that savings plans which have a savings period in excess of 27 months should be treated as compensatory. In accordance with EITF 00-23,
which applies to new offers after 24 January 2002, the Company has recognized a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans offered since that
date. The compensation charge is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the
option and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period. The compensation charge recorded in 2004 is £341,000 (2003: £310,000; 2002:
£56,000). The deferred compensation at 31 December 2004 was £599,000 (2003: £1,081,000; 2002: £313,000). 
In addition, the EITF reached a consensus that an employer’s offer to enter into a new SAYE contract at a lower price than an existing contract causes
variable accounting for all existing awards subject to the offer. Variable accounting commences for all existing awards when the offer is made, and for 
those awards that are retained by employees because the offer is declined, variable accounting continues until the awards are exercised, are forfeited, 
or expire unexercised. New awards are accounted for as variable to the extent that previous higher priced options are canceled. The compensation charge
recorded in 2004 as a result of these provisions is £115,000 (2003: £109,000; 2002: £nil) and is included within the charge disclosed above. The number of
options to which variable accounting applies is approximately 908,000 (2003: 950,000; 2002: 980,000).
The Company has an LTIP on which it is also required to recognize a compensation charge under the EITF, calculated as the difference between the exercise
price and the fair market value of the shares at the period end, over the vesting period of the options. During 2004, a charge of £619,000 (2003: £241,000)
was incurred and deferred compensation at 31 December 2004 was £1,905,000 (2003: £1,418,000).
As part of the consideration for Artisan, the Company granted approximately 90.4 million options over shares in ARM Holdings plc to employees of Artisan
with substantially the same terms of those enjoyed when they were options over Artisan shares. As a result, a significant proportion of the options 
were already vested at acquisition. The intrinsic value of the unvested options was recorded as a reduction in shareholders' funds and a reduction in
goodwill. This amount is then charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the options. The total value deferred at 31 December 2004
was £9,579,000.
Employee share ownership plans Treasury stock represents the cost of shares in the Company held by the Employee Benefit Trust (ESOP) and the QUEST. 
The ESOP was set up on 16 April 1998 to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of employees. Under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan,
5,003,724 shares could be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and QUEST. The market value of unearned shares at 31 December 2004 
was £5,525,000. 
All costs relating to the schemes are recognized in the income statement as they accrue and the ESOP has waived the right to receive dividends of over and
above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held. For the purpose of earnings per share calculations, the shares are treated as canceled until such time as they
vest unconditionally.
Treasury stock held also includes £6,047,000 relating to 713,034 shares held by the Company’s QUEST, which was established by the Company during 1999.
The Company established the QUEST to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Company. No shares were
purchased in 2004, 2003 or 2002.
The shares rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares. They will be allocated to employees and directors to satisfy their options granted
under the Company’s SAYE schemes or utilized to meet awards under the Company’s LTIP .
During 2004, 8,046 shares (2003: 1,075,674) were allocated from the QUEST following the exercise of share options granted under the Company’s SAYE
schemes. Under the terms of the trust deed, dividends have been waived on the shares held by the QUEST, and all costs relating to the scheme are dealt
with in the income statement as they accrue.
Employer’s taxes on share options Employer’s National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of
certain share options issued to employees in certain tax jurisdictions. In accordance with EITF 00-16 no provision has been made for the employer’s taxes on
these share options. These amounts will be recognized in the consolidated income statement when payable.
Recently issued accounting standards In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on recognition and measurement
guidance previously discussed under EITF Issue No. 03-01, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”
(“EITF 03-01”). The consensus clarified the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity investments accounted for
under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”, and other investments accounted for under the cost method. The
recognition and measurement guidance for which the consensus was reached in March 2004 is to be applied to other-than-temporary impairment evaluations in
reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued a final FASB Staff Position that delays the effective date for the
measurement and recognition guidance for all investments within the scope of EITF 03-01. The consensus reached in March 2004 also provided for certain
disclosure requirements associated with cost method investments that were effective for fiscal years ending after 15 June 2004. The Company is evaluating
the effect of adopting this recognition and measurement guidance.
78 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
In April 2004, the EITF issued Statement No. 03-06 “Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method Under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share”
(“EITF 03-06”). EITF 03-06 addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other
than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends on its
common stock. The issue also provides further guidance in applying the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, clarifying what constitutes a
participating security and how to apply the two-class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating, including
how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security. EITF 03-06 became effective during the quarter ended 30 June 2004, the adoption of which did not
have an impact on the calculation of earnings per share of the Company.
In July 2004, the EITF issued a draft abstract for EITF Issue No. 04-08, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share” (“EITF 04-08”).
EITF 04-08 reflects the Task Force’s tentative conclusion that contingently convertible debt should be included in diluted earnings per share computations
regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. If adopted, the consensus reached by the Task Force in this Issue will be effective for reporting
periods ending after 15 December 2004. Prior period earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes would be required to be restated to
conform to this consensus and the Company would be required to include the shares issuable upon the conversion of debt in the diluted earnings per share
computation for all periods during which such debt is outstanding. The Company will evaluate the effect of adopting the recognition and measurement
guidance when the final consensus is reached.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123(R), a revision to FAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. The standard’s effective date will apply
to awards that are granted, modified, or settled in cash in interim or annual periods beginning after 15 June 2005. This standard eliminates the ability 
to account for share-based compensation using the intrinsic value-based method under APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” 
It requires the Company to calculate equity-based compensation expense for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights granted to employees
based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. Currently, the Company discloses the pro forma net income/(loss) and related pro
forma income/(loss) per share information in accordance with FAS 123 and FAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Costs-Transition and
Disclosure.” The Company will continue to evaluate the impact that this standard will have on its financial position and results of operations.
Companies Act 1985 These financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 of Great
Britain (the “Companies Act”). The Company’s statutory accounts, which are its primary financial statements, are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP) in compliance with the Companies Act and are presented in pounds sterling. Statutory
accounts (upon which the auditors gave unqualified reports under Section 235 of the Companies Act and which did not contain statements under sub-
sections 237(2) and (3) of the Companies Act) for the years ended 31 December 2002 and 2003 have been, and those for the year ended 31 December
2004 will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales. Dividends are required to be declared in sterling out of profits available for that
purpose as determined in accordance with UK GAAP and the Companies Act.
2 Related party transactions
During the year, the Company paid royalties of £411,000 (2003: £nil, 2002: £nil) and made cross-license payments of £14,000 (2003: £453,000, 2002: £nil)
to Superscape Group plc, a company in which Mike Inglis, an executive director of ARM, is a non-executive director. £nil (2003: £392,000) was owed 
to Superscape at 31 December 2004. Also during 2004, the Company received license fees of £209,000 (2003: £157,000, 2002: £nil) and support and
maintenance income of £37,000 (2003: £nil, 2002: £nil) from CSR plc, a company in which John Scarisbrick, a non-executive director of ARM, became 
a non-executive director during the year. £nil was owed by CSR at 31 December 2004 (2003: £183,799).

Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued 3 Income taxes continued
UK income taxes have not been provided at 31 December 2004 on unremitted earnings of approximately £5,670,000 (2003: £6,891,000; 2002: £10,142,000)
of subsidiaries located outside the UK as such earnings are considered to be permanently invested. If these earnings were to be remitted without offsetting 
tax credits in the UK, withholding taxes would be approximately £1,122,000 (2003: £347,000; 2002: £518,000). The valuation allowance relates to net
operating loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, where management believes it is more likely than not such amounts will not be realized. None of the
loss carryforwards expires before 2018. The future use of the net operating losses carried forward in ARM Inc. may be restricted in the event of a purchase 
by a third party, whereby the level of losses to be utilized on an annual basis would be limited to 4% of the market value of ARM Inc. at the date of the
transaction. There is no such restriction on the losses carried forward in ARM Belgium N.V.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 81 5 Business risks and credit concentration
The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which has been characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, short
product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition. Significant technological changes in the industry could affect
operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments
and marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of the Company’s
customers are large, well-established companies. The Company has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of
customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Company markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions. For further information see footnote 
13. At 31 December 2002, 2003 and 2004, no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. 
As of 31 December 2002 and 2003, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were deposited with major clearing banks and
building societies in the UK and US in the form of money market deposits for varying periods of up to six months. At 31 December 2004, the Company's
cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities were deposited with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK and US
in the form of money market deposits and corporate bonds for varying periods of up to two years.
6 Acquisitions
Axys Design Automation Inc. 
On 16 August 2004, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Axys Design Automation Inc., a US company, for a total consideration of $12.5 million
(£6.9 million), comprising $11.6 million cash consideration and $0.9 million of related acquisition expenses. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. A further $3 million is potentially
payable subject to the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones and will be accrued when payable. Axys is a provider of fast, accurate,
integrated, processor and system modeling and simulation solutions and adds electronic system level expertise to ARM's design tools portfolio.
The operating results for Axys have been included in these financial statements for the period from 16 August 2004 to 31 December 2004. The acquisition
was accounted for under SFAS 141.

The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Axys and those intangible assets of Axys that could 
be clearly identified. These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Axys concerning development
projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating ability. There
were no other contractual or other legal rights of Axys clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below. The allocation of the purchase
price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows:
Useful estimated life (years) £000
Fair value of net assets acquired 465
Intangible assets acquired:
Developed technology 5 1,379

The company’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2003 was £0.02 million and for the period from 1 January 2004 until acquisition was a loss of
£0.9 million.
Artisan Components Inc. 
On 23 December 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capital of Artisan Components Inc., a leading provider of physical IP components for the design
and manufacture of complex system-on-chip ("SoC") integrated circuits. The acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industry's
broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer base, with highly complementary sales channels combining ARM's
channel to more than 140 silicon manufacturers with Artisan's channel to more than 2,000 companies. It better positions the combined company to benefit
from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases, and strengthens the links between the key aspects of SoC
development, enabling the combined company to deliver solutions that are further optimized for power and performance. 
The operating results for Artisan have been included in these financial statements for the period from 23 December 2004 to 31 December 2004. The
acquisition was accounted for under SFAS 141.
The total consideration paid was $926.9 million (£481.7 million), comprising cash of $235.4 million (£122.3 million), 324,399,411 ordinary shares in the
Company with a fair value of $524.2 million (£272.4 million), approximately 90.4 million share options issued to existing Artisan employees with fair value 
of $151.9 million (£79.0 million) and related direct acquisition fees of $15.4 million (£8.0 million) including legal, valuation and accounting fees. The purchase
price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
The shares issued on acquisition were valued in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-12 ("EITF 99-12"), "Determination of the Measurement
Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination". In accordance with EITF 99-12, the Company established the first
date on which the number of the Company shares and the amount of other consideration became fixed as of 23 August 2004. Accordingly, the Company
valued the transaction using the average closing price of the Company's ordinary shares two days before and after 23 August 2004, or $1.616 per share. The
assumed options to acquire ordinary shares were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model with volatility of between 80% and 94%, an average risk
free interest rate of 4.5%, an estimated life of between zero and six years, and dividend yield of 0.7%.

The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Artisan and those intangible assets of Artisan 
that could be clearly identified. These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Artisan concerning
development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating
ability. There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Artisan clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below. The allocation
of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows:
Useful estimated life (years) £000
Fair value of net assets acquired 95,361
Intangible assets acquired:
Developed technology 4 – 5 18,177
Patents/core technology 5 – 7 11,719

In-process research and development (written-off on acquisition) 3,229
Deferred stock-based compensation 9,579
Deferred tax liability (28,042)
Goodwill 331,432
Purchase price 481,663
Developed technology Developed technology of £18.2 million and patents and core technology of £11.7 million included intellectual property components
for use in SoC integrated circuits and consisted of the following: embedded memory, standard cell, input/output components, and analog and mixed-signal
products. In addition, developed technology included a combination of processes, patents, patent applications, core modular architecture and trade secrets
that are the buildings blocks of the technology. At the date of acquisition, the developed technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the developed technology and will be expensed as incurred. To estimate the fair
value of the developed technology, an income approach was used with a discount rate of 14% for existing technology and 16% for patents and core
technology, which included an analysis of future cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows. All developed technologies are being
amortized over the estimated useful lives of four to five years.
Existing agreements and customer relationships and order backlog The customer base of £36.4 million and order backlog of £1.4 million represented
the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, royalty arrangements, and support and maintenance agreements. To estimate the fair value 
of the customer base and order backlog, a cost approach (replacement value) was used. The customer base and order backlog are being amortized over
their estimated useful lives of three to six years for customer base and one year for order backlog.
Trademarks and tradenames The fair value assigned to trademarks and tradenames, including the company name Artisan, was estimated using the
income approach, which discounts the present value of attributable cash flows at a discount rate of 16%. 
84 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued 6 Acquisitions continued
In-process research and development Development projects that had reached technological feasibility were classified as developed technology and the
value assigned to developed technology was capitalized. Expensed in-process research and development of £3.2 million reflected certain research projects
that had not yet reached technological feasibility and commercial viability or had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. The fair value
assigned to in-process research and development was estimated based on the percentage of completion of each project using the income approach, which
discounts to present value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached technological feasibility using a discount rate of 19%. In-process
research and development has been written-off immediately to the income statement. 
Goodwill of £331.4 million represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. As stated, 
the acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industry's broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined
customer base and it better positions the combined company to benefit from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity
increases. These, combined with the ability to hire the entire Artisan work force, were significant contributing factors to the establishment of the purchase
price, resulting in the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company is not amortizing goodwill relating to the
acquisition. It is being carried at cost and the Company will test it for impairment annually and whenever events indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
The unaudited pro forma results of the Company for the current year, had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2004, and for the prior year, had the acquisition
occurred on 1 January 2003, would have been:
2003 2004

Income from operations 3,730 15,973
Net income 1,650 16,365
Diluted earnings per ordinary share 0.1p 1.2p
Net income has been reduced in these pro forma results in relation to reduced interest income as a result of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration,
amortization of intangibles acquired and amortization of deferred compensation.
7 Investments and marketable securities
In 2002, the Company invested £1,500,000 in Superscape Group plc, an available-for-sale investment. A further £1,152,000 was invested in Superscape
Group plc during 2003 as part of a further funding round. In 2000, the Company invested £688,000 in Cambridge Silicon Radio Holdings Limited, an unlisted
investment. In February 2004, the company (now CSR plc) became a listed investment. The aggregate fair value of listed investments at 31 December 2004
was £10,262,000 (2003: £4,139,000). In 2004, the Company invested £112,000 in Zeevo Inc. and £50,000 in Reciva Limited, both unlisted companies.
Impairments during 2004 against unlisted investments held at the year end amounted to £nil (2003: £622,000; 2002: £826,000) and against listed
investments held at the year end amounted to £nil (2003: £938,000).
At 31 December 2004, the Company had £21,511,000 (2003: £nil) and £5,438,000 (2003: £nil) of short- and long-term marketable securities respectively.
These represent both the fair market value and the amortized cost of the securities.

Until the adoption of SFAS 142 on 1 January 2002 (see footnote 1), goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to three years,
determined in each case by reference to employee turnover rates in the industry and the individual technology acquired with the acquisitions. In accordance
with SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, and is tested for impairment at least annually.
Licenses to use technology are being amortized over periods of three to five years. The amortization periods for licenses have been determined according to
their estimated useful economic life.
Patents are being amortized over four to five years, developed technology (the main IP of the company existent at acquisition and generating revenue) over
four to five years, existing agreements and customer relationships over two to six years, core technology over five years, trademarks over four years and
order backlog over one year, being the periods over which the Company is expected to derive benefit from them.
The estimated amortization expense of intangible assets in each of the next five years is set forth below:

10  Accrued liabilities
Included within accrued liabilities at 31 December 2004 are £14.3 million (2003: £nil) of acquisition-related expenses, £nil (2003: £6.4 million) relating to
the Herodion settlement provision, £4.4 million (2003: £nil) provision for staff costs and £2.8 million (2003: £2.1 million) representing the fair value of
embedded derivatives.

Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued 11  Shareholders’ equity
Share options The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share
capital in any five-year period. Options issued prior to the listing of the Company are excluded from this calculation as are those options assumed on the
acquisition of Artisan.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan (the “Executive Scheme”), the Company may grant options to directors and employees
meeting certain eligibility requirements. Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time
the options expire.
Under the Company’s Unapproved Scheme (the “Unapproved Scheme”), for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are
exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire. The Company also operates the US ISO Sheme, which is substantially
the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue. Under both of these
schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary,
100% maximum on fourth anniversary. Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met
are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are two further schemes for our French and Belgian employees (the “French Scheme” and the “Belgian Scheme”). In the French Scheme, options are
exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third
anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition. The schemes remained substantially 
the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc. 
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement. The schemes assumed were the
"1993 Plan", the "1997 Plan", the "2000 Plan", the "2003 Plan", the "Director Plan", the "Executive Plan" and the "ND00 Plan".
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods. The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most
common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years. Some options vest on 
a monthly basis, and some vest over five years. All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.  
In 1998, the Company set up two savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company. The number of options
granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee. The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM, Inc. where the
period is two years. The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for 
a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM, Inc. where the right to exercise normally only arises for a three-month period
once the savings have been completed. The Company set up further savings-related option schemes in each year up to and including 2004 for all
employees and executive directors of the Company, which have the same characteristics as those schemes set up in 1998.

In May 2002, Nazomi Communications Inc. filed suit against ARM alleging wilful infringement of Nazomi’s US patent No. 6,332,215. ARM answered
Nazomi’s complaint in July 2002, denying infringement. ARM moved for summary judgement and a ruling that the accused technology does not infringe. 
In September 2003, the United States District Court of Northern California granted ARM’s motion, holding that the accused technology does not infringe
Nazomi's patent. Nazomi appealed the District Court’s ruling. On 7 September 2004, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the appeal and the
decision of the Court is expected in the first half of 2005. Based on legal advice received to date, ARM has no cause to believe that the effect of the original
ruling by the District Court will not be upheld.
Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that
the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party. Consistent with such practice, the Company provides such indemnification
to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability. The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and
is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee infringes
such third party's intellectual property rights. The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the license and will continue in perpetuity.
The Company does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that 
it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements; and (ii) the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. 
Any such provision is based upon the directors’ estimate of the expected costs of any such claim. 12  Commitments and contingencies continued
The total provision for such guarantees was £0.5 million on 31 December 2004, and a table showing the movement of the provision during the year 
is as follows:
Provided in Utilized in 
At 1 January the year on Released the year through At 31 December

£000 £000 £000 £000 £000
Indemnification provision 1,700 1,130 (780) (1,530) 520
The fair value of the guarantees approximates to book value due to the expected short-term nature of the provision.
At 31 December 2004, ARM had provided in aggregate £1.3 million (2003: £2.5 million) in relation to the above legal matters, being the expected future
costs to be incurred. In addition, the Company had provided £6.4 million at 31 December 2003 (2004: £nil) in relation to the Herodion settlement.
At 31 December 2004, the Company had outstanding purchase commitments of £1,179,000 (2003: £1,365,000). 
13  Geographic and segment information
The directors are of the opinion that the Company had only one class of business during 2004. Following the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc., the
directors are considering whether the business is going to be re-organised, how it will be monitored internally and whether different reportable segments
will be formed.
Because the acquisition of Artisan was completed so close to the year end, the Company’s consolidated income statement does not include any material
trading results in respect of Artisan (the Physical IP group) in 2004. Total assets of £637,937,000 at 31 December 2004 are split: ARM (Cores) £133,144,000
and Physical IP £504,793,000.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 89 14  Fair values of financial instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity
of those instruments. 
Marketable securities The carrying amount approximates fair value because these instruments are marked-to-market. 
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued To the board of directors and shareholders of ARM Holdings plc In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flow present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2004 and 2003 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended 
31 December 2004, 2003 and 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), which require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion expressed above.

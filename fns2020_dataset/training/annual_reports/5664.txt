ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 This report includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, ‘forward-looking statements’. These 
forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms 
‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘plans’, ‘projects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘may’, ‘will’, or ‘should’ or, in each case, 
their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans, objectives, 
goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include matters that are not historical facts 
or are statements regarding the Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other 
things, the Group’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, and the 
industries in which the Group operates.
Forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and therefore too much 
reliance should not be placed upon them. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which 
are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Group’s control. By their nature, forward-looking statements 
involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. The Group cautions you that 
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that if risks and uncertainties 
materialise, or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, the Group’s actual results of 
operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group operates may 
materially differ from those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
In addition, even if the Group’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the 
industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this report, 
those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in future periods. A number of 
factors could cause results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking statements including, without limitation, general economic and business conditions, industry 
trends, competition, commodity prices, changes in regulation, currency fluctuations, changes in business 
strategy, political and economic uncertainty. 
Subject to the requirements of the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing 
Rules or any applicable law or regulation, the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking publicly to 
review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any updates or revisions to any 
forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any changes in the Group’s expectations with regard 
thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Group Overview
The prevailing economic conditions during 2009 meant that ENRC 
faced challenging headwinds for a significant part of the year. I was 
particularly impressed with the performance of our senior 
management team who responded quickly and effectively to ensure 
that the impact of the downturn was minimised as much as possible. 
Their focus on cost control and reducing inventory levels played a 
significant part in ensuring that the Group performed well into the 
recovery.
Despite the economic difficulties, industry production levels 
recovered progressively during 2009, particularly as a result of the 
continuing demand for commodities from China. This environment 
also supported strengthening prices. By the end of the year our own 
production levels were largely back to effectively full available 
capacity. 
During the year ENRC began to deliver on its stated intention to 
develop as a more diversified mining group. We took advantage of 
the acquisition opportunities available and in September 2009 we 
announced our offer for Central African Mining & Exploration 
Company PLC (‘CAMEC’) which became unconditional on 9 
November 2009. Work is ongoing to integrate CAMEC into the ENRC 
corporate structure, as our Other Non-ferrous Division, and we 
believe that in due course CAMEC’s assets, and our own expertise, 
will provide us with a competitive advantage in the region. In 
February 2010 we entered into a conditional agreement to acquire a 
90% interest in Chambishi Metals PLC a processing facility in 
Zambia. Management plans to combine Chambishi with the existing 
Other Non-ferrous Division facilities in the Democratic Republic  
of Congo (‘DRC’). The Chambishi acquisition was completed in  
early April. 
In June 2009 Miguel Perry stepped down as an Executive Director 
and Chief Financial Officer of the Group. In September 2009 we 
announced the appointment of Zaure Zaurbekova as an Executive 
Director and Chief Financial Officer. Prior to this Ms Zaurbekova had 
been the Group’s Deputy Chief Financial Officer and acting Chief 
Financial Officer after Mr Perry’s departure, coming to the role with 
significant experience of leading the finance function in Kazakhstan.
“2009 demonstrated the inherent 
strengths of ENRC’s low cost and 
integrated operations. Management 
performed extremely well through the 
downturn and, as the year progressed, 
had the Group advantageously 
positioned to deliver with the upturn. 
The strength of our balance sheet was 
also important and it assisted the 
business as a base from which to invest 
and to grow by acquisition. We continue 
to evaluate all opportunities, both 
organic and acquisitive, with care to 
ensure that value is delivered for all 
shareholders.”

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
In August 2009 we announced that Sir David Cooksey, non-
executive Chairman, was leaving ENRC to take up the position of 
Chairman of UK Financial Investments Limited. After consultation 
with our major shareholders, I was honoured to be asked by the 
Board to become Chairman in his place. Felix Vulis, previously our 
Chief Operating Officer in Kazakhstan, was promoted to be an 
Executive Director and the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, whilst 
our Senior Independent Director, Sir Richard Sykes, became Deputy 
Chairman. Michael Eggleton, who had served on the Board since the 
IPO as a non-executive Director, left in 2009 to pursue other 
interests. In January 2010 we announced the appointment of 
Professor Dieter Ameling as an independent non-executive Director. 
Despite the considerable changes in the Board’s composition since 
last summer, I firmly believe that the Group’s continuing strong 
strategic performance demonstrates that our Board is committed to 
driving forward the businesses and strategy.
One of the issues of the year was the increase in the number of 
fatalities compared to 2008. During the year we worked hard with 
DuPont to evaluate and improve safety management at our 
operational sites and this work is ongoing. The project is a long-term 
one and it is too soon to measure the effectiveness of the new 
processes we have introduced. However, any fatality is considered 
seriously and the management team have taken steps to increase 
their scrutiny of health and safety practices at our operational sites 
and have escalated the reporting process so there is greater 
accountability at a senior level. 
We believe that the economic outlook will continue to improve during 
the course of 2010 and that greater stability than we have had in 
recent years will result in a more positive period for natural 
resources companies in the future.

Group Overview
“In 2009 the Group’s advantages, 
particularly its proximity to China, low 
cost base and business diversification, 
underpinned a robust performance in 
the face of a marked industry downturn. 
Swift measures taken by the 
management allowed us to mitigate the 
weaker demand and lower prices and 
deliver an improved performance in the 
second-half of 2009. During the year we 
were pleased to be able to use our 
strong balance sheet to grow our 
commodity base by acquisition. Our 
entry into copper and cobalt, with the 
purchase of CAMEC, opens up an 
exciting new opportunity and 
implements our strategy of 
diversification. We are increasingly 
confident that strong growth in 
emerging markets and a recovery 
coming in the rest of the world will 
sustain growth in the demand for our 
products in 2010.”

Ch i e f	E x e c u t i v e	O f fi ce r
C h i ef 	 Ex e c u tiv e 	 Of fic e r’ s	 S t at e me n t
We are pleased with the Group’s financial and operational 
performance in 2009, which exceeded our initial expectations held 
at the beginning of the year. The Group’s resilience reflected its 
strategic location, its low cost advantages and the benefits of our 
integrated business capabilities. Our performance also reflected the 
success of measures implemented by management in response to 
the general downturn. In addition, the Group benefited from the 
strength of the Chinese economy and its robust metals demand. 
Commodity prices were generally stronger than we originally 
anticipated. Going into 2010, conditions for recovery in our main 
markets now seem to be firmly established, although we recognise 
that there remain some points of vulnerability in the global economy.
In late 2008 and into 2009 management responded rapidly and 
decisively to the crisis, cutting ferroalloys and iron ore production to 
match customer demand, reducing inventories and receivables, 
re-evaluating capital expenditure and focusing on the control of 
costs. Progressively during 2009, management was able to advance 
production levels across those businesses, and particularly in 
Kazakhstan where the labour force had been retained through the 
downturn. By the end of 2009, production had been restored to 
effectively full available capacity across most of our principal 
product lines. In 2009, the Group’s resilient operating performance 
and balance sheet strength opened up opportunities to diversify the 
business. 
The results achieved are a particular credit to the operational 
management in Kazakhstan. We are also grateful for the 
commitment of the workforce through the challenging times and to 
the efforts of our Sales & Marketing operation. The Group offers to 
all its employees its sincere thanks for their loyalty, commitment and 
continued efforts. In 2010 we are reviewing wage rates for our 
Kazakhstan employees across each of the Divisions.
We remain positive on the medium- and long-term prospects for the 
growth of the Chinese and Russian economies and elsewhere in 
emerging markets. The prospects for ENRC in these markets are 
enhanced by structural capacity shortages, notably in China, and 
supply constraints that are expected to emerge with an economic 
recovery. ENRC in Kazakhstan is well positioned to exploit 
opportunities in China and Russia. For the Group this is 
supplemented by the acquisitions of CAMEC, and more recently, 
Chambishi, which offer geographical and commodity diversification 
as well as a broader range of growth opportunities. In addition our 
capital expenditure initiatives are directed towards providing a solid 
platform for growth, inside Kazakhstan and elsewhere around the 
world, to deliver value for all our shareholders. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
2009 Production performance
The Group’s production performance in 2009 was broadly similar to 
2008 for ferroalloys and iron ore, notwithstanding the cutbacks 
initiated by management in Q4 2008, with improved aluminium 
production and electricity generation. Through 2009, the Ferroalloys 
and Iron Ore Divisions experienced a progressive recovery in 
capacity utilisation and sales. In the Ferroalloys Division 2009 
high-carbon ferrochrome production was ahead of 2008 (2009: 
1,073 kt; 2008: 1,054 kt), although weakness in chrome ore sales 
and in the low- and medium-carbon ferrochrome markets persisted. 
By Q4 2009 Kazchrome – the key Kazakhstan business of the 
Ferroalloys Division – had restored its capacity utilisation to 97%. 
In the Iron Ore Division, primary iron ore concentrate production 
progressively recovered through 2009 and was broadly in line with 
2008 (2009: 15,197 kt; 2008: 15,487 kt), although with proportionately 
more saleable concentrate production. Capacity utilisation reached 
97% in Q4 2009 and there was a strong recovery in pellet production 
in H2 2009. In the Alumina and Aluminium Division, 2009 alumina 
production was 1,608 kt, steady at its capacity run rate. Production 
volumes were supported by the long-term alumina contract with 
United Company RUSAL (‘US RUSAL’). Aluminium production 
amounted to 127 kt (2008: 106 kt), with the smelter running at its full 
Phase 1 capacity (125 kt per annum) and with half of the Phase 2 
smelter pots being charged with alumina and put into operation in 
December 2009. Also pleasing was that in 2009 the London Metal 
Exchange (‘LME’) approved the listing of our aluminium ingots.
The Energy Division was bolstered in 2009 by a recovery in demand 
and reinstated capacity, as well as the onset of adverse winter 
weather in Q4 2009. Coal extraction rose to 20,059 kt (2008: 
19,790 kt) whilst electricity generation increased to 13,478 GWh 
(2008: 11,640 GWh). Logistics maintained its transportation tonnage 
broadly steady on 2008 (2009: 58,181 kt; 2008: 58,549 kt). In 
addition, we had the first-time contribution of copper and cobalt in 
the Other Non-ferrous Division.
2009 Financial performance
The Group’s 2009 Underlying EBITDA (which excludes the benefit of 
the one-off Kazakhstani tenge devaluation gain, US$210 million) 
declined 65% to US$1,462 million (2008: US$4,161 million). The 
decline was predominantly driven by significantly lower average 
commodity prices resulting in a fall in revenue of 44% to $3,831 
million (2008: US$6,823 million), notably for ferrochrome, iron ore 
and aluminium. 
The impact of the decline in revenue was partially offset by 
reductions in the Cost of sales, 7%, and total costs, 17%. The 
reductions were driven by management’s cost saving initiatives, 
along with a reduction in Distribution costs and favourably impacted 
by the general weakening of the Kazakhstani tenge as some 75% of 
the Group’s Cost of sales were denominated in the local currency. 
Adversely impacting Underlying EBITDA were inventory destocking, 
with higher inventory costs carried over from 2008, losses incurred 
on foreign currency hedges and the introduction in 2009 of a Mineral 
Extraction Tax (‘MET’) in Kazakhstan.
Management maintained its ongoing focus on working capital and in 
2009 achieved a reduction in inventories to levels that better 
matched the lower sales volumes, while managing credit risks such 
that we have had no material default among our customers. We had 
a strong balance sheet with gross available funds of US$1,021 
million as at 31 December 2009 (2008: US$2,768 million), including 
cash and cash equivalents of US$830 million (2008: US$2,493 
million). During 2009 we paid a total of US$1,144 million for 
acquisitions, while property, plant and equipment expenditure 
amounted to US$912 million (2008: US$1,479 million). Outstanding 
debt as at 31 December 2009 amounted to US$428 million (2008: 
US$727 million), principally a trade finance facility to be repaid by 
December 2010. Operating cash flow was significantly impacted by 
market conditions, decreasing 56%, resulting in a net inflow of 
US$1,209 million (2008: US$2,766 million). We see our balance sheet 
and positive operating cash flow as key competitive advantages in 
the current environment and continue to manage this position 
prudently. 
Health & safety
Health and safety is a key priority for the Group. In 2009 we 
intensified our efforts with the implementation of a new safety 
management system which has improved the quality and coverage 
of our reporting. The total number of fatalities unfortunately rose, 
totalling 12 in 2009 (2008: 9). Any deaths are regrettable to us and 
we express our condolences to the families involved. The number of 
work-related injuries decreased to 64 (2008: 74). The Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’) declined to 0.63 (2008: 0.68) per one 
million hours worked. As the fatalities show, we still have some way 
to go before we can feel satisfied with our safety performance. The 
Group focused on improving its approach to health and safety based 
on its adoption, in 2008, of an aspiration of ‘zero injuries’ and in 
2009 launched a Safety Culture Improvement project which will be 
rolled out in full through 2010. 08
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Group Overview
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in 2009 was a little below 2008, amounting to 
US$1,147 million (2008: US$1,294 million). 2009 reflected the revision 
of our project plans in response to the changed market environment, 
with priority given to replacement and productivity capital expenditure. 
Project highlights in 2009 included: Ferroalloys Division – a second 
700 kt per annum pelletiser (operational July 2009); Alumina and 
Aluminium Division – the construction of the 125 kt per annum Phase 
2 of the aluminium smelter, to be completed in Q2 2010; and Energy 
Division – the installation of overburden stripping equipment, 
completed in Q1 2010, and an additional power unit. In July 2009, for 
commercial reasons, we withdrew from the concession for the 
construction of the China Gateway Project. 
In 2010 we reviewed our capital expenditure projects and reflected 
both our improved confidence in the future and the broadening 
range of opportunities. Only the ferroalloys expansion at Aksu 
currently remains a deferred project. Including new projects, mostly 
arising on acquisitions, total ‘in progress’ and ‘under review’ capital 
expenditure amounts to US$5.8 billion. Projects include: Ferroalloys 
Division – expansion and replacement of smelting capacity at 
Aktobe; Iron Ore Division – pelletiser and DRI/HBI plant, a conveyor 
complex and a mine expansion; Alumina and Aluminium Division – 
Phase 2 of the aluminium smelter, an alumina expansion and an 
anode plant; Energy Division – construction/reconstruction of two 
power units and new generating capacity of 1,200 MW. In the Other 
Non-ferrous Division we have reviewed the capital expenditure 
following the completion of the acquisition and have increased the 
planned capital expenditure on the copper and cobalt operations to 
US$455 million.
 
For the full year 2010, capital expenditure is expected to amount  
to approximately US$1.5 billion, including US$0.4 billion for  
capital repairs.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy. By leveraging 
our knowledge of mineral extraction, as well as our integrated 
energy and logistics capacity where possible, the Group will look  
to diversify its presence into other natural resources, both in the 
Eurasian region and elsewhere in the world. The Group remains 
interested in its core products, ferrochrome and iron ore, but is  
also looking at opportunities in other industrial metals, certain 
precious metals and in the energy sector, with a focus on low  
cost opportunities and projects close to being cash generative.  
We continue to maintain our tight financial discipline in  
evaluating opportunities.
In February 2009, we completed the acquisition from a related party 
of a 25% interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC (‘Shubarkol’) for a cash 
consideration of US$200 million less 25% of net debt. We believe 
that the acquisition of this stake strengthens the Group’s integrated 
business model, through securing a reliable and cost effective 
supply of semi-coke and relatively high quality thermal coal, and 
also enhances the Group’s position as a low cost producer. On 9 
November 2009 the Group declared unconditional the acquisition of 
CAMEC for a cash consideration of US$931 million. With CAMEC we 
acquired an African-focused emerging market mining company, with 
operations centred on copper and cobalt, a trucking and haulage 
businesses and a portfolio of potential development projects in coal, 
bauxite and fluorspar and platinum prospects. 
On 18 February 2010, the Group announced a cash offer to related 
parties for the acquisition of Enya Holdings BV (‘Enya’) which holds a 
90% interest in Chambishi Metals PLC (‘Chambishi’), a Zambian 
copper and cobalt producer, together with Comit Resources FZE 
(‘Comit’), a Dubai-based marketing and sales company. The 
aggregate cash consideration amounts to US$300 million. The 
Chambishi acquisition was completed in early April and the 
transaction overall was expected to be completed in April.
Taxation 
With effect from January 2009, the Republic of Kazakhstan 
introduced a new Tax Code including a reduction in the rate of 
Corporate Income Tax (‘CIT’) to 20% in 2009, the abolition of 
Royalties in conjunction with the introduction of MET and revisions 
to the basis of calculation of Excess Profits Tax (‘EPT’). In November 
2009, in response to the adverse changes in the global economic 
environment, the 2009 CIT and MET rates were extended for the 
period from 2010 to 2012. In 2009 the Group’s Effective Tax Rate 
was 26.2% – including a dividend withholding tax and EPT – broadly 
in line with previous guidance.
Exchange rate
On 4 February 2009 the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
announced that the tenge would be devalued against the US dollar 
by approximately 25% to about KZT150/US$. On 30 December 2009 
the Central Bank of Kazakhstan announced that, going forward, it 
would seek to maintain a wider currency range of KZT127.5/US$ to 
KZT165/US$. If the tenge were to appreciate this would add to the 
reported cost base of the Group, as it represents approximately 75% 
of the Group’s Kazakhstani businesses Cost of sales. 
Industry overview
The key driver of ferrochrome demand remains stainless steel 
production which in 2009 was believed to be 26.2 million tonnes

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
worldwide, below its 2007 peak of 28.5 million tonnes and around 
1% lower than the 26.4 million tonnes in 2008. Around 65% of 
ferrochrome is consumed by the stainless steel industry. Like many 
other metals markets the largest growth in recent years, in terms of 
both consumption and production of stainless steel, has been 
China, with the country emerging as the world leader in stainless 
steel. With China’s economic growth forecast to continue in 2010 
and beyond this situation is set to remain. In 2007, the record year 
for stainless steel production, China accounted for some 7.5 million 
tonnes; in 2010 China is forecast to produce almost 11 million 
tonnes. Even with only a limited recovery in the traditional markets 
2010 could emerge as a strong year for stainless steel production. 
Although fiscal stimulus packages are likely to be reduced during 
2010, and as initiatives such as car scrappage schemes are ended, 
some recovery in developed world consumption is forecast to 
continue. We had said in the past that a sustainable recovery in 
prices will only be possible when demand results in a significant 
increase in capacity utilisation in the ferrochrome industry. The 
recent price increases and more confidence in the economic 
recovery again turned attention to supply side constraints, such as 
electricity and logistics in South Africa. Overall, with uncertainties 
remaining for both demand and supply, some volatility can be 
expected to continue, but the overall outlook is positive.
For iron ore, our major competitive advantage is our low cost access 
to Northwest China, which facilitated a doubling of our shipments in 
2009 versus 2008. The ongoing industrialisation of our traditional 
markets in Northwest China, along with the improved access offered 
by the new China Gateway rail link in due course, will provide us with 
further opportunities to develop iron ore sales in China. In addition, 
the current improvement in the Russian steel industry is providing us 
with a recovery in iron ore sales volumes to The Magnitogorsk Iron 
and Steel Works Open Joint Stock Company (‘MMK’). 
Also, due to our low cost logistics position, as well as steady 
demand, shipments of alumina to Rusal in Russia were not materially 
affected by market conditions in 2009. However, in 2010, 
proportionately more of our alumina production will be absorbed by 
our aluminium smelter with the launch of Phase 2. 
In energy, our low cost position and market insight in electricity 
allowed us both to sell greater volumes into the region’s recovering 
market and utilise our own secure power in value-added metals 
production. Our current position in copper and cobalt is limited. 
However, we believe that the longer term demand fundamentals  
of copper are sound. This is underpinned by a weakening longer 
term supply outlook in the face of increasing demand from  
emerging markets.
Outlook 
Our confidence for 2010, in the sustainability of Chinese domestic 
demand growth and in the growth of other emerging markets, has 
improved, and is likely to offer a sustained increase in commodities 
demand. In addition, although signals remain mixed and short-term 
prospects are subdued, there are signs of stabilisation and even 
some growth emerging in the United States and Europe, whilst the 
outlook for Russia is better for 2010. 
We anticipate that product prices for the full year 2010 will be ahead 
of the averages that prevailed in 2009. We expect that production in 
2010 for our principal products will be at, or near capacity. 
Into 2010, with near full capacity production restored across our 
Kazakhstani businesses, maintaining our 2009 cost level will be 
difficult. We would anticipate some increase in costs: labour costs 
are set to rise broadly in line with local inflation; raw material and 
other input costs are increasing more significantly as the industry 
and global economy recover; whilst there is also the potential 
negative impact of a tenge appreciation. We do, however, expect to 
retain our advantaged relative low cost position. 
Save as set out in this report, there have been no material events, 
transactions or changes to the financial position of the Group since 
31 December 2009.

Key Performance Indicators
Business Review
This is a measure of the underlying profitability of the business. In 
2009 underlying EBITDA reduced sharply mostly due to significant 
falls in commodity prices from some record highs in 2008.
EPS tells us how much attributable profit per share is available for 
distribution to shareholders through dividends. Despite the impact of 
the economic downturn we were able to achieve an EPS which 
enabled us to maintain our dividend policy. 
ROCE measures how efficiently the Group’s capital is being used. 
Our 2009 ROCE was impacted by a combination of lower profits and 
our continuing significant capital investment programme which will 
deliver financial benefits in the long term. 
Our business is long term with operations often in remote areas 
where we are the principal employer. We recognise the key 
economic and social responsibilities that we have as a result. We 
have increased our community social investment despite the general 
economic pressures experienced by industry and the Group. This 
continued investment is part of our sustainable business model.
We recognise that we operate in a dangerous industry but we aspire 
to a target of zero work related injuries. Despite the Group’s 
endeavours in 2009, the number of fatalities regrettably increased. 
Many of the changes to work practices we are introducing require 
commitment over the long term and we have increased the 
accountability of senior management to ensure that focus on this 
important area is maintained.
In 2008 we started to implement a new safety management system, 
which has improved the quality and coverage of our reporting. In 
2009 the Group launched a safety culture improvement project, and 
had some success in reducing the incidence of injuries. We anticipate 
further improvements as it is rolled out in full throughout 2010.  GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION

During 2009, cost reductions were achieved across most of our 
products due to the success of anti-crisis measures along with the 
effects of the Kazakhstani tenge devaluation against the US dollar. 
This achievement was in spite of the impact of the introduction of 
MET and domestic inflationary pressures. Savings were made in 
input material prices as well as lower labour and repairs and 
maintenance costs in comparison to 2008 (refer to the Financial 
Review on pages 29 to 35). With full capacity restored across the 
Kazakhstani business, management anticipate some erosion of the 
absolute cost position in 2010 as raw material and other input costs 
are rising at around the local level of inflation, whilst there is also the 
potential negative impact of Kazakhstani tenge appreciation. We do 
however expect to retain our relative low cost advantage.

Risk Management
Introduction
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of Risk 
Management and Internal Control and for reviewing their 
effectiveness in operation. Further details are presented in the 
Corporate Governance Report on pages 48 to 50.
Effective systems of Internal Control:
play a key role in the management of risks that are significant to •	
the fulfilment of the Group’s business objectives; 
contribute to safeguarding the shareholders’ interests and the •	
Group’s assets; 
facilitate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations; •	
help ensure the reliability of internal and external reporting; and •	
assist compliance with laws and regulations. •	
Key business risks and the responses by executive 
management
This section sets out the key business risks being faced by the 
Group. Key business risks are those risks which have a high overall 
impact and likelihood risk rating in terms of the potential to adversely 
affect the Group’s ability to achieve its objectives. This section also 
includes a description of the ways in which executive management 
have responded to these risks.

The GDP of the Russian economy contracted by about 8% in 2009 
as a whole but grew in the last two quarters of the year. In 2010 
growth is expected to be around 3%.The Chinese economy 
sustained a high rate of GDP growth in 2009 of almost 9%. A 
number of forecasters believe that broadly this level of growth can 
be maintained for the medium term.

with which the Group trades brought about a decrease in demand 
for the Group’s products and also created downward pressure on 
sales prices. The Group, however, was able to leverage its 
geographic proximity to the growth market of China and in so doing 
mitigate the impact of the economic global slowdown as can be 
seen in the preceding table which shows an increased proportion of 
sales to China in 2009. Market conditions progressively improved 
throughout 2009 and are now much better than those experienced 
at the beginning of the year. 
Our confidence in the outlook for ENRC in 2010 is considerably 
stronger in relation to both the sustainability of growth in Chinese 
domestic demand, and to the growth prospects of the mature 
economies of Japan, Europe and the USA. We believe that there will 
continue to be commodity price volatility as a result of  
high levels of economic uncertainty and concern about the overall 
speed of global recovery. The medium to longer term fundamentals 
for commodities remain strong and the outlook is for China and  
the emerging economies to be the leaders on the road to  
sustainable recovery.
Response to the slowdown in the growth of the economies of key 
customers 
Management responded rapidly and decisively to the severe 
reduction in demand for the Group’s products in late 2008 and early 
2009 by: 
cutting ferroalloys, iron ore and energy production to match •	
customer demand; 
reducing inventories and actively concentrating on receivables; •	
re-evaluating capital expenditure; and •	
focusing on the control of costs in the face of significant pressure •	
on product prices. 
Progressively during 2009 management was able to advance 
production levels across those businesses and by the end of  
2009 production had been restored to approximately full  
available capacity.
We remain positive on the medium- and long-term growth prospects 
for the metal-intensive and export growth of the Chinese and 
Russian economies, with the particular benefit to ENRC of its 
strategic location. In addition there is significant sustained growth in 
the demand for industrial metals elsewhere in the industrialising 
world which, as with China and Russia, is based on their 
demographics, urbanisation and infrastructure requirements. The 
prospects for ENRC in all of these markets are enhanced by 
structural capacity shortages, notably in China, and supply 
constraints that are expected to emerge with a global economic 
recovery. The Group, with its tier one assets and the advantage of 
low cost production, is well positioned to seize opportunities in 
China and Russia and elsewhere in the world whilst benefiting from 
the progressive improvement in the stability of its long-term contract 
customer base.
Country risks 
The Group’s businesses could be adversely affected by any new 
regulations which are introduced by the Governments of the key 
countries in which the Group operates and trades, such as:
controls on imports, exports and sales prices; •	
terms of mining and other licences; •	
restrictions on foreign ownership of assets; •	
restrictions on the remittance of funds; and •	
new forms or rates of taxation, duties and royalties. •	
These risks are most relevant in relation to Kazakhstan, which 
continues to be the Group’s principal country of operation, but  
also, to a lesser extent, Russia, China and the DRC.
In addition, any increased requirements relating to regulatory, 
environmental and social approvals, in countries in which the Group 
has mining or production activities, could result in significant delays 
in the construction of new investment projects, and may adversely 
impact the economics of those projects, the expansion of existing 
operations and the financial results of the Group’s operations.
Response to country risks 
Senior management of the Group’s operations in Kazakhstan are 
engaged in an active dialogue with the Government of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan and with local authorities in many regions and towns 
within Kazakhstan, as well as directly with the Group’s workforce, to 
fully reflect the Group’s responsibilities to these stakeholders.
The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan is also a significant 
shareholder in the Group and two representatives of the Government 
are non-executive Directors and attend Board meetings. 
Through these different types of engagement with the Government 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan the Group is able to anticipate likely 
changes in regulations and to put in place plans to respond to 
changes whenever they may arise.
In DRC the management of the Group’s businesses have met with 
key Government officials at both national and regional level, 
including those responsible for mining. Management plan to 
establish effective working relationships with these officials and 
keep them informed about our plans for investment and for the 
development of the businesses. These relationships are going to be 
based on a mutual desire to improve the economy of the countries 
whilst at the same time developing the natural resources 
opportunities which are available in the areas to the benefit of the 
local communities and the Group.
Integration of acquired businesses
Some of our future growth will stem from acquisitions. There are 
numerous risks which may be encountered in business 
combinations, and we may not be able to successfully integrate 
acquired businesses which could negatively impact our financial 
condition and results of operations.
Response to risks in the integration of acquired businesses
The Group has formed a Mergers and Acquisitions Committee, 
which is a sub-committee of the Board, to oversee all acquisition 
activity including the agreement of acquisition targets, setting 
policies for due diligence activity and overseeing the process of due 
diligence, acquisition and subsequent integration into the Group. 
The committee has received delegated authority from the Board to 
finalise and execute acquisitions following Board approval. The 
committee is chaired by an independent non-executive Director and 
includes two other non-executive members of the Board. 
The Group also increased the number, seniority and experience of 
the in-house mergers and acquisitions team during 2009 and 
continues to employ external advice to supplement the in-house 
expertise. A strategic projects finance team has also been 
established in London. For each acquisition which the Group has 
made and for all prospective acquisitions a member of the Group’s 
senior management team is appointed to take responsibility for the 
integration of the acquired business.
The Group has gained valuable experience in the acquisition and 
ongoing integration of CAMEC and this will be applied to all future 
acquisitions, including Chambishi. Many of the management team 
involved in the ongoing CAMEC integration will also be responsible 
for the delivery of the Chambishi integration plan. 16

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Business Review
CAMEC acquisition
The Group acquired CAMEC in November 2009. CAMEC operates 
principally in the DRC, where it mines copper and cobalt and 
processes the ore in a company in which the State owned 
Gécamines is a minority 30% partner. 
The assimilation and integration of acquired businesses requires 
significant time and effort on the part of the Group’s senior 
management. Integration of new businesses, particularly in 
emerging markets, can be difficult, and potential problems may 
include, but would not be limited to:
Compliance with local and international regulations; •	
Harmonisation of corporate culture differences; •	
Alignment of HR policies and remuneration bases; •	
Operating in a new geographical environment and in new •	
commodity markets;
Roll-out of financial reporting procedures and unification of •	
accounting policies; 
Controlling acquired assets; and •	
Dealing with legacy issues. •	
Response to risks in the integration and management of the 
CAMEC businesses
The Group has engaged a Chief Executive Officer for ENRC in 
Africa, with extensive experience of mining in Africa, to manage the 
integration of Camec. He is being supported by a senior member of 
the Group’s Mergers and Acquisitions team who was involved in the 
due diligence process prior to acquisition. 
Human resource talent pool 
The Group’s growth and future success depend significantly upon its 
continued ability to attract, retain and motivate employees and key 
members of management and to adequately resource a wide range 
of development projects. Failure to adequately maintain the quality of 
the Group’s Human Resource pool could have an adverse impact on 
those projects or on existing operations. Despite the recent volatility 
in commodity prices and consequential impact on growth prospects 
in the industry there still exists an increasing demand for skilled 
personnel and contractors across a range of disciplines.
Response to human resource talent pool risks
We have continued to provide stimulating and challenging 
opportunities for all employees and this is attractive for both existing 
and prospective employees. The Group is committed to the 
recruitment of experienced staff across the Group, in London, 
Africa, Kazakhstan and in other countries in which the Group 
operates. In Kazakhstan the Group has developed a Succession 
Planning policy, a Talent Management Programme as well as 
planning to develop a Corporate Health Management Roadmap in 
2010. Further details of the Group’s commitment to the welfare, 
health and personal development of its employees is set out in detail 
in the Sustainability Review on pages 36 to 40. 
Capital projects 
The Group’s mining operations are capital intensive. The 
development and exploitation of mineral reserves and the acquisition 
of machinery and equipment require substantial capital expenditure. 
Capital projects are subject to a number of risks:
the project, whilst meeting the Group’s hurdle rate for investment, •	
may not be the most appropriate way to increase shareholder 
value;
the assumptions about future commodity prices, on which the •	
economic case for the investment was based, may prove to be 
too optimistic;
planned funding for the project may not be available when •	
required; 
the resources required to complete the project may not be •	
available in the right volume or at the right quality or price;
the implementation of the project may prove to be more complex •	
or technically difficult than originally envisaged and, in extreme 
cases, may not be possible to complete; and
the project may be completed but may be delivered late and/or at •	
a significantly higher cost than planned.
Response to capital project risks 
The Group has adopted policies and procedures which need to be 
applied before a capital project may obtain approval to proceed. In 
particular the technical and economic aspects of each significant 
project are subject to a detailed feasibility review and those projects 
that pass this review are then subject to further assessment by 
management.
All existing projects are subject to scrutiny by management at a 
quarterly review meeting to ensure that the bases and assumptions, 
on which the project was originally approved, continue to hold.
The Group has recently re-evaluated both expansionary and 
sustaining projects, as described in the section on Capital 
Expenditure on pages 34 to 35.
The Group has engaged external advisors to assist in the 
development of an effective investment appraisal methodology which 
will include a systematic way of assessing the potential future value 
of each proposed project against alternative uses of the funding. 
Risks to the achievement of operational objectives
Maintaining cost competitiveness
Information on the unit costs of the Group’s divisions in the years 
ended 31 December 2008 and 2009 is set out in the Financial 
Review on pages 29 to 35. 
In Q4 2008 the Group significantly reduced production volumes, 
notably in the Ferroalloys and Iron Ore Divisions, to a level which 
was consistent with expectations of sales. Capacity utilisation was 
progressively restored through 2009. By Q4 2009, production 
volumes in the Ferroalloys and Iron Ore Divisions in Kazakhstan had 
been restored to effectively full available capacity.

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Alumina
Aluminium
These changes in production volumes led, in the early parts of 2009, 
to increased operating costs per tonne of product at existing 
operations, as well as impacting the costs and schedules of 
investment projects.
Whilst reduced production volumes during 2008 and 2009 were a 
specific risk to the Group’s ability to operate a cost competitive 
business there continue to be other operational risks to the Group’s 
ability to maintain its cost advantage over competitors. 
The Group acquires a significant amount of goods and services from 
suppliers, contractors and other third parties for operational and 
capital expenditure purposes. In making these acquisitions the 
Group has the risk that goods or services may not be acquired on 
the most economical terms from suppliers and contractors.
Response to the risk of maintaining cost competitiveness
The Group’s businesses remain relatively low cost typically 
occupying the lower third of the cost curve. This remains a key 
advantage that we are focused on maintaining and, where possible, 
reinforcing, through the downturn and beyond. Crucial to our 
success is that our businesses remain underpinned by the security 
of our logistics and low cost energy supply. 
During 2009 the Group experienced a reduction in raw material input 
costs and many other costs of production and distribution, part of 
which related to the approximately 25% devaluation of the tenge 
against the US dollar in February 2009. In addition the Group 
entered into constructive discussions with employees to avoid 
compulsory redundancies but offset this by securing agreements on 
greater labour flexibility in terms of reduced working hours and lower 
levels of remuneration. As production returned to near-capacity 
levels, employment conditions were restored to pre-crisis levels. 
During 2009 domestic consumer price inflation (‘CPI’) in Kazakhstan 
was 6.2%. Whilst the Group’s businesses remain relatively low cost, 
cost control, and thus competitiveness, continues to be an area of 
great importance for the Group and one which will continue to be the 
subject of significant management focus throughout 2010.
The Audit Committee have formally approved a manual of Group 
Procurement policies which formalise earlier locally developed 
Policy Documents and control procedures to mitigate the risk of 
uneconomic procurement. These policies and procedures were 
rolled out to relevant employees in Kazakhstan and Russia during 
2009 and will be rolled out in Africa in 2010.
In addition the Group engaged Boston Consulting Group during 
2009 to carry out a wide ranging review of the Group’s procurement 
procedures and to make recommendations for improvements. These 
recommendations, and a re-emphasis of the need to improve 
management’s monitoring of compliance with the implementation of 
the Group Procurement procedures, will be the subject of training 
workshops in Kazakhstan during 2010.
Unexpected natural and operational catastrophes 
Our operational processes and locations may be subject to 
operational accidents. Our operations may also be subject to 
unexpected natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and flooding. 
Existing insurance arrangements may not provide cover for all of the 
costs that may arise from such events. The impact of these events 
could lead to disruptions in production and loss of facilities 
adversely affecting our financial results.
Response to the risk of unexpected natural and operational 
catastrophes 
We commissioned external consultants to complete a detailed 
review of the adequacy of the Group’s insurance cover in 
Kazakhstan in terms of the value of insurable assets and also to 
undertake risk surveys of our Kazakhstani operations and advise on 
the implementation of more effective contingency plans to mitigate 
the potential impact of these risks.
In August 2009 the Group improved the insurance coverage and 
policy limits of the Group’s Kazakhstani assets, in advance of the 
receipt of the reports from the external consultants. In March 2010 
the Group implemented a new insurance programme based on 
significantly enhanced assets values, coverage and terms.
During 2010 the Group’s operations will respond to the 
recommendations made by consultants in the risk surveys and the 
terms of the new insurance programme will be extended to the 
Group’s operations outside Kazakhstan. 
Risks to the achievement of compliance objectives
The Group is subject to laws and regulations in all the jurisdictions in 
which it operates and is committed to ensuring effective compliance 
with all its obligations; further details on the Group’s approach to 
compliance is set out in the Corporate Governance section on pages 
41 to 56.
Health, safety, environmental exposure and regulations 
The nature of the industry in which we operate means our activities 
are highly regulated by health, safety and environmental laws. As 
regulatory standards and expectations are constantly developing, 
we may be exposed to increased compliance costs and unforeseen 
environmental remediation expenses. 
Response to risks related to health, safety, environmental 
exposure and regulations 
This is covered in the Sustainability Review which is set out on 
pages 36 to 40.
Taxation
The Group is subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which it 
operates. There are inherent risks associated with the complexities 
of tax laws and regulations, potential differences in interpretation of 
the applicable legislation and continuous changes to tax laws and 
regimes. Cross border transactions also represent inherent risks as 
a result of being subject to different national tax rules which are not 
necessarily harmonised. An example of such inherent risk exposure 
is cross-border inter company transfer pricing.

Response to taxation risks
The Group management is committed to ensuring compliance with the tax requirements in every jurisdiction in which the Group operates 
and to both minimising and managing risks associated with taxation. The Group is also committed to building and maintaining good and 
constructive working relationships with the tax authorities in all countries in which the Group is subject to taxation.
 
In order to facilitate this approach the Group is developing its in-house team and seeking the advice of independent external consultants in 
complex and specialist areas. 
Risks to the achievement of financial objectives
Commodity prices 
Commodity Quarterly movements in sales prices in 2007/09 US$ impact
HC FeCr 5% reduction in sales price, relative to the 
average price of US$1,134 for 2009, would 
reduce underlying EBITDA by US$55 million 
Cr ore  5% reduction in sales price, relative to the 
average price of US$216 for 2009, would 
reduce underlying EBITDA by US$6 million 
Iron ore 5% reduction in sales price, relative to the 
average price of US$71 for 2009, would 
reduce underlying EBITDA by US$53 million
Alumina  5% reduction in sales price, relative to the 
average price of US$231 for 2009, would 
reduce underlying EBITDA by US$16 million 
Aluminium 5% reduction in sales price, relative to the 
average price of US$1,626 for 2009, would 
reduce underlying EBITDA by US$10 million 
The Group generates most of its revenue from the sale of commodities, primarily ferrochrome, chrome ore, iron ore, alumina and aluminium. 
From November 2009 the Group will also generate revenue from sales of copper and cobalt as a result of the acquisition of CAMEC  
and Chambishi. 
Historically, the prices for these products have been volatile and have fluctuated widely in response to changes in supply and demand, 
market uncertainty, the performance of the global or regional economies and cyclicality in industries that purchase these products. This 
was particularly evident in the last quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 when prices fell substantially. At the peak price in mid 2008 
HC FeCr was selling at a benchmark price of US$2.04 per lb of chrome but then fell as low as US$0.69 per lb of chrome in the second 
quarter of 2009 before recovering to US$1.03 per lb of chrome in the fourth quarter of 2009.
These external factors and the volatility of the commodity markets make it difficult to estimate future prices. A substantial or extended 
decline in commodity prices would materially and adversely affect the Group’s business and the financial results and cash flows of 
operations. However, the cost base of the ferroalloy industry has systematically increased as a result of increased energy and reductant 
costs whilst also suffering from the impact of currency appreciation. This has meant that the Group, due to its low cost base and integrated 
structure, is in an advantageous position relative to its peers.
Risk Management continued GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Response to commodity price risks 
The Group monitors market prices, global sales volumes and internal 
levels of inventory of key commodities to help inform production and 
sales planning decisions and avoid surplus inventory.
The management of the Sales and Marketing business produce 
regular forecasts of the sales volumes and prices for each of the 
Group’s commodities and discuss and agree appropriate production 
and distribution plans with the management of the Group’s operating 
companies on a regular basis in order to optimise revenue and meet 
customer needs.
The Group does not hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in 
the prices of its commodity products.
Credit default of key customers 
The impact of the current economic downturn has been to place 
increased financial pressure on the Group’s customers and on their 
ability to pay amounts due to the Group in accordance with agreed 
terms of trade. At the same time the Group’s traditional markets for 
obtaining credit insurance have significantly reduced. With a high 
concentration of sales to a small number of customers in our main 
divisions this is a significant risk for us.
Response to the risk of a credit default by key customers 
The Group’s response to the risk of a credit default by key customers 
has been to:
maintain close relationships with all its key customers but also to •	
develop new customer relationships in Russia, China and 
elsewhere to diversify customer default risk;
obtain credit insurance, where insurance cover is available, or •	
letters of credit against the risk of default by major customers;
review credit limits and payment terms for all major customers; •	
and
regularly monitor compliance with these terms and report •	
periodically to the Chief Financial Officer on any developments in 
the amounts receivable from customers and average days 
outstanding.
Financial counterparty default 
At 31 December 2009 the amounts invested with financial 
institutions were US$1,006 million. In making these investments the 
Group runs the risk that a counterparty may default on the 
repayment of the invested funds when they fall due. 
A number of financial institutions have been in default since the start 
of the global financial crisis but the Group had no exposure to these 
institutions and has not made any losses from its dealings with 
financial counterparties.
Response to financial counterparty default risk 
To minimise the risk of the default of a financial counterparty with 
which the Group has invested funds strict criteria for investment 
have been adopted and were approved by the Board in December 
2008. Investments may only be made with counterparties which are 
included on our Permitted Investment list. Individual counterparty 
exposure limits are based on published credit ratings or where these 
are not available, by an internal assessment of the counterparty’s 
financial strength.
On a regular basis the Group Treasury Committee reviews the credit 
ratings of all approved counterparties and may propose adjustments 
to the maximum credit limits. Any changes to credit limits require the 
approval of the Chief Financial Officer.
A consolidated counterparty exposure report is recalculated on a 
weekly basis and a monthly report is produced by the Group 
Treasurer for review by the Chief Financial Officer and is also 
included in the Treasury report for each Board meeting.
Foreign exchange rate exposure 
The presentational currency of the Group is the US dollar and the 
majority of sales are US dollar denominated. However, significant 
costs which are incurred in Kazakhstan are denominated in the 
Kazakhstani tenge and the Group has operational exposures to 
other foreign currencies.
Response to foreign exchange rate risks 
The Group considers the exposure to the Kazakhstani tenge to be 
an ongoing economic risk. Although there were hedges in place in 
2009 that were transacted in 2007, the Group is not currently 
entering into new contracts to actively hedge this exposure. 
Management review economic exposures on a regular basis. 20

Operating Review
Overview 
ENRC is a leading diversified natural resources group, performing 
integrated mining, processing, energy, logistics and marketing 
operations. The operations of the Group comprise: the mining and 
processing of chrome, manganese and iron ore; the smelting of 
ferroalloys; the production of iron ore pellets; the mining and 
processing of bauxite for the extraction of alumina and the 
production of aluminium; coal extraction and electricity generation; 
the transportation and sales of the Group’s products; and, the 
production of copper and cobalt. ENRC’s production assets are 
largely located in the Republic of Kazakhstan; other assets, notably 
the Other Non-ferrous Division, are mainly located in Africa. In 2009, 
the Group accounted for approximately 3% of Kazakhstan’s GDP. 
The Group currently sells the majority of its products to Russia, 
China, Japan, Western Europe and the United States. The Group’s 
entities in 2009 employed approximately 70,300 (2008: 67,600) 
people. For the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group had 
revenue of US$3,831 million (2008: US$6,823 million) and profit 
attributable to equity shareholders of US$1,045 million (2008: 
US$2,642 million). ENRC has six key divisions: Ferroalloys, Iron Ore, 
Alumina and Aluminium, Energy, Logistics and Other Non-ferrous. 
ENRC is a UK company with its registered office in London. ENRC’s 
shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange (‘LSE’) and the 
Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (‘KASE’). 
Production in the Ferroalloys Division was adversely affected by the 
much reduced demand for medium- and low-carbon ferrochrome 
and ferrosilicochrome and ferrosilicon. In contrast, high-carbon 
ferrochrome production in Kazakhstan remained broadly steady on 
2008. Ferroalloys capacity utilisation at Kazchrome in 2009 was 83% 
(2008: 90%), rising to about 97% in Q4 2009 with only one furnace 
not in production at the year end. Serov was more affected in 2009 
– as more capacity is committed to medium- and low-carbon 
ferrochrome – and had capacity utilisation of 51% for 2009 (Q2–Q4 
2008: 79%). At the end of 2009 Serov had 11 (of 17) furnaces in 
operation, with a capacity utilisation in Q4 2009 of about 77%. 
Similarly, the higher cost Tuoli high-carbon ferrochrome facility 
remained closed until late Q2 2009 and capacity utilisation was 32% 
through 2009 (Q4 2008: 19%). At the end of 2009 three (of four) 
furnaces were in operation, with a capacity utilisation in Q4 2009 of 
about 75%. 
Production of primary concentrate in the Iron Ore Division was 
broadly in line with 2008. Capacity utilisation in 2009 was 84% 
(2008: 86%). There was a switch in the production mix in H1 2009, as 
customer demand increased for the cheaper saleable concentrate 
product. In H2 2009 demand for pellet recovered and increased 
significantly with production more balanced in this period. In H2 
2009 overall primary concentrate capacity utilisation for the Iron Ore 
Division was 99% (H1 2009: 70%).
Production in the Alumina and Aluminium Division increased, with 
the benefit of a build-up in production at the aluminium smelter, 
which attained its full Phase 1 run rate in Q2 2008, and with Phase 2 
production partially initiated in late 2009. 
The Energy Division saw increased coal production and much 
increased electricity generation. These particularly reflected the 
recovery in the Group’s Kazakhstan-based production and greater 
third-party sales, and also increased power generation capacity 
being made available, having been taken off-line in late 2008 in 
response to the fall in demand. 
Logistics Division shipments recovered progressively through the 
year to be broadly in line with 2008.  GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION

The Group also benefited from the first-time contribution of the 
Other Non-ferrous Division, formerly Central African Mining & 
Exploration Company PLC (‘CAMEC’), in the last two months  
of 2009.
Description of ENRC’s businesses
The Group has six (2008: five) operating Divisions:
Ferroalloys Division
The Ferroalloys Division primarily produces and sells ferrochrome, as 
well as other ferroalloys, for use as alloying products in the production 
of steel, whilst manganese and chrome ore are sold to third-party 
producers of ferroalloys as well as the chemical industry. ENRC is the 
largest ferrochrome producer in the world by chrome content and the 
lowest cost producer of high-carbon ferrochrome. For the year ended 
31 December 2009, the Ferroalloys Division had revenue of US$1,871 
million (2008: US$4,151 million), which represented 48.8% (2008: 
60.8%) of the Group’s consolidated revenue. 
The Ferroalloys Division is vertically integrated, having its own 
chrome ore and manganese ore mines feeding its ferroalloy 
production in Kazakhstan, Russia and China. In addition to its own 
ore, the Division also benefits from competitively priced electricity 
supplied by the Energy Division, as well as having a gas-fired power 
station at its Aktobe plant.
Competitive position
In 2009 the Ferroalloys Division continued to have significant 
advantages over its major industry peers. Firstly, Kazakhstan – 
where the principal resource and production base is located – 
benefited from its proximity to China. Strong Chinese GDP growth in 
2009, fuelled by the large stimulus package injected into the 
economy by the Chinese government, spurred demand from its 
stainless steel industry which grew by nearly 20% in 2009, partially 
compensating for the decline in the mature economies of Europe, 
the USA and Japan. The Ferroalloys Division also gained from its 
vertical integration, which enabled it to capture value from owning 
and operating its mines and processing plants, supported by an 
integrated Energy Division with its own energy resources and the 
Group’s own logistics. The Division therefore continued to benefit 
from a secure and relatively low cost infrastructure, whilst many of 
its major peers saw energy costs increase considerably, particularly 
in South Africa. Kazakhstan ferrochrome is differentiated by its 
higher chrome content, typically about 69% as a function of the high 
quality ore, versus South African charge chrome with a chrome 
content of approximately 50% and higher silicon and iron contents. 
This limits the uses of charge chrome primarily to stainless steel 
smelting, against high-carbon ferrochrome which can be used 
universally for a wider range of alloy steels and castings produced in 
all types of furnaces. The ferrochrome quality of ENRC is more 
attractive to specialty steel producers as they prefer to limit trace 
elements, reduce the generation of slag and control the carbon 
content. This higher quality allows ENRC to maintain a more diverse 
customer base. Applications in the production of stainless steel, 
engineering and alloy steels, aerospace, foundry and powder 
metallurgy industries meant that ENRC was able to maintain 
comparatively high levels of capacity utilisation during 2009.  
The products used in these sectors include the full spectrum of 
high-, medium- and low-carbon ferrochrome, including sub 
speciality grades such as low-phosphorus, titanium and vanadium 
bearing ferrochrome.

Production
In response to the significant weakening in demand in H1 2009, 
production was cut back for the majority of ferroalloy products. In 
H1 2009 the rate of chrome ore extraction was lower than in H1 2008 
(H1 2009: 1,931 kt; H1 2008: 2,307 kt), due to the reduced market 
demand for both ore and chrome ferroalloys. In H2 2009 production 
recovered to above the level of the comparable period in 2008 (H2 
2009: 2,446 kt; H2 2008: 2,024), in response to improved demand 
and the fact that all low-grade ore stockpiles had been processed  
by the end of 2008. Chrome ore extraction in 2009 was broadly 
steady, rising 1.1% to 4,377 kt, or 4,273 kt excluding Serov (2008: 
4,331 kt; or 4,207 kt excluding Serov). However, at the same time, 
saleable chrome ore production in 2009 decreased 6.4% to 3,398 kt 
(of which Serov: 65 kt) (2008: 3,629 kt; of which Serov: 77 kt). The 
internal consumption of saleable chrome ore increased to 72.6% 
(2008: 71.5%). 
Manganese ore extraction declined 1.7% to 2,252 kt (2008: 2,290 kt). 
In response to a drop in demand there was a fall of 11.7% in saleable 
manganese ore production. Production recovered progressively 
through 2009 accompanying an improvement in the market. 22
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Business Review
In 2009 the Ferroalloys Division produced 1,161 kt of ferrochrome, 
2.9% lower than in 2008 (2008: 1,196 kt); including Serov, 105 kt 
(Q2-Q4 2008: 118 kt) and Tuoli, 28 kt (Q4 2008: 4 kt). The main 
reductions were in medium-carbon (down 62.3%; 2009: 26 kt; 2008: 
69 kt) and low-carbon (down 15.1%; 2009: 62 kt; 2008: 73 kt) 
ferrochrome production. At the same time production of the principal 
product – high-carbon ferrochrome – increased 1.8% (2009: 1,073 
kt; 2008: 1,054 kt). Production of ferrosilicomanganese increased 
12.2% (2009: 165 kt; 2008: 147 kt).
For 2009, there was a 6.8% decrease in total ferroalloys production 
to 1,446 kt (2008: 1,551 kt).
Supply and demand
The ferrochrome market faced significant oversupply as a result of 
the speed of the impact of the global recession with inventory having 
increased through the supply chain by more than 1 million tonnes. 
The industry responded with significant cutbacks in capacity 
utilisation with effective production levels as low as 35% for the 
industry being recorded in Q1 2009 before recovery started to feed 
through in Q2 2009. A progressive improvement in demand and 
declining inventory levels, as economies around the world recovered 
resulted in ferrochrome production increasing through the year. 
South Africa remained the world’s largest geographic source of 
ferrochrome supply to the stainless steel industry, comprising 
approximately 37% of 2009 global production (2008: 45%) with an 
effective operating capacity rate of around 55%. ENRC remained the 
second largest supplier at 17% (2008: 14%) and continued 
operations in Kazakhstan at about 90% of available capacity for 
2009. Whilst the relative prices of ferrochrome and charge chrome 
fluctuate according to the supply-demand balance, the quality and 
chemistry of Kazakhstani high-carbon ferrochrome has traditionally 
commanded a premium to charge chrome.
Sales and pricing
The slowdown in the stainless steel industry, the primary consumer 
of ferrochrome, coupled with a large inventory build-up for the 
industry globally, meant that the quarterly benchmark price, the 
mechanism by which the global ferrochrome price is set, declined 
US$1.06 per pound of chrome for Q1 2009 and a further US$0.10 
per pound of chrome for Q2 2009, to US$0.69 per pound of chrome. 
With major destocking in the ferrochrome industry having effectively 
ended by the end of Q2 2009, and an improved economic outlook in 
the mature economies, Q3 2009 saw a much tighter supply-demand 
situation as stainless production reached a level of 80% capacity 
utilisation. At the same time, scrap availability tightened, due to 
lower economic activity and, with increasing ferrochrome demand, 
this added to increased tightness in supply. In addition, South 
African charge chrome producers were hindered by rising costs, 
with the effect of raising the floor cost of ferrochrome. This supply-
demand condition continued into Q4 2009, resulting in an increase in 
the contract price by US$0.20 per pound of chrome in Q3 2009 and 
a further increase in Q4 2009 of US$0.14 per pound of chrome to 
US$1.03 per pound of chrome. 
Demand for medium- and low-carbon ferrochrome was adversely 
affected by the economic slowdown, particularly as they are very 
much dependent on the automotive, engineering steel and capital 
project sectors. Similar to charge and high-carbon ferrochrome, 
prices fell in Q1 2009 from the high levels seen in mid-2008, 
returning to the levels seen at the end of 2007. Chrome ore demand, 
affected by ferrochrome production, as China reduced its purchases 
due to excess inventory build up, was estimated at over 2 million 
tonnes at the start of 2009. Demand was further impacted by 
reduced demand from the chemical industry. With excess supply, 
prices fell in Q1 2009 and only recovered from Q2 2009 as demand, 
driven by China’s ferrochrome industry, fed the stainless steel 
industry improving demand. 
Manganese alloys, which are primarily used in the production of 
carbon steel and are particularly dependent on the construction and 
automotive sectors, were significantly affected by the economic 
downturn. This directly impacted on manganese ore sales due to 
reduced carbon steel production and a reduced demand for 
manganese alloys. With excess stocks, reduced demand and excess 
capacity, manganese and alloy products saw a significant decline in 
prices in the early part of the year with a recovery accompanying 
demand late in 2009. 
In 2009, the Ferroalloys Division’s top five customers accounted for 
34.7% (2008: 26.8%) of the Division’s third-party sales revenue. 
The following table sets out the Ferroalloys Division’s volume of 
third-party sales by product for the years ended 31 December 2009

28.1%) in Western Europe; 17.3% (2008: 20.4%) in Russia; 12.8% 
(2008: 19.9%) in Japan; 7.9% (2008: 8.1%) in North America; 7.7% 
(2008: 7.0%) in South Korea and the Far East; and 4.3% (2008: 5.3%) 
in the rest of the world. 
Key initiatives
The key objectives for the Ferroalloys Division are: to expand 
operations with substantial margins and returns on capital based on 
the low-cost, large scale and high-grade ore resources available to 
the Group; to reduce production costs by replacing outdated 
equipment; to further strengthen the Group’s leading market position 
in ferroalloys worldwide; and to improve the environmental and 
safety performance of the Division.
In 2009, the Group completed the construction of a second chrome 
ore pelletising plant at Donskoy GOK with a capacity of 700 kt per 
annum. The project was completed on schedule and was 
operational from early July. The pelletising plant also produces 
saleable products from the output of an enrichment plant. The total 
investment amounted to US$120 million. 
A second enrichment plant at Donskoy GOK was put into operation 
in H2 2009. Construction of the blending depository is expected to 
be complete in Q3 2010. Total capital expenditure is approximately 
US$40 million. 
The investment programme of the Ferroalloys Division also includes 
the construction of new Direct Current (‘DC’) furnaces at the Aktobe 
plant at a cost of approximately US$590 million, with completion 
planned for 2012. This project is expected to enhance productivity

and generate substantial cost savings, particularly for key input 
materials such as reductants, including coke. Further, the installation 
of modern smelting furnaces is expected to result in significant 
environmental and safety improvements.
Iron Ore Division
The Iron Ore Division operates the largest iron ore mining and 
processing enterprise in the Republic of Kazakhstan and produces 
and sells iron ore concentrate and pellets primarily to steel 
producers. On the basis of 2009 data the Group is believed to be a 
material exporter of iron ore and in the lowest third of the cost curve. 
The Iron Ore Division’s operations include iron ore mines, crushing, 
beneficiation and pelletising plants and a thermal power station.
Competitive position
The Iron Ore Division has some significant strategic advantages over 
its major competitors. First, the location of the Group’s large-scale 
iron ore reserves in northern Kazakhstan provides access to the 
important customer base of steel production plants in Russia, China 
and Kazakhstan, with relatively low transportation costs. In 
particular, the Group’s facilities are located within 340 kilometres of 
its largest customer, MMK, and this proximity provides significant 
logistical and cost advantages. Second, the Division operates 
large-scale iron ore mines and processing plants with relatively low 
production costs. This cost advantage is largely driven by the 
relatively low cost of electricity, due to the Group’s own power 
generation capacity. 
Production summary
The following table sets out the production volumes for the Iron Ore 
Division’s principal saleable products for the years ended 31 
December 2009 and 31 December 2008:
Years ended 31 December 2009 vs  
 2008 2009 2008
Run-of-Mine ore

Saleable 
concentrate ’000 t 8,541 7,835 9.0%
Saleable pellets ’000 t 6,182 6,952 (11.1)%
Production
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the Iron Ore Division  
had revenue of US$1,093 million (2008: US$1,498 million),  
which represented 28.5% (2008: 22.0%) of the Group’s  
consolidated revenue. 
Iron ore extraction improved steadily from the cutbacks initiated in 
Q4 2008, with Q3 and Q4 2009 volumes at full capacity. Total 
extraction for the full year 2009 fell 3.0% to 36,604 kt (2008: 37,751 
kt), nonetheless a better result than we had expected at the 
beginning of 2009.
In response to recovering demand, primary iron ore concentrate 
production also increased through 2009. This enabled the Group to 
limit its production decline to 1.9%, producing 15,197 kt (2008: 
15,487 kt) of primary concentrate. Primary concentrate is used for 
saleable concentrate and pellet production; saleable concentrate 
increased 9.0% from the prior year (2009: 8,541 kt; 2008: 7,835 kt), 
but there was a significant decline in saleable pellet of 11.1% (2009: 
6,182 kt; 2008: 6,952 kt). The change in the mix of production 
reflected demand, with customers switching to less expensive 
concentrate in H1 2009; however, pellet recovered in H2 2009. As a 
result, the total annual saleable products (concentrate and pellet) 
volume in 2009 was broadly similar to 2008 (2009: 14,723 kt; 2008: 
14,787 kt). 
The customer sales mix for iron ore improved, reducing the Group’s 
historic dependence on a single large customer (MMK), with the 
expansion of the Group’s business in the Chinese market. For 2009 
Chinese customers share of total sales volume increased to 42.9% 
(2008: 20.5%).
Supply and demand
The market for iron ore is primarily regional, as iron ore is a bulk 
commodity and, relative to its value, is expensive to transport. 
China, Brazil and Australia are the largest producers of iron ore, 
accounting for respectively, 39%, 17% and 16% of global output in 
2009, based on crude ore. Other significant producers include the 
CIS and India. Global production of iron ore was 2,300 million tonnes 
in 2009, ahead 3.6% compared with 2008.
Typically, steel production and, as a result, demand for iron ore, 
follows the overall growth in industrial production. Depressed by 
weak steel production in late 2008 and H1 2009, leading iron ore 
producers reduced production and deferred expansions in H1 2009. 
Global demand for iron ore gradually recovered in H2 2009, and iron 
ore producers reported production increases in H2 2009.
Sales and pricing 
With the economic downturn affecting the business of one of the 
Group’s principal customers, MMK, the Group agreed to temporarily 
waive the minimum contractual volume of the long-term sales 
contract from Q4 2008 up to Q1 2010. Contractual sales are 
reviewed on a regular basis, taking into account developing market 
conditions. The MMK contract price is determined by reference to 
published world price benchmarks for iron ore concentrate and 
pellet. In 2009 MMK accounted for 52.6% (2008: 64.1%) of the Iron 
Ore Division’s revenue and 8.8 million tonnes of saleable product.
Other iron ore markets for the Group are China and Kazakhstan. In 
2009 the run rate of iron ore sales to China was approximately twice 
that of the comparable period in 2008, at approximately 6 million 
tonnes per annum, and close to our maximum logistics capacity 
ahead of the Government of Kazakhstan completing the China 
Gateway project. Sales in Kazakhstan were minimal in 2009.
Affected by the soft steel market between Q4 2008 and Q2 2009, 
when spot iron ore prices fell below contract prices, the benchmark 
for 2009–10 was not finalised until late June between the major iron 
ore producers and the principal European and Japanese steel 
makers. The benchmark price reduced on average by around 30% 
for fines and by around 48% for pellets. The global market 
subsequently improved, especially demand from China, which was 
very strong; the spot iron ore market saw a further marked recovery 
in Q4 2009. Consequently, leading iron ore producers have strong 
confidence of a marked increase in the prices for 2010–2011. The 
changes in the iron ore benchmark pricing system are being closely 
watched and the implications assessed.

large-scale deposits of iron ore and low cost energy; and to further 
diversify the sales geography, product and customer mix.
The investment programme of the Division has been revised and 
feasibility studies are now being undertaken for the construction of a 
5 million tonnes per annum pelletiser and a Direct Reduced Iron/Hot 
Briquetted Iron (‘DRI/HBI’) plant with a capacity of 1.4 million tonnes 
per annum. The total project cost is estimated to be US$850 million. 
To support growing production the Division is planning an expansion 
of its ore base. Expansion includes six existing mines as well as the 
development of a new deposit. The estimated expenditure to 
increase iron ore extraction volumes by 10 million tonnes per annum 
amounts to US$535 million.
Other expansion initiatives under review are:
The construction of a cyclic conveyor complex at Karchasky pit •	
at SSGPO. The investment would allow the Division to increase 
Karchasky’s ore extraction capacity to 23 million tonnes per 
annum; and
The expansion of the concentrating factory to 16 million tonnes •	
per annum of iron ore.
Alumina and Aluminium Division
The Alumina and Aluminium Division produces and sells alumina to 
aluminium producers, and also produces and sells the Group’s own 
aluminium. ENRC believes, based on 2009 data, that the Alumina 
and Aluminium Division is the world’s sixth largest supplier of traded 
alumina by volume and is at the lower end of the global industry cost 
curve for alumina and aluminium.
The Alumina and Aluminium Division’s vertically integrated 
operations include: bauxite mines; a limestone mine; an alumina 
refinery; an aluminium smelter; and a power station. The smelter 
allows the Alumina and Aluminium Division to process its own 
alumina into aluminium. Last year was the second year of operation 
of ENRC’s aluminium smelter – the Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter 
(‘KAS’) – which reached its run rate capacity of 125 kt per annum in 
Q2 2008. Construction of a further 125 kt annual capacity, bringing 
the total annual capacity to 250 kt per annum, is well underway and 
is expected to be completed no later than Q2 2010, well ahead of the 
original schedule.
Competitive position
The Division’s focus on cost control, with the implementation of 
several cost-reduction programmes in 2009, enabled ENRC to retain 
its competitive cost position. The Group’s bauxite reserves 
guarantee an on-going low-cost supply of raw materials for alumina 
production. Alumina and aluminium production benefit from the 
ability to buy low-cost energy from internal Group sources. As a 
result, ENRC’s alumina and aluminium are both at the lower end of 
the industry cost curves.

For the year ended 31 December 2009, the Alumina and Aluminium 
Division had revenue of US$563 million (2008: US$864 million) 
representing 14.7% (2008: 12.7%) of the Group’s consolidated revenue. 
The Alumina and Aluminium Division extraction of bauxite was 
broadly steady at 5,130 kt (2008: 5,160 kt), as was alumina 
production at 1,608 kt (2008: 1,600 kt). 
The aluminium smelter achieved its Phase 1 run-rate production 
target of 125 kt per annum in Q2 2008. Since then the Division has 
been producing aluminium at the planned Phase 1 capacity rate, 
consuming its own alumina. In 2009 the smelter consumed 249 kt, or 
15.5%, of the Group’s alumina production (2008: 209 kt, or 13.1%). 
The increase in the internal consumption of alumina was due to half 
of the Phase 2 pots being charged with alumina and put into 
operation in December 2009. The increased production of aluminium 
in 2009 reflected the ramp-up in production in 2008 being effective 
in 2009.
Supply and demand
Global alumina production is estimated to have been approximately 
74.8 million tonnes in 2009 (2008: 77.7 million tonnes). Total 
aluminium production in 2009 is estimated to have been 36.8 million 
tonnes (2008: 40.0 million tonnes) of which 13 million tonnes, or 
35%, was from China. 
After a weak start to the year, as a result of the global economic 
crisis, demand for aluminium started to pick up in mid-2009, 
although commentators have suggested that a significant proportion 
of physical aluminium stocks were tied up in financial transactions. 
Worldwide aluminium stocks at the London Metal Exchange (‘LME’) 
stood at 4.6 million tonnes at the end of 2009, double the 2.3 million 
tonnes at the beginning of the year, with total inventories at 10 weeks 
consumption. Stronger demand combined with reduced availability 
of physical metal drove up the LME aluminium cash price in 2009 
from its February low of US$1,254 per tonne to US$2,208 per tonne 
at the end of the year. The average price in 2009 was US$1,662 per 
tonne (2008: US$2,574 per tonne). Consumption of aluminium is 
believed to have fallen in 2009 by about 2.9 million tonnes, or 8%, to 
34.5 million tonnes. Production of aluminium is estimated to have 
fallen in 2009 by 2.6 million tonnes, or 6.5%. ENRC believes 
aluminium production in 2009 to have exceeded consumption by as 
much as 3 million tonnes. Many aluminium producers implemented 
significant cuts in production capacity. ENRC believes these cuts to 
be mostly permanent at Western smelters but anticipates lots of 
idled capacity, notably in China, to be restarted, driven by the LME 
aluminium price having risen to levels above US$2,000 per tonne.
ENRC believes that in 2010 the aluminium production surplus will be 
more limited as consumption is expected to rise by as much as 10%. 
Restarting of idle capacity, LME-inventories becoming available for 
consumption and new capacity coming on-stream are factors which 
ENRC believes could negatively affect the LME aluminium price in 
2010. Cost inflation of input materials, increased demand, and an 
ongoing influx of investors’ funds into aluminium as an investment 
instrument are factors ENRC believes could positively affect the 
LME aluminium price in 2010.
Sales and pricing
In 2009, the Group sold 1.4 million tonnes (2008: 1.4 million tonnes) 
of alumina to United Company RUSAL (‘UC RUSAL’) of Russia under 
a long-term supply contract that expires in 2016. The pricing under 
this contract is linked as a percentage to the LME cash price of 
primary aluminium. In 2009 UC RUSAL, the Division’s largest single 
customer accounted for 55.6% (2008: 60.2%) of the Division’s sales

revenue. The balance of alumina production is consumed by the 
Group at its aluminium smelter.
The Group sold 125 kt of primary aluminium in 2009, of which 31 kt 
was delivered to new customers located in Russia, Kazakhstan,  
and the Ukraine. Other sales of aluminium were by way of a 
distribution agreement with Glencore International. The LME 
aluminium spot price serves as the basis for the pricing of all of 
ENRC’s aluminium contracts.
In June 2009 the LME approved the listing of primary aluminium 
ingots produced at ENRC’s aluminium smelter, KAS. 
The following table sets out the Alumina and Aluminium Division’s 
volume of third-party sales by product for the years ended 31 
December 2009 and 31 December 2008:
Years ended 31 December 2009 vs  
 2008 2009 2008
Alumina ’000 t 1,359 1,393 (2.4)%
Aluminium ’000 t 125 104 (20.2)%
LME aluminium prices in 2009 fell to levels not seen since the 
beginning of 1999. The economic crisis drove prices lower, 
particularly in Q1 2009, as demand fell faster than the reduction  
in production capacity. The Division’s average sales price for 
aluminium in 2009 was US$1,605 per tonne (2008: US$2,571  
per tonne).
Key initiatives
The Alumina and Aluminium Division’s principal strategic objectives 
are: to increase the capacity of aluminium production in Kazakhstan; 
to exploit the Group’s low-cost electricity, bauxite and alumina; and 
to reduce costs.
The Phase 2 expansion of the aluminium smelter by an additional 
125 kt per annum is ahead of schedule, and half of the Phase 2 pots 
were put into operation at the end of 2009. The new 250 kt per 
annum run rate capacity is expected to be operational in Q2 2010. 
The construction of an anode plant will allow the Group to be 
independent of third-party suppliers and to provide sufficient 
anodes for the increased aluminium production. The plant is planned 
to be commissioned in 2011. Total capital expenditure for Phase 2 of 
the aluminium smelter and the construction of the anode plant is 
US$500 million.
To support the growing production of aluminium the Group made a 
decision to resume its deferred expansion of alumina production. By 
mid-2011 we expect to achieve an alumina capacity of 1.7 million 
tonnes per annum. This investment will allow the Division to maintain 
existing sales to customers and provide sufficient alumina for 
internal consumption. 
Energy Division
The Energy Division is one of the largest electricity providers in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, accounting for approximately 17.2% of the 
country’s recorded electricity production in 2009 (2008: 14.5%). 
Taking into account all of the energy generation facilities of ENRC, 
including SSGPO, the alumina refinery (Aluminium of Kazakhstan 
(‘AOK’)) and the Aktobe ferroalloys smelter, the share of 
Kazakhstan’s energy production was 23.5% in 2009 (2008: 20.2%). 
The Energy Division provides a cost-effective energy supply to the 
Group’s principal Kazakhstani operating divisions, as well as 
producing a surplus for sales to third parties in Kazakhstan. For the 
year ended 31 December 2009, the Energy Division had revenue of 
US$402 million (2008: US$436 million) – of which US$196 million 
was derived from third-party sales (2008: US$203 million) – 
representing 5.1% (2008: 3.0%) of the Group’s consolidated revenue.

Production
In 2009, the Energy Division extracted 20,059 kt (2008: 19,790 kt) of 
coal from the Vostochny mine, an increase of 1.4%. The Division’s 
internal coal consumption increased 16.6% to 8,338 kt, or 41.6% of 
total extraction (2008: 7,148 kt; 36.1%), as higher volumes of 
electricity were produced. Sales of coal to other Group Divisions 
saw a limited decline, falling 2.7% to 4,646 kt, or 23.2% of total 
extraction, (2008: 4,773 kt; 24.1%). There was also a 9.5% decrease 
in external coal sales to 7,280 kt (2008: 8,044 kt), representing 
36.3% (2008: 40.6%) of coal mined, reflecting a milder winter in 
2008–2009 and reduced demand due to lower economic activity in 
2009. Coal extraction during 2009 changed from quarter to quarter, 
based on the usual seasonal changes in demand.
Electricity generation increased sharply, ahead 15.8%, to 13,478 
GWh (2008: 11,640 GWh), as more capacity was available; in 2008 a 
turbine block was out of service for planned refurbishment and other 
capacity was taken off-line in response to the reduced demand in 
H2 2008. The proportion of sales of electricity to other Group 
Divisions decreased to 60.8% of electricity generated (2008: 68.5%). 
Sales of electricity to other Group Divisions increased from quarter 
to quarter, reflecting improved activity, notably in the Ferroalloys and 
Iron Ore Divisions.

Sales and pricing – Coal
Weak demand from the industrial and power sectors affected coal 
output both in the Republic of Kazakhstan and Russia, each 
declining some 9% in 2009. In the Republic of Kazakhstan, ENRC 
sold 3.0 million tonnes of coal to third parties (2008: 3.1 million 
tonnes) at an average sales price of KZT850 (US$5.76) per tonne 
(2008: KZT721 (US$5.99) per tonne), an increase of 17.9% in local 
currency terms. Russian utilities reduced their coal imports from 
Kazakhstan. The decline in imports was prompted by a fall in 
electricity generation in Russia and also by the desire of utilities to 
diversify their supply sources. The Energy Division sold 4.3 million  26
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Business Review
tonnes of coal to Russia (2008: 5.0 million tonnes). The average 
annual selling price to Russian customers in US dollars decreased 
13.8% to US$21.2 per tonne (2008: US$24.6 per tonne). 
Sales and pricing – Electricity
Domestic electricity consumption in Kazakhstan declined in 2009. 
Domestic power producers operated with idled capacity due to 
weak electricity demand in H1 2009. Improvements in economic 
conditions and industrial demand led electricity demand to recover 
in H2 2009. In 2009 electricity generation in Kazakhstan fell 2% to 
78.4 billion kWh; total electricity consumption declined 3% to 77.9 
billion kWh. In 2009 the Group’s internal consumption of electricity 
was marginally ahead, however, Energy Division sales of electricity 
to third parties rose 52.5%, due to rising demand and to the increase 
in available capacity. The average sales price to third parties in local 
currency increased 11.3% to KZT2.95 (US 2.00 cents) per kWh 
(2008: KZT2.65 (US2.20 cents) per kWh). As the electricity market in 
Kazakhstan recovers, we anticipate growth in consumption. The 
Government of Kazakhstan has imposed restrictions on annual price 
increases for local sales until 2015.
Key initiatives
The Energy Division’s principal strategic objectives are: to provide 
low-cost power and coal for the Group’s existing operations, utilising 
its large scale coal reserves; and a progressive expansion of 
production in Kazakhstan. Additional energy capacity will ensure the 
power supply to the Group’s Kazakhstan operating Divisions and 
allow the Group to maintain its presence in Kazakhstan’s wholesale 
power market.
The investment programme of the Division included: 
Installation of overburden stripping equipment at a cost of US$85 •	
million was completed in Q1 2010. This investment consists of 
equipment for the continuous extraction, crushing, transportation 
and stockpiling of overburden with a processing capacity of 10 
million cubic metres per annum. This should improve the 
efficiency of coal production; in addition the machinery and 
processes were selected to satisfy environmental requirements.
Construction of a new power unit with an investment of •	
approximately US$230 million, Phase 1 will be completed by the 
end of 2010, and Phase 2 in early 2011. Total additional installed 
electricity generating capacity is expected to be 325MW.
The reconstruction of power unit 6 at Aksu, upgrading its •	
capacity to 325 MW, at an estimated cost of US$230 million, is 
planned to be complete by the end of 2012. It is intended to 
achieve savings on fuel consumption, whilst environmental 
emissions will be reduced by the implementation of up-to-date 
filters.
The Group has renewed feasibility work on the construction of •	
two 600 MW power units. In addition the Group is undertaking 
feasibility work on expanding coal extraction by 5 million tonnes 
per annum, to maintain current coal sales volumes in addition to 
requirements for the new power units.
Logistics Division
The Logistics Division provides transportation and logistics services 
to the Group’s principal Kazakhstani operating Divisions and to third 
parties. The Division’s operations include freight forwarding, wagon 
repair services and railway construction and repair services. The 
availability of these services within the Group mitigates many of the 
risks associated with the supply of raw materials and delivery of 
products to customers. In addition, the Division operates a railway 
transfer and reloading terminal on the Kazakhstan/China border, 
facilitating the Group’s access to the Far East market.
Production summary

Production
In 2009 the Logistics Division transported 58,181 kt (2008: 58,489 kt) 
of products by railway, broadly in line with volumes in 2008. The 
share of third-party freight forwarding declined to 10.2% (2008: 
19.2%) due to increased logistics demand for the Group’s own 
production. In 2009 the tonnage of the Group’s products transported 
by railway grew 10.5% (2009: 52,223 kt; 2008: 47,241 kt).
External railroad repair service volumes decreased to 198 kilometres 
(2008: 408 kilometres), due to lower demand from the State railway 
company of Kazakhstan. 
Key initiatives – Withdrawal from the China Gateway Project
In July 2009 ENRC agreed with the Government of Kazakhstan that 
it would not proceed with the China Gateway Project, a rail link with 
China. ENRC did not reach agreement with the Government on the 
sharing of risks, and the Group therefore felt unable to proceed with 
a project that was not offering sufficient value accretion to 
shareholders. On 23 October 2009 the Group signed an assignment 
agreement with the Ministry of Transport and Communication of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan and the National Railway Company 
Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (‘KTZ’) for ENRC to receive a total of US$7 
million to cover its initial project costs. 
Other Non-ferrous Division
The Other Non-ferrous Division operates principally in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (‘DRC’), where it mines copper and 
cobalt and processes the ore at Luita, in a joint venture with the 
State-owned Gécamines as a minority (30%) partner. The Division 
was formed by the acquisition of CAMEC on 9 November 2009. The 
business is in the process of developing its large copper reserves 
and investment is planned that will increase copper oxide production 
to 75 kt per annum within approximately three years. In addition the 
Division is the world’s largest independent cobalt concentrate 
producer, producing about 10% of global demand. On the basis of 
2009 data it is believed that the Other Non-ferrous Division could 
become one of the world’s most significant exporters of copper and 
cobalt and be in the lowest quartile of the copper industry cost 
curve. The Other Non-ferrous Division’s copper and cobalt 
operations include open cast mines, crushing, beneficiation, 
concentrator plants and an electro-winning facility. A cobalt solvent 
extraction (‘SX/EW’) plant, for the production of cobalt metal, is 
expected to be commissioned in H2 2010. In addition, the Other 
Non-ferrous Division includes a road logistics business operating in 
Central and Southern Africa and a number of development 
prospects: Mozambique – coal; Mali – bauxite; Zimbabwe – 
platinum; and South Africa – fluorspar.
On 18 February 2010, the Group announced that it had entered into 
a conditional agreement for the acquisition from related parties of 
Enya Holdings BV (‘Enya’) which holds a 90% interest in Chambishi

Metals PLC (‘Chambishi’), a Zambian copper and cobalt producer, 
together with Comit Resources FZE (‘Comit’), a Dubai-based 
marketing and sales company that historically has handled 
Chambishi’s copper and cobalt sales. The Chambishi acquisition 
was completed in early April and it will be integrated into the Other 
Non-ferrous Division.
Competitive position
The Other Non-ferrous Division’s copper and cobalt capacity enjoys 
significant strategic advantages. The DRC contains a significant 
proportion of the world’s copper resources outside of Chile. The 
copper rich deposits are well endowed with both readily exploitable 
oxide and sulphide ores. The business is in the process of 
developing its copper reserves, with an estimated contained copper 
resource of 1,478 kt at 2.6% copper content. It is expected that the 
available grades and volumes, and additional capital expenditure, 
will enable the growth of copper production very substantially ahead 
of the current production capacity of about 20 kt per annum and 
investment will enable the production of copper cathode Grade A – 
the Group is currently targeting production to reach 75 kt per annum 
over three years.
The DRC contains the world’s largest cobalt reserves, almost half of 
the world’s supply, with some of the highest grades available. The 
business is in the process of exploiting its large cobalt reserves with 
an estimated contained cobalt resource of 265 kt at 1.3% cobalt 
content. Current production capacity is about 8 kt per annum, a 
substantial proportion of the world’s available capacity. The high 
grade cobalt concentrate product is sought after as a blend product 
for other lower grade products exported by local producers. A 
second significant advantage is that the cobalt production is 
independent of copper production and manufacture. The third 
advantage is that the cobalt grades and ‘impurity loadings’ in the ore 
are such that high quality cathode can be produced by the cost 
effective heap leach to SX/EW process, which will facilitate a bottom 
quartile cost position and greater protection against price volatility.
Logistics costs are a substantial component of overall remote mine 
development, comprising as much as a third of the overall mine 
development cost. The Other Non-ferrous Division is supported by 
an in-house freight and haulage company, which provides a secure 
and priority delivery capability with a positive impact on project 
time-line delivery and cost.
Production summary
The following table sets out the production volumes of the Other 
Non-ferrous Division and relates to the two months ended 31 
December 2009. The acquisition of CAMEC and its consolidation as 
a subsidiary was effective from 9 November 2009:

Production – Copper 
In the last two months of 2009 copper cathode standard grade 
production included the benefits of the commissioning of additional 
mining fleet vehicles and the recommencement of operations at the 
Disele Mine, one of several mines that feed the Luita processing 
facility. Preparations made for the ‘rainy season’ were successful 
and evident in the production results. 
Production – Cobalt 
In the two-months to end 2009 the level of production of cobalt 
concentrate reflected improved market demand.
Supply and demand – Copper 
The demand for copper is largely driven by demand for construction 
and for electronic products. Industrial machinery, transportation and 
consumer products are other significant sources of demand. The 
highest grade copper is LME Grade A copper.
Global supply in 2009 amounted to 18.4 million tonnes; consumption 
fell to about 17.5 million tonnes, due to reduced industrial demand. 
The market balance is moving towards undersupply as forecast new 
production does not keep up with estimated future demand. The 
main source of copper is South America, specifically Chile, which 
accounts for approximately 34% of global production. Other key 
suppliers are: China, Russia and Kazakhstan. In addition scrap 
provides about 1 million tonnes per annum; about 5% of the global 
supply of copper. The main markets for copper are: China; rest of 
Asia; Europe; and North America.
In 2009 copper consumption and its price were driven by demand 
from China and emerging markets with some evidence of restocking 
and inventory build-up, although overall demand fell about 3.1%. For 
the short-term copper is expected to continue to maintain a supply 
surplus as an anticipated growth in Chinese demand is partly offset 
by expectations of weaker demand in the US and Europe. This 
condition is expected to persist until perhaps 2012, when the market 
is expected to move towards a deficit, caused by a recovery in 
demand whilst supply will be limited by aging mines and a lack of 
new replacement projects.
Supply and demand – Cobalt 
The market for cobalt is driven by chemicals (including rechargeable 
batteries which comprise almost one-third of total usage). Other key 
sources of demand are superalloys (in the aerospace industry) and 
special steel, carbides and diamond tools, magnets and high speed 
steel applications. The market for cobalt is a global market, although 
as a producer and consumer China has emerged as the dominant 
participant.
Cobalt has multiple applications each requiring a detailed 
specification at the manufacturing stage, but the overall market is 
small in comparison with other base metals. In 2009 approximately 
50% of the world’s refined cobalt was a by-product of nickel whilst 
an additional 45% was produced as a by-product of copper 
operations, mainly in the DRC and Zambia. Cobalt is also a 
by-product of platinum operations whilst scrap is another important 
source of supply. The remaining 5% of cobalt refined production 
came from primary producers. The DRC is the largest single source 
of cobalt with almost half of the world’s production; Zambia, 
Australia and Cuba possess the other major reserves. The main 
source of demand is China which is a significant buyer of 
concentrate and intermediate materials for further refining and 
consumption in China.
For 2009 estimated world demand was approximately 52 kt, a 
decrease of 9.1% from 2008, reflecting the impact of the global 
economic downturn. Supply amounted to approximately 55 kt in 
2009 with a number of key producers announcing cutbacks. In 2009, 
demand from China, particularly from the rechargeable battery 
chemical sector, helped keep the market from oversupply. Most 
other applications, namely the superalloys, hard metal and magnet 
sectors, were well below 2008 consumption levels. Looking forward, 
with limited inventory available, estimates are that in the near-term 
cobalt production will remain steady, creating a short-term supply  28
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Business Review
deficit as demand recovers. In the medium-term several new 
projects are sufficiently advanced to be expected to start production 
and to produce significant quantities of cobalt in late 2010 – typically 
as a by-product of nickel or copper. 
It is expected that the cobalt chemical salts market will continue to 
dominate demand in the medium term and ENRC intends to position 
itself within this market, producing both high quality cobalt metals 
and chemical. Longer-term demand is set to grow from rechargeable 
batteries for electronics applications and rechargeable batteries for 
automobiles
Sales and Pricing
 From  
 November 
2009
Saleable copper cathode t 2,778
Saleable cobalt concentrate t 1,169
Sales and pricing – Copper 
Prices and volumes for copper metal are typically negotiated on an 
annual basis, although with some contracts for quarterly 
commitments. While traditional Western markets are still large 
consumers of metal, Asia, particularly China, is the key growth 
market. Most copper products are priced based on LME prices. In 
the US, the Comex price is an alternative pricing mechanism. 
By November 2009 metal exchange-related inventories were at their 
highest level since February 2004, reflecting weak demand from the 
US and Europe and some re-exporting of copper from China, where 
inventory levels remain high. Despite increased inventory levels, the 
price reached in excess of US$7,000/tonne in December. The 
average price in Q4 2009 exceeded US$6,640/tonne.
Sales and pricing – Cobalt 
Prices and volumes for cobalt concentrate are typically negotiated 
on an annual basis, with some contracts covering multiple years. 
While there are weekly quotes available for cobalt concentrate, long 
term supply contracts are usually a formula linked to the cobalt 
metal price. Cobalt prices are quoted twice weekly by ‘Metal 
Bulletin’ and from late February 2010 cobalt prices were available on 
the LME.
Q4 2009 saw renewed demand and higher prices due to a 
combination of consumer restocking, Chinese buying and 
speculative buying in advance of the introduction of cobalt onto the 
LME. The cobalt metal price ended the year at $19.75 per pound. 
Key initiatives
The Other Non-ferrous Division’s principal objectives are: to expand 
the existing copper and cobalt operations; and to provide a basis for 
future growth projects across the region. The copper and cobalt 
operations will be developed through investments in processing 
assets, supported by an extensive exploration campaign. 
The Group reviewed its projects for the Other Non-ferrous Division in 
the DRC and elsewhere, following the completion of its acquisition of 
CAMEC. As a result of the review the scope and scale of the copper 
and cobalt investment projects were increased and the planned 
capital expenditure has risen to US$455 million. The original 
investment projects, totalling US$230 million, include:
Expansion of the existing operations in the DRC to produce 75 kt •	
per annum of copper (oxide) production and the completion of a 
new solvent extraction plant for copper in 2013;
Commissioning of an SX/EW plant to start cobalt metal •	
production in H2 2010; and
Exploration and proving of the resources base. •	
Following the review the Group added new investment projects:
Installation of 60 kt per annum production capacity for copper •	
(sulphides) production concentrate at an estimated cost of 
US$150 million; and
Additional exploration in the DRC and for a number of the other •	
potential development projects acquired with CAMEC.
Sales & Marketing
The Group’s Sales & Marketing function provides ENRC’s operating 
divisions with a fully integrated and centrally organised sales and 
marketing resource. This facilitates the efficient coordination of the 
Group’s external sales, monitoring of key markets and general 
production strategy. The Sales & Marketing function performs several 
key functions: strategy and planning; commercial contract terms and 
customer relations; market research; and coordinating logistics. The 
centralisation of this function provides significant operational 
advantages to the Group, including the identification and exploitation 
of market synergies and improved operational efficiencies. In 
addition, as the markets in which the Group operates are 
geographically diverse and complex, the size, scope and expertise of 
the sales and marketing function enables it to gather significant 
market information that is not otherwise generally available.

The Group’s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2009, 
whilst weaker than 2008, nonetheless reflected a resilient 
performance. 
The Group’s Underlying EBITDA for 2009 of US$1,462 million (2008: 
US$4,161 million) was significantly impacted by lower commodity 
prices in 2009 and fell 64.9%. The decline in revenue was partially 
offset by management’s cost control initiatives, lower distribution 
costs, and the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge against the  
US dollar.
Revenue for 2009 decreased 43.9%, or US$2,992 million, to 
US$3,831 million (2008: US$6,823 million) whilst like-for-like revenue 
decreased 41.9% to US$3,507 million (2008: US$6,040 million). 
Lower average commodity prices accounted for nearly all of the 
decline in revenue, with the Ferroalloys Division accounting for more 
than 75% of the decline in Group revenue, the Iron Ore Division 14% 
and the Alumina and Aluminium Division 10%. 
Cost of sales decreased 6.8%, or US$141 million, to US$1,947 
million (2008: US$2,088 million), whilst like-for-like Cost of sales 
declined 13.1%, or $232 million, to US$1,539 million (2008: US$1,771 
million). Management’s cost control initiatives and lower prices led to 
a fall in the costs of materials used, as well as savings on energy, 
labour, repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Cost of sales 
decrease was enhanced by the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge 
against the US dollar, in which some 75% of the Group’s Cost of 
sales are denominated. These reductions were partially offset by the 
destocking of inventory with a higher inventory cost carried over 
from 2008 and foreign currency hedging losses of US$61 million. 
Included in cost of sales for the first time was MET of US$166 million 
(Royalties 2008: US$48 million).
Distribution costs decreased 15.1%, or US$65 million, to US$366 
million (2008: US$431 million). The decrease was mainly due to a fall 
in transportation costs as a result of the Ferroalloys Division selling 
greater quantities to neighbouring China, instead of the Group’s 
traditional and more distant markets such as North America and 
Western Europe, coupled with the Energy Division’s lower third-party 
coal sales volumes. Partially offsetting these reductions were 
increased transportation costs in the Iron Ore Division, driven by 
sales to China and the change in delivery terms from Delivered at 
Frontier (‘DAF’) to First Carrier (‘FCA’). The devaluation of the 
Kazakhstani tenge and the weakening of the Russian rouble had a 
favourable effect on the Group’s Distribution costs reducing 
Kazakhstan and Russian railway tariffs in US dollar terms.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 14.9%, or 
US$63 million, to US$359 million (2008: US$422 million). This was 
principally due to savings in taxes other than income tax, 
professional and other services as well as lower provisioning for 
impairment of trade and other receivables.
Other operating income included a one-off foreign exchange gain 
resulting from the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge, amounting 
to US$210 million for 2009. 
The Group’s Operating profit decreased 64.3% or US$2,476 million, 
to US$1,374 million (2008: US$3,850 million) realising an operating 
profit margin of 35.9% (2008: 56.4%). The Ferroalloys Division 
contributed 77% of this fall, US$1,908 million; the Iron Ore Division 
15%, US$382 million; and the Alumina and Aluminium Division 9%, 
US$213 million. 
Finance income increased 44.7% or US$59 million, to US$191 
million (2008: US$132 million), primarily due to the one-off foreign 
Financial Review 30
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
exchange gain of US$104 million resulting from the devaluation of 
the Kazakhstani tenge against the US dollar, which is in addition to 
the foreign exchange gain recognised in Other operating income. 
Group Finance costs of US$157 million (2008: US$143 million), 
included foreign exchange losses of US$75 million arising from the 
devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge against the US dollar.
The share of profit of joint venture and associates was US$31 million 
(2008: US$12 million loss). This included a US$7 million profit 
contribution from the Group’s 25% interest in Shubarkol (2008: nil) 
and a profit realised by the BML joint venture of US$24 million, 
derived from foreign exchange gains and fair value gains on non 
interest bearing loans advanced by the joint venture partners.

The Ferroalloys Division’s results were greatly impacted by a marked 
decline in prices, particularly for high-carbon ferrochrome and 
chrome ore. 
Of the Division’s 54.9%, or US$2,280 million, decline in third-party 
revenue, US$2,167 million was due to lower commodity prices, to 
which ferroalloys prices contributed US$1,869 million and chrome 
ore prices contributed US$187 million. 
During the year, sales volumes steadily recovered from the impact of 
the global economic downturn with high-carbon ferrochrome and 
ferrosilocomanganese volumes increasing 13.0% and 18.4% 
respectively, whilst total ferroalloys volumes increased 6.1%. 
Although weaker market conditions resulted in significantly lower 
sales volumes for all other products within the Ferroalloys Division, 
with chrome ore experiencing a 15.8% decline in volume, signs of 
recovery were generally evident in H2 2009. 
The 8.2%, or US$83 million, reduction in Cost of sales was largely 
due to savings on the costs of materials, labour and energy costs, 
with the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge and lower overall sales 
volumes also being beneficial contributory factors. Savings in the 
costs of materials were achieved as a result of lower fuel and gas 
prices, along with an increased consumption of Russian coke rather 
than the more expensive Chinese coke. Included in Cost of sales for 
the first time was MET which amounted to US$113 million (Royalties 
2008: US$24 million). Unit costs of sales for ferroalloys fell 21% on 
2008 (excluding MET/Royalties). 
The US$92 million reduction in Distribution costs was mainly 
attributable to more products being shipped to China instead of the 
Group’s traditional and more distant markets, of North America, 
Japan and Western Europe. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased US$18 
million, largely due to cost control measures. 
The increase in other operating income reflected foreign exchange 
gains that arose on devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge, amounting 
to US$164 million.
The Division’s Underlying EBITDA decreased 74.7%, or US$2,082 
million, to US$707 million. Serov contributed US$40 million and Tuoli 
US$4 million to Underlying EBITDA. The total contribution of the 
Ferroalloys Division to the Group’s Underlying EBITDA in 2009 was 
48.3% (2008: 67.0%).

1 Unit costs: Cost of sales divided by sales volumes.
The Iron Ore Division was significantly impacted by the fall in 
commodity prices and adverse market conditions, including an 
increased proportion of lower priced concentrate sales, resulting in 
a US$405 million reduction in third-party revenue. In H2 2009 the 
sales volume mix saw a shift back towards the higher-priced pellet 
product. 
The US$18 million increase in Cost of sales was largely driven by 
higher sales volumes specifically the impact of inventory destocking 
of about US$40 million along with realised losses on the cash flow 
hedges of US$47 million. These were offset by savings on materials 
and labour costs, and with the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge 
being a large contributor for these cost reductions. Included in the 
cost of sales for the first time was MET of US$43 million (Royalties 
2008: US$13 million). Unit cost of sales for saleable iron ore 
concentrate fell 15% in 2009 (excluding MET/Royalties).
The US$38 million increase in Distribution costs resulted from a 
larger proportion of sales to China, which attracted higher tariffs, in 
comparison with sales to MMK. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased US$24 
million, largely due to savings on staff, sponsorship and consulting 
costs. 
Other operating income increased US$56 million to US$47 million 
(2008: US$9 million expense), of which US$47 million was due to 
foreign exchange gains resulting from the devaluation of the 
Kazakhstani tenge.
The Division’s Underlying EBITDA decreased US$434 million to 
US$485 million. The total contribution of the Iron Ore Division to the 
Group’s Underlying EBITDA in 2009 was 33.2% (2008: 22.1%).

1 Unit costs: Cost of sales divided by sales volumes.
The results of the Alumina and Aluminium Division were significantly 
impacted by a decline in commodity sales prices, resulting in a 
34.8%, or US$301 million, reduction in third-party revenue. Lower 
realised prices reduced revenue by US$340 million. Overall, 
however, higher sales volumes were achieved by the Division, with 
the increase in aluminium sales leading to an increase in revenue of 
US$54 million. This was partially offset by a decline in third-party 
sales volumes for alumina and gallium. 
The US$67 million reduction in Cost of sales was largely due to 
savings on materials and labour costs, partially offset by realised 
losses on cash flow hedges. Included in Cost of sales for the first 
time was MET which amounted to US$10 million (Royalties 2008: 
US$7 million). Unit cost of sales of alumina (excluding MET/Royalties) 
fell 20%. The unit cost of sales of aluminium (excluding MET/
Royalties) fell 23%.
The US$6 million reduction in Distribution costs was largely due to a 
greater volume of shipments made to Russia, in comparison to the 
more distant Baltic and Black Sea ports, along with the positive 
impact on Distribution costs of the devaluation of the Kazakhstani 
tenge.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased US$23 
million, due to savings on labour and travel costs. 
Other operating expenses increased US$7 million to US$3 million 
(2008: US$4 million income), of which US$8 million was due to an 
adverse effect of the Kazakhstani tenge devaluation. 32

The Energy Division’s third-party revenue decreased 3.4%, or US$7 
million. The fall in coal sales to third-parties adversely impacted 
revenue by US$32 million; a 9% fall in sales volumes and a 15% 
lower average US dollar price. These impacts were partially offset by 
a US$24 million increase in electricity sales, due to higher demand 
and improved generation capacity to support third-party sales. The 
US$27 million reduction in the Division’s sales revenue to Group 
entities is due to the negative impact of the devaluation of the 
Kazakhstani tenge. 
The US$42 million decline in Cost of sales was driven by the impact 
of the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge on input material costs. 
Unit cost of sales for electricity fell 14%.
The US$19 million decline in Distribution costs was largely a result of 
lower coal sales volumes.
The Division’s Underlying EBITDA increased US$36 million to 
US$213 million. The total contribution of the Energy Division to the

The US$54 million reduction in third-party revenue was driven 
largely by a reduced volume of railway repairs. The adverse effect of 
the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge resulted in a US$18 million 
decline in revenue from sales to Group entities despite higher 
volumes. 
Cost of sales decreased by US$46 million mainly due to a lower 
volume of railway repairs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased US$22 
million mostly due to lower labour costs and consulting services.
The Division’s Underlying EBITDA decreased US$11 million to

The information for the Other Non-ferrous Division (formerly the 
businesses of CAMEC), relates to the two months ended 31 
December 2009. The acquisition of CAMEC was effective from 9 
November 2009.
In the period, the main revenue and Underlying EBITDA generating 
businesses of the Division were the copper and cobalt operations in 
the DRC and a logistics business. 
The total contribution of the Other Non-ferrous Division to the 
Group’s Underlying EBITDA in 2009 was less than 1%.
Corporate
Taxation
With effect from 1 January 2009 the Republic of Kazakhstan 
introduced a new Tax Code including, amongst other measures, a 
gradual reduction in the rate of Corporate Income Tax (‘CIT’) from 
30% in 2008 to 20% in 2009, 17.5% in 2010 and 15% thereafter, the 
abolition of Royalties in conjunction with the introduction of MET, 
and revisions to the basis of calculation of Excess Profits Tax (‘EPT’). 
In November 2009, in response to the adverse changes in the global 
economic environment, the reduction in the CIT rate was postponed 
and the 20% CIT rate was extended for the period from 2010 to 
2012. MET rate increases were similarly postponed. 
The Group’s income tax expense for the year ended 31 December 
2009 was US$377 million (2008: US$1,143 million), an Effective Tax 
Rate of 26.2% (2008: 29.9%). 
The Group’s Effective Tax Rate of 26.2% included the effects of 
changes to the applicable CIT rate and to the tax depreciation rules 
in Kazakhstan enacted in November 2009. Excluding the effect of 
these changes in the tax legislation, the Effective Tax Rate was 
25.1%. This was higher than the applicable CIT rate in Kazakhstan of 
20% mainly due to the effects of withholding taxes on dividends and 
of EPT in Kazakhstan. 
Mineral Extraction Tax, not being a tax on profits, does not form part 
of the income tax expense and is reflected in Cost of sales.
Liquidity 
Cash and cash equivalents reduced 66.7% during 2009 to US$830 
million (2008: US$2,493 million). Gross Available Funds decreased 
by 63.1% in the same period to US$1,021 million (2008: US$2,768 
million).

and cash equivalents (123) (48) 156.3%
Cash and cash 
equivalents at end

Net cash generated from operating activities
The Group generated cash of US$1,209 million (2008: US$2,766 
million) from operating activities, a decrease of US$1,557 million. 
The lower operating cash inflow is predominantly due to the lower 
average commodity prices which adversely impacted operating 
profit. This was partially offset by a significant reduction in taxes 
paid in 2009 of US$464 million (2008: US$1,163 million), a result of 
the decrease in the Group’s operating profit and the reduction in 
Kazakhstani CIT rates.
Net cash used for investing activities
In 2009 the Group utilised US$2,105 million for investing activities 
(2008: US$1,919 million), an increase of US$186 million, or 9.7%. 
Investing activities consisted largely of investments in subsidiaries 
and associates namely CAMEC for US$917 million net of cash 
acquired and a 25% interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC for US$200 
million less 25% of net debt. Capital expenditure on property, plant 
and equipment amounted to US$912 million, a reduction of 38.3%.
Net cash flow used for financing activities
The Group used cash resources of US$644 million for its financing 
activities during the year ended 31 December 2009, primarily for the 
payment of dividends to shareholders of US$322 million and net 
borrowings repayments of $308 million. 34
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Capital expenditure
During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group’s capital expenditure amounted to US$1,147 million (2008: US$1,294 million), a 
decrease of US$147 million, or 11.4%.
‘Capital expenditure’ equates to additions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, which differs from 
the ‘Capital expenditure spend’, which represents the cash outflows to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. 
We have enhanced the presentation of capital expenditure, designating it as either ‘expansionary’ or ‘sustaining’. 
‘Expansionary’ capital expenditure refers to investments made to drive future growth through increasing production capacities, and may 
include the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment or the upgrade or expansion of existing facilities. 
‘Sustaining’ capital expenditure refers to investments designed to keep existing operations running at their current levels and may include 
major cyclical capital repairs or the replacement of existing property, plant and equipment.

The Group’s capital expenditure programme (including the Other Non-ferrous Division) totals US$5.8 billion comprising of expansionary and 
enhancement projects which are ‘in progress’ or ‘under review’. Deferred projects amount to US$0.5 billion.
For the full year 2010, total capital expenditure is expected to be approximately US$1.5 billion, including sustaining capital expenditure of 
around US$0.4 billion. 
Capital expenditure on BML remains contingent on the project proceeding. This is dependent upon certain outstanding approvals and the 
Government of Brazil proceeding with the construction of a rail link.
With the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Chambishi Metals PLC, a Zambian copper and cobalt producer, the Group stated its 
plans for capital expenditure of about US$80 million. The capital expenditure would be for new and upgraded production facilities, 
scheduled to be completed by the end of 2011, and increase Chambishi’s copper production capacity to 55 kt per annum of LME Grade A 
copper cathode. 
Contractual obligations
Long-term supply agreements
The Group has the following key long-term supply agreements:
Alumina – ENRC has a contract with UC RUSAL, a large aluminium producer, to supply a minimum of 1.2 million tonnes of alumina per •	
annum. The contract expires on 31 December 2016. Pricing is determined by a formula linked to the LME aluminium price; and
Iron ore – ENRC has a contract with MMK, a large Russian steel producer to supply up to 15 million tonnes per annum of saleable iron •	
ore concentrate and pellet. This contract expires in 2017. Pricing is determined by reference to published price indices for iron ore 
concentrates and pellets.
Across a number of customer contracts some reduction in contractual volumes has taken place to date, and this may continue depending 
on market conditions. 36
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Business Review
Introduction
At ENRC, sustainability is about managing the total impact of the 
business for the long term.
We aim to grow our business while maintaining our commitment to 
respecting the environment, providing safe and healthy workplaces 
and making a positive contribution to the societies where we 
operate. 
As ENRC grows, sustainability is a pathway that enables us to 
transform our business and build true competitive advantage. We 
recognise that successful businesses of tomorrow are addressing 
key sustainability challenges today, from resource efficiency to 
community health. Such vision protects our business going forward, 
and allows us to contribute to stronger economies and communities 
in the emerging markets where we operate. Investment in 
sustainability initiatives brings long-term benefits including improved 
management of risk, efficiencies in operating costs, and attracting 
and retaining the best employees.
Our five key Sustainable Development (‘SD’) priorities are: 
To consume less to produce more; •	
To integrate SD into investment decision-making; •	
To make reputation and brand one of the Group’s principal assets; •	
To build key stakeholder relationships in all countries in which we •	
operate; and
To create leadership and embed the behaviours of SD values •	
across the Group.
ENRC has committed to improving sustainability performance over 
the long term. We already operate to the standards consistent with 
best practice in Kazakhstan, and as we develop our international 
presence, we strive to achieve best practice international standards 
across our operations, including safety, health and environment.
The Group reports SD performance in compliance with local 
legislation and international best practice. In 2009 we continued to 
develop a transparent reporting system based on the Global 
Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’) Metals and Mining Supplement and the 
ICMM SD Framework. Internal reporting in compliance with GRI 
environmental indicators expanded by 60% in 2009. We plan to 
issue SD reporting which adopts GRI indicators and is subject to 
external assurance in 2011.
Working with stakeholders
Fortunately we are not alone in meeting the challenges of 
sustainable development. In all regions where we operate ENRC is 
committed to working in partnership with local government, public 
NGO’s and community representatives. Our flexibility and ability to 
engage with diverse stakeholders creates competitive advantage 
and brings benefits to society. We plan to develop a more organised 
approach to stakeholder engagement. 
For several years ENRC has engaged with local and international SD 
initiatives. We were the first Kazakhstani company to sign up to the 
UN Global Compact and have joined the Extractive Industry 
Transparency Initiative. In 2003 the Group became a founder 
member of the Kazakhstan Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (‘KBCSD’), a regional partner of the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (‘WBCSD’). 
Our extensive experience in working with governments focuses on 
supporting the development of a strong legal framework and sharing 
industry best practice with our partners. For example, through 
membership of the International Chromium Development 
Association (‘ICDA’), we are able to bring international expertise and

skills to the environment of Kazakhstan. In recognition of our 
contribution to state development, ENRC’s Kazakhstan ferroalloys 
business was awarded Best Industrial Enterprise in 2009. 
ENRC’s collaboration with local government and administrations in 
Kazakhstan is a model of successful public-private partnership 
development. In 2009 we renewed our cooperation memoranda with 
regional governments aimed at improving the welfare of the 
community.
In our engagement with all stakeholders, including government, we 
are committed to transparency and respecting human rights. In 2009 
ENRC was placed second in the Standard & Poor’s Kazakhstan 
Corporate Transparency Index. 
In 2009 we implemented a revised procurement policy, purchasing 
policy and procedure framework, which aims to create a more 
transparent purchasing policy for our business partners and 
suppliers.
Governance
The Group believes it is important to have a high standard of 
governance with clear line-of-sight objectives in order to achieve its 
SD strategy. We are implementing gradual changes in our 
governance system to effectively manage the sustainability agenda. 
We are working to build an integrated SD management system that 
provides a unified approach, while also taking into account specific 
aspects at each of our sites across Kazakhstan, Russia, China, 
Brazil and Africa. Corporate safety and environmental standards are 
a non-negotiable part of the integration process.
The Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainability (‘HSES’) 
Committee of the Board of Directors, which includes the Chairman 
and CEO, is responsible for sustainability strategy and performance. 
In 2009 the Committee met twice, and focused on: 
Safety management and performance, including a new Safety •	
Improvement Programme.
New Environmental Strategy for 2010–2012. •	
HSES Risks and Action Plans. •	
The Committee’s work is supported by the HSES Working Group 
which comprises the Divisional Heads of Environment, Health and 
Safety, Human Resources and Social Policy. The Working Group has 
responsibility for monitoring HSES programme implementation, 
changing regulatory requirements, the development of action plans 
and proposals for operational improvements. 
In 2009 sustainability risk management was incorporated into the 
Group’s central risk management governance structure. The focus is 
to establish procedures to effectively manage SD risks at the 
divisional level. 
The HSES Committee has approved several policies and procedures 
to set controls for material SD risks. In 2009 we developed and 
approved a new Environmental Strategy and launched a new Safety 
Improvement Programme. A Human Resource Management Policy, 
a Succession Planning Policy and a Climate Change Policy were 
also developed and implementation is currently in progress.
Our goals for 2010 are to: 
Set formal SD functions and accountability at divisional level; •	
Develop sound data and reporting practice in line with •	
international best practice;
Strengthen the SD management team with professionals with SD •	
expertise;
Incorporate new SD site management system into overall •	
corporate governance system; and
Integrate sustainability governance into acquisition process by •	
identifying environmental, social and governance risks ahead of 
investments in new assets.
Health and Safety
Safety
Safety has continued to be a key area of focus during 2009. ENRC 
has adopted a vision of zero injuries, based on the belief that all 
injuries are preventable. We continually seek new safety 
improvement opportunities to enable us to fulfil our ambitious safety 
policy, and to set a sustainable safety system integrating all 
company operations in achieving mutual goals.  38
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Safety is a priority to the business and a Key Performance Indicator 
as detailed on page 12. As it is a business priority key management 
are compensated on safety performance.
Regrettably, there were 12 fatal accidents at ENRC sites during 2009 
(2008: 9). We have investigated each of these incidents, learned 
lessons and implemented changes to how we operate. ENRC 
remains committed to reducing to zero the number of lives lost at 
ENRC operations.

ENRC’s Board and top management continue to champion the 
strategic safety project initiated in 2008 in partnership with DuPont. 
Following an initial full safety management evaluation, we introduced 
new commitments and will develop new safety management 
systems. In 2009 we started a pilot project at Kazchrome, which 
aims to establish a culture of safe working, including developing a 
formal safety performance appraisal system with specific, 
measureable objectives for all managers. Based on learning from the 
pilot, we will start to roll out a new corporate safety programme 
across the Group’s operational sites in 2010. It is anticipated that it 
will take three more years to complete full implementation. 
In 2009 ENRC implemented an internal corporate accident 
investigation procedure. This led to the introduction of a special 
accident investigation team consisting of safety professionals and 
technical experts. Independent corporate investigation enables us to 
find the root causes of each accident, to develop efficient non-
compromising preventative measures and to monitor action taken. 
We believe these new procedures will support improvements in 
prevention and reoccurrence of accidents. 
ENRC has always believed in equal safety standards for all our sites, 
regardless of the country or the nature of the operations there. This 
approach unites ENRC at operational and corporate levels. 
Looking ahead
Goals for safety in 2010 will include: 
Ongoing roll out of the new safety management system across •	
the Group.
Involving employees and contractors to share responsibility for •	
safety based on honesty, openness and mutual trust.
Development of safety performance appraisal systems and •	
implementation of developed and approved corporate safety 
standards. Further develop reporting procedures to align against 
international norms.
Implementing the ENRC safety vision at our newly acquired •	
operations in Africa. Our first step should be to ensure 
standardised reporting and that local legal standards are being 
met. Our strategy will be to use progressive improvement at each 
site through implementation of effective safety tools such as our 
Fifteen Corporate Safety Standards, behavioural audits and our 
Internal Accident Investigation Procedure.
Health
A key aspect of our safety management system is a focus on injury 
and illness prevention, to keep employees safe and healthy in the 
workplace. In addition, for many years ENRC has provided 
employees with health and medical programmes on a voluntary 
basis, and we believe the programmes we operate are amongst best 
practice in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Our health care provision 
includes disease prevention centres as well as sporting and other 
recreational facilities. 
In Kazakhstan we have worked closely with local communities to 
develop an effective HIV/AIDS programme based on preventative 
care, detection, support and treatment. 
Looking ahead
Goals for occupational health improvement in 2010 will include: 
Evaluation of achievements to date of health and medical •	
programmes.
Development of a new Corporate Health Management Roadmap. •	
Drawing on our experience in Kazakhstan, and building on •	
existing local programmes, to deliver locally relevant health care 
to our new employees in regions of Africa. 
Social Policy 
The Group has a solid reputation in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 
being a socially orientated and responsible business. It works 
closely with the Kazakhstani Government to implement 
governmental agreements, programmes and initiatives related to 
implementing the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan ‘On Social 
Partnership’. 
Our Whistle Blowing Policy, adopted in 2007, aims to provide early 
indications of possible corruption. 
We recognise the importance of respecting and protecting human 
rights, which becomes more challenging as we move into diverse 
locations. Open dialogue with local communities, employment 
procedures, preventing discrimination – all these will contribute 
significantly to our addressing human rights issue in the long term.
The social policy focuses on two key areas: Employees and 
Communities.
Employees
ENRC is one of the largest employers in the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
During 2009 the Group employed an average of 70,320 employees. 
As a consequence, our success as a Group depends significantly on 
our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management and 
employees and this is an area of focus for senior management.
As part of the development of a corporate culture throughout  
the organisation, members of senior management regularly visit  
the Republic of Kazakhstan to meet with employees at the 
operational sites.
The Group benefits from good labour relations and has not 
experienced any material strikes or stoppages at any of its operating 
sites since it acquired its operating assets. The majority of our 
employees in the Republic of Kazakhstan are members of trade 
unions and the Group makes significant efforts to engage and work 
with the trade unions. As a result, the Group has well-balanced 
industrial agreements and these serve as a basis for the collective 
agreements each Group company has signed with employees. In 
Business Review
Sustainability Review continued GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
addition to the social rights and benefits guaranteed by the 
Kazakhstani Labour Code, these agreements provide for free 
medical treatment, loans at favourable mortgage rates, training of 
employees and their children and preferential packages to 
sanatoriums, recreation centres and children’s recreation camps. 
Special social programmes are developed for both young people 
and pensioners.
Throughout the current economic downturn, ENRC has worked hard 
to preserve job security at our operations. Some changes had to be 
made, for example to working hours and holidays, but we managed 
to adapt to the economic environment without reducing our 
workforce, and we commit to keeping this goal at the forefront of our 
minds. We have continued to provide the same standard of social 
package for employees, including our housing programme which 
provides interest free loans to employees. 
A highly qualified and skilled workforce is at the heart of any 
successful business. Over the past five years ENRC has launched a 
number of educational and training projects. ENRC implemented a 
long-term Talent Management Programme (‘TMP’). Within the 
framework of the TMP, ENRC started the Personnel Reserve 
Programme for 2009–2012. The main aim is to ensure continuity, 
attract and retain talented staff, and train staff for different levels 
within the Company, including top management. Components of the 
programme are Replacement Planning, Succession Planning and 
Talent Management.
The ENRC training programme includes: short-term, long-term  
and executive MBA studies; courses to support cost-effective 
operations, such as training for second and allied skills improvement 
upgrades; and courses to support corporate goals such as 
leadership and communication training. Cutting edge courses such 
as the UK National Examination Board on Occupational Safety  
and Health (‘NEBOSH’), International Environmental Management 
and Assessment (‘IEMA’) certification study are also an important 
part of HSES staff development, and in addition we support 
educational institutions and provide scholarships for employers  
and the community. 
In 2009 an estimated 40% of the total workforce was involved in the 
training programme (2008: 30%). Our efforts were recognised when 
the ENRC programme on employee development was named as the 
best HR project in Kazakhstan for the last five years. 
As Kazakhstan draws strength from its diversity, we draw strength 
from our aptitude at capitalising on the skill, knowledge and qualities 
of the highly diverse nationalities and cultures that today form ENRC. 
The Group is committed to attracting a globally mobile, culturally 
diverse workforce to its African operations while developing widely 
applicable skills and technical capabilities of employees at all levels. 
As a leader in the mining sector of Kazakhstan, ENRC has a pool of 
talent available to run its international operations safely and 
effectively. The combination of talent from our Kazakhstan 
operations and the regional knowledge and experience of the 
existing management teams, will enable the Group to run its 
international operations effectively and safely.
Looking ahead
During 2010 the areas of focus will include: 
Continuation of the Talent Management Programme, including a •	
rotation scheme aimed at enhancing employees’ skills.
Improvements to business processes in the personnel •	
management system, including enhanced systems for 
recruitment and remuneration planning, and development of a 
Corporate University.
Development of new Industrial Agreements within the framework •	
of collaboration of industrial commissions with the trade unions 
of the mining and metallurgy industry, coal and electric power 
industry in Kazakhstan.
Ongoing work to improve feedback on the Code of Conduct, to •	
improve identification and prevention of Code violation.
Communities
ENRC operating sites are often located in remote areas of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan and frequently the Group is the only industry 
operating in that area. Maintenance of a responsible social contract 
with these communities in Kazakhstan is an established practice in 
ENRC because many of the towns and cities rely on the 
infrastructure development provided by the Group. Each year the 
Group signs agreements with regional Governors in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan and provides financial support.
In 2008 ENRC established the ENRC Komek Corporate Foundation, 
a non-commercial charitable organisation which finances cultural, 
educational and other social programmes in Kazakhstan. 
The Foundation’s long-term focus is on the implementation of 
programmes aimed at supporting ENRC’s own workforce, such as 
improvements to housing conditions, professional staff training and 
education, as well as programmes aimed at improving the welfare of 
the general public, such as development of scientific, technical and 
artistic creativity, protection of public health, supporting children’s 
homes, schools and higher education institutions, as well as 
environmental protection.
The Group expenditure for Community Social Investment in 2009 
amounted to US$37 million (2008: US$31 million).
Environment
ENRC management is committed to reducing any negative impacts 
of Group operations on water, air and land and to the efficient use of 
resources.
In 2009 the Group continued to make progress in raising 
environmental standards towards international norms. ISO14001 
certification was completed for the main divisions in Kazakhstan and 
Russia. All new operations are required to be certified to ISO 14001 
within three years of joining the Group. 
A new environmental strategy has been developed for 2010. This 
new approach links closely to the core business development plans. 
It will include investment in installation of modern equipment, which 
is expected to enhance productivity, improve energy efficiency and 
to generate substantial cost savings, particularly for key input 
materials. The new equipment will also bring significant 
environmental and safety improvements. 
A new framework for measuring our performance in relation to waste 
management, air emissions and water discharges is currently being 
completed. This includes a new environmental database with new 
performance indicators, benchmarks and targets, in a move towards 
common international approaches for reporting.
We have identified seven key areas of our environmental 
performance to report on: climate change, energy, emissions, water, 
waste, toxics and biodiversity.
Climate Change
ENRC recognises the importance of the global issue of climate 
change, and the role that our industry has in responding to the 
challenges it brings. As one of the largest producers of energy in 
Kazakhstan, ENRC appreciates its responsibility to meet challenges 
of doing business in a carbon-constrained future.  40
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
For several years ENRC has worked to improve the energy efficiency 
of operations, and during the past year specific steps were taken 
towards ensuring that a carbon strategy is embedded into core 
business activities. In 2009 a full Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) footprint 
was conducted of the Kazakhstan businesses and for 2010 the aim 
is to develop a carbon roadmap with the goal of emission reduction 
through energy saving and efficiency. As a Group committed to 
growth, we are unlikely to be using less energy in the foreseeable 
future, therefore we need to focus on energy efficiency initiatives 
that will allow us to do more with less. 
In March 2009 Kazakhstan ratified the Kyoto Protocol as an Annex 1 
country under the United National Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (‘UNFCCC’) and has reconfirmed its intention to 
become an Annex B country under the Kyoto Protocol. Although the 
Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of December 2012, we expect the 
post Kyoto period (2013–2020) to present challenging emissions 
reduction targets for Kazakhstan organisations. Our Group is fully 
engaged in the process to support Kazakhstan in meeting its 
obligations towards the international community in this regard. 
Energy
In 2009 ENRC’s Kazakhstan and Russian operations consumed 
275,000 tera joules of energy, of which about 75% was sourced from 
coal. This considerable energy requirement represents both a 
demand on natural resources and a significant operational cost. 
In response, ENRC has begun developing an energy management 
policy, to include an energy consumption inventory. For 2010 we are 
planning initiatives on energy efficiency improvements for machinery 
and on conserving energy currently lost during industrial processes.
 
Emissions
While we foresee the Group’s production levels continuing to grow, 
ENRC recognises the need to reduce emissions, so our focus is on 
reducing the intensity of our operations’ emissions. The Group’s 
strategy for reducing emissions is a two-part approach: gradually 
replacing older technology with new technology that complies with 
international air emissions standards, and, for older technology, 
maintaining lower levels, reducing incrementally where possible. 
Examples from 2009 include the upgrade of baking equipment in 
iron pellets production, which enabled production to increase by 
25% while reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by 15%, and dust 
emissions by 12%. At the Pavlodar Power plant, a technology 
upgrade to near BAT (‘Best Available Technology’) standards led to a 
drop in nitrogen oxide emissions of 30%, and a reduction in dust 
emissions of 66%. 
Water 
With sites operating in the dry deserts of Kazakhstan, ENRC is 
mindful of water scarcity challenges. We are committed to 
maximising water use efficiency and minimising pollution. Water 
recycling is an effective way to save water and to minimise our 
impact on the environment. ENRC has water conservation 
programmes which allowed us to further increase recycling and to 
decrease fresh water intake.
For ENRC operations in Kazakhstan and in Russia fresh water intake 
is only 3% out of the total amount of water used. 59% of water is 
returned into natural sources, and 38% of the water is recycled.
Waste
ENRC is committed to reducing overall costs of production and 
reducing our environmental footprint by reducing and recycling 
waste produced by our operations. 
In 2009 we completed the waste reduction programme for the 
ferroalloy production cycle at Kazchrome. Following a five year 
investment of US$165 million, 14m tonnes of waste was processed, 
and approximately 45 hectares of land saved. At the site, 100% of 
newly produced slag (a by-product of smelting ore) is processed; 
and a programme is in place to process historical slag stored at 
waste land fields. 
Toxics
ENRC adopted a new Chemical Policy in 2009. Our strategic 
approach is to develop and implement a specific Toxic Pollutants 
Reduction action plan. Part of this work was an inventory of 
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (‘PCBs’) and other toxic chemicals. The 
Republic of Kazakhstan has committed to cease utilising equipment 
with PCBs by 2025, and to eliminate PCBs by 2028. ENRC is 
working closely with the government to achieve these goals.
Biodiversity 
ENRC is committed to active stewardship of biodiversity. Our 
strategy is to involve local stakeholders in developing and 
implementing specific biodiversity action plans at each site. 
Looking ahead 
In 2010 we will implement our new environmental strategy and strive 
to continuously improve our environmental performance. The 
strategy focuses on new investment and modernisation projects’ 
eco-efficiency, including evaluating such aspects as energy, 
resource consumption and overall impact on climate change. 
In 2010 we will focus on: 
Improving the transparency of environmental disclosures •	
including development of quantitative targets for environment 
performance; 
Developing appropriate capacity and capabilities within the •	
organisation and establishing levels of responsibility on HSES 
reporting;
Implementing a carbon road map and action plan, and •	
undertaking an energy efficiency study;
Incorporating eco-efficiency indicators and assessment including •	
GHG emissions into investment decision making; and
Making commitments for new construction projects to achieve •	
improvements in environmental performance and specifically in 
energy efficiency, taking into consideration both economic and 
environmental aspects.

receive their dividend in pounds sterling by notifying the Registrars 
before each dividend announcement.

Corporate Governance
Directors’ Report continued

in relation to rights issues and other pre-emptive offerings and 
generally up to an aggregate nominal amount of US$12.9 million 
(representing 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at

Amendments to the articles of association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by a 
special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. A 
special resolution proposing further amendments to the Articles of 
Association required as a result of the implementation of the 
Shareholder Rights Directive that took effect on 3 August 2009 in the 
UK, will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company the 
Board is permitted to consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise 
situations where a Director has an interest that conflicts, or may 
possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company. The Board has a 
formal system in place for Directors to declare any conflicts or 
potential conflicts and for these to then be considered for 
authorisation. The Nomination Committee takes responsibility for 
ensuring that a schedule of conflicts is maintained and that the 
Board reviews this schedule on an annual basis and updates 
authorisations where necessary. The annual review of conflicts was 
carried out in December 2009.
Major interests in shares

Relationship agreements
On 7 December 2007, Mr Chodiev, Mr Ibragimov and Mr 
Machkevitch entered into separate relationship agreements with the 
Company to regulate the ongoing relationship between each 
Founder Shareholder and the Company. The principal purpose of the 
relationship agreements is to ensure that transactions and 
relationships between the Group and the Founder Shareholders are 
at arm’s length and on a normal commercial basis. Under the terms 
of the relationship agreements, each Founder Shareholder has a 
right to appoint a Director to the Board as detailed in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 44 to 50. As at the date of this Report, 
only Mr Ibragimov has exercised this right.
Employees
Detailed information about employees is disclosed in the 
Sustainability Review on pages 36 to 40.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of trading with suppliers in 
advance and to make payment in accordance with these terms. The 
Group does not follow any specific published code or standard on 
payment practice. Suppliers in Kazakhstan and Africa often require 
prepayment and the average number of creditor days outstanding 
for the Group excluding CAMEC as at 31 December 2009 was 42 
days (2008: 34 days). The average creditor days outstanding as at 31 
December 2009 for the Company was nil days (2008: nil days).
Post balance sheet events
Purchase of the minority shareholding in CAMEC
In 2010, the Group completed a partial buyout of minority interests  
in CAMEC for a cash consideration of US$9 million. Details can  
be found in note 40 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on 
page 109.
Acquisition of Chambishi Metals and Comit Resources
On 18 February 2010, the Group announced that it had entered into 
a conditional agreement with International Mineral Resources BV 
(‘IMR’), a company owned by the Founder Shareholders to acquire 
Enya Holdings BV (‘Enya’). On 6 April 2010, the acquisition was 
effectively completed and control obtained by the Group. Details can 
be found in note 40 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on 
page 109.
Export Credit Facility Agreement
On 16 February 2010, the Group entered into an export credit facility 
agreement for the amount of €47.6 million. Details can be found in 
note 40 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109.
Political and charitable donations
No political donations were made during the year. Sponsorship and 
charitable donations amounted to US$37 million (2008: US$31 
million). During the year, the Group provided US$30 million of its 
charitable financial support through ENRC Komek, a corporate 
foundation established in Kazakhstan during 2008. Komek is a 
non-commercial and charitable organisation which finances cultural, 
educational and other social activities in Kazakhstan. The 
foundation’s programme aims include improvements to housing 
conditions, professional staff training and education, development of 
scientific, technical and artistic creativity, protection of public health, 
supporting children’s homes, schools and higher education 
institutions, as well as environmental protection. The Group regards 
the provision of charitable donations as an important part of its 
strategy to maintain good working relationships with local authorities.
A further description of donations is in the Sustainability Review on 
pages 36 to 40.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s financial risk management, objectives and 
policies, together with details of financial instruments are described

Significant agreements and other potential legal impediments
The following represent significant agreements and other potential 
legal impediments which may entitle the counterparties to exercise 
termination or other rights in the event of a change of control of  
the Company.
Article 71 of the Kazakhstan Subsurface Law: the Republic of 
Kazakhstan may be entitled to exercise pre-emptive rights over 
certain issuances or sales of ordinary shares or assets shared by the 
Group. Article 71 of the Kazakhstan Subsurface Law provides that 
the Republic of Kazakhstan has pre-emptive rights to purchase 
certain subsurface use rights or indirect or direct interests in 
companies having subsurface use rights for sale. This pre-emptive 
right permits the Republic of Kazakhstan to purchase any such 
subsurface use rights or equity interests being offered for sale on no 
less favourable terms than those offered by other purchasers.
Structured Trade Finance Agreement: On 15 December 2006, ENRC 
Marketing AG entered into a Structured Trade Finance Facility with 
ABN AMRO Bank NV, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank AG 
Amsterdam Branch as Arrangers and Original lenders, Deutsche 
Bank AG Amsterdam Branch as Agent and Deutsche Bank AG 
Amsterdam as Security Trustee to borrow up to US$1,000 million 
from a syndicate of lenders. By a Supplemental Agreement dated 12 
April 2007 the Facility was increased to US$1,480 million. If one of 
the following events occurs:
i) the Founder Shareholders together no longer have Shareholder 
Control or Effective Control; or
ii) a person or persons acting in concert had Effective Control or 
Shareholder Control or owns more shares in the relevant holding 
company of the Group than are held by the Founder 
Shareholders at the date of the Facility; or
iii) ENRC Marketing and Kazchrome cease to be subsidiaries of the 
same holding company,
then any Lender may decline to fund a drawdown and any Lender 
may cancel its commitment under the Facility and require its portion 
of any outstanding loans be due and payable in full at the end of the 
then current interest period.
For these purposes, ‘Shareholder Control’ means holding directly or 
indirectly shares in the issued share capital of ENRC Marketing 
carrying the rights to exercise more than 30% of the votes 
exercisable at a general meeting of the shareholders of ENRC 
Marketing, and ‘Effective Control’ means the ability to give directions 
with respect to the operating and financial policies of a company 
with which the directors or equivalent officers of such company are 
obliged to comply (ignoring, for the avoidance of doubt, the powers 
of any sub-committee of the board of directors or equivalent to 
which the board of directors have delegated certain of their powers).
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
The Group’s external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have 
indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution 
seeking to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Each of the Directors at the date of approval of this report confirms 
that:
1) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
2) the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware 
of the information.
The confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Corporate Governance
The Group’s statement on Corporate Governance is included in  
the Corporate Governance Report on pages 44 to 50 of these 
financial statements.

Corporate Governance
Compliance with the Combined Code
ENRC is committed to high standards of corporate governance. This report details how the Company has applied the principles and 
provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’) which was published in June 2008. Throughout the year ended 31 
December 2009, the Company has been in full compliance with the provisions of the Code with the exception of Provision A.2.2, which 
states that: ‘The Chairman should on appointment meet the independence criteria set out in A.3.1. A Chief Executive should not go on to be 
Chairman of the same company. If exceptionally a Board decides that a Chief Executive should become Chairman, the Board should 
consult major shareholders in advance and should set out its reasons to shareholders at the time of the appointment and in the next annual 
report’.
On 14 August 2009 we announced a number of Board changes which took effect on 20 August 2009. Sir David Cooksey resigned as 
Chairman in order to focus on his appointment as Chairman of UK Financial Investments Limited. Dr Johannes Sittard accepted the position 
of non-executive Chairman in his place and Felix Vulis was promoted to Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer. Sir Richard Sykes 
was appointed as non-executive Deputy Chairman of the Group.
The Board did consult with its major shareholders during the period leading up to the announcement on 14 August 2009. The shareholders 
supported the view that Dr Sittard’s extensive knowledge of both ENRC and the mining industry and his successful leadership during the 
Company’s IPO justified his elevation to Chairman and that the retention of his expertise was of significant importance in the Group’s 
continuing success and development. As a result of this support it was not considered necessary to appoint an external search consultancy 
to assist with the appointment of the new Chairman.
In addition, it was agreed that Sir Richard Sykes, Senior Independent Director of the Company, should be made Deputy Chairman so as to 
utilise his extensive experience of UK listed companies in the metals and mining sector and provide additional support to the new Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer.
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for promoting the long-term success of the Company and ensuring that its principal goal is to enhance the 
Company’s long-term value for the benefit of shareholders, whilst having regard to the interests of other stakeholders. At its regular 
meetings the Board reviews the Company’s long-term strategic direction, capital expenditure and budget plans and monitors on a regular 
basis the Company’s operating and financial performance and its approach to risk management and Corporate Governance. The Board 
also reviews management performance and succession planning and assesses whether the Company has the necessary resources in place 
to meet its objectives. The Board has established a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for its attention and which are published 
on the Company’s website.
Board composition
During the period under review, the composition of the Board changed several times. This is shown in the table below

1 January 2010 – 12 April 2010 Appointment of Professor Dr. Dieter Ameling – 26 January 2010 Non-executive Chairman
2 Executive Directors
10 non-executive Directors
The Board currently comprises, in addition to the Chairman, two Executive Directors and 10 non-executive Directors, seven of whom are 
independent according to the definition in the Code.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly separated and their responsibilities have been set out in writing. The Board is 
chaired by Dr Johannes Sittard and he is responsible for leading the Board and ensuring it functions effectively. Mr Felix Vulis is the Chief 
Executive Officer and he is responsible for the operational management of the Group and the execution of the Group’s strategy.
In order to further strengthen the balance of independent and non-independent Directors on the Board, the Nomination Committee decided 
to seek the appointment of a further independent non-executive Director and in January 2010 recommended the appointment of Professor 
Dr Dieter Ameling whom the Board subsequently approved.

Miguel Perry left the Company on 30 June 2009 and Ms Zaure Zaurbekova was subsequently appointed as Executive Director and Chief 
Financial Officer on 30 September 2009 after a period as acting Chief Financial Officer.
On 6 October 2009, Michael Eggleton resigned as a non-executive Director in order to take up the position of Chief Executive Officer of 
Eurasian Bank, a related party.
Mr Utepov and Mr Beketayev are representatives of The State Property and Privatisation Committee of the Ministry of Finance of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, and as such are not considered by the Board to be independent under the provisions of the Code.
Under the relationship agreements between the Company and each of the Founder Shareholders (as disclosed in the Directors’ Report on 
pages 41 to 43), each of the Founder Shareholders has the right to appoint one Director to the Board, so long as his shareholder group 
controls 10% or more of the voting rights exercisable at general meetings of the Company. Pursuant to this right, Mr Ibragimov has 
appointed Mr Yedilbayev to the Board. He is not considered to be independent under the Code.
Sir Richard Sykes has been appointed as Senior Independent Director and Deputy Chairman and his principal duty in this capacity is to 
evaluate the performance of the Chairman and address any shareholders’ concerns that have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of communication with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or in cases when such communications 
would be inappropriate.
Details of the individuals’ skills and experience are contained within the Directors’ biographies on pages 04 and 05.

Board responsibility and accountability
The Board is provided with regular, timely and relevant information in a form that enables it to discharge its duties. Board papers are 
generally distributed five days in advance of meetings to enable Directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the matters to be 
discussed. The Board also holds at least one formal meeting per year in Kazakhstan to enable Directors to gain a greater understanding of 
the Group’s operating environment. In September 2009, the Board held a Board meeting in Astana. Whilst there, they visited Shubarkol 
Komir, Kazmarganets and Zhairem GOK open cast mines. Following the acquisition of CAMEC in November 2009, it is anticipated that the 
Board will also hold one of its annual meetings in Africa.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the General Counsel and Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the 
Board on corporate governance matters and ensuring that Board procedures and applicable laws and regulations are followed. The General 
Counsel and Company Secretary provides regular updates to the Board on the legal and regulatory environment and is responsible for 
ensuring that any other training needs are identified and met. The Company ensures that related party transactions are identified, disclosed 
and managed and a regular report is presented to the Board for approval. All Directors declare their interests in other businesses on 
appointment to the Board and a review of situational conflicts is carried out annually. On appointment, Directors are provided with adequate 
information to ensure that they fully understand the business of the Group and their legal and regulatory responsibilities as a Director of the 
Company. The appointment and removal of the General Counsel and Company Secretary is a matter for the Board. 46
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
The Board has put in place a procedure whereby all Directors have access, through the General Counsel and Company Secretary, to 
independent professional advice at the expense of the Company. The Company also maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance. An indemnity has been in place since 2008 for the benefit of current Directors and Officers of the Company 
and those of its subsidiaries to enable the Company to fund the costs incurred by Directors in defending certain claims against them in 
relation to their duties as Directors and Officers. The indemnity operates only to the extent that the Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance does not afford protection.
Board evaluation
In 2008 an external consultant was appointed to carry out the first annual Board Evaluation. In 2009 the decision was taken to conduct the 
annual Board evaluation process internally via the use of online questionnaires. Each Director was asked to complete detailed 
questionnaires about the Board, the Board Committees of which they were a member at the time of the evaluation and their personal 
assessment of Directors’ individual contributions. The results and any comments were amalgamated into a single report which was then 
discussed collectively by the Board.
The Board was satisfied that progress had been made and that the Board had worked well together over the course of the year. Areas of 
additional focus were identified and these will be addressed during 2010. These include furthering the Board’s knowledge of operating 
environments as the Group expands globally, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as increased focus on corporate strategy.
The non-executive Directors, led by Sir Richard Sykes as Senior Independent Director, would ordinarily have carried out an evaluation of 
the Chairman. However, in light of Dr Johannes Sittard’s recent appointment as Chairman, it was decided that a full review of his 
performance would be carried out during the next evaluation process.
Re-election of Directors
Under the current Articles of Association, a minimum of one-third of the Directors retire by rotation each year. This ensures that each 
Director is re-elected at least every three years. Dr Johannes Sittard, Mr Roderick Thomson and Mr Abdraman Yedilbayev will be offering 
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
Additionally, those Directors appointed by the Board since the AGM held in June 2009 are required to be formally elected for the first time 
by the shareholders in general meeting. Accordingly, Professor Dieter Ameling, Mr Felix Vulis and Ms Zaure Zaurbekova will all offer 
themselves for election at the AGM to be held in June 2010.
The Board remains satisfied that each Director proposed for election and re-election is competent to carry out his or her responsibilities 
as a member of the Board.
Board Committees
The Board has established five principal Committees. During September 2009, the Nomination Committee undertook a review of the 
membership of all the Board Committees and made a number of recommendations to the Board. As a result of this, the membership of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees was unchanged but changes were made to the membership of the Nomination and HSES 
Committees. In addition, the Nomination Committee recommended and the Board approved the formation of a new Mergers and 
Acquisitions Committee.

The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr Gerhard Ammann, who is considered to have recent and relevant financial experience. The other 
members of the Audit Committee are Sir Paul Judge, Mr Kenneth Olisa and Mr Roderick Thomson, all of whom are independent non-
executive Directors. Each member is considered to have extensive commercial and business leadership experience.
Under its terms of reference, which are available on the Company’s website, the Audit Committee is required to meet at least four times a 
year at appropriate times in the reporting and audit cycle. Meetings are timed so as to enable the Committee to review the Group’s key 
financial announcements prior to release. The Audit Committee Chairman provides a verbal update on the Committee findings and 
recommendations at the next Board meeting, identifying any matters in respect of which action or improvement is required.
Invitations to attend Audit Committee meetings are extended to the Chief Financial Officer, the Head of Internal Audit, the General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman, none of whom attend by right. In addition, the external auditors attend 
each Committee meeting and also meet separately with the Committee to facilitate discussions without the presence of management. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION

Received regular updates detailing the net risk assessment of the •	
Group and a summary of inherent risk matrices.
Reviewed Project Arrow: a Business Transformation Programme •	
which includes the design and implementation of new processes 
and the necessary IT systems.
Reviewed financial reporting procedures to be operated by the •	
Group.
External audit
The overall performance of the external auditors is reviewed annually 
by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible to the 
Board for ensuring that the external auditors remain independent of the 
Company in all material respects and that PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP, as external auditors, are adequately resourced so as to enable 
the delivery of an objective audit to the shareholders. The Audit 
Committee is also responsible for making formal recommendations 
each year to the Board in respect of the continuation of the external 
auditors in office. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the 
Company’s auditors since before it was listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in December 2007. The Audit Committee remains satisfied 
with their effectiveness and independence. Accordingly, the 
Committee has not considered it necessary to date, to require the 
firm to tender for its audit work. The external auditors are required to 
rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group and subsidiary 
audits every five years and the current lead partner has been in 
place for three years.
The Audit Committee also reviews the level and nature of any 
non-audit work to be performed during the year and considers 
whether it is appropriate for this work to be carried out by the 
external auditors. The external auditors are precluded from engaging 
in non-audit services that would compromise their independence 
and objectivity or violate any laws or regulations affecting their 
appointment as external auditors.
Internal Audit
The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee at each of 
its meetings and provides assurance, independent of the assurance 
provided by the Chief Financial Officer, that control activities, which 
have been subject to audit by his team, are operating effectively.
The implementation of an Internal Audit Charter, approved by the 
Committee in December 2008, has improved the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Group’s operations. The basis of the Internal Audit 
Charter states that the Head of Internal Audit is accountable to  
the Audit Committee and is to provide Group management with  
the following:
An independent, objective, positive assurance on effectiveness of •	
internal controls in mitigating inherent risks of audited processes 
or significant projects or initiatives.
To provide value-adding consulting services to the ENRC Group •	
management designed to improve the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Group’s operations, and to safeguard both the 
assets and the integrity of the Group.
Whistleblowing
The whistleblowing policy enables employees to raise any concerns 
they may have about workplace fraud or mismanagement with local 
management on a confidential basis. The complaint is then 
investigated in the first instance and a decision taken about further 
steps. Feedback is provided to the person making the complaint. 
Written records are kept of all whistleblowing incidents and a regular 
status report is presented at each Board meeting.
Health, Safety, Environment & Sustainability Committee  
(HSES Committee)
Following a review by the Board in September 2009, it was agreed 
that Mr Felix Vulis should become Chairman of the Committee 
following his appointment as CEO of the Group. Up until then the 
HSES Committee had been chaired by Dr Johannes Sittard. Dr 
Sittard remains a member of the Committee. The other members are 
Mr Abdraman Yedilbayev and Mr Eduard Utepov who are both 
non-executive Directors of the Company and Professor Dr Dieter 
Ameling an independent non-executive Director who was appointed 
to the Committee on 19 March 2010.
The role of the HSES Committee is to assist the Board in its 
oversight of the following:
health, safety, environment and community risks; •	
the Group’s compliance with applicable legal and regulatory •	
requirements associated with health, safety, environment and 
community matters;
the Group’s performance in relation to health, safety, environment •	
and community impact and monitoring sustainable development; 
and
the preparation of a report by the Committee to be included in the •	
Annual Report.
Further details of the work of the HSES Committee are set out in the 
Sustainability Review on pages 36 to 40.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee was chaired by Sir David Cooksey until 
his resignation as Chairman of the Company in August 2009. The 
Board appointed Dr Johannes Sittard as Chairman of the Committee 
in September 2009. At that time the Board reviewed the Committee 
membership and decided that in order to achieve a more effective 
Committee, the number of members be reduced. The other 
Committee members are Mr Gerhard Ammann, Sir Richard Sykes, 
Mr Roderick Thomson, and Mr Marat Beketayev.
The role of the Nomination Committee is as follows:
reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board, taking •	
into account the skills, knowledge and experience of Directors 
and for recommending to the Board any new candidates; and
giving full consideration as to whether non-executive Directors •	
have sufficient time to devote to the proper performance of their 
duties and make recommendations in relation to the retirement 
and re-election of Directors at the Company’s AGM and 
succession planning. 48

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
In addition, the Committee has assumed day to day responsibility for 
monitoring Directors’ conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of 
interest in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The 
Committee carried out an annual review of situational conflicts which 
was presented to the Board. As a result of this review, a number of 
additional situational conflicts were approved by the Board.
The Committee is required to meet at least twice a year and during 
2009 it met 12 times. The majority of these meetings were to 
consider and make recommendations in respect of the various 
Board changes and succession planning as part of the process. The 
Committee considered both internal and external candidates with 
relevant knowledge of the mining industry or experience of working 
in emerging markets. The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sir Richard Sykes and 
the other members are Mr Mehmet Dalman, Sir Paul Judge and Mr 
Kenneth Olisa all of whom are independent non-executive Directors. 
The Company complies with the Code recommendations regarding 
membership of the Remuneration Committee. The Committee’s 
terms of reference are available on the Company’s website.
The main roles of the Remuneration Committee are as follows:
to determine and recommend to the Board the broad policy for •	
the remuneration of Executive Directors and members of the 
senior management team;
to determine the policy and scope for pension rights for each •	
Executive Director;
approve the design of any performance-related pay schemes •	
operated by the Group and determine the relevant performance 
targets as well as approving annual payments made under such 
schemes;
to review the design of any share incentive plans for approval by •	
the Board and shareholders and to determine the performance 
targets and the appropriate level of annual awards to be made; 
and
to ensure that any compensation payments made in respect of •	
termination of contracts are fair to the individual but do not 
reward failure and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully 
recognised.
The remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive Directors is a 
matter for decision by the full Board.
During 2009 the Remuneration Committee met nine times. The 
Committee met:
to approve the bonus payments awarded in respect of •	
performance in 2008;
to determine and approve the performance targets for bonus •	
arrangements in respect of 2009; and
to determine the performance targets for the Long Term Incentive •	
Plan and to approve the awards made under the Plan in April 
2009.
As a result of the changes made at Board level, the Committee also 
considered a number of issues in relation to remuneration, including 
the approval of termination payments and early settlement of LTIP 
awards made to Dr Sittard and Miguel Perry. The Committee also 
considered and recommended the remuneration packages offered 
to Felix Vulis and Zaure Zaurbekova as new Executive Directors.
Further details are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
which is set out on pages 51 to 55. A resolution to approve the 
Remuneration Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Mergers and Acquisitions Committee
The Board decided in September 2009 that a Mergers and 
Acquisitions Committee should be formed to consider and scrutinise 
mergers and acquisition opportunities which may be of benefit to the 
Group. It is chaired by Mr Mehmet Dalman. The other members are 
Sir Richard Sykes, Mr Marat Beketayev and Professor Dr Dieter 
Ameling who was appointed to the Committee on 19 March 2010.
The main roles of the Committee are as follows:
to review and discuss with management all necessary due •	
diligence on prospective mergers and acquisition projects;
to receive detailed analysis of prospective mergers and •	
acquisitions projects;
to oversee the post-acquisition integration of target acquisitions; •	
and
to oversee the structuring and implementation of mergers and •	
acquisitions projects.
The Mergers and Acquisitions Committee meets on an ad hoc basis, 
as and when required. The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website.
The Group’s approach to Risk Assessment, Management and 
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s approach to Risk 
Management as described in the Risk Management section on 
pages 14 to 19.
Risk assessment
A systematic assessment of the risks which may adversely affect the 
achievement of the Group’s objectives operates throughout the 
Group. Management review the Key Business Risk Assessment on a 
regular basis which included a formal review in July 2009. The risk 
assessment was further reviewed by senior management as part of 
the process of producing this Annual Report and Accounts. Reports 
on Risk Management have been provided to the Audit Committee at 
each meeting during 2009. As part of the risk assessment process 
the Group has consistently adopted the following approach:
Management considers risks to the Group under the headings of:
Strategic Objectives – these relate to the Group’s long-term •	
business objectives.
Operational Objectives – these relate to the effectiveness and •	
efficiency of the Group’s operations, including performance and 
profitability goals and safeguarding resources against loss.
Compliance Objectives – these relate to the adherence of laws •	
and regulations to which Group companies are subject; and
Financial Objectives – these relate to the financial status of the •	
Group and Group companies and their arrangements for financial 
reporting, including the prevention of fraudulent public financial 
reporting.
This approach considers the potential impact of each risk and the 
likelihood of the risk materialising at an ‘inherent’ level, i.e., before 
considering any controls which may be in place to manage or 
mitigate the risk.
Response to key business risks
The output of each risk assessment meeting of management is an 
updated list of Key Business Risks which are those risks which have 
a high overall risk rating and therefore most critically require an 
appropriate response; this requires control procedures to be 
implemented to manage or mitigate those risks to a level which is 
consistent with the Group’s overall risk appetite. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION
49
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
The Group Risk Manager coordinates the process of responding to 
Key Business Risks and reports on these matters to the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Audit Committee. Each significant Group 
Company has appointed a Business Risk Manager to be the 
principal point of contact on matters of risk and control within that 
business. ENRC Africa will appoint a Business Risk Manager during 
2010. BML, the Group’s Joint Venture, has not appointed a Business 
Risk Manager at this stage in its development.
A list of the Key Business Risks arising from the assessment process, 
and the responses to those risks, is maintained by the Business Risk 
Managers. The Group risk matrices are tabled annually for review 
and adoption by the Audit Committee and the Committee receives 
quarterly reports on the risk management activities.
Evolution of the Group’s approach to risk management
During 2009 the Group has continued to develop its approach to 
Risk Management and Internal Control. We have further 
strengthened the Group’s Risk Management team by the 
appointment of a Risk Manager in ENRC Management KZ to be 
responsible for monitoring the roll out of the Risk Management 
policy across all Kazakhstani and Russian operations.
The Group’s Key Business Risks were further sub-analysed by 
management into those risks which were High Manageability, i.e. 
direct action by management is able to significantly reduce the 
potential impact of the risk arising, and Low Manageability, where 
management action is usually limited to monitoring external events. 
The Audit Committee agreed that management should concentrate 
on High Manageability risks during 2009 and 2010.
Independent consultants performed an assessment of our 
operational risk management procedures for the Kazakhstani and 
Russian businesses, and during 2010 plants will implement the 
recommendations which were raised by this review. A semi-annual 
monitoring of the implementation of these recommendations will be 
completed by the Group’s Risk Management team.
We engaged external consultants to assist us in the production of a 
detailed analysis of risks, including documentation of a detailed 
description of each risk and the development of Risk Action plans 
for High Manageability Key Business Risks.
Management also re-designed the Risk Reporting framework, based 
on industry best practice, and this now clearly defines and 
formalises roles and responsibilities for risk reporting within the 
Group. The Risk Reporting framework will be implemented across 
the Group during 2010.
The plan for further development in 2010 includes:
regular monitoring of the implementation of Risk Action plans; •	
the development of Key Risk Indicators to facilitate more effective •	
monitoring and analysis of risks which have materialised;
quarterly monitoring of risk assessment; •	
regular reporting to management on the implementation of Risk •	
Action plans; and
regular Risk Reporting to the Audit Committee. •	
Assurance on the operation of systems of internal control
The Board considers risk assessment and internal control to be 
fundamental to achieving the Group’s business objectives and has 
put in place an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by the Group. This process, 
which is consistent with the Turnbull guidance in the Combined 
Code, has been in place during the year under review and has 
continued up to the date of approval of the Annual Report  
and Accounts.
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can provide only reasonable assurance against the risk of material 
misstatement or loss.
Key elements of the internal control process are as follows:
The Board regularly reviews and updates the Group’s strategy •	
and those of its operating companies.
The Board reviews performance through a monthly system of •	
reporting, measured against an annual budget, supplemented by 
quarterly business reviews of actual results.
The Board seeks assurance that effective control is being •	
maintained and deficiencies addressed through regular reports 
from the Audit Committee.
Risk management and internal control systems in relation to 
financial reporting
The main features of the Group’s systems of Risk Management and 
Internal Control in relation to Financial Reporting, other than the 
general principles referred to above, are: 
Control Environment – the way in which management •	
communicates principles and policies, delegates authority and 
reports on compliance;
Risk Management – the way in which management identifies the •	
critical risks and decides on the most effective response to those 
risks;
Control Activities – the way in which management uses •	
preventative and detective controls to minimise the risk of error; 
and 
Monitoring – the way in which management oversees the above •	
activities.
Control environment
The Group’s Code of Conduct has been presented throughout the 
Group to key members of management and is the subject of annual 
confirmation on compliance from the management of all significant 
Group companies. New employees are provided with a copy of the 
code as part of their induction to the Group.
The Group’s Accounting Methodology Manager (‘AMM’) is 
responsible, on the basis of delegated authority from the Chief 
Financial Officer, for designing and communicating accounting 
policies, practices and procedures to all Group companies, working 
closely with the Group’s Corporate Reporting Group (‘CRG’). The 
AMM also provides technical interpretation and advice to members 
of the Group’s finance teams. A Group Finance Manual was 
approved by the Audit Committee in December 2008 and circulated 
to all the Group’s finance teams. Updates to the manual are issued 
whenever it is necessary.
CRG issue a monthly set of instructions and timetable for the 
completion of internal financial reporting forms including the 
requirement to follow up on any issues which were identified during 
the closure of the previous period. The accuracy and timeliness of 
receipt of those forms is monitored by the Systems Support 
Manager (‘SSM’). CRG also host a monthly teleconference of Group 
finance teams to discuss and resolve financial reporting issues 
immediately prior to each month-end.
The consolidation of financial performance and assets and liabilities 
is performed on a software system which has appropriate access 
controls and which is maintained by a Systems Support team who 
are independent of the teams inputting and reviewing data. All 
significant movements and unusual items in data which is submitted 
are reviewed by a senior member of CRG. Key consolidation journals 
relating to data submitted by Group companies are reviewed within  50
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Corporate Governance
CRG in accordance with their significance. A reconciliation and 
analysis of consolidation journals is reviewed by the Group Financial 
Controller. Consolidated Profitability and Net Assets are reconciled 
back to original data inputs.
Internal financial reports are produced monthly by CRG and the 
Budget and Analysis team (‘B&A’) and reviewed by senior members 
of the Group finance team and then distributed to management and 
the Board.
B&A produce quarterly instructions and a timetable to be followed 
by Group companies in the preparation of quarterly forecasts and 
the annual budget. B&A monitor compliance with the instructions 
and timetable and follow up any cases of non-compliance.
Risk management
As part of the Group’s overall approach to Risk Management the 
risks relating to Financial Reporting are identified and ownership of 
these risks is taken by the Chief Financial Officer. A subsequent Risk 
action plan is prepared to ensure that there are adequate controls in 
place to manage the risks.
Control activities
The Risk action plan for risks relating to Financial Reporting is 
designed to identify the control activities which need to take place in 
different parts of the Group to minimise the risk of error in the 
Group’s internal and external financial reports. Responsibility for the 
implementation of these control activities is documented and 
communicated to relevant members of finance teams. All members 
of finance teams receive appropriate training, including updates 
whenever there are any significant proposed changes in procedures.
Monitoring
Senior members of finance teams are delegated responsibility for 
monitoring compliance with the instructions issued by CRG and  
B&A and for ensuring that Control Activities are effectively 
implemented. Any cases of non-compliance are identified and 
escalated for resolution.
Approach to the annual review of internal control
For 2009 the Group continued to improve the process for reviewing 
the systems of Internal Control and reviewed the existing key 
controls which were managing the Group’s High Manageability Key 
Business Risks. The basis of the review for 2009 included:
An assessment of the results of Internal Audit reviews of High •	
Manageability Key Business Risks where Internal Audit had 
performed testing in 2009; and
Controls over Financial Reporting and Consolidation were •	
reviewed in the context of coverage from reviews by external 
advisors.
As CAMEC was only purchased in November 2009, the Group is in 
the process of doing further work to assess the control environment 
in, and rolling out risk management policies to, the acquired 
companies. This further work is supplemental to the pre-acquisition 
due diligence work that was conducted.
For key controls relating to High Manageability Key Business Risks 
which were not covered by Internal Audit or external advisor’s 
reviews, the Risk Management team performed walkthrough tests to 
see whether the control is in place and is in compliance with 
required policies and procedures.
The conclusions arising from the 2009 Annual Review of Internal 
Control were that:
The Group has adopted a range of policies and procedures which •	
constitute the Group’s systems of Internal Control and these 
policies and procedures are being effectively operated within the 
Group’s businesses but there needs to be a greater level of 
consistency within these policies and procedures across the 
Group;
The Group needs to adopt a more effective approach by •	
management to the monitoring of compliance with the Group’s 
policies and procedures; and
During 2010 the Group intends to reinforce the policies and •	
procedures which have already been adopted and to roll out a set 
of consistent policies throughout the Group, including non-
Kazakhstan operations, BML, the Group’s Joint Venture, and the 
recently acquired businesses.
The Audit Committee has reviewed a report from the Chief Financial 
Officer setting out the contents and findings of the above approach 
which explains the basis on which she has obtained assurance as to 
the operation of the Group’s systems of internal controls.
Relations with shareholders
During 2009 the Group met with a large number of investors  
in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and the United States  
of America.
As part of its investor relations programme, the Group aims to 
provide a high level of transparency and communication to investors 
and analysts on a regular and timely basis, through announcements, 
meetings and seminars. The Group seeks to develop a regular 
dialogue with investors and analysts and to respond to their 
challenges and to understand their sentiments and concerns. The 
Group has a comprehensive investor relations website which has up 
to date information available to all shareholders and investors. All 
shareholders have the opportunity to attend and raise questions at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
The Group aspires to have an investor relations programme that is 
ranked highly amongst its peers for its accessibility, responsiveness 
and disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer aim to meet all major shareholders at least twice a year and, 
with other senior management, to meet with a wide range of 
shareholders and prospective investors in the United Kingdom, 
continental Europe, Russia and the United States of America during 
the year. These discussions will focus on the results and businesses 
of the Group but will also seek to learn of any concerns amongst 
investors. The Group will also seek to meet with sell-side analysts to 
raise the Group’s profile and to build the research coverage.
Information on investor relations activity and analysts’ and brokers’ 
reports are regularly circulated to the Board. The Chairman and 
non-executive Directors are free to attend investor relations 
meetings or to request meetings with investors or analysts 
independent of the Group’s management.
The third Annual General Meeting is due to be held on 9 June 2010 
and the Board welcomes the opportunity to answer questions put 
forward to them by shareholders of the Company.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Introduction
As required by Section 420 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Directors present their report on Directors’ remuneration for the year 
ended 31 December 2009.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board. 
Its remit is set out in terms of reference formally adopted by the 
Board in 2007 and which were reviewed and amended in December 
2009. The terms of reference are designed to enable the Committee 
to comply with the requirements relating to remuneration policy set 
out in the Code. A copy of the terms of reference can be found on 
the Company’s website.
The principal responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are:
To determine and recommend to the Board a broad framework •	
for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Chairman, the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary and other senior 
executives of the Group;
To monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s remuneration policy; •	
To approve the design and performance targets of any •	
performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group and to 
approve the total annual payments made under such schemes; 
and
To review the design of share based incentives and determine the •	
level and extent to which awards are made during the year.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee, all of whom are independent 
non-executive Directors and were appointed on 6 December 2007, 
are as follows:
Sir Richard Sykes (Chairman) •	
Mehmet Dalman •	
Sir Paul Judge •	
Kenneth Olisa •	
The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and the Head of Human 
Resources also attend Committee meetings by invitation, but none 
is present when the Committee discusses issues relating to their 
own remuneration.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
During the year, Kepler Associates were retained by the Committee 
to carry out a review of the senior executive remuneration and to 
provide advice in relation to the Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). 
Other than as described above, no other service was provided by 
Kepler Associates to the Group during the year.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is focused upon providing a level of 
remuneration which attracts, retains and motivates Directors and 
senior executives of sufficient calibre to achieve the Group’s 
strategic goals and enhance shareholder value, whilst ensuring that 
remuneration is consistent with best practice and provides an 
appropriate alignment with personal and business performance. The 
Committee recognises that there is a competitive market for 
successful executives with experience in the mining industry and 
that the provision of appropriate rewards for superior performance is 
important for the continued growth of the business. The 
Committee’s aim in formulating remuneration policy is to assess 
relevant benchmark data from sources such as other FTSE 100 
companies of a similar size and complexity, international mining 
companies and the market generally. In setting remuneration within 
this framework, the Committee aims to give senior executives every 
encouragement to enhance the Group’s performance whilst ensuring 
that they are fairly, but responsibly, rewarded for their personal 
contributions.
As a result of the economic downturn and its impact on our 
operations in Kazakhstan, it was agreed in January 2009 that both 
Executive Directors and all Executive Committee members would 
accept a temporary 10% reduction in their remuneration for a period 
of six months, ending 30 June 2009.
The Committee believes that it is important to benchmark the 
remuneration packages of senior executives, particularly during 
periods of economic turmoil. Accordingly, at the beginning of 2009, 
the Committee instructed Kepler Associates to carry out a full review 
of senior executive remuneration packages. As a consequence of 
this review, the Committee decided to make some changes for 2009 
to the Annual Performance Bonus as disclosed in the relevant 
section below.
Components of Executive Directors’ remuneration
Remuneration packages are structured to provide an appropriate 
balance between fixed and variable elements. The main components 
of the two Executive Directors’ remuneration and the percentage of 
each element as part of the total package are detailed below.
These charts have been calculated on amounts paid as CEO and CFO; the LTIP 
award value is however a pro rata amount to cover their time in their respective 
roles as CEO and CFO. The LTIPs were granted earlier in the year based on their 
senior management roles and not Executive Director roles. In the future the LTIP 
amount is likely to form a greater proportion of total remuneration as the maximum 
award for CEO is 200% of salary and the maximum award for CFO is 175% of 
salary. Maximum awards for senior managers are 100% of salary.
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee and take 
account of the relevant benchmark data (as described above), pay 
quantum and structure more generally throughout the Group.
Annual bonus
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the performance measures 
for the annual bonus arrangements were amended slightly so that 
they were based on Group financial performance (75% of bonus 
potential), health and safety performance (15% of bonus potential) 
and personal performance (10% of bonus potential).
Specific financial targets have not been disclosed as they are 
considered to be commercially confidential but they are deemed to 
be appropriately challenging by the Committee and will only pay out 
in full for exceptional performance.
Remuneration Report 52
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Corporate Governance
Remuneration Report continued
The maximum bonus potential for 2009, payable for exceptional levels of performance, was set at 200% of base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and 175% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer. Half of the maximum bonus potential was payable at target 
performance levels. Details of the actual amounts paid for 2009 are set out in the Directors’ emoluments table on page 53.
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP allows the Committee to make awards which are a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration. Annual 
awards may not exceed an amount equal to two times base salary. An award will normally vest (i.e become exerciseable) on the third 
anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
The extent to which awards may vest will be subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance over a three year period 
relative to the TSR performance of a specified comparator group of companies. These share awards will vest in full only if the Company’s 
TSR performance is ranked at upper quartile or above within the comparator group and the following vesting schedule will apply:
TSR Proportion of LTIP award exerciseable
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Median to upper quartile Pro rata between 25%–100%
Upper quartile 100%
The TSR comparator group are:
BHP Billiton Rio Tinto
Xstrata Alcoa
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Teck Cominco
Vedanta Resources Mount Gibson
Antofagasta Cameco
Kazakhmys Peabody Energy
Fortescue Metals Cliffs Natural Resources
Vale SA Group Mexico
Ferrexpo Aluminium Corp of China
Mitsubishi Materials Corp Outokumpo OYJ
  
The performance condition for all awards under the LTIP provides for the exclusion from the comparator group of those companies that 
cease to be listed and the exclusion of those companies that have been subject to a recommended takeover offer and are therefore in the 
process of delisting. Where companies are excluded from the comparator group, the median/upper quartile rankings are recalculated using 
the reduced number of companies in the comparator group.
Although there has been a reduction in the number of comparator companies from 22 to 20, the Committee still views them as effective 
comparators. The comparator companies that were removed were Portland which was acquired by Cleveland Cliffs Inc (now known as Cliffs 
Natural Resources) on 11 December 2008 and Aricom which was acquired by Peter Hambro on 22 April 2009.
In addition to the above, the awards will not vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Company’s TSR over the 
performance period reflects the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The Committee considers that TSR remains the most appropriate measure of long-term Company performance, providing alignment of 
interests between management and shareholders, and therefore the 2010 LTIP awards will be subject to the same performance condition.
In 2009, the maximum level of award under the LTIP was set at 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer, based on the average 
market value of the shares over the five days preceding the date of grant.
As announced on 25 March 2009, Miguel Perry decided to step down as CFO of the Group with effect from 30 June 2009. Accordingly, no 
LTIP award was made to him in April 2009.

1 Dr Johannes Sittard resigned as CEO and was appointed as non-executive Chairman on 20 August 2009.
2 Felix Vulis was appointed as an Executive Director on 20 August 2009.
3 Zaure Zaurbekova was appointed as an Executive Director on 30 September 2009.
4 Miguel Perry resigned as an Executive Director 30 June 2009.
5 Sir David Cooksey resigned as non-executive Chairman on 20 August 2009.
6 Michael Eggleton resigned as non-executive Director on 6 October 2009.
On 30 June 2009, Miguel Perry stepped down as Chief Financial Officer and as a Director of the Company. Under the terms of his service 
agreement, he was entitled to receive a payment in lieu of notice of 12 months’ salary. He was paid a termination sum of £670,000 to take 
account of his contractual entitlements and by way of compensation for loss of office in return for entering into a compromise agreement 
with the Company. In addition, Mr Perry had in 2008 been granted an award under the LTIP. Under the Rules of the Plan, the Remuneration 
Committee were permitted to exercise their discretion in deciding whether to release any shares to Mr Perry as an early leaver. The 
Remuneration Committee assessed the performance condition within the Plan to the date of termination of Mr Perry’s employment and the 
time served since the award was made and approved the release of 20,060 shares. This equated to a cash equivalent payment of £186,347 
in lieu of a transfer of shares.
On 20 August 2009, Sir David Cooksey stepped down as non-executive Chairman of the Board and Dr Johannes Sittard accepted the 
position of Chairman. In March 2009, Dr Johannes Sittard had entered into a new service agreement as Chief Executive Officer. Under this 
service agreement he was entitled to a payment in lieu of notice of 12 months’ salary in the event that his contract was terminated by the 
Company. After consultation with the Company’s major shareholders it was agreed that Dr Johannes Sittard was the preferred choice to 
become non-executive Chairman following Sir David Cooksey’s departure. As a result, his service agreement was terminated and it was 
agreed that a mitigated payment of £1,000,000 would be paid to him in lieu of notice.
In addition, Dr Johannes Sittard had in 2008 and 2009 been granted awards made under the LTIP. The Remuneration Committee were 
permitted to exercise their discretion as to the release of shares to Dr Sittard as an early leaver. The Committee assessed the performance 
condition within the Plan to the date of termination of Dr Sittard’s employment and the time served since the awards were made and 
subsequently approved the release of 107,087 shares from the 2008 award and 60,728 shares from the 2009 award. The Committee also 
determined that a cash payment would be made to Dr Sittard in lieu of a transfer of these shares. As the Company was, during the 
remainder of the financial year, in a prohibited period under the UKLA’s Model Code on share dealings, the Rules of the Plan provided that 
no transfer of shares (or, as a result, payment in lieu of shares) to Dr Sittard could take place. The Remuneration Committee also agreed to  54

determine the amount of the cash payment in lieu of shares as soon 
as it was able following the date on which the Company was no 
longer in a prohibited period. At its meeting on 25 March 2010, 
immediately after the announcement of the Company’s preliminary 
results which marked the end of the prohibited period, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that the cash payment in lieu 
of shares be made at £12.01 per share (resulting in an aggregate 
payment of £2,015,458) being the closing share price on the date of 
the announcement of the Company’s preliminary results.
Directors’ contracts
Executive Directors
Both Executive Directors have service agreements which can be 
terminated by either the Group or the Executive Director giving 12 
months’ notice. Under the terms of the agreements, the Group 
reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to terminate an 
Executive Director’s employment by making a payment in lieu of 
notice. In the event of a contract being terminated, the Remuneration 
Committee would determine the level of any compensation to be 
paid, normally by reference to fixed elements of remuneration and 
the notice period. Any annual bonus payment or vesting of shares 
under the LTIP would be at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee. Payments would normally be pro-rated and subject to 
the performance conditions under which the awards were granted.
Dates of the service agreements are:
Name Date Notice period
Felix Vulis 20 August 2009 12 months
Zaure Zaurbekova 1 October 2009 12 months
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to 
accept outside appointments on external boards or committees so 
long as these are not deemed to interfere with the business of the 
Company. Any fees in respect of those appointments are retained by 
the Executive Directors concerned. During 2009, Dr Johannes 
Sittard whilst in his capacity as the Chief Executive Officer received 
no earnings in respect of external directorships or committees 
(2008: US$200,000).
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors do not have service agreements with the 
Company, but each has a Letter of Appointment. Details of the

of the Company.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors (other than the 
Chairman) is a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
Fees are designed to ensure that the Company attracts and retains 
high calibre individuals. They are reviewed on an annual basis and 
account is taken of the level of fees paid by other companies of a 
similar size and complexity. Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in any annual bonus plan, long-term incentive plan or 
pension arrangements. The Company repays the reasonable 
expenses that non-executive Directors incur in carrying out their 
duties as Directors.
The fees payable to the Deputy Chairman are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and following a review, the level of fees 
remain unchanged for 2010.
During 2009 the base fee for non-executive Directors was £100,000 
per annum. There was no increase in this fee for 2010.
Additional fees of £20,000 per annum are payable to Gerhard 
Ammann as chairman of the Audit Committee and additional fees of 
£150,000 per annum are payable to Sir Richard Sykes in relation to 
his chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee, his role as Senior 
Independent Director and as Deputy Chairman. There was no 
increase in these fees for 2010
As members of the Kazakhstani Government, neither Mr Beketayev 
nor Mr Utepov are permitted to receive their fees personally. The 
fees for Mr Beketayev were donated to the London School of 
Economics and Political Science. As part of a larger and already 
ongoing engagement with Kazakhstan to facilitate the training and 
development needs of its Government, the School kindly offered to 
support two study visits for small groups of government officials 
from Kazakhstan in 2009. Mr Utepov has donated his fees for 2008 
and 2009 to the Nursultan Nazarbaev Educational Foundation.

Corporate Governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union, and the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under Company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them •	
consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable •	
and prudent;
state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and •	
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
consolidated and parent company financial statements 
respectively; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis •	
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and 
the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 04 and 05 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared •	
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Group;
the parent company financial statements, which have been •	
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company; 
and
the Directors’ Report and Business Review include a fair review •	
of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the year ended 31 
December 2009 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and 
the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 56, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at •	
31 December 2009 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as •	
adopted by the European Union; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the •	
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial •	
year for which the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law •	
are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we •	
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the directors’ statement, set out on page 50, in relation to going •	
concern; and
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the •	
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the 
year ended 31 December 2009 and on the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been 
audited.

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
1. Principal accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC (the ‘Company’) was incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales on 
8 December 2006. The address of the Company’s registered office is 16 St. James’s Street, London, SW1A 1ER, United Kingdom. The 
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
and the Group’s interest in a joint venture and associates.
The accounting policies used in preparing these consolidated financial statements (‘financial statements’) are described below and are 
based on International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’), the Listing Rules of the United 
Kingdom Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’), the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and Article 4 of the 
European Union IAS Regulation. These standards are subject to interpretations issued from time to time by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretation Committee (‘IFRIC’). These consolidated financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
necessitates management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher 
degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in 
note 2.
The financial statements have been drawn up on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 except where new policies have been applied. New accounting policies and pronouncements and the 
effects of these policies have been outlined in note 3.
b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain 
economic benefits from its activities, generally accompanying, directly or indirectly, an interest of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company (acquisition date) and are de-consolidated from 
the date that control ceases.
c) Joint ventures
Joint ventures are all entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous 
consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. The Group has elected to use the equity method to account for interests in jointly 
controlled entities, which are disclosed as joint ventures in the financial statements and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s 
investment in joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The Group’s share of its joint venture’s post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement and its share of post-
aquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted 
against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint 
venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint 
ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
d) Minority interests
Minority interests are that part of the profit or loss and of the net assets, which are attributable to interests which are not owned, directly or 
indirectly, by the Company. Minority interests form a separate component of the Group’s equity.
The Group has adopted the ‘parent company method’ and applies a policy of treating transactions with minority interests as transactions 
with parties external to the Group. Gains or losses arising from disposals of minority interests are recorded in the income statement. 
Purchases from minority interests result in goodwill, being the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 
the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary.
e) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. When the 
Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in that associate the Group does not recognise further losses, unless 
it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

1. Principal accounting policies continued
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of 
the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the 
investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred.
f) Functional and presentational currency
All amounts in these financial statements are presented in millions of US$, unless otherwise stated.
The functional currency of the significant operating entities is either the Kazakhstani tenge (‘KZT’) or the Russian rouble (‘RUB’), whilst for 
the Sales and Marketing entities it is the US dollar (‘US$’). The functional currency for major entities in the Group is determined as the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The following additional factors are considered in determining the 
functional currency of a foreign operation:
Whether the activities of the foreign operation are carried out as an extension of the reporting entity, rather than being carried out with a •	
significant degree of autonomy.
Whether transactions with the reporting entity are a high or a low proportion of the foreign operation’s activities. •	
Whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation directly affect the cash flows of the reporting entity and are readily •	
available for remittance to it.
Whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation are sufficient to service existing and normally expected debt obligations •	
without funds being made available by the reporting entity.
The functional currency for the Company is the US$.
The following table shows, for the years indicated, the principal rates of exchange used for the Kazakhstani tenge, expressed in Kazakhstani 
tenge per US$1.00.

Year ended 31 December 2008 29.38 24.86
g) Foreign currency translation
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated to the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying 
cash flow hedges.
h) Translation from functional to presentational currency
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are 
translated into the presentational currency as follows:
Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet. •	
Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable •	
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the dates of the transactions).
All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. •	
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity •	
and translated at the closing rate at the date of acquisition. When a subsidiary is disposed of through sale, liquidation, repayment of 
share capital or abandonment of all, or part of, that entity, the exchange differences deferred in equity are recognised in the income 
statement. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
1. Principal accounting policies continued
i) Revenue recognition
A significant portion of production is sold under contracts of sale of goods. Revenue from sales of goods is only recognised on individual 
shipments when persuasive evidence exists that the following criteria are satisfied:
the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer. If it is arranged that the goods are •	
transported to a specified location, revenue is recognised when the goods are passed to the customer at the destination point. The 
revenue from sales of many products is subject to adjustment based on an inspection of the product by the customer. In such cases, 
revenue is initially recognised on a provisional basis using the Group’s best estimate of the quantity/quality of the product. Any 
subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of quantity/quality of the product is recorded in revenue once they have been determined;
neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold has •	
been retained;
the amount of revenue and respective costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably; and •	
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group. •	
Revenues from sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered by reference to the stage  
of completion of the specific transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual services provided, as a proportion of the total services to  
be provided.
Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When the fair value of goods or services received in a 
barter transaction involving dissimilar items cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or service 
given up. Revenues are shown net of VAT and discounts.
j) Finance income and cost
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains and income on investment and trading securities. Finance cost 
comprise interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions, interest expense from the unwinding of the discount 
on provisions for asset retirement obligations and losses on the revaluation and disposal of investments designated at fair value through 
profit or loss.
Finance income and cost include foreign exchange gains and losses that relate mainly to loans receivable, borrowings, term deposits (more 
than three months).
Interest income and expenses are recognised on a time proportion basis, using the effective interest method. All interest and other costs 
incurred in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred as part of financial expenses unless incurred on borrowings to finance the 
construction of property, plant and equipment in which case they are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and 
prepare the asset for its intended use.
k) Income tax
The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In that case, tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Kazakhstani Excess Profits Tax, being a tax on income, forms part of the income 
tax expense.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year. It is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and including any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises 
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates – and laws – that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred assets to be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either 
the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 66

l) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the 
balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the 
balance sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
m) Finance leases and hire purchase commitments
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased items, are capitalised at the 
commencement of the lease term. Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair 
value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. The capital elements, net of finance charges, of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as 
current or long-term payables in the balance sheet, as appropriate. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and 
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
charged to the income statement. Capitalised lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of 
the asset.
n) Operating leases
Where the Group is a lessee in a lease which does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership from the lessor 
to the Group, the total lease payments, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the period of the lease. For operating leases of facilities used in the process of production activity, the rental expense is 
recognised in the cost of sales. For operating leases relating to the use of administrative facilities, the rental expense is recognised in the 
selling, general and administrative expense in the income statement.
Where the Group is a lessor under an operating lease, the lease payments receivable are recognised as rental income on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
o) Exploration and evaluation
Exploration and evaluation expenditure related to an area of interest are written off as incurred until the management conclude that it is 
probable that future costs will be recovered through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively through 
its sale, from which point they are carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet and are included as a component of property, plant and 
equipment at cost less impairment charges.
Capitalised costs include costs directly related to exploration and evaluation activities in the relevant area of interest. Selling, general and 
administrative costs are allocated to an exploration or evaluation asset only to the extent that those costs can be related directly to 
operational activities in the relevant area of interest. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed for impairment if 
facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.
The following facts and circumstances, among others indicate that exploration and evaluation assets must be tested for impairment:
the period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the near future, •	
and is not expected to be renewed;
substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor •	
planned;
exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of •	
mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; or
sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the •	
exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, the exploration and evaluation assets subject to testing are grouped with existing cash-
generating units of operating mines that are located in the same geographical region. Where the assets are not associated with a specific 
cash-generating unit, the recoverable amount is assessed for the specific exploration area.
Any impairment loss is recognised as an expense in accordance with the policy on impairment of non-financial assets.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised as assets at their fair value at the 
date of acquisition.
p) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Depreciation is 
recorded over the useful life of the asset, or over the expected remaining life of the mine if shorter, as follows:
Buildings and mining constructions: 20 to 50 years on a straight-line basis. •	
Mining assets: on a units of production basis. •	
Plant and equipment: 4 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. •	
Motor vehicles: 5 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. •	
Land is not depreciated. •	
The residual value of an asset is nil if the Group expects to use the asset until the end of its physical life. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
67
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Estimates of residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually, and any change in estimate is taken into account in the determination 
of future depreciation charges.
The individual significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment (components), whose useful lives are different from the useful life 
of the asset as a whole, are depreciated individually, applying depreciation rates reflecting their anticipated useful lives. The cost of 
replacing major parts or components of property, plant and equipment items is capitalised and the replaced part is retired.
Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other 
repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Specialised spare parts and servicing equipment with a significant initial value and a useful life of more than one year are recognised as 
items of property, plant and equipment. Other spare parts and servicing-related equipment are recognised as inventories and accounted for 
in the income statement on utilisation.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income 
statement.
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, in accordance with 
the impairment policy below.
i) Mining assets
Once a project has been established as commercially viable, capitalised expenditures are transferred from ‘exploration and evaluation’ to 
‘mining assets’. In addition, mining assets include expenditure incurred to establish or expand productive capacity, costs to conduct 
mining-construction and mining-capital works, as well as costs arising from mining preparation works during the development or mine 
reconstruction phase.
Development expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the Group is accumulated separately for each area of interest in which economically 
recoverable resources have been identified. Such expenditure comprises costs directly attributable to the construction of a mine and the 
related infrastructure, including the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
When further development expenditure is incurred in respect of a mining asset after the commencement of production, such expenditure is 
carried forward as part of mining assets when it is probable that additional future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will 
flow to the Group. Otherwise such expenditure is recognised as a cost of production.
Once a project has been fully commissioned, depreciation is charged using the units of production method, based on proved and probable 
reserves, with separate calculations being made for each area of interest. The units of production basis results in a depreciation charge 
proportional to the depletion of proved and probable reserves.
Mining assets are included within the category ‘Buildings and mining construction’ of property, plant and equipment.
ii) Assets under construction
Assets under construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. Self-constructed assets include the 
cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category. Assets under construction are not depreciated. 
Depreciation commences on the earlier of the date when the assets are brought into service or the assets are available for use.
iii) Stripping costs
Stripping costs comprise the removal of overburden and other waste products from a mine. Stripping costs incurred in the development of 
mines and open pits before production commences are capitalised as part of the cost of constructing the mines and open pits, and 
depreciated using the unit of production method over the lives of the mines or open pits.
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of operations are treated as a production cost that form part of the cost of inventory.
q) Impairment
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and all other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if facts and 
circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of ‘value in use’ (being the net 
present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit) and ‘fair value less costs to sell’ (the amount obtainable 
from the sale of an asset or cash-generating unit in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of 
disposal). Where there is no binding sale agreement or active market, fair value less costs to sell is based on the best information available 
to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash-generating unit in an arm’s length transaction. A cash-generating unit is the 
smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets. 68
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
The estimates used for impairment reviews to determine ‘value in use’ are based on detailed mine plans and operating budgets, modified as 
appropriate to meet the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Future cash flows are based on:
estimates of the quantities of the reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction; •	
future production levels; •	
future commodity prices; and •	
future cash costs of production, capital expenditure related to construction in progress and development projects that are not yet •	
completed, close down, restoration and environmental clean up.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income 
statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted in the impairment. This 
reversal is recognised in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
r) Business combinations and goodwill
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value 
of the assets given up, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition. The date of exchange is the acquisition date where a business combination is achieved in a single transaction, and is the 
date of each share purchase where a business combination is achieved in stages by successive share purchases.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the acquiree, represents goodwill. Any excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired over the cost of acquisition (‘excess of acquirer’s interest’ or ‘negative goodwill’) is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the business combination. These cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units represent the 
lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and these groups are not larger than the 
Group’s operating segments, which are its product groups.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in accordance with the impairment policy described in the note above. Goodwill is measured at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses.
s) Intangible assets
Intangible assets, which are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value when the fair value can be measured 
reliably on initial recognition. Intangible assets are tested for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, in 
accordance with the impairment policy described above.
Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives not exceeding 20 years.
t) Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: loans and receivables, financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and held-to-maturity financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for 
which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
i) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are unquoted non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments. They are included in current 
assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s 
loans and receivables comprise mainly ‘loans receivable’, ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the balance 
sheet.
ii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if 
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedges.
iii) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the 
other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the 
balance sheet date. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
69
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
1. Principal accounting policies continued
iv) Held-to-maturity financial assets
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the 
Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than an insignificant amount of 
held-to-maturity financial assets, the whole category would be reclassified as available-for-sale.
Recognition and measurement
Purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised on the relevant settlement date, which is the date that an asset is delivered to 
or by the Group. The change in value between the trade date and settlement date is not recognised for assets carried at cost or amortised 
cost. The change in value between the trade date and settlement date is recognised in the income statement for financial assets as ‘at fair 
value through profit or loss’.
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, loans and receivables are stated at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Where a loan is provided at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is 
remeasured at origination at its fair value, which is represented by future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market 
interest rates for similar loans. The difference between the fair value of the loan at origination and its cost (fair value of the contribution to 
the borrower, net of transaction costs) represents an origination gain or loss. The origination gain or loss is recorded in the income 
statement within finance income/costs unless it qualifies for recognition as an asset, liability or a charge to equity in accordance with the 
substance of the arrangement. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the loans is adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss 
and the amortisation is recorded as finance income/costs using the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets carried at fair value through 
profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Available-for-sale financial 
assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available-for-
sale monetary items, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or 
loss in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Interest on available-for-sale securities calculated using effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Dividends on 
available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.
Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
The Group derecognises financial assets when: (i) the assets are redeemed or the rights to cash flows from the assets have otherwise 
expired; (ii) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets; or (iii) the Group has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership but has not retained control. Control is retained if the counterparty 
does not have the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party without needing to impose additional restrictions 
on the sale.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is 
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment 
as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact 
on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of 
impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments, when it becomes probable that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, 
where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or 
economic conditions that correlate with defaults, and prolonged decline in the value of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale.
i) Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments carried at amortised cost 
has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial assets original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of loss is recognised in the 
income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to 
an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting an allowance 
account. 70

ii) Assets classified as available-for-sale
The decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in other comprehensive income. When there is an objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity 
to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment even though the financial asset has not been derecognised. The amount of the 
cumulative loss that is reclassified from equity to the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal 
repayment and amortisation) and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income 
statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale 
are not reversed through the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale 
increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income 
statement, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in the income statement.
u) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group holds derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, to hedge its foreign currency exposure in relation to 
operating costs.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income 
statement when incurred on the date a derivative contract is entered into. Derivative financial instruments are subsequently remeasured at 
their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitment (fair value •	
hedge);
hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to particular risk associated with a recognised asset or •	
liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). •	
The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its 
risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at 
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Management policy has been to hedge a proportion of foreign exchange risk associated with highly probable forecast transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies, refer note 34 for details.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘other 
operating income/expense’. Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item 
affects profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss existing in equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement.
Movements on derivatives not designated as hedge derivatives are taken to ‘other operating income/expense’ in the income statement.
Refer note 34 for disclosure of derivatives and financial risk management.
v) Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory is determined on a weighted average basis.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost for raw 
materials is purchase price or extraction cost and for work in progress and finished goods is the cost of production, including the 
appropriate proportion of depreciation and overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to 
completion and disposal. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Principal accounting policies continued
w) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the 
original effective interest rate. The movement in the provision from the previous reporting period is recognised in the income statement. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or 
delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against ‘selling, general and administration expenses’ in the income statement.
x) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. Balances 
restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date are included in other 
non-current assets, while balances restricted for more than three months but less than 12 months after the balance sheet date are included 
in trade and other receivables. Restricted balances are excluded from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow 
statement.
y) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference 
between the proceeds net of transaction cost and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings using the effective interest method.
Where a loan is obtained at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is remeasured at origination to its fair value, which is 
calculated as future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans. The difference 
between the fair value of the loan at origination and its cost (fair value of the contribution to the borrower, net of transaction costs) 
represents an origination gain or loss. The origination gain or loss is recorded in the income statement within finance income/costs unless it 
qualifies for recognition as an asset, liability or a charge to equity in accordance with the substance of the arrangement. Subsequently, the 
carrying amount of the borrowings is adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss and the amortisation is recorded as finance 
income/cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after balance sheet date.
z) Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where 
there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class 
of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same 
class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to 
passage of time is recognised as a part of finance costs.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a 
separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
aa) Asset retirement obligations and other environmental provisions
An obligation to incur asset retirement costs occurs when environmental disturbance is caused by exploration, evaluation, development or 
ongoing production. Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular review. Estimates are based on 
management’s interpretation of compliance with current environmental legislation in the country of operation.
Asset retirement costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net present value, are 
provided when the obligation to incur such costs arises and are capitalised into the cost of the related asset. These costs are charged to the 
income statement through depreciation of the asset and unwinding of the discount on the provision. Depreciation is included in operating 
costs while the unwinding of the discount is included as a financing cost. Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the 
decommissioning or site rehabilitation of plant and other site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset.
ab) Employee benefit obligations
Defined benefit plans
The Group provides long-term employee benefits to employees before, on and after retirement, in accordance with labour union 
agreements in Kazakhstan and Russia. The agreements provide for one-off retirement payments, financial aid for employees’ disability, 
significant anniversaries and funeral aid. The entitlement to some benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to 
retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. Such benefits are valued consistent with an unfunded defined benefit plan 
in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. 72
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
The future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods is discounted to determine the 
present value. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the 
terms of the Group’s benefit obligations. The calculation is performed annually internally or by a qualified, independent actuary depending 
on the complexity of computations.
The expected costs of the benefits associated with one-off retirement payments are accrued over the period of employment using the same 
accounting methodology as used for defined benefit post-employment plans. This means that the difference between the fair value of the 
plan assets (if any) and the present value of the defined liabilities obligations is recognised as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are taken to the income statement. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both 
the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial 
assumptions and what has actually occurred.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including current service cost, any past service cost 
and the effect of any curtailments or settlements.
Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Obligations for 
contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Payroll expense and related contributions
Wages, salaries, and social insurance funds, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year 
in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group. On behalf of its employees, the Group pays those statutory 
pension and post-employment benefit amounts prescribed by the legal requirements of the countries in which it operates. These payments 
are expensed as incurred.
Share-based bonus awards
The Group has introduced an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan, under which the Group receives services from qualifying 
employees as consideration for equity instruments. The employee services received in exchange for the grant of the equity-settled 
payments are measured at the fair value of the equity granted and are recognised as expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, 
over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards subject to the Group’s estimate of the number of awards 
which will lapse, due to the employees leaving the Group prior to vesting. The amount recognised in the income statement as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest. The fair values of equity-settled payments are measured at the dates of grant 
using a Monte Carlo pricing model.
If the Group cancels or settles a grant of equity instruments during the vesting period, it treats this as an acceleration of vesting and 
recognises immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting 
period. Any payment made to a counterparty on the cancellation or settlement of a grant of equity instruments, even if this occurs after the 
vesting date, is accounted for as a repurchase of an equity interest (ie as a deduction from equity), except to the extent that the payment 
exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess is recognised as an 
expense.
ac) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
ad) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction from the proceeds.
ae) Financial guarantees
Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of the guarantee for a loss it 
incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees 
are initially recognised at their fair value adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. 
Financial guarantees are recognised when premiums are paid or in the case of premium-free guarantees when the borrower received the 
money from the financing entity. When the Group issues premium-free guarantees or guarantees at a premium different from the market 
premium, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques (eg market prices of similar instruments, interest rate differentials, etc). 
Losses at initial recognition of financial guarantee liabilities are recognised in the income statement within ‘net other operating expenses’. 
Financial guarantee liabilities are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee with the respective income presented 
within ‘net other operating expenses’. At each balance sheet date, the guarantees are measured at the higher of: (i) the unamortised balance 
of the amount at initial recognition; and (ii) the best estimate of expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
af) Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The 
chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for making strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Group Chief Executive Officer. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a) Taxation
Taxation represents an area of inherent risk due to complexities of tax laws, frequent changes in tax rules, interaction between different 
taxes and interaction between tax rules of different jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the position for income 
taxes across the different countries in which the Group operates.
Tax provisions are recognised by the Group in accordance with tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the taxing jurisdictions, and in 
accordance with requirements of the applicable accounting standards.
Note 15 contains information on current tax charges, prior period adjustments, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities including, 
where appropriate, provisions against uncertain tax positions.
b) Ore reserve estimates
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period. This may impact the Group’s financial results. Such changes in reserves may 
impact depreciation charges, asset carrying values, and asset retirement obligation provisions.
The Group’s ore reserves are based on its best estimate of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the relevant mining 
properties. Estimates are developed after taking into account a range of factors including quantities, ore grades, production techniques and 
recovery rates, forecast commodity prices and production costs.
The Group’s estimates are normally supported by geological studies by independent mining engineering consultants and drilling samples to 
determine the quantity and grade of each ore body. Significant judgement is required to generate an estimate based on the geological data 
available.
Ore reserve estimates are mostly calculated based on the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and 
Ore Reserves of December 2004 (the JORC code) which requires the use of reasonable assumptions, including:
future production estimates – which include proved and probable reserves, resource estimates and committed expansions; •	
expected future commodity prices, based on current market price, forward prices and the Group’s assessment of the long-term average •	
price; and
future cash costs of production, capital expenditure and rehabilitation obligations. •	
c) Life of mines
Contracts for subsurface use expire between 2013 and 2041. Management expects that the subsurface use contracts will be extended at 
nominal cost until the end of the lives of the related mines, which range between 12 and 52 years. Any change to this assumption may 
impact the Group’s financial results by affecting depreciation charges, asset carrying values and asset retirement obligations, as these have 
been recorded on the assumption that the subsurface use contracts will be extended until the end of the mine life.
If the contracts are not renewed at their current expiry dates, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment in Kazakhstan and 
Russia existing at the expiry date to be written off at the date of expiry is US$612 million as at 31 December 2009 (2008: US$757 million).
d) Provision for asset retirement obligations
Provision is made for asset retirement obligations when the related environmental disturbance takes place. Provisions are recognised at the 
net present value of future expected costs as outlined in note 28.
The provision recognised represents management’s best estimate of the costs that will be incurred but significant judgement is required as 
many of these costs will not crystallise until the end of the life of the mine. Estimates are reviewed annually and are based on management’s 
interpretation of compliance with current environmental legislation in the country of operation. Significant changes in environmental 
legislation, restoration techniques and estimates of contamination will result in changes to provisions from period to period.
The inflation rate currently applied in the calculation is 5.6%–6.2% as at 31 December 2009 (2008: 7%–8.6%) being the estimate of the rate 
of inflation over the mine lives. The discount rate currently applied in the calculation is 6.0%–8.9% at 31 December 2009 (2008: 10.6%–
11.4%) being the estimate of the risk-free pre-tax interest rate for long-term government securities. Rehabilitation expenditure is largely 
expected to take place at the end of the respective mine lives, which varies from 12 to 52 years. 74

e) Impairment
As stated in note 2 (f) below, the Group considers, at least annually, the recoverability of the values of goodwill recognised in its financial 
statements. The Group also at the reporting date considers the recoverability of all assets if there have been any indications of impairment.
The recoverability of the value of current assets is addressed through the Group’s usual procedures (refer note 1), for example the 
assessment of counterparty default risk, both customer and financial counterparties, and is not part of this impairment review.
Long-term non-financial assets require there to be a reasonable expectation of recoverability of the carrying value of those assets through 
profitability and cash flow. Accordingly, an impairment indicator exists, the Group’s approach is to consider the ability of its groups of 
cash-generating units, which have no goodwill or other intangible assets in their financial statements, to generate future economic benefits 
which exceed the value of the related tangible assets in the financial statements.
The Group’s strategic planning models, which are on a life-of-mines basis, are used to calculate an appropriate value of the future economic 
benefits for each of these cash-generating units in terms of discounted future cash flows. Cash flows have been projected for a maximum of 
37 years as of 31 December 2009.
The key assumptions which formed the basis of forecasting future cash flows in the models as of 31 December 2009 are:
commodity prices, which are based on internal forecasts by the management of the Group’s sales and marketing business. These •	
internal forecasts are consistent with the forecasts of industry market researchers;
long-term costs are set in line with current operational performance, as adjusted for future inflation rates in countries of operation and, •	
where applicable, the expected movements in key input costs;
the successful extraction, processing and sale of the reserves in accordance with the quantities described in the report on Ore Reserves •	
and Mineral Resources on pages 115 to 121;
the long-term US inflation rate will average 2.5% per annum, in line with external forecasts; and •	
in determining the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows the Group based its assumption on an external advisor report. The •	
rate used was 13.9%–16.3%, which is the advisors’ opinion on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital for the Group.
The impairment reviews as at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 concluded that no impairment provisions are required for 
long-term non-financial assets.
f) Business combinations and goodwill
The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year. Where necessary, the Group hired external valuation consultants to advise on the 
fair value and asset lives of acquired assets, otherwise these were estimated internally.
The portion of the purchase price not allocated to specific assets and liabilities as identified by management has been attributed to 
goodwill.
The Group considers, at least annually, the recoverability of the values of goodwill recognised in its financial statements.
For groups of cash-generating units that were allocated goodwill the Group’s strategic planning models were used to calculate discounted 
future cash flows (‘Value in Use’ per IAS 36) and thus assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the goodwill. These models are 
prepared on a life-of-mines basis as this period properly reflects the long-term nature of the Group’s assets. The key assumptions which 
form the basis of forecasting future cash flows are the same as listed in section 2e) above.
The impairment reviews as at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 concluded that no impairment provisions are required for goodwill.
g) Fair value of financial instruments
In determining fair value of financial instruments the Group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and verify assumptions that 
are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date, as well as obtains fair value measurements from other parties.
Effective 1 January 2009, for the financial instruments measures in the balance sheet at fair value, the group has adopted the following fair 
value measurement hierarchy:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. •	
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or •	
indirectly.
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market •	
data.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in the active market is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. These 
instruments are included in level 1. As of 31 December 2009, the Group’s available-for-sale financial instruments (note 20) are included in 
level 1 of the hierarchy. As of 31 December 2009, the Group does not hold financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
As of 31 December 2009, the group does not hold financial instruments that are included in level 2 or 3 of the hierarchy.
As of 31 December 2008, the fair values of the Group’s available-for-sale financial instruments and financial instruments at fair value through 
profit or loss were value based on quoted market prices. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued
The fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost is based on expected cash flows discounted at current interest rates for 
new instruments with similar credit risk and maturity.
The investments in unquoted options, disclosed in note 20, are carried at cost, because the fair value can not be reliably measured.
3. New accounting pronouncements
(i) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2009 and are relevant to Group’s operations
Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate – IFRS 1 and IAS 27 Amendment (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The amendment allows first-time adopters of IFRS to measure investments in subsidiaries, 
jointly controlled entities or associates at fair value or at previous GAAP carrying value as deemed cost in the separate financial statements. 
The amendment also requires distributions from pre-acquisition net assets of investees to be recognised in the income statement rather 
than as a recovery of the investment. The amendment does not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Vesting Conditions and Cancellations – Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009). The amendment clarifies that only service conditions and performance conditions are vesting conditions. Other features of 
a share-based payment are not vesting conditions. The amendment specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other 
parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. The amendment does not have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements.
Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments – Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The amendment requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity 
risk. In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair value measurement hierarchy. As the 
change in accounting policy only results in additional disclosures, there is no impact on earnings per share.
IFRS 8, Operating Segments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). IFRS 8 requires a ‘management approach’, 
under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. The segments are reported 
in a manner that is more consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. No changes in segment 
aggregation occurred.
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (revised September 2007; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). 
The revised standard prohibits the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is, ‘non-owner changes in equity’) in the statement of 
changes in equity, requiring ‘non-owner changes in equity’ to be presented separately from owner changes in equity in a statement of 
comprehensive income. As a result the Group presents in the consolidated statement of changes in equity all owner changes in equity, 
whereas all non-owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Comparative information 
has been re-presented so that it also is in conformity with the revised standard. As the change in accounting policy only impacts 
presentation aspects, there is no impact on earnings per share.
IAS 23, Borrowing Costs (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The main change to IAS 23 is the removal of 
the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready 
for use or sale. An entity is, therefore, required to capitalise such borrowing costs as part of the cost of the asset. The revised standard 
applies prospectively to borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 
January 2009. The amendment to the standard did not have impact on the Group’s financial statements, as the Group previously capitalised 
interest and other costs on borrowings used to finance the construction of property, plant and equipment during the time required to 
complete and prepare asset for its intended use (note 1).
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction. (IFRIC 14 as adopted by 
the EU is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 31 December 2008, with early adoption permitted). The interpretation contains 
guidance on when refunds or reductions in future contributions may be regarded as available for the purposes of the asset ceiling test in 
IAS 19, Employee Benefits. The amendment does not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation—IAS 32 and IAS 1 Amendment (effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The amendment requires classification as equity of some financial instruments that meet the 
definition of financial liabilities. The amendment does not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards (issued in May 2008). In 2007, the International Accounting Standards 
Board decided to initiate an annual improvements project as a method of making necessary, but non-urgent, amendments to IFRS. The 
amendments consist of a mixture of substantive changes, clarifications, and changes in terminology in various standards, such as IFRS 5, 
IAS 1, 7, 16, 19, 20, 23, 27, 28, 31, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41. Further amendments made to IAS 8, 10, 18, 20, 29, 34, 40, 41 and to IFRS 7 represent 
terminology or editorial changes only, which the IASB believes have no or minimal effect on accounting. The amendments do not have any 
material effect on Group’s financial statements. 76

4. Segment information
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Group Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) and used 
to make strategic decisions. The CEO considers the business from a products and services perspective and assesses the performance of 
the operating segments based on the measure of Underlying EBITDA (refer note 38).
The amounts provided to the CEO with respect to segment assets and segment liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of 
the financial statements. These assets and liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment and their physical location.
Segment Underlying EBITDA, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated 
on a reasonable basis. Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and receivables 
and mainly exclude investments in joint venture and associates, other financial assets, loans receivable, unallocated cash and cash 
equivalents, term deposits and deferred and current income tax assets. Segment liabilities comprise primarily trade and other payables and 
mainly exclude borrowings and deferred and current income tax liabilities. Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets. The Group is organised on the basis of six (2008: five) operating segments:
Ferroalloys – comprises the extraction and sale of chrome ore as well as the production of ferroalloys from chromium and manganese •	
ores.
Iron Ore – comprises extraction, processing and manufacturing of iron ore products. •	
Alumina and Aluminium – comprises extraction and processing of bauxite and limestone, and smelting of alumina and aluminium. •	
Energy – comprises coal mining and power generation. •	
Logistics – the Republic of Kazakhstan’s main freight forwarder and railroad operator, providing international logistics for all Eurasian •	
based ENRC operations; also rail construction and repair services for the Kazakhstani state rail company.
Other Non-ferrous – comprises the exploration and extraction, processing and manufacturing of copper and cobalt products, the •	
exploration of other minerals and logistics operations in Africa acquired as part of the acquisition of CAMEC in 2009 (refer note 6). 78

1 The carrying values at acquisition date include certain adjustments relating to the alignment of balances with ENRC accounting policies.
2 Includes minority interests of subsidiaries wholly owned by CAMEC.
The goodwill balance is the result of the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on the acquired mineral rights (within property, 
plant and equipment). This deferred tax liability is recognised within the carrying values at the acquisition date with an additional amount 
included within the provisional fair value adjustments.
Acquisition costs of US$14 million have been expensed to the 31 December 2009 income statement. The treatment of such costs will be 
determined upon the completion of the fair value review.
The Group’s share of CAMEC’s profit from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2009 was nil. If the acquisition had taken place at the 
beginning of the year, the impact to the Group’s revenue would have been an additional US$240 million, whilst the impact to profit after tax 
would have been a loss of US$100 million. This is pro forma unaudited information provided for comparative purposes only and does not 
necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the combined 
companies.
ASEK Reinsurance AG
On 30 June 2009 the Group acquired ASEK Reinsurance AG (‘ASEK’), an unlisted captive insurance company, for cash consideration of 
US$12 million from CIM Global Investments NV, a company controlled by the Founder Shareholders.
The fair value of ASEK’s net assets at the date of acquisition was US$12 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of US$13 million 
and deferred tax liabilities of US$1 million.
The Group’s share of ASEK’s loss from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2009 amounted to US$2 million. Had the acquisition taken 
place at the beginning of the year, the impact to the Group’s revenue would have been nil, whilst the impact to profit after tax would have 
been a loss of US$2 million.
This is pro forma unaudited information provided for comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that

ENRC PMZ LLP
On 8 January 2009 the Group acquired ENRC PMZ LLP (‘PMZ’) from the Founder Shareholders of the Group for a cash consideration of 
US$20 million. PMZ, an unlisted company based in the Republic of Kazakhstan, owns 100% interest in Pavlodar Machinery Plant JSC which 
is a producer of overhead factory cranes. 84

Goodwill on acquisition of US$3 million is attributable to cost saving synergies as overhead factory cranes are used extensively in the 
operating activities of the Group.
The Group’s share of PMZ’s profit from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2009 was nil. If the acquisition had taken place at the 
beginning of the year, the impact to the Group’s revenue would have been US$4 million, whilst the impact to profit after tax would have  
been nil.
This is pro forma unaudited information provided for comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that

Serov minority interests buy out
On 3 April 2008 the Group acquired a controlling interest in the Serov group and certain related entities (‘Serov’) from companies controlled 
by the Founder Shareholders. The total consideration was US$212 million (of which US$100 million was incurred in 2007). Serov’s principal 
activity comprises the mining of chrome ore, processing and sale of ferroalloys.
In January, March and April 2009 the Group completed a buy out of minority interests in the Serov Ferroalloy Plant and Saranovskaya Mine 
‘Rudnaya’ for a cash consideration of US$5 million and US$5 million respectively.
As at 31 December 2009, the Group holds the following ownership interests in Serov:

Fair value estimates
The provisional values of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised on acquisition are their estimated fair values at the date of 
acquisition. Accounting standards permit up to 12 months for provisional acquisition accounting to be finalised following the acquisition 
date if any subsequent information provides better evidence of the item’s fair value at the date of acquisition.
For all business combinations, the Group either undertook or is in the process of undertaking a detailed review to determine the fair value of 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition. Such reviews may include engaging third party advisors to 
determine the fair values of the cash-generating units of the entities acquired.

Factors affecting future tax charges
Future tax charges are affected by changes to the applicable laws and regulations, as well as profit mix from the jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates. Given that the Group is subject to Excess Profits Tax in the Republic of Kazakhstan, future tax charges are also affected by 
product prices and profitability levels achieved on subsurface use contracts in the Republic of Kazakhstan. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
15. Income taxes continued
The Republic of Kazakhstan has announced a phased reduction in the applicable rate of CIT from 30% in 2008 to 20% for 2009–2012, 
17.5% for 2013 and 15% thereafter. Changes to the applicable CIT rates enacted in November 2009 resulted in remeasurement of the 
deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2009 and a debit to the income tax charge of US$16 million. Changes enacted in 
December 2008 resulted in a credit to the income tax charge for 2008 of US$177 million.
MET is being phased in to broadly offset the reduction in the applicable CIT rate for subsurface users. However, MET, not being a tax on 
profits, forms part of ‘cost of sales’ and is not reported as part of the income tax expense.
Tax charge reconciliation
Reconciliation between the actual tax charge for the period and the expected tax charge on the profit before tax for the period at the tax

a) Acquisitions of joint venture and associates
Shubarkol Komir Joint Stock Company (‘Shubarkol’)
On 16 February 2009 the Group acquired a 25% interest in Shubarkol, a major semi-coke and thermal coal producer incorporated in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, for a cash consideration of US$200 million less 25% of net debt.
Shubarkol is majority owned by EFIC, a private company controlled by the Founder Shareholders of the Group.
In connection with the acquisition, the Group has entered into an off-take agreement with Shubarkol, secured a seat on Shubarkol’s  
board and entered into a shareholders agreement with EFIC. In addition the Group has a right of first refusal, combined with a call option, 
over all or part of the remaining shares in Shubarkol held by EFIC. The call option is exercisable (at the Group’s discretion) at any time until 
31 January 2011 which, if exercised will be subject to required regulatory approvals having been obtained and is expected to be subject to 
the approval of the Group’s shareholders. The price payable on any exercise of the call option is the aggregate value of the shares to be 
transferred, assuming Shubarkol has a total value of US$800 million on a fully diluted basis, less any net debt at the time of the transfer.
Because the call option is subject to the approvals noted above, it is not readily exercisable or convertible and hence the possession of the 
call option does not contribute to control over Shubarkol, the Group accounted for its investment in Shubarkol using equity accounting in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. 90

(a) Structured Trade Finance Facility
On 15 December 2006, ENRC Marketing AG entered into a US$1,000 million Structured Trade Finance Facility (the ‘Facility’). By a 
Supplemental Agreement dated 12 April 2007, the Facility was increased to US$1,480 million.
The Facility is secured principally by grants of security over certain sales contracts entered into by ENRC Marketing AG and third party 
buyers (and all receivables thereunder). The associated accounts receivable balance at 31 December 2009 was US$214 million (2008: 
US$178 million). All monies payable by the end purchasers under the sales contracts are required to be paid into bank accounts which are 
also used to secure the Facility. Withdrawals from these bank accounts are subject to restrictions imposed under the terms of the Facility 
Agreement. The Group agreed to certain restrictive covenants in respect of Kazchrome, as guarantor of the loan, which prohibit Kazchrome 
from lending more than US$100 million and having total debt of greater than US$1,500 million outstanding at any time during the duration of 
the Facility. In addition, the guarantee provides for other restrictions on Kazchrome including on payment of dividends, giving guarantees or 
indemnities, creating security interests or changing its business.
During 2009, the Group made accelerated repayments of the Facility for a total of US$353 million. As at 31 December 2009, US$342 million 
of the Facility was drawn down (2008: US$686 million). Repayment of the balance occurs in equal and consecutive monthly instalments, 
with final payment scheduled for December 2010.
The interest rate applicable to the loan is one-month LIBOR plus 1.35% per annum.
(b) ECA Facility
On 30 November 2007, Eurasian Energy Corporation entered into an unsecured €32.5 million Export Credit Facility (‘ECA Facility’). The ECA 
Facility has an applicable interest rate of EURIBOR plus 0.5% per annum and matures on 20 February 2020.
The purpose of the Facility is to finance an export contract with Takraf GmbH. As at 31 December 2009 US$44 million of the Facility was 
drawn down (2008: US$8 million).
28. Asset retirement obligations
The Group has a legal obligation to complete landfill site restoration during the mining operations and to decommission its mining property 
after its expected closure. The timing of decommissioning activity is subject to reassessment at the same time as the revision of the 
Group’s proved and probable reserves.

In accordance with the contracts on subsurface use, the Group makes annual obligatory contributions to form a deposit fund for the  
closure costs which will take effect upon exhaustion of the mineral deposits at the end of respective mine lives, which varies between  
12 to 52 years.
The amount of the provision for asset retirement obligations is determined using the nominal prices effective at the reporting dates by 
applying the forecasted rate of inflation for the expected period of the life of the mines. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include 
potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and the level of discount and inflation rates.
Principal assumptions made in calculations of asset retirement obligations are presented below:
2009 2008
Kazakhstani 
entities
Russian

entities
Discount rate 6.0% 8.9% 11.4% 10.6%
Inflation rate 5.6%–6.0% 6.2%–11.7% 8.6% 7.0%
The increase in the asset retirement obligations for the year ended 31 December 2009 was mainly due to the reduction in the discount rate 
for both Kazakhstani and Russian entities.

30. Derivative financial instruments
Forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into in order to mitigate foreign exchange currency risk arising from highly probable 
forecast transactions. The foreign exchange contracts were designated as cash flow hedge instruments and their fair value recognised in 
the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
All forward foreign exchange contracts expired during the year ended 31 December 2009, reducing the financial instruments liability as at 
December 2009 to nil (2008: US$54 million). Fair value losses recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve were taken to ‘Cost of sales’ in the 
income statement during year ended 31 December 2009.

extraction. Rental tax is included in ‘Distribution expenses’.
Other taxes payable include property, environmental and other taxes.
33. Share-based payments
The Group has established a LTIP with a view to attracting, retaining and motivating the Executive Directors and selected senior 
management.
The LTIP share awards are equity-settled share-based payment transactions which vest on the third anniversary of the grant date subject to 
achievement of performance targets. The LTIP performance target is based on the Group’s total shareholder return, ranked against a 
comparator group of other international mining companies over a three year period. Further information on the LTIP is disclosed in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 55.
In circumstances where an employee ceases to be employed prior to the vesting date for reasons except dismissal, the Board has the 
discretion to allow the employee’s award to vest to the extent they deem the performance target would have been satisfied if pro rated to 
the date of cessation of employment.
Details of grants and assumptions in the calculation of fair value under the LTIP are set out in the table below:
Grant 1 Grant 2
Grant date 7 May 2008 20 April 2009

1 The Group’s estimated share price volatility is based on the historical average annualised volatility of the comparator group of mining companies and reflects the 
assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the awards is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The increase in volatility for Grant 2 was due to the changes in market conditions over an historical period similar to the life of the awards.
2 The estimated dividend yield for Grant 2 was based on the Group’s historical dividend payments. For Grant 1, the expected dividend yield was deemed to be the 
average of the comparator group of mining companies as ENRC had not paid any dividends prior to grant date of Grant 1.
3 The risk-free interest rate is a government bond rate of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed, over a period similar to the life of the awards. 
The decrease in the risk free rate in 2009 was due to market fluctuations.
The estimated fair value of each share granted under the LTIP is calculated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation model. 100

34. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group may use derivative financial instruments to partially hedge foreign exchange exposure.
Financial risk management is the responsibility of the treasury function which identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close 
cooperation with the Group’s operating units. The Treasury Policy outlines principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies 
covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-
derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
Credit risk
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. The Group has credit insurance for the majority of its sales. Credit limits 
are set by the Group in accordance with limits provided by the Credit Insurance Company.
Credit insurance is no longer available in respect of the Group’s Russian customers. The development of the Group’s relationship with its 
two largest Russian customers, MMK and UC Rusal, is described in the Operating Review. The Group undertakes rigorous credit control 
procedures which are closely monitored by the Head of Sales and the Chief Financial Officer. These procedures are regularly reviewed in 
light of the limited availability of credit insurance. As a general rule, for those sales to non-major customers where credit insurance is not 
available, the Group operates a policy of ‘cash on delivery’ and ‘letters of credit’.
The Group has established relationships with a number of international and domestic banks in the areas in which the Group operates to 
diversify credit risk. Individual credit limits are assigned to each counterparty according to an analysis of financial strength or published 
credit rating. Limits and exposures to each counterparty are regularly monitored and reported at each Board meeting. During the year a 
mixture of bank deposits, liquidity funds, asset management funds and sovereign debt were used within the Group’s investment portfolio to 
manage credit exposure.
Individual counterparty exposure limits are based on entity credit ratings published by at least one of the major credit rating agencies where 
available. Our policy is to invest cash and cash equivalents with highly rated banks and with AAA rated liquidity funds. The Group’s Treasury 
policy prescribes the maximum limits that are available for investment purposes with any individual counterparty.
For operational and investment purposes in Kazakhstan, there are a limited number of counterparties with an independent credit rating. The 
process of evaluating Kazakhstani counterparty credit limits is based on the results of synthetic ratio calculations derived from relevant 
financial data for each counterparty. The resultant counterparty credit limits are reviewed frequently and amended as appropriate to meet 
the changing business environment in which the Group operates.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk related to the uncollateralised balances to be as follows:

In 2009 the top 10 customers as a proportion of the outstanding balance of the Group’s trade receivables accounted for 65 % (2008: 51%).
Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due 
by up to 60 days. The top 10 customers have a good payment record with the Group.
Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s production costs are denominated in Kazakhstani tenge and Russian roubles while sales are denominated in US 
dollars. The Group is therefore exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates will affect both its operating profit and cash flows.
The Group’s foreign currency exposure arises from:
highly probable forecast transactions (sales/purchases) denominated in foreign currencies; and •	
monetary items (mainly intercompany receivables, payables and borrowings) denominated in foreign currencies. •	
Foreign currency risks were partially mitigated through forward foreign exchange contracts which were deemed to be effective hedges on 
highly probable forecast transactions that achieved an average exchange rate. All forward exchange contracts expired at 31 December 2009.

The above tables exclude the impact of forward foreign exchange contracts which have been hedged.
Devaluation of Kazakhstani tenge
The devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge in early February 2009 gave risk to significant one-off foreign exchange movements on the 
revaluation of US dollar denominated balances in the Kazakhstani operations, primarily inter-company receivables and loans, and term 
deposits. Consequently, the Group recognised net foreign exchange gains of US$210 million and US$104 million included in ‘net other 
operating income’ (note 11) and ‘finance income’ (note 13), respectively, and a foreign exchange loss of US$75 million included in ‘finance 
costs’ (note 14).
Separately, in the Group’s balance sheet the devaluation impact on net assets was reflected in a significant one-off reduction of about 
US$1.3 billion in the currency translation reserve within equity.
Commodity price risk
The Group generates most of its revenue from the sale of commodities, primarily ferrochrome, chrome ore, iron ore, alumina and aluminium. 
Historically, the prices of these products have been volatile and have fluctuated widely in response to changes in supply and demand, 
market uncertainty, the performance of the global or regional economies and cyclicality in industries that are end users of these products.
Prices may also be affected by government actions, including the imposition of tariffs and import duties, speculative trades, the 
development of product substitutes or replacements, recycling practices, an increase in capacity or an oversupply of the Group’s products 
in its main markets. These external factors and the volatility of the commodity markets make it difficult to estimate future prices.
A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices would materially and adversely affect the Group’s business and the financial results 
and cash flows of operations. The Group does not hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of its products.
The table below sets out the sensitivity of the Group’s Underlying EBITDA to changes in commodity prices:
The 5% reduction in sales price, relative to the average for the year, would reduce Underlying EBITDA by:

Chrome ore 6 18
Iron ore 53 72
Alumina 16 26
Aluminium 10 13
Interest rate risk
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates. These assets and liabilities are 
exposed to cash flow interest rate risk or fair value interest rate risk depending on whether they are subject to variable or fixed rates of 
interest.
The objective of interest rate risk management is to manage and control interest rate risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while 
optimising the return. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable interest rate borrowings.
The Group’s significant interest bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 20, 21, 24, 25, and 27.

34. Financial risk management continued
An increase/(decrease) of 1% in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) profit before tax for the year ended 
31 December 2009 by US$7 million (2008: US$17 million). The impact on equity is the same as the impact on income. This analysis assumes 
that all other variables, in particular foreign exchange rates, remain constant.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group intends to maintain a capital structure in line with industry’s norms and practices which will be achieved over a period of time, 
taking into account investment opportunities and availability of debt finance.
The Group considers the following balances as a part of its capital management:
As at 31 December

Reserves
1
4,456 4,915
Total capital 8,141 8,899
1 Reserves include retained earnings, translation reserve, hedge reserve, and revaluation reserve of financial assets available-for-sale.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to manage its debt level.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable 
losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The table below summarises the Group’s non-derivative financial assets and liabilities which will be settled on a gross basis and derivative 
financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet 
date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the tables are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, translated at year

37. Contingencies
At the end of 2009, the Kazakhstani tax authorities issued a transfer pricing assessment of US$126 million on SSGPO in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2004. The Group’s management are confident that the Company was fully compliant with the transfer pricing 
legislation prevailing at the time, have appealed against the assessment, and will be defending the adopted filing position. No provision

Purchase of the minority shareholding in CAMEC
In 2010, the Group completed a partial buyout of minority interests in CAMEC for a cash consideration of US$9 million. As a result, the 
Group’s interest in CAMEC as at 18 March 2010 increased to 96.88% of CAMEC’s issued share capital.
Acquisition of Chambishi Metals and Comit Resources
On 18 February 2010, the Group announced that it had entered into a conditional agreement with International Mineral Resources BV, a 
company owned by the Founder Shareholders (denoted in note 5) to acquire Enya Holdings BV (‘Enya’) for a consideration of US$300 million 
less net debt. Enya holds a 90% interest in Chambishi Metals PLC (‘Chambishi’), a Zambian copper and cobalt producer, together with a 
100% interest in Comit Resources FZE, a Dubai based marketing and sales company that historically has handled Chambishi’s copper and 
cobalt sales. 
On 6 April 2010, the acquisition of Enya was effectively completed and control obtained by the Group. The consideration paid was wholly 
funded from the Group’s cash resources.
Export credit facility agreement
On 16 February 2010, the Group entered into an export credit facility agreement for the amount of €47.6 million. The facility is a 10 year 
draw-down facility and bears an interest rate of six-month EURIBOR plus 1.5%. Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs AG has provided credit 
insurance to support the facility. The facility will be used to finance some of the Group’s capital expenditure.
2009 final dividend
For 2009 the Board has recommended a final dividend of US 6 cents per share amounting to US$77 million, which will be paid on 
Wednesday 16 June 2010, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 6 April 2010. 11 0

Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.

year for which the parent company financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent •	
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements and the part of the •	
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law •	
are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we •	
require for our audit.

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Financial Statements
1. Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards and generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom  
(‘UK GAAP’). 
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is US dollars. At 31 December 2009, the exchange rate was £1 = US$1.6139 
(2008: £1 = US$1.450) and the average rate for the year was £1 = US$1.5664 (2008: £1 = US$1.855).
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment. Investments are tested for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An 
impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the higher of net realisable value and the discounted future 
earnings from the investment.
Financial assets and liabilities
Interest and non-interest bearing amounts owed by Group companies are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently re-measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Finance income and expense are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective 
interest method. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in currencies other than US dollars, including the issue of shares, are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which 
they arise.
Taxation including deferred tax
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that 
deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is recognised on 
an undiscounted basis.
Share-based payments
The Company has adopted a LTIP designed to reward senior management employees of the Group for achieving the Group’s strategic 
objectives and provide an appropriate level of long-term performance related pay. Each year, participants will receive conditional awards of 
shares in the Company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded. This is subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions, measured over a three-year performance period and continued service. 
The share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Company’s financial statements and is measured at fair value of 
the equity instruments at the date of grant. The fair value was calculated by applying a Monte Carlo model.
In accordance with UITF 44 and FRS 20, where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and 
such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is 
required to record an expense for such compensation with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent. 
Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent, the Company is required to record an addition to the Company’s investment in 
subsidiaries, with a corresponding increase recognised in other reserves.
Further details on the share-based payments can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report section of this Annual Report on pages 51 
to 55 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Dividends
Dividends payable are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before 
or on the balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after 
the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd. (‘SRK’) has reviewed the GKZ ‘reserve’ statements of the mining assets of Eurasian Natural Resources 
Corporation plc (‘ENRC’) as prepared in accordance with the local regulatory requirements of Kazakhstan, as of 31 December 2009. SRK 
has restated these as Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the terms and definitions given in the 2004 Australasian 
Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the ‘JORC Code’) as published by the Joint Ore Reserves 
Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. SRK has modified and translated ENRC’s GKZ ‘reserve’ statements for 
reporting in accordance with the JORC Code without recourse to fundamental recalculation.
In 2007, SRK prepared an independent mineral experts’ report (‘MER’) on the mining, processing, smelting and power generating assets of 
ENRC. An abridged version of this MER was included in the prospectus published by the Company in connection with the admission of the 
ordinary shares of the Company to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc’s market for listed securities in December 2007 (the ‘IPO’). 
The MER contained Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements in accordance with the JORC Code, dated 1 July 2007.
In 2008, SRK carried out a desktop review of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, and provided an updated statement in line with the 
JORC Code, based on a review of the depletion of the reserves from the annual submissions to the Kazakhstan Government, the actual 
production figures from the mines and any information on significant changes to the operations provided to SRK by ENRC. No site visits 
were undertaken.
In 2009 and 2010, the auditing of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves has been carried out in significantly more detail than the 2008 
review, with site visits being undertaken on a two to three year basis. Visits to Kazchrome’s Donskoy GOK ferrochrome operations and 
Zhairemsky GOK’s iron/manganese operations were undertaken in February 2009. Visits to Eurasian Energy Corporation’s (‘EEC’) 
Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine and the SSGPO iron ore mines were undertaken in February 2010. The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve 
Statements as of 31 December 2008, as prepared by SRK during the 2009 review, form the basis for the current update. 
SRK has reviewed the Ore Reserve Statements in conjunction with the current consensus market forecast commodity prices where 
appropriate. These prices are derived from the median of annual price assumptions as reported by various analysts during Q1 2010. ENRC’s 
forecasts used to support the current Ore Reserve declarations are:
Chromite at US$257/tonne and HCFeCr at US¢102.5/lb. •	
Manganese concentrate products between US$62/tonne and US$182/tonne and iron-manganese concentrate products at US$33/tonne. •	
Iron concentrate prices have been based on SRK’s CMF price of US$0.85/dmtu (‘dry metric tonne units’).
Iron ore at US$1.12/dmtu for pellets, US$0.85/dmtu for concentrates, and US$355/tonne for HBI briquettes. •	
Alumina at US$338/tonne. •	
SRK has relied on ENRC and its technical representatives to ensure all technical information provided to SRK is accurate. A detailed •	
information request list was submitted by SRK and ENRC provided data during January and February 2010.
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements for 31 December 2009 are based on the following assumptions, assessments, 
recommendations and material changes:
Ferroalloys Division
Kazchrome
Donskoy GOK 
In 2009 the group produced 4.3 Mt of ore. Molodezhnaya underground mine produced 2.5 Mt and has a mine life of 16 years, producing 
between 2.2 and 2.5 Mtpa for the next 10 years. 10th Anniversary underground mine produced 1.6 Mt and has a mine life of 39 years, with 
an average 2.5 Mtpa from Phase 1. The deeper Phase 2 commences production in 2021, where production builds up to around 5.5 Mtpa in 
2036. Yuzhniy open pit mined 0.2 Mt and is due to produce 2.9 Mtpa ore between 2013 and 2018. However, approximately 80 Mt of waste 
are planned to be stripped within the next five to eight years, which represents an unusually high stripping ratio of 28:1 (t waste:t ore). A 
significant portion of the Ore Reserve is dependent on successful application of new mining methods for both near surface and deposits at 
depth. Whilst studies have been carried out for these, the methods have not been trialled and will be at a higher cost than the current 
method. The investment required to sustain the current operations and to provide for planned expansions and improvements at the 10th 
Anniversary mine and the Aktobe smelter, have been adequately allowed for. The Mineral Resource has marginally decreased in line with 
depletion from the 2009 production. The Ore Reserves for Yuzhniy and Molodezhnaya have not materially changed. However, the Ore 
Reserves for the 10th Anniversary mine have increased due to an increase in the mine life from 2041 to 2048. 
Kazmarganets 
The Ore Reserve for Tur is based on a Life of Mine Plan ending in 2020. The current mining Contract for Tur expires on 7 October 2021. The 
Vostochny Kamys Ore Reserve is based on a Life of Mine Plan ending in 2012. The current mining Contract for Vostochny Kamys expires on 
28 June 2018. No operational changes are planned for. Kazmarganets product is consumed by the Aksu smelter. Hence, the Ore Reserve 
has been reported on an integrated Kazchrome company basis, adopting the same approach as for Donskoy.
Overall comment on Kazchrome
The production levels planned for the mines, process plants and smelters, and the respective operating costs, are considered to be realistic. 
The 10th Anniversary mine and the Aktobe smelter have substantial expansion plans and these appear to have been adequately investigated, 
planned and costed. The Ore Reserves for Donskoy and Kazmarganets are supported by the overall profitability of Kazchrome. Whilst minor 
recommendations have been made to ENRC, SRK finds all other requirements to be in place, including the mining Contracts.
Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2009
Reserves 11 6
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Reserves
Zhairemsky GOK 
The 2009 period has resulted in a marginal decrease of Mineral Resources (1.7 Mt) and Ore Reserves (1.2 Mt) from mining activities and 
stockpile depletion. SRK recognises that the long-term demand and commodity price forecasts of the various products should allow 
production to increase in the near future.
The current mining Contract for Ushkatyn III expires in June 2015 and for Zhomart in June 2013. The Reserves for the Zhairem deposit are 
based on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2024. SRK has declared the Reserves on the understanding that Zhairemsky GOK can extend 
these licences under similar terms for periods that match their Life of Mine plans.
Iron Ore Division – SSGPO
In 2009 SSGPO produced 36.6 Mt of iron ore at 32.5% iron, from four open pits and one underground mine. The current mining Contract 
expires in May 2015. SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the assumption that SSGPO will apply for, and be granted, at least one 25-year 
extension of this Contract until 2040 under similar terms and conditions. The Ore Reserves are based on an overall ‘Life of Mine’ plan for 
SSGPO until 2040. The Mineral Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2040.
Aluminium Division – AoK
In 2009 the two divisions of AoK produced 5.1 Mt of bauxite, 4.8 Mt from 13 operating open pits in four areas of KBRU and 0.36 Mt from 
four operating open pits of TBRU. All mining Contracts expire on 21 January 2017, with the exception of the mining licence for Vostochno-
Ayatskoye, which expires on 26 July 2031. SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding that AoK can extend these licences 
under similar terms for periods that match their Life of Mine plans. The Ore Reserves are based on an overall Life of Mine Plan for AoK to the 
end of 2046. SRK notes that the economic viability of TBRU is dependent on the production from KBRU. 
Energy Division – EEC
Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine produced 20 Mt coal in 2009. The current mining Contract expires on 18 March 2022. The Coal Reserves are 
based on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2045 and on the understanding that EEC can extend the Contract under similar terms for a period 
that matches the Life of Mine plan. The Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2045.

probable ore reserves The economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured 
mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur 
when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and 
include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, 
economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. These 
assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified. 
A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a proved ore reserve but is of 
sufficient quality to serve as the basis for a decision on the development of the deposit.
product cost per tonne The total operating costs, as presented in the income statement, over the volume of product 
sold. The product cost per tonne measures the performance of ENRC in maintaining its low 
cost base.
proved ore reserves The economically mineable part of a Measured mineral resource. It includes diluting materials 
and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate 
assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification 
by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal environmental, social 
and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that 
extraction could reasonably be justified. A proved ore reserve represents the highest 
confidence category of reserve estimate. The style of mineralisation or other factors could

As noted in the Directors’ Report on page 41, and in the AGM Notice,

do so, may lodge their form at anytime. However, in order for the 
submission to be effective for a dividend payment, the form must be 
lodged with the Registrars by the close of business on the day 
immediately preceding the date of the dividend announcement. For 
the final dividend 2009, this date was 23 March 2010.

remain in force until such time as the instruction is amended.

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
Notes This report includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, ‘forward-looking statements’. These 
forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms 
‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘plans’, ‘projects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘may’, ‘will’, or ‘should’ or, in each case, 
their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans, objectives, 
goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include matters that are not historical facts 
or are statements regarding the Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other 
things, the Group’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, and the 
industries in which the Group operates.
Forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and therefore too much 
reliance should not be placed upon them. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which 
are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Group’s control. By their nature, forward-looking statements 
involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. The Group cautions you that 
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that if risks and uncertainties 
materialise, or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, the Group’s actual results of 
operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group operates may 
materially differ from those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
In addition, even if the Group’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the 
industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this report, 
those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in future periods. A number of 
factors could cause results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking statements including, without limitation, general economic and business conditions, industry 
trends, competition, commodity prices, changes in regulation, currency fluctuations, changes in business 
strategy, political and economic uncertainty. 
Subject to the requirements of the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing 
Rules or any applicable law or regulation, the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking publicly to 
review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any updates or revisions to any 
forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any changes in the Group’s expectations with regard 
thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

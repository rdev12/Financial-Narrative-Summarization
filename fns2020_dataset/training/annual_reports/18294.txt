Chairman’s Statement
On track to achieve our 
strategic objectives
With demonstrable progress and significant activity 
achieved during the period, I am pleased to report that 
your Company is on track to achieve its strategic 
objectives: creating value and growth through real estate 
development and asset transformation in sectors and 
locations in the UK where demand is in evidence. The 
impact of this progress in financial terms is yet to be 
captured in our results and we report a loss before tax 
of £10.2 million for the 14 months ended 29th February 
2012, as compared to a profit before tax of £2.6 million 
for the year ended 31st December 2010. Shareholders’ 
funds declined accordingly to £313.2 million from £333.1 
million at the end of 2010. Net assets per share ended 
the period at 256 pence per share, compared to 272 
pence per share at 31st December 2010.
 Given our balance sheet strength and the emerging 
and likely success of our business plan, the Board has 
recommended the payment of a final dividend for the 
period of 3.2 pence per share payable on 26th October 
2012 to shareholders on the register on 28th September 
2012. This brings the total dividend payment for the 
14-month period to 5.6 pence, equivalent to that paid 
for the previous twelve months.
 The main contributory factors to the loss before tax 
were a charge of £4.7 million arising from a small 
downturn in the valuation of our £237.9 million investment 
portfolio and an impairment provision of £2.8 million 
in respect of our small serviced office division. Asset 
realisations from our development and trading portfolio 
have begun to benefit our earnings statement and setting 
aside revaluation movements and the impairment 
provision, we broke even in the eight months to 29th 
February 2012; we anticipate a stronger impact as more 
assets are realised from our active value creation strategy. 
The net asset decline of £19.9 million over the 14 months 
reflects the loss before tax of £10.2 million, together with 
the dividend of £5.9 million paid to shareholders and a 
provision of £4.3 million arising from the mark-to-market 
impact of a long-term fixed rate loan, the impact of which 
will unwind over the term of this financing. 
Developing value
As you will be aware, in July 2010, we completed the 
second of two step changes in the size of your Company 
when we raised equity of £100 million, the same 
amount as raised twelve months previously. We set out 
to invest the proceeds of this fresh equity in real estate 
opportunities through which we could apply our 
development expertise to realise gains through 
repositioning and redeveloping secondary assets into 
the prime or near-prime market. The majority of these 
funds has now been invested into the property market 
in more than 40 separate transactions. It is from these 
transactions and others that we intend will follow in the 
near-term, that significant value will be added for our 
shareholders. The business case for our two approaches 
to shareholders for further funds was based on our 
assessment that the banking sector would not be able 
to provide the liquidity essential for a fully functioning 
property market for some time and that equity would 
therefore command a powerful position in deal 
negotiations. We anticipated that this restriction on 
the markets would continue for some time, thus allowing 
us to execute our individual asset business plans and 
recycle some of the proceeds back into a still illiquid 
marketplace for a further round of profitable 
opportunities. Our assessment was that the average 
asset business plan would take just over three years 
to execute and generate realised gains and that is a 
view to which we adhere today. 
 Accordingly, at 29th February 2012, with 32 months 
passed since our first equity raise in July 2009, we are 
now beginning to realise gains on these newly acquired 
assets. It is pleasing to note that not only have some 
gains been realised ahead of time but also that the 
quantum of the gains realised on assets where exits have 
been secured, has been in line or ahead of their individual 
business plans.
 This progress is reported against a backdrop of 
ongoing and much reported difficulties in the European 
banking sector which have exacerbated the continuing 
economic uncertainties in both the UK and in Continental 
Europe. In addition, the eurozone fiscal crisis has not only 
reduced the demand for UK exports to that region, but 
has also restricted the banks’ access to funds for lending 
to businesses and perhaps above all, undermined 
business confidence. Whilst the UK Government appears 
to have a credible strategy for its own necessary fiscal 
consolidation, a return to sustained growth will also need a 
resolution to the eurozone crisis as an important precursor. 
Meanwhile, it seems that the best the UK economy can

asset transformation in the UK,

hope for in the near-term is a more or less sideways 
movement in GDP performance – effectively, stagnation.
 In the investment property markets, 201 1 was 
characterised by an increasing flow of overseas funds 
into Central London’s prime office and residential 
markets. The financial and political turmoil in various 
parts of the world caused a significant flow of funds into 
the Sterling-denominated Central London property 
markets, to some extent seeking a safe haven from the 
perceived risks elsewhere and only tentatively based on 
property fundamentals. The secondary property market 
continued to languish and, indeed, in the final few months 
of the period under review, values declined slightly. 
This was largely a result of prospects for rental 
growth continuing to recede and the flight to quality 
strengthening amidst increasing uncertainty in the 
eurozone and continuing concerns over the weakness of 
the UK economy. For the first time in over a decade our 
performance was less than that of the IPD UK Monthly 
Property Index. The largest contribution to our 4.2 per 
cent underperformance was the insolvency at Peacocks 
in February 2012. We believe that the prime markets of 
Central London will ease back and the secondary 
markets will recover lost ground in the near- to 
medium-term.
 It is our view that the UK needs a vigorous 
regeneration of its redundant and derelict real estate 
assets into prime or near-prime investments servicing 
those areas of the economy which still retain an element 
of demand strength; effectively, changing functional 
obsolescence into functional strength. Accordingly, at 
this stage in the economic cycle, we do not see a strong 
demand for large-scale office development in our 
country’s major conurbations, including Central London. 
That demand must largely await a recovery in GDP growth 
both domestic and international. It is our continued belief 
that, in an economy with virtually no upward and possibly 
some downward momentum, the opportunity to create 
growth in our industry will rely on the value-added 
component that can be generated through repositioning 
real estate into areas of demand. We will continue to 
pursue this strategy as and until the wide arbitrage 
between secondary and prime yields begins to narrow 
significantly. The alternative approach of expanding our 
investment portfolio does not hold attractions for us at 
this stage of the economic cycle. Whilst that strategy 
might offer a more stable income base for us, it offers 
little in the way of significant capital growth. Our skills as 
a developer have naturally led us into our current area 
of activity that relies on a detailed and technical 
understanding of real estate fundamentals in which we 
are accomplished and confident. We believe that the 
successes now emerging from within our development 
and trading portfolio are evidence of our strategy coming 
to fruition. Of course, our Group policy of maintaining a 
moderate level of gearing offsets, to a large extent, the 
risks associated with our development and trading 
property assets that are either nil or low income yielding.
Outlook
The yield curve is indicating that interest rates will remain 
at current minimal levels for some considerable amount 
of time and we would not disagree. Current fiscal policy, 
together with further rounds of quantitative easing, are 
helping to support asset values and we believe will 
continue to do so. Of course, at some time, one would 
anticipate interest rates returning to long-term trend but 
that will probably need to await a perceived recovery in 
the UK’s economic performance. When that re-rating of 
the cost of money does occur, it may impact negatively on 
property values since the perceived offset of increased 
rental growth will take several years to work through 
the cash flows attaching to individual assets. We expect 
the banking groups to continue to gradually reduce 
their exposure to real estate in a way that does not 
significantly impact on property values. In that regard, 
they will be consistent with their policy of recent years 
of not unduly disturbing current market equilibrium.
Conclusion
After nearly nine years of sterling service on behalf 
of your Company, both Victoria Mitchell and Michael 
Soames will be stepping down from the Board at this 
year’s Annual General Meeting. On your behalf, I would 
like sincerely to thank both of these Non-executive 
Directors for their valuable contribution to our 
deliberations and for their resolute efforts and 
commitment in support of the progress we have made.  
I would also like to welcome our new Non-executive 
Board member, Nick Thomlinson, senior partner and 
Chairman of the Knight Frank Group, who joined the 
Board on 3rd January 2012 and brings with him 
significant expertise and experience derived from 
a lengthy career in the property industry. 
 The period under review has seen an enormous 
effort from the management and staff at Development 
Securities PLC in deploying equity and debt into the 
market across a multitude of sometimes very complicated 
transactions, and implementing our strategy for each 
either in joint venture or on our own account. I would like 
to place on record my thanks for their commitment, 
professionalism and teamwork in a challenging market 
where credibility, track record and brand strength have 
played such an important role.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Creating value in spite 
of a weak economy
Looking at the IPD All Property Returns for 201 1, one 
might be forgiven for thinking that nothing much has 
happened in the property sector. Capital returns were 
low over the period, as was rental growth. Given that UK 
GDP growth across the same period was also negligible, 
it should not surprise us that the key property return 
indicators reflected a period of economic stagnation. The 
UK economy is seemingly bound hand and foot by global 
events, from the pressures within the eurozone, to the 
banking crisis across most of Europe, geopolitical tensions 
and rising commodity prices. To the extent that it has been 
able, the UK Government has responded with several 
rounds of quantitative easing, continuing the policy of 
maintaining minimal interest rates at a level to sustain 
both economic activity and asset values and of course 
reducing government expenditure to lower debt levels.
 Within this environment, the challenge for our 
industry remains how value can be created. The course 
we set ourselves in 2009, before our first equity raise of 
£100 million in July of that year, was to create capital 
value by the selective acquisition of secondary assets 
which had the potential to be repositioned or redeveloped 
into prime or near-prime assets rather than purely collect 
income return. The equity raised has allowed us to 
engage in such an investment strategy within a market 
where the value of equity has been amplified by 
significant constraints on the banks’ ability to generate 
liquidity. For the most part, we have acquired these 
assets from third parties who, for one reason or another, 
are under financial pressure and/or lack the expertise 
to resolve progress on a particular asset or portfolio of 
assets. The severe economic downturn in our sector 
followed the pattern of previous cycles when the upswing 
in property values after the crash was led by prime real 
estate, with secondary real estate also improving in value 
but nowhere near to the same extent. Accordingly, the 
yield differential between secondary and prime property 
has widened considerably. This yield differential provides 
us with a generous margin within which to trade and 
effectively exploit the arbitrage opportunity that the 
market presents by transforming assets from secondary 
to prime. This is precisely where we have placed the 
majority of our new equity funds. 
 Our initial view was that it would take an average 
period of some three to four years to deliver a profitable 
exit from each of the new investments we had made and 
were likely to make. It was clear, therefore, that patience 
would be required before we would be able to deliver the 
full returns we were seeking. Nevertheless, for the period 
under review, some of the projects have already been 
brought to fruition. More will be delivered in the near-term 
with progress made across several projects to 
significantly advance their individual business plans. 
In recent months we have achieved planning success in 
six projects and in some instances, have also been able 
to secure the exit.
 We have now invested in over 40 projects in a period 
of just over two years, an unprecedented deal flow for the 
business. This has enabled us to diversify specific asset 
risk, thus reducing our exposure to any one particular project.
 At least 50.0 per cent of these acquisitions were 
secured to benefit from planning gain. In a weak 
economy, the process of granting planning consents 
continues almost regardless of the difficulties besetting 
the economy and surrounding circumstances. Indeed, 
one could argue that a recession or stagnation is positive 
for the planning process since it encourages local 
authorities to allow schemes to come forward more 
rapidly in order that appropriate regeneration, economic 
stimulation and job creation can occur. To date, this 
seems to have been the case on the schemes on which 
we are working. 
 The difficulties of the banking sector have been 
subject to much comment and there is still clearly a need 
for the banks operating in the UK to significantly reduce 
their exposure to real estate lending before they can 
consider any serious volume of new loan originations. 
Since early 2009, net new commercial property lending 
has been below zero and we anticipate this will continue 
for some years until total loan exposure to our sector has 
been significantly reduced from present levels. Whilst, 
against this trend, the Group has been able to raise new 
bank debt on our own balance sheet, we have given 
consideration to the extent that limited bank lending 
might impact on our property exit strategies. 
Given that we are aiming to sell to prime or near-prime 
participants, we have focussed our investments in areas 
of relative wealth, prosperity and hence liquidity within 
the UK. An analysis of the assets acquired since July 
2009 reveals a concentration in Greater London, the 
South East and South West of England, as well as 
Our identified strategy is starting 
to deliver its anticipated returns

supply/demand imbalance with respect to prime office 
stock, will offer a more realistic opportunity for 
commercial office development. In Hammersmith, we 
recently broke ground at our 275,000 sq. ft. prime office 
development in partnership with Scottish Widows 
Investment Property Partnership Trust. Our next phase 
at PaddingtonCentral, of 140,000 sq. ft. net, is a similar 
opportunity, both in terms of size and location.
 The current economic slowdown has significantly 
impacted the serviced office sector in the UK, where we 
are represented by Executive Communication Centres 
(ECC), our wholly owned subsidiary that operates out of 
seven locations across the UK. Its profitability has been 
squeezed considerably by the impact of declining 
short-term income on one hand and the fixed, 
longer-term nature of its own rental obligations to its 
various landlords on the other. Since recovery of its 
margins is likely to be a slow and uncertain process, 
we have made a £2.8 million provision this year for 
impairment of its fixed assets and the resultant 
onerous leases of certain of the properties from 
which ECC trades.
 It is now likely that the real estate sector will find it 
challenging to demonstrate value gains in a low growth, 
largely sideways-moving economy, with the ever present 
threat that, at some stage, interest rates begin to rise 
thus potentially undermining an element of property 
value in the near-  to medium-term. Our identified 
strategy of driving capital growth through real estate 
regeneration is starting to deliver its anticipated 
returns. We believe that this strategy, reliant as it is on 
development expertise and a unique access to complex 
parts of the market, will allow us to navigate these 
difficult times and emerge with significant value growth 
for our shareholders.

Manchester. With regard to sectors, we have recognised 
the continuing demand for foodstores, retail schemes 
around foodstores, selected residential and student 
accommodation and, in certain locations, hotels. 
 A broad analysis of the planned disposals indicates 
that approximately one-third is targeted at institutional 
investors, one-third at housebuilders and one-third at 
the wider investor market. The institutional purchasers 
require little or no bank leverage and the housebuilding 
sector is now benefiting from restructured balance 
sheets and fresh bank facilities urged on by government 
policy. Even the final sector mentioned, the wider investor 
market, is willing to acquire good secondary assets 
sometimes with cash and sometimes with bank facilities, 
albeit at a significantly lower level of gearing than would 
have been achieved prior to 2007.
 The strategy we have set ourselves cannot be 
pursued by all market participants, not only because it 
requires a significant level of development expertise, but 
also because it generally involves smaller rather than 
large-scale development. Accordingly, those substantial 
domestic and global real estate funds that are seeking 
further exposure to the real estate markets in the UK 
are unable to easily access this part of the marketplace. 
They are, however, willing to partner with real estate 
businesses, such as ourselves, who have the expertise, 
brand strength and transparency that a publicly listed 
company provides, as well as the local knowledge that 
goes with being a UK specific developer. We have 
already entered into a number of partnership agreements 
with real estate funds and would anticipate more being 
concluded in the medium-term. 
 As shareholders will be aware, the overwhelming 
majority of our recent transactions have been outside 
Central London. Whilst large-scale office development in 
the City and the West End has been an important part of 
our traditional business model, market conditions have 
now militated against such development opportunities. 
For one thing, the surge of overseas investment into 
Central London offices has driven values to a point at 
which it is difficult for us to justify development risk. 
Whilst we have noted the declining vacancy rates in both 
the City and the West End markets, our concern in the 
last few years has been that demand may be constrained 
by lack of GDP growth, the continuing uncertainty that 
attaches to the current European economy, further 
redundancies in the financial services sector and 
improved occupational efficiencies. These difficulties are 
now becoming more apparent and will ultimately need to 
be resolved before further major office development can 
prudently commence. Until then, pre-lets will be hard to 
come by, bank loans difficult to secure and equity 
reluctant to come forward to take the associated risks.

CEO-statement
Chief Executive’s Statement 6 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
For 15 years, the management team has adopted 
a consistent approach to risk management and 
commercial focus, allowing the Company to pursue 
opportunities in different stages of the property and 
economic cycles whilst mitigating the effects of 
major market fluctuations.
The following five principles underpin our strategy 
and approach. Adherence to these principles 
enabled the Company to survive the financial crash 
in 2008 without recourse to shareholder funds.
01 
Low risk financial and funding structure
The Group maintains modest levels of gearing at 50 – 60 
per cent.
02 
Large-scale development projects in partnership 
with major institutions
We consider large-scale development projects to be 
generally a late economic cycle activity driven by an 
expanding economy and strengthening demand. In our 
experience, large and complex developments delivered 
at the right part of the cycle offer greater profit potential 
than smaller schemes. Nonetheless, we have never 
believed it appropriate for a company of our size to 
accept sole development risk in relation to our complex 
and substantial development projects and, consequently, 
we share the majority of development project risk with 
financial institutions and partners who are the more 
appropriate long-term investors.
Our funding partners on major projects have included:
  Standard Life Investments
  Scottish Widows Investment Property 
Partnership Trust
  The Prudential Assurance Company
  Legal & General Assurance Society
  Aviva Investors
  Corpus Sireo Immobilienfonds
03 
Focus on commercial property
Whilst the emphasis of our activities may shift between 
major, complex developments and smaller scale 
development and trading properties at the different 
stages of the property cycle, we maintain a predominant 
focus on securing planning consents and redeveloping 
commercial property. 
Our property portfolio is focused on:
  Single, prestige office developments
  Multi-phase office developments
  Regional urban regeneration projects
  Food-anchored retail development projects
  Mixed-use developments
  Selected residential schemes, hotels and student 
accommodation 
Since July 2009, we have broadened the scope of our 
real estate activities to take advantage of specific 
opportunities, partnering with specialist operators and 
developers as necessary. 
04 
Actively managed investment portfolio for 
steady income
We maintain an investment portfolio that is proactively 
managed to drive capital growth and enhance rental 
income. Thus, the investment portfolio provides a steady 
and predictable flow of funds, contributing significantly 
towards central overheads and mitigating the more 
uneven profits and cash flow arising from the major 
development and trading portfolio. The investment 
portfolio accounts for a significant element of invested 
equity and represents a diverse portfolio of assets across 
the UK, comprising carefully selected retail and office 
properties. The scale and profile of our portfolio does not 
suit the concentration of risk from any significant 
investment in Central London commercial property. 
05 
Geographic focus
All of our development and investment activity is 
conducted within the United Kingdom.

Risks
annualreport2012. 
developmentsecurities.com/ 
our-business/risk
Principal risks
The Group’s business model is defined by the nature 
and extent of the risks which the Directors consider 
appropriate to its skills and size. Project specific risk and 
cumulative portfolio risk are key measures by which the 
Executive Directors appraise potential new transactions. 
The Group’s risk profile is maintained under continual 
review by its Risk Committee, which meets quarterly, 
and by the Board.
 The Directors consider the following to be the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the business. 
They may be grouped as external risks, whose 
occurrence is beyond the control of the Group, and 
business risks, which the Directors choose to manage  
as part of the Group’s operations.
External risks
Market risk
The real estate market is closely linked with the health of 
the local and national economies. Recessionary or 
stagnant conditions undermine the demand for new 
developments and exacerbate occupier risk in existing 
investment properties, hence significantly reducing their 
value. Taking into account changing consumer behaviour, 
some properties may be rendered not merely cyclically 
redundant, but functionally obsolete. 
 Lack of liquidity available to prospective purchasers 
of our completed projects may delay our ability to realise 
planned disposals or reduce the prices we achieve. 
 Current and prospective market conditions are a 
principal focus for both executive management and the 
Board. Our more detailed assessment of the position  
and our strategic and operating responses are set out  
in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s 
Review on pages 2 to 5, and in the Operating Review  
on pages 1 1 to 31.
Scarcity of opportunities
The Group’s business is transactional and requires a 
flow of opportunities, which can be sparse either 
because of lack of market demand for new product or 
through excess equity forcing uncompetitive market 
pricing. Since the first equity raising in 2009,  
the Group’s strategy of exploiting the current spread 
between prime and secondary yields, targeting 
properties which offer opportunities for refurbishment  
or redevelopment, has attracted a strong pipeline of 
potential projects, owing to the lack of liquidity generally 
available for this part of the market and a restricted  
field of competition for such complex projects.
 The Group maintains a flexible approach to market 
opportunity, resisting the temptation to chase activity 
when prices move too high, and seeking sectors and 
locations where value can be generated, as described 
in the Operating Review on pages 1 1 to 31.
People risk
The Group’s success depends on the ability and 
experience of its Directors and management. The 
departure of key individuals or the failure to attract 
and retain new talent can result in the loss of core 
competencies and industry knowledge and networks.
 The Group aims to motivate and reward its team 
appropriately and competitively as described in the 
Remuneration Report, and the Board keeps the strength 
and depth of the team under continual review.
Funding, liquidity and counterparty risks
The transactional nature of our trading and development 
businesses means that the amount and timing of cash 
receipts is subject to variability, making cash flow forecasts 
uncertain. In addition the pressure on banks to reduce their 
exposure to real estate and to increase the risk-weighting 
of such lending, as well as the continuing risk of a credit 
crisis in the European banking sector, all threaten to 
constrain the liquidity available to us to fund acquisitions 
or refinance existing borrowings as they fall due. 
 Such conditions also heighten counterparty risk  
both operationally, in sale contracts and joint venture 
agreements, and financially, in cash deposit and  
hedging arrangements.
 These risks are kept under continuous review by  
the executive team and discussed by the Board at every 
meeting.  Further analysis of the risks and our processes 
for analysis and management are set out in the Financial 
Review on pages 39 to 40.
Business risks
Planning risk
Procuring an appropriate and valuable planning consent 
is a key element of the creation of value through property 
development. Our current strategic focus on regeneration 
and redevelopment relies significantly on our skills in this 
area.  Securing planning permission is a complex and 
uncertain process with applications subject to objection 
from a wide range of potential stakeholders, and hence  
is prone to delay, modification and rejection.
 The Directors rely on their experience and local 
knowledge supplemented by advisors and, in some 
cases, by sector-specialist partners, to maximise the 
chance of success and reduce the risks and costs 
of failure.
 
Construction risk
Construction is subject to risks of cost overruns, delay 
and the failure of an appointed contractor.
 The Group examines these risks in each case, 
conducting appropriate due diligence on the capabilities 
and financial security of its prospective contractors. 
The Group deploys its own experienced project managers 
to minimise the likelihood and impact of the above risks.

This 46,000 sq. ft. period Grade II listed building was acquired in June 
2010 for £10.1 million and comprised commercial, residential and retail 
space. Planning consent was secured to convert the majority of the 
office suites to residential. The residential units have been pre-sold for 
£20.6 million and are currently being converted into luxury flats with 
practical completion anticipated in Q2 2012. The residual office 
component was sold for £2.3 million in January 2012. The retail units 
and freehold are under offer at £1.3 million and £1.1 million respectively. 14 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
The Old Vinyl Factory,  
Hayes, Greater London
An 18-acre site purchased for £16.0 million in joint venture with 
Cathedral Group plc. The masterplan, currently under public 
consultation, proposes 1.5 million sq. ft. of mixed-use regeneration 
paying homage to the site’s rich history (this was the former HQ of EMI) 
creating a vibrant new district in West London. Extensive works to 
reposition the site and integrate the changes proposed within the 
community are underway. Planning consent has been secured for the 
first phase, 132 new residential homes, and an 80.0 per cent stake has 
been sold in a shell office building for an initial receipt of £3.8 million. 
Further value is expected from overage linked to this sale.

A prominent retail parade located on the pedestrianised high street  
in Bexleyheath, Kent. The building provides retail units of between 
4,500 – 39,500 sq. ft. arranged over three floors. During the period 
£1.2 million was invested in the asset adding 17,000 sq. ft. of retail 
space for Primark Stores and achieving a rental uplift and a lease  
term extension to 25 years. This has resulted in a weighted average 
unexpired lease term across the asset of 18 years. 18 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012

Property
The UK commercial property market still lacks clear 
direction and is showing signs of slipping back into a 
further period of negative value growth. Of the two main 
drivers to property value growth, one has probably run its 
course and the other requires a more positive economic 
environment before it can begin to manifest itself. The 
first, declining interest rates, led to a period of sustained, 
very low gilt yields ushered in by quantitative easing. One 
of the effects of this was to sustain property values at a 
higher level than that to which they might otherwise have 
fallen. Interest rates are now effectively at their lowest 
possible level and any further rounds of quantitative 
easing are likely only to sustain rather than boost 
property values. It is likely that this period of low interest 
rates will continue for some time given the 
macroeconomic indicators of economic stagnation, rising 
unemployment, continued fiscal tightening and extended 
uncertainty over the economic outlook within the 
eurozone. The second main driver, rental growth, requires 
an expanding economy which is absent today and is likely 
to remain so for some time. In a number of sectors, rental 
growth is likely to be negative rather than positive in the 
near-term.
Retail sector
The dramatic slowdown in the UK economy and the 
decline in consumer spending has served to exacerbate 
the decline in our high streets. In addition, structural 
change is increasingly evident as a result of changing 
consumer habits, most notably the ever increasing rise 
of multi-channel retailing. Such widespread functional 
obsolescence is more apparent than it has ever been. 
A real challenge lies ahead for towns and cities to 
regenerate substantial areas of the high street that are 
unlikely ever again to return to vibrant retail activity. 
Town centre sales fell by 1.4 per cent in 201 1, the fourth 
consecutive year that sales have declined and the fifth 
year that it has been the weakest performing sub-sector 
of the retail market. Growth is apparent within selected 
areas of the market: at one end of the spectrum, the 
luxury goods market and at the other end, value retailers. 
It is the mass market, middle ground where retailers are 
cutting back space and our investment flows reflect 
these trends.
 The foodstore sector has shown the strongest 
demand for new development product as the major food 
retailers have staked their respective claims for increased 
market share. Whilst it is encouraging to identify a 
sub-sector that demonstrates some strength, clearly 
there will come a time when this trend abates. Indeed the 
recent indications from one or two of the major stores 
suggest that competition for sites has already reduced. 
Nonetheless, it is helpful that the main food retailing 
groups are financially strong, which makes them 
The main driver to value creation is 
change of use, which repositions real 
estate towards those sectors where 
demand persists Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 23
attractive as prime tenants for institutional investment 
and appropriate to lead development activity. 
Office market
Outside of Central London, the office market is also 
retrenching, reflecting the impact of reduced levels of 
economic activity and demand. Vacancy rates are by no 
means at their highest historic levels, but a sustained 
period of weak occupier demand has, in some instances, 
outweighed any perceived supply shortages. Central 
London is a possible exception to this since London 
has an outward facing role to the global economy as a 
leading business and financial centre. However, even 
here, demand is weak, especially within the financial 
services sector and there is not only a risk that new 
supply could be brought to the market somewhat 
prematurely but also that an expanding Canary Wharf will 
remain a competitive challenge, especially as Crossrail 
approaches completion in the medium-term. To a lesser 
extent, the office sector is also impacted by structural 
change evident throughout Western Europe as the 
population ages and the birth rate declines, with a 
consequent reduction in the size of the workforce. Within 
the office buildings, changes are occurring and will 
continue to occur regarding space utilisation. Effective 
headcount densities within the buildings will increase as 
more flexible workspace solutions are implemented in 
order to reduce costs, often on the back of increasing 
technological developments. Greater demand will be 
required to offset the diminution in space requirements 
from these factors. The present scenario for global 
economic activity does not bode well in that regard. 
 Large-scale office property development is 
traditionally a late cycle activity as demand increases 
on the back of economic growth and vacancy rates fall. 
Accordingly, at this early point in the property cycle, 
new office development is primarily restricted to 
Central London and even there is not without its risks.
Value creation
In response to this challenging scenario, the Group 
continues to chart a course between secondary and 
prime markets. If value gain cannot be generated by 
either rental growth or yield compression, it can only be 
found within the areas of intensive asset management, 
regeneration and redevelopment. Simply put, our main 
activity in the last two years has been to realise capital 
growth from properties that have been sourced by 
us in the secondary or tertiary markets and which we 
endeavour to reposition towards the prime or near-prime 
markets. In many instances, the main driver to value 
creation is change of use, which repositions real estate 
towards those sectors where demand persists. The more 
than 40 projects acquired since the date of our first 
equity raise cover a range of sectors and regions of the 
UK, with an emphasis on areas that have been least 
impacted by the economic downturn. Hence we have a 
heavier weighting in Greater London, the South, South 
East, South West and Manchester and a focus on 
foodstores, retail around foodstores, selected residential 
schemes, student accommodation, hotels and leisure. 
We have largely excluded the office, traditional high 
street and industrial sectors from this view. 
Risk management
The number of assets that we are actively managing 
achieves risk diversification across a range of 
transactions rather than a concentration of value in one 
or two individual assets. This is a tactical move that 
mitigates our move up the risk curve as we seek higher 
returns. Where assets have been large, we have sought 
to bring in partners to provide risk equity, reducing our 
own exposure and improving our potential returns at the 
same time. This is yet another way in which risk is 
managed. Of course, the corollary to this is that our tasks 
are more management intensive in order to achieve our 
desired levels of returns. 
 On pages 24 to 27 of this Annual Report, a matrix 
of current properties can be found, giving information as 
to scheme details and progress achieved to date. 
 This matrix is not all-inclusive and it is worth making

Major development portfolio 
At 10 Hammersmith Grove our building contractor, Wates 
Group, is making good progress and we expect to fi nish 
the building in the spring of 2013 at a moment of limited 
competition. If the building lets swiftly following 
completion, there is no reason why we should not roll 
straight into the development of the second phase, 
12 Hammersmith Grove, comprising 160,000 sq. ft. 
offi ces with planning permission already granted.
 The pace of letting at Two Kingdom Street has been 
disappointing, taking two years to get the building two 
thirds let at a rental tone that we considered acceptable. 
However, the quality of the tenant register is impeccable.
 The letting process at St Bride Street, a 44,000 sq. 
ft. prime offi ce accommodation, forward sold to Corpus 
Sireo, has been similarly extended, but we continue to 
apply ourselves to the task of letting the fi nal two fl oors. 
No profi t will arise to us from this activity. 
 Our hotel development at West Quay, Southampton, 
was successfully completed in the summer, and we 
received our profi t payment from AMEC Pension Fund.
 Turning to the future, we hope to start a further 
phase of offi ces at PaddingtonCentral, Four Kingdom 
Street, with planning consent for 140,000 sq. ft. of prime 
offi ce accommodation. Our site in Slough, with planning 
consent for 385,000 sq. ft. offi ces, is now cleared, ready 
to start and surrounded by impressive new public realm, 
but development in the current economic environment 
will only be triggered by a pre-let.
 We were delighted to be appointed by Trinity Hall, 
Cambridge, as development manager for three of its sites 
on the Cambridge Science Park, immediately to the north 
of the city centre. It is Trinity Hall’s intention to structure 
the funding for the development using its banking 
relationships, subject, of course, to occupier demand. The 
Cambridge occupier market has been an exception to the 
subdued rule and has been quite active. If we are able to 
secure the right level of occupier demand, we could fi nd 
ourselves on site in Cambridge this year.
 As to new business, we continue to seek out sites 
and opportunities, but only in prime locations. Bidding 
remains very competitive, to the point where returns to 
ourselves and our investors are too low to be attractive. 
Our outlook is cautious.
Development and trading portfolio
At Cross Quarter, Abbey Wood in South East London, 
we are in detailed discussions with foodstore groups 
to anchor a mixed-use development. We would hope 
to secure an operator within the next three months 
following which a planning application can be submitted. 
To date, pre-application consultation with stakeholders 
has shown support of our proposals.
 In Ilford, North East London, discussions are also in 
hand with a major food retailer and the site masterplan 
has now been completed, having benefi ted from positive 
engagement with the Local Authority.
 The 82-bed care home development in Dartmouth, 
pre-let to European Care, is proceeding broadly on 
time and on budget, and expected to reach practical 
completion in August 2012.
 At the hotel in Braehead, operated by the Group 
under a management agreement with Campanile, trading 
has been below target, though remaining profi table. 
We are working with our partner and the manager to 
enhance performance and achieve our business plan.
 At the Friarsgate Shopping Centre in Lichfi eld, the 
395,000 sq. ft. retail led mixed-use scheme is now in an 
advanced stage of scheme design and, together with 
our partners, S Harrison Developments Limited, we are 
shortly to submit a revised planning application. 
Accordingly, we are now in a position to identify anchor 
tenant demand. Separately, the cinema is under offer by 
way of a pre-let. Retailer demand in the town is strong, 
as there is a level of under supply.
 The retail element of HDD’s local centre scheme at 
Bannerbrook was sold in December 201 1 generating 
proceeds of £1.8 million. At our retail led 19-acre 
development in Buckshaw Village, fi ve retail units have 
been pre-let and two plots have been sold allowing 
construction to commence in June 2012. At Bridgwater, 
the progress is similar with suffi cient lettings now 
completed to secure development funding and start on 
site to take place later in the year. We have also now 
commenced on site at Tranmere, a local retail scheme 
in The Wirral, with 60.0 per cent pre-let to retailers 
including The Co-operative and funding secured 
from Santander.

Renewable energy
During 201 1, we entered into a joint venture arrangement 
with Njord Energy to secure and promote sites for 
medium sized wind farms. We view this sector very much 
in the same vein as strategic land promotion, being high 
risk but with limited capital exposure and high potential 
returns. To date £0.5 million has been committed, rising 
to a potential of £2.1 million in the event that selected 
projects mature. Five sites have been secured under 
promotion agreements and initial technical and planning 
analyses on all of the sites have been supportive of 
making detailed planning applications. These will be 
made later in the year and initial determinations should 
be forthcoming in 2013, at which point a decision will be 
made as to how to progress what will be consented sites 
in a marketplace short of such projects and very much 
still part of the Government’s green agenda.
Investment portfolio
We have continued with a profi le of investments that 
focuses on both core defensive income and asset 
initiatives that will create value in the medium-term.
 At 29th February 2012, the portfolio comprised 
42 assets with a fair value of £237.9 million, increased 
from 37 assets with a fair value of £199.2 million at 
31st December 2010. 
 The revaluation of the direct investment portfolio 
at 29th February 2012 showed a capital decrease of 
£4.7 million or 1.9 per cent. We were disappointed not 
to match the IPD Monthly Property Index return for the 
twelve months to 31st December 201 1, but this was due 
in no small part to the strong contribution from Central 
London within the IPD Index return. Overall, our total 
return for this period was 4.2 per cent as against the IPD 
Index return of 8.7 per cent. Whilst our income return was 
higher by 0.7 per cent, our capital return was 4.2 per cent 
negative as against the Index. In the two months ended 
29th February 2012, our total return was a negative 1.6 
per cent as compared to positive 0.6 per cent for the 
Index. Of the overall decline in values of £4.7 million for 
the 14 months to 29th February 2012, £2.3 million alone 
derived from the impact of the administration at 
Peacocks, which resulted in multiple store closures on 
22nd February 2012. This was the fi rst signifi cant tenant 
failure within our portfolio in recent years, but has and 
will continue to be mitigated by the good location of the 
fi ve properties involved. Indeed, at the time of writing, 
we estimate that approximately 50.0 per cent of the 
Strategic partnerships
CTP
CTP, our associate company based in Manchester, has 
continued to recycle capital into new opportunities. In 
addition to progress at Hattersley, Greater Manchester 
and Castle House, Sheffi eld (referred to in the matrix of 
properties on page 26), the Company also completed the 
acquisition of its joint venture partner’s share in three 
projects within the Yorkshire region and has already 
secured several lettings on vacant elements, adding 
value to the projects. CTP also continues to bid for new 
business in the Local Authority sponsored town centre 
market, an area where it has had signifi cant success and 
has been selected by a Local Authority to bring forward 
an exciting town centre mixed-use project. 
Beyond Green
In the summer, Beyond Green was disappointed to lose 
its planning appeal for the project in Tilehurst, West 
Berkshire. However, the Inspector’s decision was positive 
in many areas and we have begun work with the planning 
authority and objectors to examine how a revised smaller 
scheme, that better refl ects local environmental 
concerns, could be brought forward. In due course we 
anticipate submitting a fresh application for a reduced 
scheme benefi ting from strong local support.
 At the project in Broadland, north of Norwich, we 
remain on track to submit a planning application in 
summer 2012 for a mixed-use urban extension including 
around 3,500 homes. We have been encouraged by the 
receptive attitude of the local planning authority to a 
comprehensive scheme, positive stakeholder feedback 
on the design and sustainability principles adopted, and 
confi rmation of Central Government funding for the 
Northern Distributor Road. 
Barwood
Following the successful completion of two projects, 
where planning consent was obtained and the sites 
subsequently sold, the Group’s loan of £2.3 million was 
repaid, together with a dividend of £0.3 million. The 
Group immediately reinvested £2.5 million into a new 
associate, Barwood Development Securities Ltd, which 
has itself entered into a long-term £15.0 million fund, as 
an investor alongside Aberdeen Asset Management, to 
secure and promote similar sites. The fund has already 
secured four projects and is hopeful of being fully 
invested during the course of 2012.

£2.3 million diminution in value has already been 
recaptured with two stores being retained by the 
Peacocks business and one store re-let to a superior 
covenant. The fourth store is very small and will be most 
probably re-let to a convenience store operator and the 
fifth is under offer to a national retailer, albeit at a 
reduced rent.
 Had it not been for the demise of Peacocks, the 
portfolio returns would have been much closer to the 
IPD Index albeit still negatively impacted by the lack 
of Central London properties within the investment 
portfolio.
 We continue our strategy of active management 
of our investment portfolio. During the period we have 
added 18 new lettings, representing 67,100 sq. ft. 
and rental income of £0.8 million. Vacant space now 
stands at 1 1.4 per cent, 99,000 sq. ft., with an ERV of 
£1.0 million.

Corporate Responsibility
We recognise the 
significant impact that 
our large-scale property 
developments can have on 
a diverse range of groups. 
Our stakeholders include 
our employees, 
shareholders and 
co-investors and also 
our suppliers, our tenants 
and their employees, 
their customers and the 
communities surrounding 
our properties.
Our approach
We work constructively within the strong framework of 
regulation which exists to balance the interests of all 
these groups. However, there are many situations in 
which exceeding minimum standards creates economic, 
social and environmental benefits, contributing to the 
sustainable success of our Company.
 We continue to work to the same high standards that 
we have reached to date, and we will continue to prioritise 
those activities with which we believe we can make a 
positive impact for our stakeholders.
 As our business strategy continues to evolve in this 
challenging market, our portfolio of activity has become 
more diverse. Therefore, our strategy for Corporate 
Responsibility has also had to adapt and we are beginning 
to identify priorities in each area of our business.
Our governance system
At the start of each financial year, the Executive Directors 
set objectives based on the material issues relating to 
each of our stakeholder groups. Objectives are also set 
considering wider environmental issues.
Performance is recorded throughout the year and is 
consolidated by the Director responsible for Corporate 
Responsibility. The progress made is assessed and new 
targets are set for the following year. 
Our overall objectives
In all of our activities we strive to:
  achieve and maintain good practice in all aspects 
of sustainable and responsible development. 
  improve the measurement of what we do and ensure 
continuous improvement in our performance.
Respect for people:
Maintain a collegiate atmosphere and safe working 
environment for our employees and encourage and 
facilitate employee development. 
 Engage our major suppliers in our sustainable 
development programmes, share our objectives with 
them and ensure compliance with health and safety 
best practice on all of our sites.
 Create diverse and balanced developments that 
reflect the socio-economic diversity of the local 
communities and contribute to their enrichment through 
support for youth programmes, skills development, 
arts projects and environmental projects.
Respect for the environment:
Minimise energy and water consumption through 
considered design, construction site best practice and 
clear advice to occupants.
 Minimise waste from all our operations.
 Appoint suitably qualified consultants to advise on 
all aspects of environmental protection and sustainable 
development.
Reputation and risk:
Contribute to the better working of our industry by 
participating in debate and publishing research. 
 Identify and manage risks to the achievement of our 
corporate strategy, including harm to our good reputation, 
arising from our work with people and the environment.

Major developments
We manage the design and construction of these projects 
from planning application to delivery. At the outset and 
throughout the life of each project, we consider the 
issues of sustainability, from lifetime carbon footprint to 
sustainable transport and community socio-economic 
development. By doing these well we will continue to 
create premium products for responsible owners.
 A formal report is made to the Projects Board on 
every live development project each month. These 
reports refer to health and safety matters and all other 
material issues affecting the Company’s CR objectives.
 When planning and bidding for development and 
investment opportunities, the briefing material we give to 
our consultants lists our detailed aspirations and outlines 
our CR policies. Through early consideration in the

Benchmark and reduce carbon emissions 
from all future developments, in advance 
of legislation, by working with our design 
and contracting teams on specifications 
and site management techniques.
  Premier Inn’s specification for our Southampton project was fixed and 
not conducive to benchmarking future developments. However, key 
statistics are:
– A BREEAM rating of ‘very good’ 
– Awarded gold standard under Considerate Contractors scheme
– Very strong EPC rating of ‘A’ 
– Design team achieved a 65 per cent improvement on Part L 
requirements of Building Regulations, for Carbon emissions
– Achieved a 20 per cent renewable energy target
– 58 per cent of our crushed concrete recycled into our building
– 87 per cent of our site waste diverted away from landfill
  Our technical review of Two Kingdom Street can be summarised:
– BREEAM rating of ‘Excellent’
– EPC rating of C
– 20 per cent improvement on the requirements of Part L2A of the

  10 Hammersmith Grove is targeting to achieve an ‘Excellent’ 
BREEAM rating and incorporates a large amount of Photovoltaics 
(PV) on its roof contributing towards emission reductions. 
  We anticipate an EPC rating of 40 equating to carbon emission 
reductions in excess of 20 per cent from the baseline levels. 
  We shall look to achieve a 10 per cent improvement on the carbon 
footprint of 10 Hammersmith Grove compared to our last major 
scheme. 
  Our environmental strategy for the building already includes:
– Very efficient lighting, heating and cooling strategy
– Electricity generation from PV 
– Improved building fabric: low u value glazing/curtain walling,  
very good insulation ( A+ rated) throughout the building
– Adoption of extra low energy LED lighting
– Green Materials with A/A+ Green Guide ratings 
– In excess of 170 cycle racks and showers for the cyclists 
– A sustainable travel plan and very good transport links
Ensure that all new development projects 
have a ‘brief’ based around the Standard 
Brief Documentation.
  Our Standard Brief Document is used as the basis of all project briefs.

  We continued to maintain a real spirit of partnership with our key 
suppliers during 2011. In at least one case, we actively supported a key 
partner’s business through a difficult period. 
  Our Delivery team is encouraged to maintain relations and the Head 
of Delivery co-ordinates interest from and to the business, with a 
structured approach to communication.
  To maintain this approach. 
social considerations become embedded in all our projects.
 Our recent start on site at Hammersmith confirms 
our ambition to create BREEAM Excellent schemes and 
we are working with our contractor, Wates, to achieve 
demanding targets for waste management during 
construction. 
 In 201 1 we achieved our targeted BREEAM 
accreditations for Premier Inn in Southampton (very 
good) and Two Kingdom Street (excellent). At HDD’s 
Lawley Village development we shall achieve BREEAM 
very good on all the commercial units and Code 3 for 
sustainable homes. At Stanground we have worked 
closely with the local authority and Morrisons to develop 
one of their greenest superstores to date, featuring solar 
heating, energy saving lighting, heat recovery and 
rainwater harvesting. Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 35
Investment portfolio
Our investment portfolio is a deliberately diverse range of 
properties with many types of end use and therefore it is 
very challenging to apply universal principles. Within our 
portfolio there may be situations in which focused 
investment could make individual properties significantly 
more environmentally and socially sustainable, and more 
successful for tenants, thereby adding value.
 In 201 1 we commissioned an ‘environmental’ study 
of the current portfolio, which will be completed in 2012. 
It is expected to identify specific opportunities to improve 
our CSR performance at some properties, and to 
highlight general principles that may be used to guide 
improvement in our longer-term property management 
and development.
This study will examine energy use, emissions, waste 
management, public transport facilities, the provision 
of public facilities, landscaping and ‘public realm’ and 
existing partnerships with local communities.
 This will allow us to establish benchmarks and set 
targets on which we will report in future years.
 The study has already identified a number of 
examples of the support that Development Securities 
PLC provides to the community. For example, the use of 
empty shops as ‘pop up units’ for temporary charitable 
use at The Furlong shopping centre and the provision 
of accredited training opportunities for staff at 
Atlantic Village.
Corporate Responsibility
Other development and trading 
and joint ventures
The majority of these properties are owned and 
developed in conjunction with joint venture or project 
partners. Our focus is therefore to play an influential role 
by working with our partners to ensure their good 
environmental, social and governance practice. This 
not only helps the spread of good practice across our 
industry but it also provides an important aspect of 
risk management for our Company.

Financial Review
Graham Prothero 
Finance Director
The typical sources and models for property finance 
seem to be at a point of change. The banks are slowly but 
resolutely reducing their commitment to the sector, with 
most restricting their appetite, and several withdrawing 
altogether. Net lending to UK commercial real estate has 
been negative in all but two quarters since April 2009. 
Current and prospective regulatory requirements around 
risk classification and capital allocation will surely 
exacerbate this trend, as well as driving up cost to the 
borrower. On the demand side, a significant proportion of 
the total outstanding debt to the sector of £217 billion (as 
at 31st January 2012) is due for repayment or refinancing 
by the end of 2013. To this can be added the looming 
maturities of some of the £47 billion of outstanding 
Commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS). 
 We therefore face an increasing need for debt in a 
market where supply will be progressively constrained. 
This prompts a strong focus on certainty of funding,  
with term probably even more important than cost,  
and emphasises the importance of our relationships  
with a number of stable institutions who demonstrate 
long-term commitment to our marketplace and  
to the Group.
 During 201 1 we were pleased to secure two major 
refinancing transactions, drawing £22.5 million and 
£37.9 million respectively from Aviva Commercial 
Finance and Lloyds Banking Group, both key long-term 
lenders to the Group. As at 29th February 2012, our 
weighted average maturity was 9.4 years (8.4 years 
including our share of joint ventures), compared with 
9.1 years as at 31st December 2010 (8.5 years  
including share of joint ventures). Within this average,  
it is important to note that we have decreased the 
proportion of loans maturing within four years, as can  
be seen from the analysis provided in note 18(c) to  
the financial statements.
We also continue to deploy partner equity at the project 
level, thereby extending our own equity and leveraging 
our expertise. Since our last year-end we have invested 
alongside some £24.1 million of partner capital, including 
£18.6 million provided by Brockton Capital at Kensington 
Church Street.
 Following the two share issues in July 2009 and 
July 2010, we have been highly active in deploying the 
proceeds into the market. Our cash resource provides 
advantages of speed and certainty and enhances our 
ability to transact, in particular with the banks’ lending 
timetable now typically extended by risk-averse credit 
approval and legal processes. Between summer 2009 
and summer 201 1 we executed a number of deals from 
equity, refinancing with debt after completion. In the 
second half of 201 1, as economic storm clouds gathered 
over Europe, and in particular as uncertainty mounted 
over liquidity in its banking sector, we moderated that 
approach and currently complete transactions only when 
our financing is secure.
 As at 29th February 2012 we had invested £157.4 
million of equity in 46 projects since July 2009, 
representing acquisitions and development expenditure 
of £372.7 million, including partner capital of £33.2 
million and debt of £182.1 million. Since the period-end 
this figure has risen to equity investment of £163.4 
million and 48 projects, with a total acquisition cost of 
£397.4 million.
 Consequently the Group’s gearing, including share of 
joint ventures, has increased to a more efficient level of 
58.9 per cent as at 29th February 2012, compared with 
27.7 per cent as at 31st December 2010. If joint ventures 
are excluded, the figures are 48.8 per cent as at 29th 
February 2012 and 21.4 per cent as at 31st December 
2010. As described on page 6, we target a level of 
between 50 and 60 per cent as an efficient operating 
level for the business.
Capital structure and liquidity management
The Group’s strategy for capital structure and liquidity 
management is to maintain a conservative balance of 
equity and debt appropriate to the nature and profile of 
our asset portfolio, achieving both certainty and flexibility. 
This takes into consideration our operational strategy 
and our intention for each asset, together with our 
expectations for the availability and cost of alternative 
sources of finance.
 Our cash and overall liquidity is managed at Group 
level, with each of our portfolios assessed and monitored 
according to their own specific risks. The increasing 
importance of the development and trading portfolios to 
our business model increases the inevitable uncertainty 
as to timings of cash flows. We keep our liquidity under 
continual review and maintain cash buffers sufficient to 
absorb delays in planned asset sales.
Our continuing strong 
relationships with several 
major lenders mean that 
the Group has not been 
restricted in raising new 
debt for both investment 
and development projects Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 37
Medium-term liquidity is provided through a mix of the 
Group’s equity and its debt facilities. Our continuing 
strong relationships with several major lenders mean that 
the Group has not been restricted in raising new debt for 
both investment and development projects. We have also 
arranged facilities with new lenders during the period, 
increasing our access to finance in a constrained market. 
During the 14-month period to 29th February 2012, we 
raised new facilities totalling £1 18.8 million, including 
£39.7 million of new facilities raised by joint ventures.
 Reflecting the nature of the Group’s business, 
short-term liquidity requirements are fairly predictable. 
Cash requirements are monitored on a monthly and 
weekly basis, and short-term cash balances are 
deposited accordingly.
Cash management
Cash may be invested across a range of instruments, 
including instant and term deposit accounts, money 
market funds and commercial paper. Our policy prioritises 
security and liquidity ahead of returns, and the Board has 
set limits for both minimum credit ratings and maximum 
concentrations with respect to counterparties. As at the 
period-end the Group had £50.2 million of cash held 
across nine banks.
Current bank facilities and borrowings
The Group’s bank facilities are set out in the table on the 
next page. As at 29th February 2012, the value of the 
Group’s gross borrowings was £203.1 million (31st 
December 2010: £175.5 million). Cash balances were 
£50.2 million (31st December 2010: £104.1 million), 
including amounts of £14.6 million held as restricted 
deposits, giving net debt of £152.9 million and gearing 
of 48.8 per cent (31st December 2010: £71.4 million 
and 21.4 per cent).
 The Group’s share of net debt in joint ventures was 
£31.5 million (31st December 2010: £20.8 million); if this 
is aggregated with Group balances, net debt rises to 
£184.4 million and gearing to 58.9 per cent (31st 
December 2010: £92.2 million and 27.7 per cent).
 During the 14-month period, the Group has drawn 
new facilities of £79.1 million, of which £37.9 million was 
applied to refinance existing loans and £41.2 million 
represented new debt.
 In addition to the loans of £37.9 million from Lloyds 
Banking Group and £22.5 million from Aviva Commercial 
Finance, the Group arranged finance of £6.0 million  
from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and £7.2 million  
from The Co-operative Bank secured against investment 
assets. We also obtained development finance of  
£2.5 million from RBS in respect of the project at  
328 Sandbanks Road, Dorset, and a further £3.0 million 
from Investec Bank in respect of the acquisition of 
Valentines House, Ilford.
Within our debt portfolio we maintain a mix of fixed and 
variable rates, in general preferring the certainty of fixed 
rates for our larger and longer-term borrowings. In 
particular we have taken advantage of current low rates 
to fix a higher than usual proportion of the portfolio, 
taking the view that certainty at these levels outweighs 
the potential savings in floating rates (should current 
levels persist into the medium-term). For shorter-term 
facilities we also consider caps, though the high volatility 
of rate expectations has typically made these 
instruments expensive to purchase.
 As described on page 6, the Group limits its risk  
in major development projects through the principle  
of forward sales. This is achieved in various ways,  
from the completed forward sale of the land and  
project assets, through to the contracted sale of the 
prospective development, with appropriate guarantees  
of completion. The Group’s direct contribution to more 
modest development project finance is provided by  
way of equity and medium-term bank facilities which 
provide the necessary flexibility to draw down funds  
as required.
 The Group’s investment portfolio is financed by a 
blend of equity, the debenture loan and bank borrowings 
of an appropriate term for each asset or group of assets. 
Our investments in joint ventures and associates are 
funded from equity, with any relevant gearing deployed 
within the ventures themselves.
 Responsibility for management of cash and liquidity 
risk rests with the Board. The executive team has 
systems in place for the monitoring and management of 
this key aspect of our business. Daily review is delegated 
to the Finance Director, who discusses this with the other 
members of the executive team at least on a weekly 
basis. The Board formally reviews the position at its 
meetings, which occur eight times a year.
 The principal tools of assessment are: 15-month, 
risk-analysed cash flow forecast, which is updated in 
full on a quarterly basis and monthly for material 
changes; a schedule of agreed bank facilities and 
amounts drawn against them; a summary of net debt, 
including derivative instruments; a summary of current 
cash deposit balances; and a formal commentary on the 
position prepared by the Finance Director for each 
Board meeting.
 For the longer-term, the Directors review the Group’s 
capital structure, taking account of the real estate cycle, 
any changes in the nature and liquidity of the Group’s 
asset portfolio, the likely forthcoming risks and 
opportunities for the Group, and the market for equity 
and debt finance. This is formally revisited at least twice a 
year, via the Group’s Risk Committee, which reports to 
the Board, and at the Board’s annual strategy review. 
In addition this is discussed as appropriate at each 
Board meeting.

Gardens project. This asset has been forward sold 
to a purchaser who is paying for the units as they are 
delivered. Subject to this counterparty risk, the loan is 
anticipated to be repaid in advance of its term. Should 
there be a change to this plan the Directors do not 
anticipate difficulty in extending this small facility, held 
with a key relationship bank, to cover any delay. The 
loan of £2.5 million in respect of 328 Sandbanks Road, 
Dorset is due for repayment by February 2013. The 
Directors anticipate that this will be repaid from sales 
of the apartments during 2012. No other facilities fall 
due within the next twelve months. The earliest maturity 
in respect of facilities financing longer-term assets 
is June 2013.
 
In respect of projects held in joint venture, we borrowed 
£26.0 million from RBS for the acquisition of Newcombe 
House, Kensington Church Street. We also drew £9.1 
million from HSBC in respect of The Old Vinyl Factory, 
Hayes and £4.6 million from The Co-operative Bank for 
the purchase of the Manchester student accommodation.
  In addition to the amounts repaid through 
refinancing, the Group repaid a further £18.7 million, 
principally representing sales proceeds from the Rock 
portfolio and Westminster Palace Gardens.
Committed facilities as at 1st May 2012 total 
£204.1 million, with a weighted average term of 9.0 
years, (falling to 8.0 years including the Group’s share 
of joint ventures). Unutilised facilities are £9.9 million.
 Within the portfolio the earliest maturity date 
is June 2012, in respect of the Westminster Palace

1  Interest cover ratios are specific to the loan and the relevant property. Minimum net worth refers to the net asset value of the Group per its latest Balance Sheet (29th February and 31st August).
2  These unsecured, variable rate loan notes are denominated in Euros, with a nominal value of €47 million. The Group has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap, such that interest rates 
are fixed and the Group will repay a fixed Sterling amount. The minimum net worth covenant applies to the hedge rather than the loan notes.
3  The loan to value ratio covenant is only testable after the third anniversary of the loan being refinanced (May 2013).

respect of the potential failure of the bank on the other 
side of the transaction. The Group mitigates this risk by 
dealing only with major banks and monitoring their 
continuing creditworthiness. There is no current 
indication that any of the Group’s hedging counterparties 
may be unable to settle its obligations.
 Interest rate swaps are marked to market in the 
Balance Sheet, giving rise to the risk of fair value 
movements in the derivative instrument, and a consequent 
impact on net asset value. The Group also holds a 
cross-currency interest rate swap, which is designated as 
a cash flow hedge. Movements in the foreign currency leg 
of this swap provide a hedge against movements in the 
fair value of the €47 million loan notes. Movements in the 
interest leg are taken to reserves. The effects of these 
fair value adjustments in the 14 months ended 29th 
February 2012 are set out in the note 18(d) on page 98.
Other financial instrument risks
Development and trading portfolios
The principal financial instrument risks in these assets 
are the credit risk in counterparties. Given the nature of 
these assets the amounts owed to the Group can be 
significant, and these arrangements are monitored very 
closely both before contracts are exchanged and 
throughout the execution period.
  As at 29th February 2012, the Group had no 
material, unsecured debtors in respect of the sales of 
development and trading assets. As the recycling of 
our development and trading portfolio gains further 
momentum in the coming months, the Directors will 
remain alert to counterparty risk, in particular where 
purchasers are reliant on uncertain bank debt to fulfil 
their commitments to the Group.
 The Group is contracted to provide £5.0 million of 
development funding for each phase at 
PaddingtonCentral, in respect of which it earns interest 
and a profit share, both subject to the profitability of the 
phase. The Group’s development partners, who are 
contracted to pay this interest and profit share at the 
completion of each phase, and to repay the capital at the 
end of the development, are large financial institutions. 
This risk capital is held as a development participation 
within available-for-sale financial assets, and at the 
period-end was valued at £5.0 million (31st December 
2010: £5.0 million), as described in note 18(a) to the 
Group financial statements. The Directors are satisfied 
that the combination of the Group’s risk-averse approach 
to development funding, its cautious selection of 
development partners and its focused and active 
management of each project provide reasonable  
comfort over the risks of these financial exposures.
The £15.6 million bank loan to the Curzon Park Ltd joint 
venture matures in May 2015, and the Group is keeping 
this under review, whilst monitoring the prospects for the 
asset itself (see page 88). The loan-to-value covenant 
is scheduled to be measured in May 2013, which is 
expected to generate a partial repayment of the loan. 
The Group is currently in discussions with its joint 
venture partner and the bank to agree the approach to 
this exercise.
 The loan of £46.3 million to the Manchester Arena 
Complex joint venture matures in June 2013, and the 
Group is currently negotiating with the lenders for an 
extension to this facility.
 The Directors keep bank covenants under review, 
and are content with the current position. We aim to agree 
our loan-to-value covenants at comfortably tolerable 
levels, leaving sensible headroom for foreseeable 
changes in the general market or the specific asset. 
We also incorporate cure mechanisms into the facility 
documentation, such that we have an appropriate 
opportunity to restore the required loan-to-value ratio 
by making cash deposits or prepayments.
Interest rate risk and hedging
As at 29th February 2012, the summary of the Group’s 
interest rate exposure was as follows:
Excluding 
share of joint 
ventures
%
Including 
share of joint 
ventures
%
Fixed rate 49.4 42.1
Floating rate, swapped into fixed 41.5 42.6
Floating rate with cap 3.2 9.3
Floating rate 5.9 6.0
The weighted average interest rate payable was 6.0 per 
cent, 5.7 per cent including joint ventures.
 As noted in the table in note 18(d), interest rate caps 
and swaps are used to provide protection against 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Directors have 
maintained a mix of fixed and variable rates, in order to 
provide an appropriate measure of certainty within the 
portfolio.
 Facilities with variable rates of interest, in particular 
longer-term facilities, expose the Group to the risk of 
interest rate fluctuation, whilst fixed rate instruments 
reduce flexibility and incur break costs in the event of 
early settlement. The Directors keep these risks under 
continual review, and regularly consider the possibility 
and likely cost of extending our interest rate hedging.
Interest rate swaps also carry counterparty risk, in 
Financial Review 40 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
Financial Review continued
Maximum credit risk exposure
The Directors consider that the maximum credit risk 
exposure in each class of financial asset is represented 
by the carrying value as at 29th February 2012.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out on pages 6 and 9, in the Chief 
Executive’s Statement on pages 4 and 5 and in the 
Operating Review on pages 22 and 23. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position, 
borrowing facilities and financial instrument risks are 
described in the Financial Review on pages 36 to 44, 
which also covers the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk. Note 18 to the financial 
statements gives further information about the Group’s 
financial instruments and hedging activities.
 The Group has considerable financial resources. The 
Directors maintain a risk-averse capital structure, with 
gearing ideally in the range of 50-60 per cent and long 
average debt maturities, with borrowings spread across a 
number of lenders. The Group continues to enjoy access 
to bank finance, as demonstrated by loans arranged 
during the period and further activity to date. Banking 
covenants are regularly monitored and appropriate cure 
mechanisms are incorporated in facility documents.
 The Directors are alert to potential liquidity risk in the 
Group’s cash flow forecast which, in the current phase of 
operations, includes significant uncertain sales income. 
The Directors keep both short- and medium-term cash 
flows under continual review, and moderate outflows 
according to the level of this uncertainty. The model 
preserves a cash buffer of £20.0 million at all times, 
to protect against delays in asset realisations.
 The Group’s rental income is also subject to risk of 
delay or non-payment, as demonstrated by the recent 
failure of Peacocks, at the time the Group’s second 
largest tenant by rental income. This risk is mitigated 
by proactive asset management, which includes close 
monitoring of tenant resilience, and a strong focus on 
actual and potential voids.
 As a consequence of the above, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well-placed to manage its business risks 
successfully, despite the continuing uncertain economic 
outlook. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Investment portfolio
The principal financial instrument risk in the investment 
portfolio is the credit risk implicit in potential tenant 
failure. The Group maintains the portfolio under 
continuous review. The portfolio is managed by local 
agents, with active involvement by the Group’s investment 
team. The Board receives at each of its meetings 
analyses of tenant profile (including the concentration 
of credit risk, both by sector and by entity), existing and 
anticipated voids, overdue rents, and future and 
outstanding rent reviews, as well as a formal commentary 
by the investment team. The current profile of the 
portfolio and comments on performance in the period 
are set out in the Operating Review on pages 1 1 to 31.
Projects in partnership
As described in the Operating Review, the Group 
conducts a number of projects in partnership with others, 
where the Group brings both development expertise and 
funding. These interests are carried in a number of 
balance sheet categories, and are summarised in note 27 
to the Group financial statements.
 The financial instrument risks in respect of projects in 
partnership are the financial strength and integrity of the 
operating partner, the contractual risk in the partnership 
arrangements and the operating success of the venture. 
The Group manages these risks by securing appropriate 
rights in each case over the use of the Group’s invested 
capital and by active participation in the joint strategic 
and operating control of the ventures.
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are described in note 24 to the 
Group financial statements. The Directors ensure that 
these risks are appropriately documented and monitored, 
and that the risk of actual liabilities arising is restricted so 
far as is possible.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s operations are conducted almost exclusively 
in the UK. The Group’s principal exposure to foreign 
currency movements is in the €47 million Euro- 
denominated loan notes, which is fully hedged to provide 
an effective Sterling liability. The details of the Group’s 
sensitivity to exchange rate movements are set out in 
note 18(c) to the Group financial statements. Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 41
Financial Review
final two stores. Bad debts in the investment portfolio 
were restricted to £0.1 million in the 14-month period, 
and our void rate as at 29th February was 1 1.4 per cent 
(including 1.6 per cent in respect of the Peacocks stores), 
compared with 8.0 per cent as at 31st December 2010.
 The Group also earned net rental income of £1.9 
million from the development and trading portfolio, 
equivalent to the amount generated in the prior year.
Development and trading profits
Profits from development and trading increased to 
£8.5 million from £5.5 million in the year ended 31st 
December 2010. The principal projects were the 
residential and retail sales at Westminster Palace 
Gardens, which contributed £2.4 million in the period, 
and seven disposals from the Rock portfolio, which 
produced profits of £3.8 million, together with £0.7 
million from the completion of the hotel at Southampton.
Operating costs
Operating costs of £14.8 million for the 14-month period 
were slightly below the equivalent figure of £12.9 million 
for the twelve months ended 31st December 2010. 
Within this total, staff costs were £8.8 million, equivalent 
to the prior year.
Exceptional impairment and provision for serviced 
office segment
The Group’s serviced office business has made operating 
losses for several periods, in very difficult market 
conditions. Aggressive price discounting by competitors 
over an extended period has forced the Group to accept 
lower occupancy levels and reduced licence fees. The 
business continues to make a positive contribution to its 
committed, fixed costs, but certain centres are expected 
to continue to generate losses into the future. 
Consequently the Directors have determined that the 
fixed assets of five of the seven centres are impaired, and 
have made provision of £1.6 million for such impairment. 
In addition, four of the centres are not expected to cover 
all of their committed rental costs, and a further provision 
of £1.2 million has been made in this regard, aggregating 
to an exceptional charge of £2.8 million.
Net finance costs
Finance costs for the 14-month period was £13.2 million, 
broadly equivalent to the corresponding amount for the 
prior year. However the total for 2010 included a cost of 
£0.8 million in respect of the termination of two interest 
rate swaps. The higher interest charge for the reporting 
period reflected higher average loan balances and an 
increased proportion of fixed rate loans.
Result for the period and movement 
in net asset value
Total comprehensive income for the 14 months ended 
29th February 2012 was a loss of £15.4 million (31st 
December 2010: £0.7 million loss). After dividend 
payments of £5.9 million and a change in minority 
interest of £1.4 million, net asset value reduced by £19.9 
million to £313.2 million (31st December 2010: £333.1 
million), representing a fall of 16.0 pence per share to 
256 pence per share (31st December 2010: 272 pence 
per share).
 The movement in net asset value may be analysed as 
follows. Excluding revaluation movements and the 
exceptional provision, profit before interest and taxation 
for the 14 months was £7.5 million (31st December 2010: 
£3.8 million). Net interest costs for the period were £10.1 
million (31st December 2010: £10.0 million), aggregating 
to a realised loss for the 14 months of £2.6 million, 
reduced from the 31st December 2010 figure of £6.2 
million loss. This result was increased by three fair value 
losses, being the exceptional provision in respect of the 
serviced office business of £2.8 million (31st December 
2010: £nil), property revaluations of £4.4 million (31st 
December 2010: credit of £8.5 million), and revaluations 
of swap instruments of £4.8 million (31st December 
2010: £2.8 million loss). Dividends paid were £5.9 million 
(31st December 2010: £3.9 million).
In the following analysis, all percentage movements are 
expressed after adjusting for the additional two months 
in the current reporting period.
Net rental income
Gross rental income from our investment portfolio 
increased to £16.9 million, compared with £12.8 million 
for the year ended 31st December 2010. Part of this 
increase reflected the inclusion of £1.3 million from 
Weeke Local Centre, Winchester, which in the prior year 
represented £1.1 million in the development and trading 
portfolio. Adjusting for the transfer of Winchester to the 
investment portfolio (and for the 14-month period), this 
represents an increase of 4.8 per cent over the prior year. 
The increase was achieved through rent from new 
acquisitions of £1.0 million. Direct costs were £3.7 
million, giving net rental income from the investment 
portfolio of £13.2 million, an increase of 1 1.4 per cent 
from 2010.
 Our annual rent from five Peacocks stores 
aggregated to £0.7 million. We suffered no loss of rent 
in the period, and are pleased to have retained the brand 
in the two largest stores, generating £0.2 million per 
annum. We have assigned one further lease of £0.1 
million per annum, and are in negotiations to re-let the  42 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
Financial Review continued
Finance costs include a charge of £0.5 million in respect 
of the fair value of interest rate swap instruments, as 
medium-term interest rates ended the period close to 
their lowest points, leaving our fixed rate hedging 
arrangements out of the money. In addition a similar 
charge of £4.3 million was included in Other 
comprehensive income, in respect of the interest leg 
of the currency and interest rate swap relating to the 
€47 million 2027 Unsecured Subordinated Loan Notes 
(see note 18(d)). 
Investment portfolio
The investment property portfolio increased from £199.2 
million at the beginning of the period to £237.9 million at 
29th February 2012. New acquisitions of £20.2 million 
include Colston Tower, Bristol at £7.6 million in June and, 
in November, the Chorlton Cross Shopping Centre at 
£9.0 million, along with the Vicus Building in Manchester 
at £1.5 million. Improvements of £3.2 million included 
works across a number of assets, notably £0.9 million 
in respect of Swanley Shopping Centre.
 The Directors have also transferred Weeke Local 
Centre, Winchester from the development and trading 
portfolio to the investment portfolio. The centre was 
developed for sale over 2008-2010, and letting of the 
final units was completed in 201 1. The Group has 
received a number of offers to sell the centre, but the 
Board has decided instead to retain the asset for its 
income and capital growth potential. The carrying value 
of the asset at time of transfer was £20.0 million, which, 
following further capital expenditure of £0.4 million, has 
been increased as at 29th February 2012 to its fair value 
of £21.4 million, in accordance with IAS 40.
 Further details of acquisitions, disposals and 
valuation movements are set out in note 10 to the 
financial statements, and further analyses of the 
management and performance of the portfolio are 
given in the Operating Review on pages 1 1 to 31.
Inventory – development and trading properties
We have now invested close to 90 per cent of the net 
proceeds of the equity raises in 2009 and 2010 in 
projects with potential for redevelopment. The following 
table analyses this investment between the principal 
balance sheet categories (with shares of assets held 
in partnership allocated to their relevant categories).

Whilst the investment properties are carried at fair value, 
the majority of our acquisitions are held as development 
and trading assets, which are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value, with no uplift recognised until 
the asset is sold. As set out in the Operating Review on 
pages 1 1 to 31, we are making progress with our plans 
for these assets, which, as indicated when we raised the 
new equity, we expect to take three to four years on 
average. To date we have sold assets with a gross purchase  
cost of £47.9 million, reporting profits of £9.7 million; the 
continuing projects represent circa £157.0 million of the 
Group’s inventory (including shares of assets in 
partnership) as at 29th February 2012. We anticipate 
that the rate of recycling these projects will accelerate 
in the years ending 28th February 2013 and 2014. 
 Inventory also includes some £42 million of “legacy” 
assets, whose original plans predate the market crisis of 
2008, and which were disrupted by that event. We are 
making good progress on several of these, notably 399 
Edgware Road, London NW9 (formerly known as 
Colindale), as described on page 24, which represents 
by some way the largest of these projects.
Associates and joint ventures
Reflecting our strategy of working with partners, 
investments in associates and joint ventures has 
increased during the period. The Group’s interests in 
projects in partnership are structured in several ways, 
resulting in a number of different accounting 
categorisations. Note 27 to the financial statements 
summarises the position.
 The current carrying values of associates and joint 
ventures are analysed in note 14. Notable additions to 
joint ventures in the period include a 24.0 per cent share 
of Notting Hill (Guernsey Holdco) Limited, which acquired 
the office and retail asset at Kensington Church Street, 
London for £47.5 million, with bank debt of £26.0 million; 
in addition we took a 50.0 per cent interest in Purplexed 
LLP, established to develop The Old Vinyl Factory, Hayes, 
which was acquired for £16.0 million, with bank debt of 
£9.1 million. Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 43
Financial Review
The Group’s share of joint ventures is reported at the net 
asset level, as prescribed by accounting standards. The 
net figure of £26.6 million includes shares of investment 
property of £23.1 million (stated at fair value), shares of 
inventory of £27.0 million (stated at lower of cost and net 
realisable value), and shares of bank debt of £26.8 
million (all figures excluding the Group’s share of Curzon 
Park Limited).
 The Group’s share of the net assets of Curzon Park 
Limited was written down to £nil in 2008. As at 29th 
February 2012, the Group has a debtor due from the joint 
venture of £5.0 million, held within Financial assets (note 
18(a)), and has provided a guarantee for its share of the 
joint venture’s bank loan of £15.6 million, as noted within 
contingent liabilities. The current status of the project is 
described in note 14(b).
Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are analysed 
in note 18 to the Group’s financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s Euro-denominated loan notes and the 
related cross-currency hedge are carried as separate 
instruments in the Balance Sheet. During the 14-months 
ended 29th February 2012, Sterling strengthened 
against the Euro, decreasing the Sterling liability of the 
loan by £1.0 million to £39.3 million, and reducing the fair 
value of the currency and interest rate swap by a similar 
amount. The continuing softening of long-term EURIBOR 
interest rates over the period caused a further reduction 
in the value of the instrument, such that its total fair value 
declined to a liability of £1.9 million as at 29th February 
2012, compared with an asset of £3.3 million at 31st 
December 2010. Other interest rate swaps were fair 
valued at a liability of £0.5 million.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets include the Group’s participation in 
the third phase of PaddingtonCentral, which has been 
revalued by the Directors at £5.0 million (unchanged 
from the previous year), together with loans to a number 
of joint operations and associate companies. During the 
period, the Group advanced a further £4.7 million to CTP, 
which, together with accrued interest of £1.3 million, took 
the total investment in the group to £21.5 million. The 
loan to Orion Shepherds Bush Limited in respect of 
Shepherds Bush was increased by £2.1 million to £2.5 
million. A further £0.7 million was lent to Cathedral Group 
in respect of The MVMT, Greenwich, taking the total to 
£2.2 million. As described in the Operating review on 
page 29, the loan to Barwood, which stood at £1.2 million 
as at 31st December 2010, was repaid during the period, 
and immediately reinvested in the new associate, 
Barwood Development Securities Limited.
Cash and borrowings
Details of the Group’s borrowings and cash management 
are set out in note 18(b) and (c) to the financial statements,  
and in the Financial Review on pages 36 to 44.

Share of net debt in joint ventures £m (31.5) (20.8)
Gearing including joint ventures % 58.9 27.7

The gross debt figure includes the €47 million 2027 
Unsecured Subordinated Loan Note facility, stated in 
Sterling at the current fair value of £39.3 million (31st 
December 2010: £40.3 million), and ignoring the hedging 
instrument. If these long-term loan notes are removed 
from borrowings, gearing falls to 40.1 per cent. This is 
calculated by deducting from net debt the current fair 
value of £39.3 million (31st December 2010: £40.3 
million) and adding back relevant restricted cash 
balances of £1 1.0 million (31st December 2010: 
£10.1 million) and transaction costs of £1.0 million 
(31st December 2010: £1.1 million).
Loan to value gearing
Net debt expressed as a proportion of total property 
assets, (including shares of properties and net debt 
in all projects in partnership), was 37.0 per cent.
Taxation
The net current tax charge in the Statement of 
comprehensive income was £0.8 million principally in 
respect of non-resident landlord income. The Group has 
significant potential deferred tax asset balances, but the 
Directors have restricted recognition to the amount of 
corresponding deferred tax liabilities, as uncertain 
market conditions do not offer sufficient probability 
of profits in the foreseeable future within the terms 
of IAS12. 44 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
Financial Review continued
Dividends
The Board will recommend to shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting on 28th August 2012 a final dividend of 
3.2 pence per share (2010: 2.4 pence per share) to be 
paid on 26th October 2012 to shareholders on the 
register on 28th September 2012. This final dividend, 
amounting to £3.9 million, has not been included as a 
liability at 29th February 2012, in accordance with IFRS. 
The total dividend for the 14-month period will be 5.6 
pence per share, equivalent to the rate of 4.8 pence per 
share for the year 2010.
(Loss)/earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share for the 14-month 
period represented a loss of 10.3 pence (31st December 
2010: earnings of 1.7 pence). After removing the 
unrealised revaluation of the investment portfolio and the 
gain on the disposal of trading properties and impairment 
of development and trading properties, the EPRA 
adjusted loss per share was 8.2 pence (31st December 
2010: loss of 1 1.8 pence).

schemes would normally vest or become exercisable 
subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions.

voluntarily offering themselves for re-election as a matter 
of best practice in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Following the performance evaluation 
of the Board, all Directors were judged to have made 
a significant contribution to the Board’s deliberations, 
reflecting their commitment to the role. The rules that

Report of the Directors continued
Ordinary Resolutions 3 to 9 – Election and Re-election 
of directors
N H Thomlinson has been appointed as a Director since 
last year’s Annual General Meeting. In accordance with 
the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, N H Thomlinson will retire at this year’s Annual 
General Meeting and Resolution 9 proposes his election. 
 The Directors seek to maintain the highest standards 
of corporate governance and in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, each of the other Directors will voluntarily retire 
and those wishing to serve again shall submit themselves 
for re-election by the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting. The Chairman is satisfied that, following 
individual formal performance evaluations, the 
performance of the Directors standing for re-election 
continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment 
to the role. Biographical details of all the Directors 
appear on page 45 of the Directors’ Report and 
financial statements.
Ordinary Resolution 10 – Declaration of a dividend
A final dividend can only be paid after the shareholders 
at a general meeting have approved it. A final dividend of 
3.2 pence per Ordinary share is recommended by the 
Directors for payment to shareholders who are on the 
register at the close of business on 28th September 2012.
Ordinary Resolutions 11 and 12 – Re-appointment 
and remuneration of auditor
Resolutions 1 1 and 12 propose the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Auditor of the 
Company and authorise the Directors to set their 
remuneration.
Special Resolution 13 – Authority to purchase 
own shares 
The Company is seeking authority to purchase up to 10.0 
per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
at, or between, the minimum and maximum prices 
specified in this resolution. The Directors have no 
present intention of making any market purchases of the 
Company’s shares, but if they believed such action would 
enhance net assets or earnings per share, they would 
consider exercising their authority. As at the date of this 
report, the Company has an unexpired authority to 
repurchase 12,235,250 Ordinary shares.
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Company is allowed 
to hold its own shares in treasury following a buyback, 
instead of cancelling them. Such shares may be resold 
for cash or used for the purpose of employee share 
schemes but all rights attaching to them, including voting 
rights and any right to receive dividends, are suspended 
whilst they are held in treasury. Accordingly, if the 
Directors exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 
13, the Company will have the option of holding these 
shares in treasury, rather than cancelling them. The 
authority sought at the Annual General Meeting will 
expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company or on 1st September 2013 
(being the latest date by which the Company must hold 
an Annual General Meeting in 2013).
Ordinary Resolution 14 – Allotment of shares 
The Directors may only allot Ordinary shares or grant 
rights over Ordinary shares if authorised to do so by 
shareholders. The Directors will be seeking new authority 
under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot 
Ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or to 
convert any security into Ordinary shares which will 
expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company or on 1st September 2013 
(being the latest date by which the Company must hold 
an Annual General Meeting in 2013). 
 If passed, paragraph (i) of Resolution 14 would give 
the Directors authority to allot Ordinary shares or grant 
rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, 
Ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£20,392,084 representing approximately one third 
(33.33 per cent) of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital and calculated as at 30th April 2012 (being the 
last practicable date prior to publication of the notice). In 
accordance with the latest institutional guidelines issued 
by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), paragraph (ii) 
of Resolution 14, if passed, would give the Directors 
authority to allot further Ordinary shares in connection 
with a pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue to 
shareholders up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£20,392,084, representing approximately one third 
(33.33 per cent) of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital and calculated as at 30th April 2012 (being the 
last practicable date prior to publication of the notice). As 
at 30th April 2012 (being the last practicable date prior 
to publication of the notice,) the Company held no shares 
in treasury. Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 49
Report of the Directors
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this 
authority. However, the Directors consider it desirable to 
have the maximum flexibility permitted by corporate 
governance guidelines to respond to market 
developments and to enable allotments to take place 
to finance business opportunities as they arise.
Special Resolution 15 – Disapplication of pre-emption 
rights
Under section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006, if the 
Directors wish to allot any shares and other relevant 
securities, or sell treasury shares for cash (other than in 
connection with an employee share scheme), they must 
in the first instance offer them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their holdings. The Directors seek authority 
to renew the disapplication of shareholders’ pre-emptive 
rights. The purpose of paragraph (i) of Resolution 15 is 
to authorise the Directors to allot any shares pursuant to 
the authority given by paragraph (i) of Resolution 14 for 
cash either (a) in connection with a pre-emptive offer or 
rights issue or (b) otherwise up to a nominal value of 
£3,058,812 (being equivalent to 5.0 per cent of the total 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 
30th April 2012 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to publication of the notice)), in each case without 
the shares first being offered to existing members 
in proportion to their existing holdings.
 The purpose of paragraph (ii) of Resolution 15 is to 
authorise the Directors to allot any shares pursuant to 
the authority given by paragraph (ii) of Resolution 14 for 
cash in connection with a rights issue without the shares 
first being offered to existing members in proportion to 
their existing holdings. This is in line with corporate 
governance guidelines issued by the Pre-emption Group. 
The Board considers the authority sought to be 
appropriate in order to allow the Company flexibility to 
finance business opportunities or to conduct a 
pre-emptive offer or rights issue without the need to 
comply with the strict requirements of the statutory 
pre-emption provisions. The Board intends to adhere to 
the provisions in the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of 
Principles not to allot shares on a non pre-emptive basis 
(other than pursuant to a rights issue or pre-emptive 
offer) in excess of an amount equal to 7.5 per cent of 
the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
within a rolling three year period without prior 
consultation with shareholders.
Special Resolution 16 – Notice period for general 
meetings
The Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 
increased the notice period for general meetings of a 
company to 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a 
shorter period, which cannot be less than 14 clear days.
 At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held 
on 27th May 201 1, shareholders authorised the calling of 
general meetings, other than an annual general meeting, 
on not less than 14 clear days’ notice. Resolution 16 
seeks the approval of shareholders to renew the 
authority to be able to call general meetings (other than 
an annual general meeting) on 14 clear days’ notice.
 The shorter notice period would not be used as a 
matter of routine for general meetings, but only where 
the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting 
and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as 
a whole. If the proposals at a given meeting are not time 
sensitive, the Company will not normally use the shorter 
notice period. The approval will be effective until the 
Company’s next annual general meeting, when it is 
expected that a similar resolution will be proposed. It 
should also be noted that the changes to the Companies 
Act 2006 mean that, in order to be able to call a general 
meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company 
must make a means of electronic voting available to all 
shareholders for that meeting.
Ordinary Resolution 17 – Political donations
Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006, amongst other 
things, prohibits the Company and its subsidiaries from 
making political donations or from incurring political 
expenditure in respect of a political party or other political 
organisation or an independent election candidate unless 
authorised by the Company's shareholders. Aggregate 
donations made by the Group of £5,000 or less in any 
twelve month period will be disregarded. 
 Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has 
any intention of making any political donation or incurring 
any political expenditure. However, the Companies Act 
2006 defines "political organisation", "political party", 
"political donation" and "political expenditure" widely. 
Accordingly, the Company wishes to ensure that neither it 
nor its subsidiaries inadvertently commits any breaches 
of the Companies Act 2006 through the undertaking of 
routine activities, which would not normally be considered 
to result in the making of political donations and political 
expenditure being incurred.  50 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
The Resolution authorises the Company and its 
subsidiaries to:
  make political donations to political parties or 
independent election candidates not exceeding 
£10,000 in total; 
  make political donations to political organisations, 
other than political parties not exceeding £10,000 
in total; and 
  incur political expenditure, not exceeding £10,000 
in total,
provided that the aggregate amount of any such 
donations and expenditure shall not exceed £10,000 
during the period beginning with the date of the passing 
of the Resolution and ending on the date of the 
Company's next Annual General Meeting.
 Full details of all the resolutions can be found 
in the enclosed Notice of Annual General Meeting, 
which is also displayed on the Company’s website at 
www.developmentsecurities.com
 The Directors believe that all the proposals to be 
considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best 
interests of both the Company and its shareholders. The 
Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour 
of the proposed resolutions as they intend to do in 
respect of their own holdings.

Corporate Governance
Development Securities 
PLC Ordinary shares are 
listed on the Official List of 
the UK Listing Authority 
and, as such, the Company 
is required to state whether 
it has complied with the 
provisions for corporate 
governance contained 
within the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The Board confirms that the Company has applied 
the main provisions and has complied with all of the 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) during the financial period under 
review. The full Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk.
 The Board is committed to maintaining high 
standards and levels of integrity within a corporate 
governance framework which underpins the ethos of the 
Company. Constructive dialogue has continued to be 
built up over the period between stakeholders and has 
strengthened investor confidence. The Company’s 
governance principles have been, and will continue to be, 
kept under review as the Directors believe that a sound 
corporate governance framework is key to achieving the 
Company’s objectives and discharging its legal and 
regulatory responsibilities.
 The Company’s going concern statement can be 
found in the Financial Review on pages 36 to 44 and 
is incorporated here by reference.
The Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the success of 
the Company and in this capacity has, over the financial 
period under review, dispensed independent judgement 
in relation to, but not limited to, strategy, executive 
performance and retention, remuneration and 
succession, financial performance, the issue of any 
securities, significant borrowing facilities, development 
opportunities, investment portfolio acquisitions and 
disposals, corporate reputation and communication, 
internal control and risk management and the Board’s 
own effectiveness. In carrying out its responsibilities, 
the Board takes into account the size and complexity 
of the Group, and internal control measures employed, 
to determine those formal matters reserved to the Board 
and those delegated to its various Committees or the 
Executive Directors.
 The Board met formally eight times during the period 
and held one meeting solely to consider the Group’s 
strategy. The Board also met on an ad hoc basis as 
required by the on-going business of the Company. The 
Chairman and the Non-executive Directors met on one 
occasion during the period with no Executive Directors 
in attendance.
 During the financial period under review, the Board 
consisted of four Executive Directors, a Non-executive 
Chairman and three Non-executive Directors, rising to 
four Non-executive Directors following the appointment 
of N H Thomlinson on 3rd January 2012. The 
independence of each Non-executive Director has been 
assessed during the period, in line with the independence 
criteria contained within provision B.1.1 of the Code. The 
Company considers all the Non-executive Directors to be 
independent. The Chairman was considered independent 
on appointment. The current ratio of Executive and 
independent Non-executive Directors is permissible 
for a smaller company under Code provision B.1.2. 
 V M Mitchell remained as Senior Independent 
Director for the whole period and is available as a point 
of contact for shareholders where normal channels 
of communication have failed, or are not appropriate.  
After V M Mitchell steps down at the Annual General 
Meeting on 28th August 2012, S C Bates will then take 
over the role.
 The Non-executive Directors provide a valued role 
by contributing to the decisions and challenging aspects 
of executive decisions to produce a considered and 
independent outcome to Board deliberations. There is a 
clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman, 
who is responsible for the running of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness and the Chief Executive, who 
is responsible for the running of the Company’s business. 
The roles and remit of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive are set out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
 Biographical information for the Directors in office 
at the date of this Report is on page 45.
 As in previous years, the Board has undertaken a 
formal performance evaluation of the Board as a whole 
and its Committees, to ensure they continue to be 
effective, and that individual Directors demonstrate 
commitment to his or her respective role and has 
sufficient time to meet his or her commitment to the  Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 53
Corporate Governance
Company. V M Mitchell chaired a meeting of the 
Non-executive Directors without the Chairman or 
Executive Directors present, at which, inter alia, the 
performance of the Chairman was reviewed on behalf 
of the Board. The outcome, which was completely 
satisfactory, was then discussed between the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director. The evaluation was 
conducted by means of a questionnaire which was 
co-ordinated and collated by the Company Secretary. 
The responses were considered by the Board and 
suggestions for improvements were discussed and 
where considered relevant, have been implemented.
 All Directors have access to the services of the 
Company Secretary and may seek independent 
professional advice as necessary, at the Company’s 
expense, and subject to the consent of the Chairman. 
Upon election, or re-election, Non-executives are invited 
to serve for three-year fixed terms, subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. All Non-executive Directors 
have confirmed that they have sufficient time to dedicate 
to their role. Their terms of appointment are available 
from the Company Secretary and details of the 
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are 
detailed in section 1k of the Remuneration Report on 
page 62. Directors undergo a formal induction process 
on joining the Company and receive appropriate training 
whilst in office. 
 The Board delegates responsibility for certain 
matters to Standing Committees, which report back to 
the Board. These Committees operate within defined 
terms of reference, as determined by the Board. 
Details are available upon request from the Company 
Secretary and are also published on the Company’s 
website, www.developmentsecurities.com. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to each of the Committees.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises S C Bates as Chair, 
V M Mitchell and D S Jenkins. As from 28th August 2012 
N H Thomlinson will become a member in place of 
V M Mitchell.
 The Company’s Chief Executive, Finance Director 
and Financial Controller, attend the Audit Committee 
meetings by invitation. The Committee also met without 
Executive Directors present and S C Bates, as Chairman 
of the Committee, met separately with the auditors and 
internal auditors.
 The Committee met four times during the period. 
A meeting was held to agree the terms of engagement, 
proposed approach and the fees of the annual audit. 
As is standard each year, two of the meetings take place 
prior to the issue of the preliminary full-year and interim 
results in order to consider any significant issues arising 
from the audit and review processes. The Board has 
determined that D S Jenkins as a qualified accountant 
with considerable experience has significant ‘recent 
and relevant financial experience’ for the purposes of 
the Code.
 It is within the Committee’s remit to recommend 
the appointment of the external auditors, advise on the 
Group’s accounting policies and monitor the treatment 
of areas of major judgement in the Group’s financial 
statements. Furthermore, it acts as a conduit between 
the Board and the external auditors and internal auditors.
 Apart from conducting the annual audit, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was also engaged during 
the period to conduct a review of the interim results to 
30th June 201 1 and provided tax advisory and planning 
services at a total cost of £298,000. 
 An analysis of the non-audit fees can be found in 
note 4 to the financial statements. The non-audit 
services policy as adopted by the Committee during the 
last financial year was adhered to throughout the period 
providing added control measures around the instruction 
of the auditors to undertake non-audit work. The policy 
requires that all non-audit fee work be reported to the 
Audit Committee, with certain categories and amounts 
to be approved by the Audit Committee Chairman in 
advance of any work being undertaken. In addition the 
policy prohibits the Auditors from being considered for 
providing the following services: Internal Audit; 
Bookkeeping services; and Design and implementation 
of financial information systems. Given the clear 
efficiencies and value-added benefits to the Company 
of combining the audit and certain consultancy roles, 
additional scrutiny was placed on the independence and 
objectivity of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Audit 
Committee was satisfied as to their independence 
and accordingly recommended their re-appointment 
as auditors. This was subsequently ratified by 
the Board and accordingly the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been the independent 
auditor of Development Securities PLC since 2008.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises D S Jenkins as 
Chairman, V M Mitchell and M H Marx. As from 28th 
August 2012, S C Bates will become a member in place 
of V M Mitchell. The Nomination Committee has reviewed 
the size, structure and composition of the Board and 
concluded that this is appropriate. The Committee 
devises and implements succession plans for  54 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
Corporate Governance continued
appointments to the Board, which are fulfilled through 
an effective search, interview and evaluation process 
based upon objective criteria. 
 The Nomination Committee meets as necessary. 
In the period under review it met three times; the first 
meeting discussed succession planning in respect of the 
two Non-executive Directors who will be stepping down 
after nine years of service on the Board. The second 
meeting was held to recommend to the Board the 
appointment of N H Thomlinson, which followed a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure conducted via 
an external search consultant. In recommending 
N H Thomlinson to the Board the Committee had given 
due consideration to the balance of skills and experience 
on the Board with proper regard to independence and 
diversity. The Committee, in conjunction with the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, also 
recommended N H Thomlinson’s appointment to the 
Remuneration Committee. 
 The Committee also met to discuss the re-election 
of Directors and recommend to the Board that, following 
shareholders’ approval at the 201 1 Annual General 
Meeting to allow changes to the Company’s Articles 
of Association to permit annual re-election of Directors, 
each Director, being eligible, should opt for annual 
election. The Board approved this recommendation and 
each Director, with the exception of V M Mitchell and 
M S Soames who will be stepping down and N H 
Thomlinson who will be seeking election, shall retire and 
seek re-election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting in line with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises M S Soames 
as Chairman, V M Mitchell and D S Jenkins. 
N H Thomlinson was appointed as an additional member 
with effect from 19th January 2012 and will become 
Chairman from the Annual General Meeting on 28th 
August 2012 when M S Soames steps down. As from 
28th August 2012, S C Bates will become a member 
in place of V M Mitchell. 
 The Committee is authorised to determine 
remuneration policy, details of which can be found in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 64.
 The policy includes the setting of Executive Directors 
base salaries, the exercise of powers to grant options 
under the Group’s option schemes to the Executive 
Directors and senior managers and awards under the 
Performance Share Plan. In addition the policy specifies 
the framework for determining the annual bonus, awards 
under the Development Profit Plan, Joint Venture Profit 
Plan, Strategic Profit Plan, the Investment Growth Plan 
and ad hoc bonuses for exceptional contributions.
Approvals Committee
The Approvals Committee comprises two Executive 
Directors and a minimum of two Non-executive Directors. 
Its remit is to permit the approval of transactions between 
£2.0 million and £5.0 million, which are then reported to 
the Board. Transactions below £2.0 million are delegated 
to the relevant Executive Directors responsible and those 
above £5.0 million are under the remit of the Board.

Directors at the meetings of the Board, and the Audit,

Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is a high priority for  
the Board. The Executive Directors have regular dialogue 
with institutional shareholders. The Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and Non-executive Directors are 
available at any time to meet with them. No shareholders 
asked to meet with V M Mitchell, the Senior Independent 
Director during the period. The Company’s Annual  
General Meeting provides an opportunity to respond to 
shareholders’ appropriate questions, and the information 
necessary for informed participation is made available  
with as much notice as possible. Directors are  
introduced to shareholders at the Annual General  
Meeting, including the identification of Non-executives  
and Committee Chairperson. The Company’s website  
www.developmentsecurities.com is updated at the same time 
as the Regulated Information Service, to provide additional 
information dissemination for shareholders. Shareholders 
are also invited to free subscription of the Company’s 
e-mail news alert service on the Company’s website.  Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 55
Corporate Governance
Internal control
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investments 
and protect the Company’s assets. The Directors 
acknowledge that they are responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the significant risks the 
Company is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives. The operational, financial and compliance risk 
controls are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Board has 
conducted a thorough risk assessment of the business, 
identifying risks, their potential impact, likelihood of 
occurrence, controls and mitigating actions, together with 
early warning systems and further actions which need to 
be implemented.
 Detailed below is a description of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management used in the process of 
preparing the Consolidated financial statements.
 The regular process of identifying, evaluating and 
managing significant corporate risks has been delegated 
by the Board to a Risk Committee, consisting of M H 
Marx as Chairman, C J Barwick, M S Weiner, G Prothero 
and two senior managers, R C McCubbine and D A K 
Trench. During the period there has been at least one 
Non-executive Director in attendance at meetings of the 
Risk Committee.
 The Committee meets quarterly during the year to 
ensure that the Group’s risk management procedures are 
comprehensive and appropriate for the current economic 
climate, regulatory requirements and business 
operations. The Committee’s remit includes all of the 
Group’s subsidiaries and those joint ventures and 
associates which are administered by the Company. 
Risks arising from externally managed joint ventures are 
managed at the boards of the joint venture companies. 
In view of the increased number and complexity of these 
joint ventures the Risk Committee is in the process of 
deliberating the best strategy to identify, monitor and 
mitigate the risks arising out of these joint ventures in 
respect of the Group’s exposure. The minutes of the 
Committee’s deliberations are reviewed by the Board. 
In addition to the activities of the Risk Committee, a risk 
evaluation on each significant prospective development, 
investment or joint venture opportunity is evaluated by 
the Board, and for development opportunities, the risks 
are evaluated by an internal independent Project Review 
Committee. The Executive Directors regularly evaluate 
the Group’s risk-weighted development exposure, which 
is then considered by the Board. All necessary actions 
have been or are being taken to remedy any weaknesses 
acknowledged from the quarterly reviews. No significant 
failings were identified over the period.
 A ‘whistleblowing policy’ has been prepared and 
issued to all staff in the Group, outlining arrangements 
by which they may, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting 
or other issues.
 HW Fisher & Company were appointed as the 
Company’s internal auditors in 2010. In this capacity HW 
Fisher & Company report to the Audit Committee. They 
attend meetings of the Risk Committee, and from these 
meetings, and discussions with management, they 
identify areas of potential weakness or improvement in 
the Group’s financial controls. They propose an agenda 
of work to the Audit Committee, at least annually, and 
devise and implement appropriate work programmes, 
independently of management.
 The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control for the 
period ended 29th February 2012 and to the date of this 
report, and considers that there is a sound system of 
internal control which accords with the Turnbull Report, 
Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code. The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
Group’s significant risks including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and that it is regularly reviewed. 
Takeover Directive 
Details of the required disclosure under the Takeover 
Directive can be found in the Directors’ Report on pages 
46 to 51 and the Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 
64 and are incorporated herein by cross reference. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
 Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under this 
law, the Directors have prepared the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union, and the Parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the  56 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group for the period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
  state whether IFRSs, as adopted by the European 
Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards, 
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Group and Parent 
company financial statements respectively; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Corporate Governance continued
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
 Each of the Directors, whose names and functions 
are listed in the Remuneration Report confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
  the Group financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and loss of the Group; and
  the Report of the Directors incorporating the Summary 
page, the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s 
Statement, the Business Model, Operating Review, 
Financial Review, Summary of Principal Risks, 
Corporate Responsibility and Board of Directors 
includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.

Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder 
The salaries for the Executive Directors have been kept at the 2010 levels, 
with the exception of M S Weiner who was awarded a 4.6 per cent increase 
to reflect his increased role within the business. 
During 2009 the Committee undertook a substantive review of its executive 
remuneration arrangements, to take account of the changing economic 
climate and to provide a framework of remuneration for the future property 
cycle. This was to ensure that arrangements would support the Company’s 
strategy as it moved forward into the next stage of its development at the 
start of the next UK commercial property cycle. 
The Committee monitors the remuneration policy on an on-going basis to 
ensure that it supports the business strategy and takes into account the views 
of shareholders and the evolving executive pay governance environment.
The focused profit plans relating to the principal activities of the Company 
(development, investment and joint ventures) continue to be a key part of our 
performance based pay arrangements, alongside the annual bonus and the 
Performance Share Plan, which are considered to be sufficiently stretching 
for Executive Directors and senior management and to promote the 
long-term success of the Company.
The Development Profit Plan (section c) has resulted in bonuses being paid 
to C J Barwick and a senior manager for the successful completion of the 
hotel development at Southampton. New Development Profit Plan awards 
have been made to two Directors and senior managers.
New Joint Venture Profit Plan awards have been made during the period. 
The Committee has also reviewed the awards for the Strategic Profit Plan 
for the financial period (sections d and f).
The Investment Growth Plan (section e) resulted in a nil vesting as 
performance conditions were not satisfied for the 2012 Initial Bonus. The 
performance condition in respect of the 2009 deferred award was satisfied, 
resulting in payments to M S Weiner and two senior managers. 
Awards under the Performance Share Plan were made on 22nd March 201 1 
to the Executive Directors and staff. An assessment of the performance 
condition for the award made under the Plan on 8th May 2009 resulted 
in a nil vesting. 
A resolution will be proposed to the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting seeking their approval of this report. 
This is my last year as Chairman of the Committee as I will be stepping down 
at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. N H Thomlinson, who joined the Board 
in January 2012, will be succeeding me in this role. It remains for me to 
thank my fellow Committee members and shareholders for their valued 
contributions during my time as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
I am certain the Remuneration Committee is well placed to support the 
Company in the future.
Michael Soames 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee 
1st May 2012
I am pleased to introduce the Remuneration 
Report for the financial period ended  
29th February 2012. 
The Remuneration Report has been divided into three parts:
  Overview – summary of the total remuneration policy; 
  Remuneration explained – disclosures on Executive Directors’ and senior 
managers’ pay, outlining the incentive plans; and
  Remuneration in detail – detailed audited disclosures which are required 
by the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations. 
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for determining 
the remuneration policy for the Company’s Executive Directors and for 
ensuring that the remuneration of senior managers and other employees is 
consistent with the Company’s remuneration philosophy. The Committee has 
considered the performance of the Company over the period, the impact of 
the strategy set previously and the strategy for future years. The Committee, 
in light of the economic environment and current property market, has sought 
to reinforce the Company’s objectives through the implementation of the 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2010, together with the 
amendments to the existing policies made during the period. The Company 
has complied throughout the period with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in relation to Directors’ remuneration. 
The Committee has taken into account that, whilst the result for the year is a 
loss, the strategy of investing the monies received in the two equity raises is 
now largely complete and the execution of the individual business plans for 
each of the properties is well advanced and is on track to deliver the 
predicted profits. In considering the performance of the Company’s senior 
management team the Committee was of the view that this is not the year 
for higher level performance packages when the full implementation of the 
strategy has yet to deliver profits for the Company and its shareholders.
In this time of heightened scrutiny of executive remuneration, as the 
Committee Chairman, I have been in regular contact with the Company’s 
largest shareholders to discuss the current policy and ensure that their views 
are appropriately reflected in any changes. The Committee continues to 
believe that the current policy, together with the recent changes, supports the 
needs of the business and its shareholders.
The changes are described in greater detail later in the report but can be 
summarised as follows:
  in future years 100.0 per cent of any annual bonus awarded in excess of 
Target will be in the form of shares which will be held for a minimum of 
two years; 
  the performance condition for the Performance Share Plan is to be widened 
to take into account not only Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
but also growth in Net Asset Value per share (NAVps); and 
  a further shareholding requirement will apply where a Director’s 
shareholding is less than two times salary. In the event that payments under 
the focused profit plans, in aggregate, exceed £1.0 million in one financial 
year, two thirds of the payment above £1.0 million will be made in shares 
which must be retained for two years. Overview and remuneration explained
Overview 
The key objectives of the Company’s Remuneration Policy are as follows:
  to ensure that Executive Directors and senior managers are rewarded in 
a way that attracts, retains, motivates and rewards management of the 
highest quality;
  to operate focused profit plans and share schemes designed to encourage 
Executive Directors and senior managers to align their long-term career 
aspirations with the long-term interests of the Company and shareholders’ 
expectations;
  to promote the attainment of both individual and corporate achievements, 
measured against performance criteria required to deliver long-term growth 
and sustainability of the business; and
  to encourage sustained performance over the medium- and long-term.
The total pay framework is based on a mixture of fixed and variable elements 
considered on a meritocratic basis at individual and Group level, taking into 
account the remuneration awarded to employees in the Group.
The balance between fixed and variable pay is considered appropriate, given 
that the various incentive plans/schemes ensure a significant proportion 
of a key individual’s remuneration package is performance related, thereby 
correlating with the strategic aims of the business and the performance of 
the Company.
Role and constitution of the Committee
The Committee’s full terms of reference are set out on the Company’s 
website www.developmentsecurities.com. Its principal role is to determine 
the total remuneration of the Executive Directors and to ensure that senior 
management remuneration is consistent with corporate policy. In addition 
to the support of the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary, the 
Committee sought professional advice from external remuneration 
consultants Deloitte LLP and legal support from Linklaters LLP. 
Representatives of Deloitte LLP attended two meetings of the Committee by 
invitation. Deloitte LLP currently undertakes the audit of the Development 
Securities Retirement Benefit Scheme of which the Company is Trustee, but 
otherwise undertakes no other work for the Company. Linklaters LLP are 
also the Group’s principal legal advisor.

The numbers in brackets represent the maximum number of meetings that a Director could attend 
during the period 1st January 2011 to 29th February 2012.
Following the Board evaluation process the effectiveness of the Committee 
was reviewed and the Committee was considered to be operating effectively. 
No member has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided.
Remuneration explained
a)  Salary
The salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed each year and are 
determined by reference to individual performance and in relation to 
comparable companies in the same business sector. The Committee carefully 
considered the level of the base salaries payable to the Executive Directors 
and has determined that the base salaries for Executive Directors should 
remain at last year’s levels and the year prior to that, with the exception of 
M S  Weiner, who was awarded a salary increase to £340,000 per annum 
with effect from 1st January 2012. This recognises his increased role within 
the business.
The Committee considers the salary increases of Executive Directors at the 
same time as increases proposed for all employees within the Company. 
It applies the same criteria to Executive Directors as are applied to all 
employees, taking account of any changes to roles as well as relevant market 
movements. For the financial period ending 29th February 2012 the zero 
increase that was applied for the Executive Directors, excluding M S Weiner, 
was substantially below the average increases awarded to employees across 
the Company.

b)  Annual bonus 
The non-pensionable annual bonus is based on the performance of the 
Company during the period, team achievements and the specific contribution 
of the individuals concerned. With the exception of M H Marx, Executive 
Directors are set a target bonus of 37.5 per cent of salary and an above 
target maximum of 75.0 per cent. As M H Marx does not normally qualify for 
awards under the Development Profit Plan, Joint Venture Profit Plan and 
Investment Growth Plan described below, his target bonus is 75.0 per cent 
of salary, with a maximum of 150.0 per cent. 
The Committee has always taken a somewhat different approach to the annual 
bonus compared to our competitors, in that the annual bonus has never been 
formulaically driven by the annual financial results but reflects a true measure 
of annual performance in the context of the length of the property cycle. 
The annual bonus in respect of the Executive Directors is determined 
principally by the four main drivers for the creation of shareholder value in our 
business: namely, accurate reading of the economic and market cycles in which 
we operate, the pipeline of future development projects, active management of 
the investment portfolio and the maintenance of the standards of excellence 
that are embedded within the Company’s corporate culture.
The Committee considered that although management had delivered an 
exceptional period in laying the ground work for future success, the 
performance of the Company in the financial period did not warrant bonus 
awards at Target. The following bonus awards were made in respect of the 
financial period ended 29th February 2012.

G Prothero 60.9 170 21 70
From 1st March 2012, 100.0 per cent of any annual bonus awarded which is 
above Target will be paid in shares which the recipient must hold for at least 
two years. 
c)  Development Profit Plan 
The Development Profit Plan seeks to reward and incentivise those Directors 
and senior managers that have brought successful development 
opportunities to the Company. 
Not all developments are eligible for an award; the following criteria must 
be met before an award can be made: 
1) The development must be unconditional; and
2)  (i) The development must be expected to exceed £2.0 million profit; or is 
(ii) A multi-phased development where the first phase is expected to 
exceed £2.0 million profit. 
Awards are based on a percentage of the bonus pool which becomes payable 
only once the development has achieved realised profits. The maximum 
bonus pool available for distribution is 10.0 per cent of the realised profit for 
each development. This is calculated once a notional cost of equity of 
12.5 per cent is deducted, so that the pool generated only relates to profits 
over and above a threshold equity return.
The Committee reserves the right to award 80.0 per cent of the prospective 
bonus pool prior to completion, subject to profit realisation. When the 
development completes and the profit has been realised, the remaining 
unallocated 20.0 per cent of the bonus pool is assessed to take into 
consideration any additional Directors and senior managers who were 
instrumental during the life of the development. If no other participants are 
identified then the 20.0 per cent is allocated pro-rata to those participants 
already in receipt of an award.
In awarding annual bonuses and awards under the Development Profit Plan, 
there is no ‘double-counting’. The contribution of any team and individual 
performance, which leads to awards under the Development Profit Plan, 
are disregarded in assessing the annual bonus. 
The principal awards, that are outstanding for Executive Directors are 
as follows:

Remuneration Report continued
The award is remitted following the end of the financial year when the 
award is determined, with an equivalent amount representing a Deferred 
Bonus assessed two years thereafter, provided that during the intervening 
period the total investment portfolio return exceeds a specified proportion 
of the Index. 
The performance condition in respect of the financial period has not been 
satisfied, and therefore does not give rise to an Initial Bonus. The Deferred 
Bonus from the 2009 financial year has satisfied the additional condition, 
resulting in a remittance of £249,074 to M S Weiner.
f)  Strategic Profit Plan 
The Strategic Profit Plan was approved by shareholders in 2010. The Plan 
is an incentive scheme designed to incentivise all Executive Directors and 
senior management in all the principal activities of the Group, namely 
development, joint ventures and the investment portfolio. The Plan introduces 
a Group-wide collegiate aspect to rewarding success, and supporting 
co-operation as our executives deliver on the significant opportunities that 
exist in our portfolio and across our market. 
The bonus pool available for distribution represents an additional 4.0 per cent 
of the profits achieved (as adjusted) which count towards the maximum 
amount under both the Development Profit Plan and Joint Venture Profit Plan 
for that financial year and 2.0 per cent of each of the Initial Bonus and 
Deferred Bonus pools achieved under the Investment Growth Plan. Awards 
are made to individuals at the discretion of the Committee. In doing so, the 
Committee takes into account whether individuals are already eligible for 
awards under the Development Profit Plan, Joint Venture Profit Plan and 
Investment Growth Plan. As a guideline, 75.0 per cent of the bonus pool 
would be allocated to the Executive Directors and 25.0 per cent to senior 
management. 
Awards will be subject to a risk underpin such that the Committee must be 
satisfied that performance has not been achieved as a result of inappropriate 
financial risk (e.g. very high levels of gearing), and that the level of financial 
and business risk is in line with the Company’s stated strategy. In making 
awards to individuals, the Committee will also take into account the overall 
performance of the Company.
No awards have been approved under the Strategic Profit Plan in respect 
of the period ended 29th February 2012.
g)  Performance Share Plan 
Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made on the basis that shares 
will be acquired subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a 
three year period, with no retesting. For awards made prior to 29th February 
2012 performance is measured by comparing the Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) achieved by the Company with the individual constituent members 
of the FTSE Real Estate Investment Trust Index and the FTSE Real Estate 
Investment Services Index. There is a sliding scale of vesting as follows:
(i)  25.0 per cent of the award will vest if the Company’s TSR equals the 
median TSR of the comparator group; 
(ii) 100.0 per cent of the award will vest if the Company’s TSR equals 
or exceeds the 85th percentile TSR of the comparator group; and
(iii)  pro-rata vesting will apply in between the above points. 
Additional awards under the Development Profit Plan have been made 
to senior managers.
Following practical completion of the hotel development at Southampton, 
C J Barwick received £50,634 from maturity of his Development Profit 
Plan award. 
During the period M H Marx waived his entitlements to receive awards under 
the Development Profit Plan and reaffirmed his intention of not participating 
in any future awards under the Plan. 
In addition to making awards under the Development Profit Plan for securing 
development opportunities, the Remuneration Committee retains the 
discretion to award bonuses to Executive Directors and other senior managers 
at any time for making an exceptional contribution towards the Company. 
Such awards will not be applied in securing any corporate acquisitions. 
d)  Joint Venture Profit Plan 
The Committee reserves the right to make awards under the Joint Venture 
Profit Plan to Executive Directors and other senior managers who have been 
instrumental in securing profits generated from joint ventures.
Awards are made when joint ventures are likely to produce a total profit in any 
one year of more than £2.0 million. No more than 10.0 per cent of this profit 
is awarded in total. This is calculated once a notional cost of equity of 12.5 
per cent is deducted, so that the pool generated only relates to profits over 
and above a threshold equity return. In any given year, the Committee 
determines which individuals should receive awards and the amount of 
the award for each of the joint ventures for the following year.
In assessing the profit from each joint venture, all profits remitted during the 
period on successful projects are cumulated and all projects which have 
either crystallised or are forecast to make a loss are deducted. Any actual 
profits/losses realised in subsequent years will be rationalised against 
forecast losses already taken into account.
In awarding annual bonuses, there is no ‘double-counting’. The contribution 
of any team and individual performance which leads to awards under the 
Joint Venture Profit Plan is disregarded in assessing the annual bonus.
No bonus payments have been made to Executive Directors during the period 
in respect of previous awards. Awards for joint ventures have been made to 
an Executive Director and a senior manager for the next financial year.
e)  Investment Growth Plan 
The Committee reserves the right to award bonuses under the Investment 
Growth Plan. The performance condition under the award is that the total 
investment portfolio return must exceed 120.0 per cent of the All-Fund 
Universe Index return as published by the Investment Property Databank, 
if the Index return is greater than zero, or at least 0.1 per cent, if the Index is 
less than or equal to zero and, in addition, represents at least one percentage 
point above the total return under the index. The total investment portfolio 
return represents the sum of income return, net of irrecoverable property 
expenses, together with capital growth. 
The Initial Bonus represents a bonus pool of 5.0 per cent of the value 
determined by the excess of the total investment portfolio return over the 
benchmark index, up to a cap of £1.0 million, unless otherwise determined.  Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 61
Remuneration Report
In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained 
improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance over the 
performance period (typically by considering the change in net asset value). 
For awards from 2010, a risk underpin (as previously described) will also apply. 
On 22nd March 201 1, awards were made under the Performance Share Plan 
to M H Marx of 130,862 shares in the Company, representing 75.0 per cent 
of salary, and to C J Barwick, M S Weiner and G Prothero of 70,883 shares, 
each representing 50.0 per cent of salary. In total, 624,508 shares were, 
at the discretion of the Committee, awarded to 33 employees and the four 
Executive Directors. 
Following feedback from shareholders the Committee determined that for 
the 2012 award a wider range of performance measures should be used. 
The performance condition for the 2012 award will be as follows:
Performance measure
Proportion 
of the 
award (%)
Threshold 
vesting 
(25%)
Maximum 
v e s t i n g  
(100%)
Relative TSR against the constituents 
of the FTSE Real Estate Investment 
Trust Index and the FTSE Real Estate 
Investment Services Index 50% Median
85th 
Percentile
NAV per share growth 50%
RPI+3% 
per annum
RPI+10% 
per annum
Pro-rating vesting will apply between points. The underpins described above 
will also apply.
The performance condition under the award made on 8th May 2009 has 
now been assessed and the award did not vest.
Historical Total Shareholder Return Performance
The graphs demonstrate the Company’s TSR performance over five financial 
periods as represented by share price growth plus reinvested dividends, 
against both the FTSE Real Estate Investment Trust Index and the FTSE Real 
Estate Investment Services Index. The FTSE All Share Real Estate Index 
used in previous years has ceased to be published and, having reviewed the 
constituents of the previous index, it is considered that the constituents of 
these two indices are the most appropriate for comparison of the Company’s 
business performance against that of its competitors. The Company is a 
constituent of the FTSE Real Estate Investment Services Index, but a number 
of constituents of the FTSE Real Estate Investment Trust Index are also 
considered as within the Company’s peer group.
h)  Option Scheme 1993 
The Option Scheme 1993 is a share based bonus scheme approved by 
shareholders in that year. It allows individuals to benefit from movements in 
the price of the Company’s shares over the period between the third and 
tenth year following grant. The Directors may at the date of grant limit the 
aggregate notional bonus which may become payable. 
No new grants have been made during the period and none are currently 
outstanding.
i)  Share option schemes 
The Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 was approved by shareholders in 
that year. This was replaced by the Executive Share Option Plan 2005 which 
was approved by the shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting on 
12th May 2005. The options under both schemes were granted on the basis 
that they may only be exercised if a performance condition is satisfied. 
No share options were granted during the period.
The performance condition for those options outstanding is to measure the 
average net asset growth of the Company over three consecutive financial 
years against the growth in the Investment Property Databank Index (All 
Property). The options will vest on a sliding scale with 50.0 per cent if average 
net asset growth is at least equal to that of the Index, 100.0 per cent if in 
excess of the Index by 4.0 per cent per annum and pro-rata vesting in 
between. The performance condition will not be retested after the end of the 
performance period. The performance condition is considered appropriate as 
the Index measures against the Company’s added value. 
It is the intention of the Committee that no further grants be made to 
Executive Directors unless in exceptional circumstances, for example, a new 
appointment or an acute retention requirement. Grants to senior managers 
may continue in the future as appropriate. 
Following the declaration of a 28.5 pence special dividend on 19th February 
2003, the Committee resolved that option holders may receive, upon exercise 
of those options then outstanding, a cash bonus equivalent to the special 
dividend as equitable compensation.
j)  Savings Related Option Scheme 
The Save As You Earn Option Plan 2005 was approved by shareholders at 
the 2005 Annual General Meeting. The fourth grant under the plan was made 
on 24th October 201 1 for a total of 193,205 options over shares at 152.0 
pence per share to 45 employees, including M H Marx, G Prothero and M S 
Weiner for options over 5,921 shares each. The Option Plan was open to all 
employees who had been employed by the Group in excess of one month. 
The options may be exercised after three years at a price not less than 80.0 
per cent of the market value of the shares at the time of invitation.

General Meeting.
The fees of the Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board 
within the aggregate limit set by the Articles of Association. No Director 
participates in any discussion about their own remuneration. The fees of 
the Non-executive Directors were reviewed by the Board with effect from 
1st October 2010 based on advice received from the Company’s 
remuneration consultants, Deloitte LLP. There has been no change in the 
fees of the Non-executive Directors. Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in the Company’s share option schemes, Performance Share 
Plan or pension scheme.

Executive Directors to have received any external non-executive directorship 
fees during the year were M H Marx, who received £35,000 per annum from 
Nationwide Accident Repair Services PLC and C J Barwick, who received 
£45,000 per annum from London & Continental Railways Limited. Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 63
Remuneration Report
l) Retirement benefits 
Qualifying members of staff are invited to join the Development Securities 
Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is a contracted-in money purchase 
scheme, including appropriate life assurance. Since the Company’s policy is 
to render pension payments on a defined contribution basis, this avoids the 
uncertainty of pension liabilities to the Company, which would be the case 
had a defined benefit scheme been adopted. M H Marx and G Prothero have 
separate personal pension arrangements, whilst C J Barwick and M S Weiner 
are members of the Company scheme. The maximum contributions by the 
Company towards the approved Company scheme and any alternative 
arrangements may not exceed a total of 17.5 per cent of salary.
m) Executive Directors’ shareholding requirement 
Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding requirement of one half of 
basic salary within two years of appointment, rising to an amount equivalent 
to one times basic salary after four years. M H Marx, C J Barwick and M S 
Weiner have all met the amount equivalent to basic salary, with G Prothero 
yet to reach this level. 
From 1st March 2012, the Company will operate an additional shareholding 
requirement, which will operate where significant success is achieved and 
rewarded via the Company’s focused profit plans. Where payments under the 
Development Profit Plan, Joint Venture Profit Plan, Investment Growth Plan 
and Strategic Profit Plan, in aggregate, exceed £1.0 million in one financial 
year, two thirds of the payment above £1.0 million will be made in shares.  
This will apply if the Director’s shareholdings are less than two times salary. 
The amount paid in shares will be subject to a two year retention period.  
The interests of the Directors, all of which were beneficial, in the share capital 
of the Company, were:

1st May 2012
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Development 
Securities PLC 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Development Securities 
PLC for the 14-month period ended 29th February 2012 which comprise 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out 
on pages 55 and 56, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 29th 
February 2012 and of its loss and cash flows for the 14-month period 
then ended; 
  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.

revaluation of investment property, operating property, available-for-sale 
financial assets and derivative instruments at fair value.
c) Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make 
judgements, assumptions and estimates that affect the application of 
accounting policies and amounts reported in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and the Balance Sheet. Such decisions are made 
at the time the financial statements are prepared and adopted based on the 
best information available at the time. Actual outcomes may be different 
from initial estimates and are reflected in the financial statements as soon 
as they become apparent.
Judgements other than estimates
1.1 Classification of directly owned property assets
The Group earns revenue from property development, trading and 
investment, and from operating serviced offices.
Property development includes the entire development process from 
identification of an opportunity through to construction, letting and sale 
of a completed scheme. This activity is undertaken both on the Group’s own 
Balance Sheet and in partnership with institutional investors, usually via a 
pre-sale of the completed development. 
Property trading refers to participation in the development process, where 
the Group acquires an interest in land and enhances the potential 
development, for instance by procuring or changing planning permission, 
before selling on to a third party to complete the development. 
Property investment represents the acquisition of income-generating real 
estate which is held for the purposes of income and capital gain, through 
active asset management. 
In most cases the property interest is held directly by the Group and is 
classified either as investment property (see note 10) or as inventory for 
development and trading properties (see note 15). 
The varied nature of the Group’s properties is such that a number exhibit 
characteristics consistent with more than one classification; also the 
Directors’ strategy for an asset may change during its ownership. The 
Directors determine the status of each asset according to their intention 
on acquisition. A change in classification is made only in exceptional 
circumstances, where the strategy has demonstrably changed for a period 
of over one year. An example has arisen in the current period, in the transfer 
of the Weeke Local Centre, Winchester, from our development and trading 
portfolio to our investment portfolio, as explained in note 10. 
1.2 Classification of projects in partnership
In addition to its directly owned and managed activities, the Group 
participates in similar activities in partnership with others, typically to access 
expertise in different locations or market sectors. The Group’s financial 
participation may be by way of equity investment or loan. In each case a 
judgement is required as to the status of the Group’s interest, as an 
associate, a joint venture or a financial asset, typically focusing on the extent 
of control exercised by the Group. 
The Group’s share of control is governed and achieved by a mixture of rights 
set out in agreements and participation in the management of each 
business. The exercise of control in practice does not always follow the legal 
structure. The Directors have considered the position in respect of each 
venture, taking account of the operation in practice, and have determined 
the status of each accordingly. 
These investments are reported under the relevant balance sheet headings, 
with a summary in note 27.
The IASB has recently issued IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
and IFRS 1 1 ‘Joint Arrangements’, which (when adopted by the European 
Union) will amend and clarify the guidance in this area, and is likely to result 
in some changes to the current classification. The Directors are conducting 
a detailed review of the new standards and their application to the Group’s 
arrangements. Any changes in accounting policies or classifications will 
be implemented according to the timetable for adoption, which has yet to 
be confirmed.
1.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries
The Group sometimes acquires properties through the purchase of entities 
which own real estate. At the time of acquisition the Group considers 
whether the transaction represents the acquisition of a business. In cases 
where the entity is capable of being operated as a business, or an integrated 
set of activities is acquired in addition to the property, the Group accounts 
for the acquisition as a business combination. When the acquisition does not 
represent a business, it is accounted for as the purchase of a group of 
assets and liabilities. In making this distinction, the Group considers the 
number of items of land and buildings owned by the entity, the extent of 
ancillary services provided by the entity, and whether the entity has its own  Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 71
Financial Statements
staff to manage the property (over and above the maintenance and security 
of the premises).
1.4 Accounting for pre-sold development assets
Where development is undertaken on the Group’s Balance Sheet under a 
contract for a pre-sale, a judgement is required as to whether this represents 
a sale of property or a contract for construction as described in note 1(h)(vi). 
The refurbishment of the residential units at Westminster Palace Gardens 
and the hotel development at West Quay, Southampton are characterised as 
construction contracts (under IAS 1 1), whereby revenue is reported in line 
with construction progress. The amounts concerned are set out in note 3.
Estimates
1.5 Valuation of property assets
The key source of estimation uncertainty rests in the values of property 
assets, which affects several categories of asset in the Balance Sheet. 
The investment property portfolio (and the operating property) are stated 
at fair value, which requires a number of judgements and estimates in 
assessing the qualities of the Group’s assets relative to market transactions. 
The approach to this valuation and the amounts affected are set out in notes 
1(i), 10 and 1 1. In determining fair value, the capitalisation of net income 
method and the discounting of future cash flows to their present value have 
been used, which are based upon assumptions including future rental income, 
anticipated maintenance costs and appropriate discount rate, and make 
reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
The same uncertainties affect the determination of fair value of certain 
available-for-sale financial instruments, described in note 18, with the further 
complexity that the value of these assets requires estimates of future 
construction costs, tenant demand and market yields.
The Group’s development and trading properties are carried at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value. The determination of net realisable value 
relies upon similar estimates, with the added challenge, in some cases, 
of judgements about uncertain planning outcomes. These amounts are 
disclosed in note 15.
1.6 Impairment reviews
The Group’s Curzon Park Limited joint venture owns a development site in 
Birmingham known as Curzon Street. The current proposal for the High 
Speed Train Link between London and Birmingham (HS2) indicates that the 
planned route of HS2 passes through the site, including provision for part 
of the prospective station. In view of this, the ultimate value of the site is 
uncertain. The early indications are that the impact of HS2 may restrict 
future development on the 105-acre site by approximately two thirds of its 
original potential. The Group has (jointly) guaranteed the liabilities of the joint 
venture to the bank, and hence should the value of the site (together with 
any compensation received) be insufficient to repay the bank loan, the Group 
may incur further charges in respect of its obligations to the joint venture 
and the bank. The Directors believe that the site will recover at least its 
carrying value in the books of the joint venture, although the interim and 
ultimate uses of the site and timing of its development remain unclear. The 
site is discussed in the Financial Review on page 43, and in notes 14 and 24.
In view of operating losses at Executive Communication Centres (ECC), the 
Group’s serviced office subsidiary, the Group has conducted an impairment 
review of its investment in the business. The review required significant 
judgements and estimates concerning future customer demand and 
competitor behaviour, as well as discount rates. The review determined that 
there is an impairment requiring a provision to be made, as described in 
note 2. 
1.7 Derivative instruments
The Group is party to a number of interest rate swap and foreign currency 
agreements which are accounted for as derivatives and measured at fair 
value. The estimation of this figure is based upon market assumptions about 
future movements in interest and exchange rates. The assumptions used, 
the estimated fair values and the movements in the period are set out in 
note 18.
1.8 Income tax losses
The Group has significant carried forward income tax losses, arising mainly 
from valuation movements in the Group’s investment and trading property 
portfolios. Recognition of these losses as a deferred income tax asset 
requires judgements and estimates about the amounts and timing of the 
Group’s future taxable profits. The balances are disclosed in note 19.
d) New accounting standards
The following amendments to standards are effective for the first time for 
the financial year beginning 1st January 201 1.
  Revised IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’, issued in November 2009
  Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Classification of rights issues’, issued in 
October 2009
  Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, the 
amendment provides an option to present an analysis of each component 
of other comprehensive income either in the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity (SOCIE) or in the notes to the financial statements. 
The Group provides the information in the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity.
Other standards, amendments and interpretations effective for the first time 
in 201 1 and not relevant to the Group’s operations:
  IFRIC 14, ‘Payments of a minimum funding requirement’.
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been 
issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1st January 
201 1 and have not been early adopted.
  IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1st July 2012. The amendments to IAS 1 change the 
grouping of items presented in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Items 
that could be reclassified (or ‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in 
time (for example, upon derecognition or settlement) would be presented 
separately from items which will never be reclassified. 
  IAS 12, ‘Income Taxes’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1st January 2012. The amendment clarified the determination of deferred 
tax in investment property measured at fair value. The amendment 
introduces a rebuttable presumption that deferred tax on investment 
property measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 should be 
determined on the basis that its carrying amount will be recovered through 
sale. Furthermore, it introduces the requirement that deferred tax on 
non-depreciable assets measured using the revaluation model in IAS 16 
should always be measured on the sale basis of the asset. It is not 
anticipated that this will have any impact on the Group. 72 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
Financial Statements continued
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
d) New accounting standards continued
  IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1st January 2013. IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the 
IASB’s work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification 
and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in 
IAS 39. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting 
and impairment of financial assets. The adoption of the first phase of 
IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of 
the Group’s financial assets; the impact on the classification and 
measurements of financial liabilities has yet to be assessed. The Group 
will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, 
to present a comprehensive picture.
  IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1st January 2013. 
IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated 
financial statements. It also includes the issues raised in SIC-12 
Consolidation — Special Purpose Entities. 
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities 
including ‘special purpose entities’. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 
will require management to exercise significant judgement to determine 
which entities are controlled, and therefore are required to be consolidated 
by a parent. 
  IFRS 1 1, ‘Joint Arrangements’, effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1st January 2013. IFRS 1 1 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint 
Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities — Non-monetary 
Contributions by Venturers.
IFRS 1 1 removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities (JCEs) 
using proportionate consolidation. Instead, JCEs that meet the definition of 
a joint venture must be accounted for using the equity method.
  IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1st January 2013. IFRS 12 includes all of the 
disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial 
statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included 
in IAS 31 and IAS 28 Investment in Associates. These disclosures relate 
to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and 
structured entities. A number of new disclosures are also required.
  IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’ effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1st January 2013. IFRS 13 establishes a single source of 
guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.  IFRS 13 does not 
change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides 
guidance of how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is 
required or permitted.
e) Basis of consolidation 
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial 
statements of Development Securities PLC (‘Company’) and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which 
the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
generally accompanying the shareholding of more than half of the voting 
rights. The Group deems control where it does not have more than 50 per 
cent of the voting power but is able to govern the financial and operating 
policies by virtue of de-facto control, taking account of how the entity 
operates in practice.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included from the 
effective date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains 
control. They are deconsolidated on the date that control ceases. 
Where property is acquired, via corporate acquisition or otherwise, 
management considers the substance of the assets and activities of the 
acquired entity in determining whether the acquisition represents the 
acquisition of a business. The basis of the judgement is set out in Note 
1(c) 1.3. 
Where such acquisitions are not judged to be an acquisition of a business, 
they are not treated as business combinations. Rather, the cost to acquire 
the corporate entity is allocated between the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of the entity based on their relative fair values at the acquisition 
date. Accordingly, no goodwill or additional deferred taxation arises. 
Otherwise, acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations.
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. 
Any excess of the purchase price of the business combination over the 
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised as 
goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair 
value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity 
interests issued by the Group. This fair value includes any contingent 
consideration. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis either at fair value or ar at the non-controlling interest's 
proportionate share of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from 
intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated 
financial statements. Where necessary, adjustments have been made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to bring 
the accounting policies used and accounting periods into line with those of 
the Group. 
f) Associates and joint ventures 
An associated company is defined as an undertaking other than a subsidiary 
or joint venture over which the Group has significant influence but not 
control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 per 
cent of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted using the 
equity method. 
A joint venture is defined as an undertaking other than a subsidiary or 
associated undertaking where the Group has joint control with two or more 
venturers under a contractual arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for 
using the equity method. 
Under the equity method, the interest in associates or joint ventures is 
carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of its net assets, less distributions received 
and less any impairment in value of individual investments. The Statement of 
Comprehensive Income reflects the Group’s share of the associate’s or joint 
venture’s result after tax only after its share of the profits equals the share 
of losses not recognised. The Group does not recognise net losses unless 
it has incurred constructive or legal obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate or joint venture.

Financial Statements
g) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries 
is included in Intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses 
on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of 
impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected 
to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, 
identified according to operating segment.
(ii) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not 
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that 
are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-
use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the 
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs). 
Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, that have suffered an impairment 
are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
h) Revenue recognition
(i) Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread 
evenly over the lease term, even if payments are not made on such a 
basis. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together 
with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue 
the lease, where, at inception of the lease, the Directors are reasonably 
certain that the tenant will exercise that option. Lease incentives are 
usually in the form of rent-free periods or capital contributions. Assets 
held within both the investment and development and trading segments 
earn rental income. 
(ii) Lease surrender payments from tenants are recognised in income when 
they are contractually agreed.
(iii) Sales of property (both those classified as Investment and Inventory) 
are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the purchaser.
(iv) Licence fee income from serviced offices is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the term of the licence. Other income from serviced 
offices is recognised when the service is provided. The income is 
classified within the operating segment. 
(v) Project management fee income is recognised over the contract term 
for which project management services are provided.
(vi) Development revenue and profits are recognised in accordance with IAS 
1 1, ‘Construction contracts’ or IAS 18, ‘Revenue’ depending on whether 
all development risks, apart from the construction risk have passed to 
the purchaser under the terms of the development agreement. 
Where only the construction risk remains, the revenue and profit on the 
development is recognised under IAS 1 1, so as to match the proportion 
of development work completed on a percentage completion basis as 
determined by consultant monitoring surveyors or using a suitable 
method particular to the contract concerned. Profits are only recognised 
where the outcome can be determined with reasonable certainty. Full 
provision is made for losses as soon as such losses are foreseen. 
Where revenue and profit is recognised under IAS 18, disposals are 
recognised where the risks and rewards of ownership are considered to 
have been transferred to the purchaser. Profits are recognised within the 
development and trading segment. 
(vii)  Finance income is recognised by reference to the principal outstanding 
using the effective interest method.  
(viii) Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Group’s right 
to receive income has been established. 
i)  Investment properties 
(i) Investment properties are those properties, including land holdings, that 
are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both. 
Investment properties may be freehold or leasehold properties. For 
leasehold properties that are classified as investment properties, the 
associated leasehold obligations are accounted for as finance lease 
obligations if they qualify to be treated as such.
(ii) Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including directly 
attributable transaction costs, and thereafter are stated at fair value. 
Surpluses and deficits arising from changes in the fair value of 
investment properties are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.
(iii) Completed investment properties are valued, at each reporting date, by 
independent valuers on the basis of market value in accordance with the 
Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors. Fair value is assessed as the estimated amount for which a 
property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing 
buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper 
marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently 
and without compulsion. A deduction is made to reflect purchaser’s 
acquisition costs. In determining the fair value, the capitalisation of net 
income method and the discounting of future cash flows to their present 
value have been used, which are based upon assumptions including 
future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs and appropriate 
discount rate, and make reference to market evidence of transaction 
prices for similar properties.
(iv) Investment properties under construction are valued by the Directors, on 
the basis of the expected value of the property when complete, less 
deductions for the costs required to complete the project and 
appropriate adjustments for risk and finance costs. In preparing these 
valuations the Directors consult with agents and other advisors to derive 
appropriate assumptions specific to each asset.
(v) Profits and losses on disposal of investment properties are calculated by 
reference to book value and recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership are considered to have passed to the purchaser. Gains and 
losses are recognised within ‘Gains or losses on disposal of investment 
properties’ in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
(vi) Investment properties held for sale are held at fair value and classified 
separately within current assets in the Balance Sheet.  74 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
Financial Statements continued
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
j) Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Operating properties – serviced offices
Operating properties are held for business purposes rather than for 
investment, generating revenue by way of licence fees and ancillary services. 
These properties are recognised initially at cost, which includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset 
to its working condition for its intended use. Thereafter the asset is carried 
at valuation less depreciation and impairment charged subsequent to the 
date of revaluation. A revaluation surplus is credited to Other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity under the heading of Property revaluation 
reserve, unless it reverses a revaluation decrease on the same asset 
previously recognised as an expense, where it is first credited to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income to that extent.
Operating properties are valued at each reporting date by independent, 
professional valuers on the basis of Existing Use Value. Surpluses and 
deficits in the period are included in the Property revaluation reserve within 
equity, except where carrying value is below depreciated cost, in which case 
surpluses and deficits are included in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the value of the 
properties, excluding land, over their expected useful lives, usually 25 years. 
(ii) Other plant and equipment 
Other plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Depreciation is provided so as 
to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets over their 
expected useful lives on a straight-line method. The principal annual rates 
used for this purpose are as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings and computer equipment – 10% to 33% 
Motor vehicles – 20% 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if 
appropriate at the end of each reporting period. An asset’s carrying amount 
is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying 
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net 
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within Other gains 
and losses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
k)  Operating leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership 
are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rents payable 
under operating leases are charged in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
l) Inventory – development and trading properties 
Property acquired or being constructed for sale in the ordinary course of 
business, rather than to be held for rental or capital appreciation, is held 
as inventory and is measured at the lower of cost and estimated net 
realisable value. 
Cost includes directly attributable expenditure and interest. No element of 
overhead is included in cost, since it is not practical to identify overhead 
amounts in respect of particular assets. Where the Directors consider that 
the costs are not recoverable from the sale or development of the asset, the 
project or site is written down to its net realisable value, with the write-down 
taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Net realisable value is calculated as the estimated realisable value of the 
project or site, based upon our current plans, less all further costs to be 
incurred in making the sale. 
m) Current and deferred income tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, 
based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, together with any adjustment in respect of previous years. 
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on all temporary 
differences arising at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, 
with the following exceptions:
  Where the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss.
  In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference can be controlled by the parent, venture or 
investor respectively, and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items 
recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. 
n) Financial assets and financial liabilities 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual terms 
of the instrument. 
(i)  Financial assets
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. The classification depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired as follows: 
  Loans and other receivables with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted on an active market. The Group’s loans and receivables are 
included within Trade and other receivables and Other financial assets in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. This represents interest 
and currency swaps which are categorised as held for trading unless they 
are designated as hedges. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the 14-month period ended 29th February 2012 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 75
Financial Statements
  Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are designated 
as such or are not classified in any other category. After initial recognition 
at cost, available-for-sale assets are measured at fair value, with gains or 
losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the 
investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be 
impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously represented 
in equity is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Equity 
instrument financial assets are held at cost in the event that the fair value 
of the instruments is not reliably measurable.
  Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original 
invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is 
material, receivables are carried at amortised cost. Provision is made when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover 
balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery 
is assessed as being remote. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against the appropriate cost line in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
  Amounts due from customers for contract work are included in Trade and 
other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of 
payments on account received. 
  Cash and bank balances comprise deposits held at call with banks and 
other short-term highly liquid investments with no significant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
which form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included 
as a financial liability. For the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, cash and cash equivalents are stated net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts. 
Financial assets are included within current assets except for assets 
maturing after one year, which will be classified as non-current.
Financial assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date. Assets 
are impaired where there is evidence that as a result of events that occurred 
after initial recognition, the estimated future cash flows from the assets have 
been adversely affected. 
(ii) Financial liabilities
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising on the 
repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised 
respectively in finance income and finance costs.
Other financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost and are 
classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. 
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Amounts due to customers for contract work is included within Trade 
and other payables and represents payments received in advance 
from customers.
(iii)  Derivatives
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, including interest rate 
swaps, caps and collars and cross-currency swaps, to manage its exposure 
to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value 
at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit 
or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated as an effective 
hedging instrument, in which case the fair value is taken through Other 
Comprehensive Income.
(iv)  Hedging
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or 
a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is 
more than twelve months and as a current asset or a current liability if the 
remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than twelve months.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its 
risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will 
be measured throughout its duration. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items.
The Group has designated derivatives as cash flow hedges, in which case 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument 
is recognised in Other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to 
an ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. Amounts taken to equity are recycled to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the periods when the hedged item 
is recognised in profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging 
relationship or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
o) Borrowing costs
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on investment 
properties and inventories under development are capitalised. The interest 
capitalised is calculated using the rate of interest on the loan to fund the 
expenditure, or the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings where 
appropriate, over the period from commencement of the development work 
until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset 
for its intended use or sale are complete. The capitalisation of finance costs 
is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is 
interrupted. 
Capitalised interest is written off to direct costs on disposal of inventory or 
to operating profit on disposal of investment properties.
Fees paid on establishment of loan facilities are capitalised as a prepayment 
for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which 
it relates. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred. 76 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012

1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
p) Provisions 
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be 
reliably estimated.
Onerous lease provisions are created for properties that are unoccupied, 
sublet at below the rent payable on the head lease or for operating sites 
where the projected future trading revenue is insufficient to cover the 
value in use.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected 
to be required to settle the obligation. The accretion in the discount is 
recognised as an interest expense. 
q) Pension schemes 
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. The charge to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period represents the actual 
amount payable to the scheme in the period. Differences between 
contributions payable in the period and contributions paid are shown as 
either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. 
r) Foreign currencies 
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in UK 
Sterling, the Company’s functional and presentation currency. Transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates 
of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the 
balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange 
movements are dealt with in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with 
exchange differences on borrowings taken to finance income/costs, except 
when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net 
investment hedges.
s) Segmental reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker (CODM). 
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board.
t) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new Ordinary shares 
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
u) Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans, the 
majority of which are cash-settled, under which the entity receives services 
from employees as consideration for cash-settled instruments of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of the option is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
The Group has used a Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine 
the fair value of share options granted. An equal probability model has been 
used to determine the fair value of share awards under the Performance 
Share Plan. The cost of cash-settled transactions with employees and 
Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they 
are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which 
ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are 
treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is 
calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of 
non-market conditions and of the number of cash-settled share-based 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject 
to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The 
movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date 
is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a 
corresponding entry in accruals.
v) Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised 
as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
w) Definitions 
  Operating profit: stated after gain on disposal of investment properties and 
the revaluation of the Investment property portfolio and before the results 
of associates, jointly controlled entities and finance income and costs. 
  IPD Index and Total Portfolio Return: total return from the completed 
investment property portfolio, comprising net rental income or expenditure, 
capital gains or losses from disposals and revaluation surpluses or deficits, 
divided by the average capital employed during the financial period, as 
defined and measured by Investment Property Databank Limited, a 
company that produces independent benchmarks of property returns. 
  Total Shareholder Return: movement in share price over the period plus 
dividends paid as a percentage of the opening share price. 
  Gearing: expressed as a percentage, is measured as net debt divided 
by total shareholders’ funds.
  Adjusted gearing: expressed as a percentage, is calculated by deducting 
from net debt the current fair value of the subordinated loan notes and 
adding back relevant restricted cash balances and transaction costs.
  Loan to value gearing: expressed as a percentage of net debt as a 
proportion of total property assets, including shares of properties and 
net debt in all projects in partnership.
  Net debt: total debt less cash and short-term deposits, including 
pledged cash.

2 Segmental analysis
The segmental information presented consistently follows the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker (CODM) and reflects the three 
sectors in which the Group operates. The CODM, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as the Board. The three operating divisions are:
  Investment – management of the Group’s investment property portfolio, generating rental income and valuation surpluses from property management; 
  Development and trading – managing the Group’s development and trading projects. Revenue is received from project management fees, development 
profits and the disposal of inventory; and 
  Operating – serviced office operations. Revenue is principally received from short-term licence fee income. 
Unallocated assets and liabilities comprise amounts that cannot be specifically allocated to operating segments; an analysis is provided below.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information. All operations occur and all assets are located in the United 
Kingdom, except assets of £89,000, which are located in The Netherlands. In December 2010, assets of £642,000 were located in France and The 
Netherlands. All revenue arises from continuing operations.

A summary of unallocated assets and liabilities is shown on page 79.
In view of continuing losses arising within the Group’s serviced office business, the Directors have conducted an impairment review (as described in the 
Financial Review on page 41). The business operates seven centres, each of which is designated as a cash-generating unit. The review determined that the 
fixed assets of five of the seven centres are fully impaired, requiring a provision of £1,575,000. In addition, four of those centres are not expected to cover their 
committed rental costs in full, and a further provision of £1,270,000 has been made in this regard, aggregating to an exceptional provision of £2,845,000.
The net book amount of the remaining fixed assets associated with the business segment is £2,149,000. No reasonable change in underlying assumptions 
would give rise to a material impairment. 78 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012

of business on 28th September 2012 and will be recognised in the year ending 28th February 2013. 
9 (Loss)/earnings per share and net assets per share 
Basic (loss)/earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing (loss)/profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted (loss)/earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the (loss)/profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of Ordinary shares that would be issued on the 
conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares. 
Basic net assets per share amounts are calculated by dividing net assets by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the period-end.
Diluted net assets per share amounts are calculated by dividing net assets by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the period-end plus the number 
of Ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares.
Management has chosen to disclose the European Public Real Estate (EPRA) adjusted net assets per share and earnings per share from continuing 
activities in order to provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance and to assist comparison between European property companies. 
EPRA loss is the (loss)/profit after taxation excluding investment property revaluations, (losses)/gains on disposals of investment and trading properties, 
impairment of development and trading properties and mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swaps. 
EPRA net assets are the Balance Sheet net assets excluding mark-to-market adjustments on financial instruments used for hedging purposes and deferred 
taxation on revaluations and is calculated on a fully diluted basis. 
EPRA triple net assets is the EPRA NAV adjusted to reflect the fair value of debt and derivatives and to include deferred taxation on revaluations.
The calculation of basic and diluted (loss)/earnings per share and EPRA loss per share is based on the following data:

The Group’s Investment properties have been valued at 29th February 2012 and at 31st December 2010 by independent valuers and by the Directors on 
the basis of market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Completed Investment 
properties have been valued by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Chartered Surveyors, Savills Commercial Limited, Chartered Surveyors or Ryden LLP, 
Commercial Property Consultants at a value of £208,509,000 (31st December 2010: £168,399,000). 
Land held as investment property has been valued by Colliers CRE, Chartered Surveyors at £14,000,000 (31st December 2010: £12,400,000). 
The valuers have consented to the use of their names in the financial statements.
Also included within Investment properties are freehold land and buildings representing investment properties under development, amounting to 
£15,390,000 (31st December 2010: £18,438,000), which have been valued by the Directors. These properties comprise buildings and landholdings for 
current or future development as investment properties. This approach has been taken because the value of these properties is dependent on a detailed 
knowledge of the planning status, the competitive position of these assets and a range of complex project development appraisals. 
Investment properties under development include £7,590,000 (31st December 2010: £7,104,000) of landholdings adjacent to retail properties within the 
Group’s portfolio, acquired for the purpose of extending the existing shopping centres. The fair value of these properties rests in the planned extensions, and 
is difficult to estimate pending confirmation of designs and planning permission, and hence has been estimated by the Directors at cost as an approximation 
to fair value.
£215,329,000 (31st December 2010: £145,425,000) of Investment properties are charged as security against the Group’s borrowings.

Goodwill £’000 
At 1st January 2011 and 29th February 2012 1,268
On 29th March 2010, the Group acquired 100.0 per cent of the issued shares in Henry Davidson Developments Limited (HDD), a property development 
company specialising in neighbourhood retail schemes. Goodwill of £1,268,000 arose as a result of HDD’s expected future profits from two specific 
developments acquired.
The carrying amount of the goodwill has been tested for impairment at the reporting date. The current project appraisals are reviewed at each reporting date, 
assessing the timing of the cash flows and expected future profit associated with the project. 
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to the operating segment. The recoverable amount of all CGUs has 
been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by 
management covering a period up to the completion of each project (or less than five years). The pre-tax discount rate used was 8.0 per cent. No provision 
for impairment was considered necessary. No reasonable change in any assumption would give rise to a material impairment.

Curzon Park Limited acquired the 10.5-acre Curzon Street site in Birmingham in November 2006. In January 2012, the Government confirmed their 
intention to proceed with the High Speed Rail Link between London and Birmingham (HS2). The proposed route passes through our site, which may restrict 
development by approximately two thirds of its original potential. The Group together with our joint venture partner is liaising with HS2 and the Department 
for Transport to discuss a revised master plan for the site. The Group has provided for its share of net assets.
In 2010, the Group provided a further £5,000,000 funding to our Curzon Park Limited joint venture, to enable a partial repayment of the bank loan held 
within the entity. Our joint venture partner also made a similar contribution. These partial repayments reduced the bank’s loan to the joint venture entity to 
£15,610,000. In turn, the bank extended the loan for a new five-year term, with loan-to-value testing suspended for three years until 6th May 2013.

Included in the above amounts are projects stated at net realisable value, being development and trading properties of £48,959,000 (31st December 2010: 
£42,947,000). 
Net realisable value has been estimated by the Directors, taking account of our plans for each project, the planning status and competitive position of each 
asset, and the anticipated market for the scheme. For material developments the Directors have consulted with third party chartered surveyors in setting 
their market assumptions. 
Weeke Local Centre, Winchester, a property previously constructed by the Group for sale, has been transferred to investment assets in the period. It is the 
Group’s intention to hold the asset for income and long-term capital appreciation. Capitalised interest of £521,000 has been transferred with the asset.
Interest of £665,000 (31st December 2010: £nil) was capitalised on development and trading properties during the period. Capitalised interest included 
within the carrying value of such properties on the Balance Sheet is £759,000 (31st December 2010: £615,000).

The property provisions of £775,000 arose from residual liabilities on completed development projects where the Group was responsible for certain 
development costs in prior years. The provision has been reversed in the period as it is no longer considered payable.
Following a review of our serviced office operation it was identified that the future revenue of four of the seven centres was not sufficient to cover future 
rental commitments. £1,270,000 has been provided to cover the onerous liability associated with these leases (refer note 2).
Two further provisions of £1,051,000 (31st December 2010: £1,010,000) and £355,000 (31st December 2010: £590,000) relate to onerous lease 
obligations entered into in 2009 and 1989 respectively. 
The Group made a payment of £3,624,000 in respect of a lease to Stead & Simpson Limited in respect of which Development Securities PLC was 
a guarantor. The payment represented the final obligation as guarantor. A further onerous lease provision of £52,000 was utilised in the period.

Development participation represents the Group’s risk capital invested alongside our partners in one of our development schemes PaddingtonCentral. 
The fair value of the participation is assessed by reference to the stage of completion of the project and progress on construction and lettings. 
Development loans to joint ventures include a number of working capital and project-specific loans of £1 1,191,000 (31st December 2010: £5,703,000) 
to CTP Securities Limited. The loans attract fixed coupon rates of between 5.0 and 13.0 per cent. Included in the above amount is an interest-free loan 
of £208,000.
Following the renegotiation of the Curzon Park Limited loan facility, the Group provided a £5,000,000 loan to the joint venture in order to repay a share 
of its bank debt. The joint venture partner provided a similar loan.
The Group has two funding agreements totalling £4,730,000 (31st December 2010: three agreements totalling £3,023,000), in respect of projects 
in partnership. The loans attract fixed coupon rates of between 3.0 and 8.5 per cent. 
Loan notes with a carrying value of £89,000 (31st December 2010: £89,000) are held in Continental Estates Corporation BV, an associate. Interest 
is earned at a fixed rate of 6.0 per cent. Loan notes with a carrying value of £8,425,000 were issued in November 2007 by CTP Securities Limited, 
with a term of five years and a fixed coupon rate of 4.25 per cent. During the period the Group acquired a further £100,000 of CTP loan notes.

A full explanation of the Group’s borrowings and any changes since the balance sheet date can be found in the Financial Review on pages 36 to 44.
c) Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, fair value interest rate 
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group defines capital as total equity and monitors this on the basis of gearing.
The nature and extent of the Group’s financial risks, and the Directors’ approach to managing those risks, are described in the Financial Review on pages 39 
to 40 and below. This note provides further detailed information on these risks.

Interest on financial instruments classified as variable rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed 
rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group that are not included above are non-interest 
bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk. 96 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012

Foreign currency risk
The Group does not undertake significant trade overseas, but does hold certain assets, amounting to £89,000 (31st December 2010: £642,000) 
denominated in foreign currencies. The currency exposure arising from these investments is not considered to materially affect the Group’s operations and 
is not subject to hedging arrangements.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from €47,000,000 (31st December 2010: €47,000,000) loan notes issued during 2007 that are denominated 
in Euros. 
The Group has entered into a currency and interest rate swap with a banking institution to minimise these potential risks. The swap is cash collateralised and 
qualifies to be accounted for as a cash flow hedge as detailed below. The fair value of this instrument at 29th February 2012 was a liability of £1,925,000 
(31st December 2010: £3,302,000 asset).
The Group maintains a security deposit of £4,000,000 (31st December 2010: £4,000,000) throughout the loan note term. The security deposit is required 
to cash collateralise the risk for the swap counterparty. The Group is further required to increase this security if the Group's potential liability under the 
instrument increases to within £250,000 of the security deposit. 
During the 14-month period to 29th February 2012, the movement of Sterling against the Euro was approximately 8.0 per cent. Management has therefore 
measured sensitivity on this basis.
The following table demonstrates the possible effect of changes in Sterling and Euro exchange rates with all other variables held constant:

The Group does not undertake significant foreign exchange trading activity; consequently, a detailed foreign exchange sensitivity analysis is not presented. 
Interest rate sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity in respect of variable rate debt obligations to a change in interest rates, with other variables held constant, 
of the Group’s (loss)/profit before income tax. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed-rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost as well as variable rate financial instruments 
with associated effective fixed-rate hedging instruments or currency hedging instruments.
Fair value interest rate hedging instruments that are part of a hedging relationship have been excluded. Variable rate non-derivative financial instruments 
where the associated interest has been capitalised have also been excluded.
As at 29th February 2012, a movement of 50 basis points higher or lower, with all other variables held constant would have the following effect on (loss)/
profit before tax. Management consider a movement of 50 basis points to be a reasonable guide to sensitivity in the current interest rate environment.

Market risk
A summary of market risk and its effect on the Group is set out in Business Risks on page 9 and further discussed in the Chief Executive’s Statement 
on pages 4 and 5 and in the Operating Review on pages 1 1 to 31.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Except as detailed below, in respect of fixed rate debenture and loan facilities, the Directors consider the carrying amount to be either fair value or a reasonable 
approximation of fair value apart from equity instruments classified as available-for-sale assets under IAS 39, where fair value cannot be reliably measured.
Fixed rate debt
A valuation was carried out as at 29th February 2012 by J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to calculate the market value of the Group’s fixed rate debt on 
a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between fixed interest rates for the Group’s borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest 
rate of appropriate debt instruments. Whilst the replacement basis provides a consistent method for valuation of fixed rate debt, such financing facilities are 
in place to provide continuing funding for the Group’s activities. The valuation is therefore only an indication of a notional effect on the net asset value of the 
Group as at 29th February 2012, and may be subject to daily fluctuations in line with money market movements. J C Rathbone Associates Limited have 
consented to the use of their name in the financial statements.
The fair value compared to the carrying amounts of the Group’s fixed rate financial liabilities as at 29th February 2012 is analysed below:

The fair value difference of £18,082,000 at 29th February 2012 (31st December 2010: £8,965,000) represents approximately 18.3 per cent of gross, fixed 
rate borrowings (31st December 2010: 1 1.6 per cent). The effect on net assets per share after tax of this adjustment would be a decrease of 10.9 pence 
after tax (31st December 2010: 5.3 pence decrease).  98 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012

At 29th February 2012, the Group held one cross-currency interest rate swap designated as a hedge of expected future cash flows arising from 
€47,000,000 variable rate loan notes issued in September 2007. The cross-currency swap is used to hedge the EURIBOR interest rate exposure to a fixed 
rate of 7.97 per cent and Euro currency exposure from the loan notes fixed at a rate of €1.43:£. The terms of the derivative have been negotiated to match 
the terms of the loan notes.
The cash flow hedge of the expected future loan note cash flows was assessed to be 100.0 per cent effective. The mark-to-market movement in the foreign 
currency leg of the swap of £959,000 (31st December 2010: £1,352,000) has been recycled through profit or loss to offset the re-translation of the 
€47,000,000 loan. The mark-to-market movement on the interest leg of this swap of £4,268,000 loss (31st December 2010: £2,819,000 loss) is included 
within the net unrealised gain/(loss) reserve in equity.
At 29th February 2012, the Group held interest rate swaps, caps and collars designated as economic hedges and not qualifying as effective hedges under 
IAS 39. The derivatives are used to mitigate the Group’s interest rate exposure to variable rate loans of £56,045,000 (31st December 2010: £6,565,000). 
The fair value of the derivatives amounting to £544,000 is recorded as a financial liability at 29th February 2012 (31st December 2010: £6,000 asset) 
with the fair value (loss)/gain taken to finance costs.
Fair value estimation
From 1st January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the Balance Sheet at fair value, 
which requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
(i)  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
(ii)   Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly 
(that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
(iii)   Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). Discounted cash flows are used 
to determine fair values of these instruments.
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 29th February 2012.

19 Deferred income tax 
The following are the deferred income tax liabilities and assets and movements thereon recognised by the Group during the current and previous financial 
period. The UK corporation tax rate decreased on 1st April 2012 from 26.0 per cent to 24.0 per cent. Deferred income tax is calculated on the temporary 
differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 25.0 per cent (31st December 2010: 27.0 per cent).

At 29th February 2012 —
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances 
net. Deferred income tax assets arising from the Group’s trading and capital losses are recognised on the basis that there will be sufficient profits in the 
foreseeable future to utilise such losses. The Group has not recognised deferred income tax assets of £12,105,000 (31st December 2010: £1 1,839,000) in 
respect of losses amounting to £48,422,000 (31st December 2010: £43,848,000) that can be carried forward against future taxable income. The proposed 
reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1.0 per cent per annum to 22.0 per cent by 1st April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year. 
The overall effect of the further changes from 26.0 per cent to 22.0 per cent, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 29th February 2012, would be 
to reduce the net deferred income tax asset by £nil.
Movements in deferred income tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances) are shown above. 100 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012

571,361 268.7 528,647 325.3
Any options granted on or before 7th November 2002 have not been recognised under IFRS 2 under the exemption in that standard. These options have 
not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was £0.50 (31st December 2010: £0.50). The average share price during the period 
was 194.1 pence (31st December 2010: 255.0 pence). Of the 571,361 (31st December 2010: 528,647) outstanding options at 29th February 2012, 
155,753 were exercisable (31st December 2010: 229,166).
The options outstanding at 29th February 2012 were exercisable between 152.0 pence and 559.8 pence per share and have a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 5.3 years (31st December 2010: 4.2 years). 
The fair value of grants is measured at the grant date using a Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
instruments were granted. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. The main 
assumptions of the Black-Scholes pricing model are as follows:
Grant date 24.10.11 31.08.10 08.05.09 28.10.08 28.04.06 27.10.05 19.04.04

Risk-free rate 0.9% 2.9% 1.5% 3.5% 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% 
Expected forfeiture p.a. Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Development Securities PLC share price over multiple time periods. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
Conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan
The terms of the Performance Share Plan are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 64.
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded under the Performance Share Plan are valued at their fair value on the date of the award, using an Equal Probability 
Model, which takes into account the probability of the Ordinary shares vesting based on an equal probability of achieving appropriate total shareholder return 
ranking as determined under the performance condition.
The principal assumptions for calculating the fair value of the Ordinary shares conditionally awarded are:

2010
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded (no. of shares) 624,508 527,621

Percentage probability applied for fair value 52.00% 36.88%

The expense recognised for equity-settled share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the period is £21,000  
(31st December 2010: £nil). 
The credit recognised for cash-settled share-based payments during the period due to historic cash-settled options lapsing is £15,000  
(31st December 2010: expense of £19,000). 102 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012

The Group has provided guarantees for rent liabilities in respect of properties previously occupied by Group companies. In the event that the current tenants 
ceased to pay rent, the Group would be liable to cover any shortfall until the building could be re-let. The Group has made provision against crystallised 
liabilities in this regard. In respect of potential liabilities where no provision has been made, the annual rent-roll of the buildings benefiting from such 
guarantees is £503,000 (31st December 2010: £374,000) with an average unexpired lease period of 4.1 years (31st December 2010: 6.7 years).
The Group has guaranteed its share of the interest payable by Wessex Property Fund (see note 14(a)) in respect of the Fund’s borrowings of £17,500,000.

106 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012
Company Independent Auditors’ Report
We have audited the Parent company financial statements of Development 
Securities PLC for the 14-month period ended 29th February 2012 which 
comprise the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out 
on pages 55 and 56, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Parent company financial statements: 
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 29th 
February 2012;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial period for 
which the Parent company financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or 
  the Parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Development Securities PLC for the 14-month period ended 
29th February 2012.

29 Accounting policies 
a) Basis of accounting 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable laws and United Kingdom accounting standards and on a going 
concern basis and under the historical cost convention. The accounting 
policies adopted are consistent with the previous year and are set out below. 
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as 
permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax for 
the period was £24,705,000 (31st December 2010: £8,467,000 loss). 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing 
a Cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 
2D of FRS 29, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and has not disclosed 
information required by that standard, as the Group’s Consolidated financial 
statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures 
for the Group under IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
The financial statements were approved by the Directors for issue on 
1st May 2012. 
b) Investments 
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures 
are accounted for in the financial statements at cost less any provision for 
impairment. 
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
c) Operating leases 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis 
to the profit and loss account over the lease term even if the payments are 
not made on such a basis. 
d) Tangible assets 
Tangible assets are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the 
asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost less 
estimated residual value of such assets over their expected useful lives on 
a straight-line basis. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are 
as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings and computer equipment – 10% to 33%  
Motor vehicles  – 20% 
e) Provisions 
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be 
reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected 
to be required to settle the obligation. The accretion in the discount is 
recognised as an interest expense. 
f) Taxation 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, 
using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together with any 
adjustment in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of 
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences or unutilised tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items 
recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the profit and 
loss account. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
g) Pension schemes 
The Company operates a defined contribution scheme on behalf of the 
Development Securities PLC Group. The charge to the profit and loss 
account in the period represents the actual amount payable to the scheme 
in the period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and 
contributions paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the 
Balance Sheet. 
h) Foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into UK 
Sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange movements are dealt 
with in the Profit and loss account. 
i) Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of share-based compensation plans, the 
majority of which are cash-settled, under which the entity receives services 
from employees as consideration for cash-settled instruments of the 
Company. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for 
the grant of the option is recognised as an expense. 
The Company has used a Black-Scholes option valuation model to 
determine the fair value of share options granted. An equal probability model 
has been used to determine the fair value of share awards under the 
Performance Share Plan. The cost of cash-settled transactions with 
employees and Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the 
date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the 
vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award. In valuing cash-settled transactions, no 
account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to 
the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For the 14-month period ended 29th February 2012 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012 109
Financial Statements
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are 
treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is 
calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of 
non-market conditions and of the number of cash-settled share-based 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject 
to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The 
movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date 
is recognised in the Profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry 
in accruals.
30 Auditors’ remuneration 
Auditors’ remuneration in respect of the audit for the Company was £15,000 (31st December 2010: £15,000).

Any options granted on or before 7th November 2002 have not been recognised under FRS 20 under the exemption in that standard. These options have 
not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with FRS 20.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was £0.50 (31st December 2010: £0.50). The average share price during the period 
was 194.1 pence (31st December 2010: 255.0 pence). Of the 571,361 (31st December 2010: 528,647) outstanding options at 29th February 2012, 
155,753 were exercisable (31st December 2010: 229,166).
The options outstanding at 29th February 2012 were exercisable between 152.0 pence and 559.8 pence per share and have a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 5.3 years (31st December 2010: 4.2 years). 
The fair value of grants is measured at the grant date using a Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
instruments were granted. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. The main 
assumptions of the Black-Scholes pricing model are as follows:
Grant date 24.10.11 31.08.10 08.05.09 28.10.08 28.04.06 27.10.05 19.04.04

Risk-free rate 0.9% 2.9% 1.5% 3.5% 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% 
Expected forfeiture p.a. Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Development Securities PLC share price over multiple time periods. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
Conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan
The terms of the Performance Share Plan are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 64.
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded under the Performance Share Plan are valued at their fair value on the date of the award, using an Equal Probability 
Model, which takes into account the probability of the Ordinary shares vesting based on an equal probability of achieving appropriate total shareholder return 
ranking as determined under the performance condition.
The principal assumptions for calculating the fair value of the Ordinary shares conditionally awarded are:

2010
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded (no. of shares) 624,508 527,621

The expense recognised for equity-settled share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the period is £21,000 (31st December 
2010: £nil). The credit recognised for cash-settled share-based payments during the period due to historic cash-settled options lapsing is £15,000 
(31st December 2010: expense of £19,000). 114 Development Securities PLC / Annual Report 2012

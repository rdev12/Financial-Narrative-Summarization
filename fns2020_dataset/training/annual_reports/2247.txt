I 
am delighted to report my first full year results as 
Chairman of Bloomsbury Publishing. The Group has 
enjoyed a good year, with total revenue up 11% 
and profit before tax and highlighted items* up 4%. 
The Bloomsbury Adult division’s total revenue increased 
by 13%, with increases in both print and digital sales. 
Bloomsbury has continued to broaden its business. In 
particular the Academic & Professional division has kept 
pace with the success of the Adult division and accounts 
for 29% of Group revenue. Total digital sales grew by 21% 
across the Group. The India business is reporting its first full 
year of results and showing early promise. 
The Chief Executive’s Review provides more detail on the 
Group’s performance for the year. 
Our Strategic Report is set out on pages 1 to 45. One 
major objective is to grow the academic and professional 
publishing business. Our acquisition of Hart Publishing, a 
specialist legal publisher, demonstrates the execution of this 
strategy. At the year-end we had net cash of £10.0 million 
down from £14.6 million last year, having spent £8.5 million 
on acquisitions. We will continue to be open to acquisitions 
which help us to deliver our strategy.
We also want to grow digital and subscription revenues, 
further developing the One Global Bloomsbury approach. 
At the same time there is a need to make sure that our 
systems keep up with the growth in the business and enable 
us to provide excellent support to our authors.
Looking ahead, there is continuing optimism that there will 
be a return to a reasonable level of economic growth in the 
UK and the US. These markets together account for over 
90% of total Bloomsbury sales. 
Since Bloomsbury reported last year, alongside my 
appointment as Chairman, the Board has also appointed 
two new independent Non-Executive Directors: Jill Jones, 
Managing Director of McGraw Hill Education, Europe, 
Middle East and Africa, and Stephen Page, Chief Executive 
of Faber & Faber. The knowledge they respectively bring 
of the academic and trade businesses is invaluable to the 
Board. Around the same time, Sarah Jane Thomson and 
my predecessor, Jeremy Wilson, left the Board. We thank 
Sarah Jane and Jeremy enormously for their important 
contributions to Bloomsbury. 
The performance of the last year would not have come 
without the steely determination and hard work of the 
Executive Directors, the other members of the Executive 
Committee and the wider staff at Bloomsbury. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank all of the staff for their 
professionalism and dedication. We know that our future 
success is dependent on our authors, on the commitment 
and talents of our people and on the support of our other 
stakeholders. Mindful of the rapid evolution of digital 
publishing, the strength of the Bloomsbury team enables us 
to look forward to the future with confidence.

B
loomsbury is continuing to grasp the 
opportunities offered by the digital revolution 
to build a growing, sustainable and balanced 
twenty-first century publishing business. We 
have succeeded in developing into a wholly integrated 
consumer and academic publisher in the major markets 
around the world. We are now recognised as one of the 
finest publishers of both general and academic books and 
we believe there are valuable synergies between the two. 
Strong revenue growth, up 11% to £109.5 million, was 
driven by an excellent list of new books contributing 
significantly to another successful year for the Group. Profit 
before tax and highlighted items of £13.0 million was up 4% 
on the year ended 28 February 2013 of £12.5 million. Profit 
before tax was £9.5 million (2012/13: £9.8 million). 
The majority of our revenue is generated by title sales, 
which were up by 16% year on year to £101.0 million 
following the success of our new books. Within this, digital 
sales rose by 21% to £12.2 million and now make up 12.1% 
of title sales (2012/13: 11.5%). The strong sales from new 
books mitigated a fall in higher margin rights and services 
revenues, which delivered 8% of total revenue compared 
to 12% last year.  Rights and services revenues were down 
26% to £8.5 million. Within that, copyright licence revenue 
fell by £2.5 million as fewer deals were completed and at 
lower amounts.  
A robust sales performance in our Academic & Professional 
division was enhanced by the acquisition of the legal 
publisher, Hart Publishing (‘Hart’), in September 2013, 
which contributed revenue of £1.8 million and profit before 
tax of £0.5 million in the six months since its acquisition. 
Underlying revenue, which excludes the result of Hart and 
the two businesses we acquired in 2012, Fairchild Books and 
Applied Visual Arts Publishing, was up by 10% to £101.5 
million. 
Operating profit margin before highlighted items 
reduced from 12.6% to 11.9% mainly because of the lower 
proportion of higher margin rights and services revenue 
compared to the very strong prior year. During the year 
we have tendered our colour print purchasing and 
delivered savings in the second half of the year equivalent 
to £0.4 million per annum. This was part of a significant 
reorganisation of our Group Production, which included 
adopting an XML-based, content-led workflow across the 
entire Group. This consolidation project will deliver a single, 
documented and controlled mark-up language suited to 
over 95% of Bloomsbury’s output. This is vital to the success 
of our publishing strategy for both print and digital.
Bloomsbury is a global, fully 
integrated publisher of books and 
other media for general readers, 
children, students, researchers 
and professionals throughout the 
world. Bloomsbury uniquely offers 
authors access to these multiple 
markets in multiple formats 
throughout the world: in print, 
through e-books, through digital 
downloads and apps; in schools, 
in libraries, in universities, and in 
terrestrial and internet bookshops, 
with entrepreneurial teams in New 
York, London, New Delhi and 
Sydney serving all territories.

We have also invested in new staff in IT, Digital Development 
and Production to facilitate further the strategic move to 
digital workflows. Combined with additional investment in 
Operations in the second half of the year, total additional 
investment in these areas is £0.6 million per annum, as 
previously announced.
We have been investing successfully in the development 
of online platforms. These include Drama Online, Churchill 
Archive and Berg Fashion Library, with Bloomsbury 
Collections launching in May this year. As sales and the 
number of platforms increase, we are creating our own 
institutional digital sales force. During 2014/15 there will be 
overlap costs of £0.3 million as we make this transition.
In its first full year of operation, our Indian publishing 
business in New Delhi generated revenues of £1.5 million 
and broke even, before the allocation of Group costs. 
This is a year ahead of our original plan and was due to 
the excellent sales of Khaled Hosseini’s And the Mountains 
Echoed and some strong local publishing. 
The acquisition of Hart Publishing, related restructuring 
and other strategic initiatives have resulted in £0.8 million 
of costs which, together with intangible amortisation, are 
highlighted separately in the financial statements.
The effective rate of tax for the year was 18.7% compared to 
20.6% for the year ended 28 February 2013. The reduction 
mainly reflects the lower rate of UK corporation tax which 
affected current and deferred tax.  
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items, 
were 14.23 pence, up 9% from 13.11 pence in 2012/13. Total 
diluted earnings per share for the year were 10.43 pence 
compared to 9.99 pence in 2012/13.
The Group’s net cash balance was £10.0 million at 28 
February 2014 down from £14.6 million at 28 February 2013. 
The Group generated £3.9 million of cash in the year before 
an £8.5 million outflow for acquisition investment. This was 
reflected in our strong operating cash conversion rate of 
86% (2012/13: 62%).
The Churchill Archive online has around one million pages accessible 
on demand to libraries worldwide.  All secondary schools in the UK, USA 
and Canada will be granted access to the entire archive.
In September 2013, we acquired Hart Publishing, the publisher of law 
books and journals for the academic and professional markets.

Divisional Review
Academic & Professional — another year of robust sales growth
The year saw a robust sales performance driven by substantial growth in organic digital revenues, the acquisition of Hart 
Publishing and a strong US performance, reflecting the investments made last year in sales and marketing infrastructure. 
Profits were also impacted by a reduction in rights and services income and a one-off £0.8 million additional US stock 
provision.  
The division’s results are summarised below:
Underlying revenue growth of 5% compares to 0.7% 
growth for global revenues at UK academic and 
professional publishers generally (source: The Publishers 
Association Sales Monitor). Revenues from e-books and 
other digital products now account for 10% of divisional 
revenue (2012/13: 8%). Subscription revenues make up 
9% of sales (2012/13: 6%). Rights and services revenues 
reduced by £1.0 million year on year following a very 
strong year in 2012/13. The Academic & Professional 
division generated 29% of Group sales this year (2012/13: 
29%).
In May 2014 the division was voted Academic, Educational 
and Professional Publisher of the Year at The Bookseller 
Industry Awards for the second year running. This prize 
goes to the company which best exhibits all-round 
excellence in its publishing including: the commercial 
success and innovation of the publishing programme; 
a sustainable and durable business; particularly with 
digital (including e-book and journal platforms, Virtual 
Learning Environments and internal digital workflow) 
and new ways to engage with learners; excellent relations 
and engagement with institutions, staff, faculty, teachers, 
professional organisations, learned societies and/or 
students; environmental awareness and responsibility; the 
retention and motivation of staff. The other companies 
on the shortlist were Oxford University Press, Sage and 
Palgrave Macmillan.
There is no evidence that competition is lessening in the 
academic market.  Library budgets worldwide remain 
constrained.  However, we expect digital sales to continue 
to grow much faster than the market overall as educational 
establishments at all levels adopt new ways of supporting 
students and faculty. 
We have seen sizeable revenue growth albeit from a low 
base from Bloomsbury India and Bloomsbury Australia.  
Sales to market of the division’s academic products 
and services are 50% outside the UK, and we expect this 
percentage to increase. 
The acquisition of Hart Publishing is consistent with 
Bloomsbury’s strategy to increase its proportion 
of academic and professional revenues to balance 
revenues generated from consumer sales. Academic and 
professional revenues are more predictable and have lower 
related costs of sale with higher margins and are much 
less reliant on retail bookshop sales. Around 50% of Hart’s 
revenue is generated outside the UK, thereby reducing 
Bloomsbury’s overall exposure to the UK book market. 
The acquisition will also enable the further development 
of Hart’s e-book catalogue and expand the Bloomsbury 
Professional digital range of services for lawyers and 
accountants.

Hart’s leading list of authors is complementary to 
Bloomsbury’s existing academic and professional lists, 
offering Bloomsbury the ability to improve revenue 
momentum within its Academic & Professional division 
in both the UK and a range of overseas markets. Hart 
published over 150 new books in the last 12 months and 
launched a new journal, Restorative Justice, and has a larger 
programme this year. 
Bloomsbury Professional’s Irish operation had a very good 
year of growth. Key to this success were new editions of 
Wylie, Irish Land Law and McMahon and Binchy, Law of Torts, 
both of which have been shortlisted for the Dublin Solicitors 
Bar Association’s Irish Law Book of the Year award.   The 
sixth online service from the Irish team, Irish Criminal Law, 
was launched in December 2013. This has been a strong 
addition to our highly regarded range of services and 
significant contracts have been won with the Attorney 
General’s Office, the Law Library of Ireland and the Garda 
Síochána Ombudsman Commission. In September 2013, 
in association with PricewaterhouseCoopers, we published 
the Manual of Accounting New UK GAAP which has quickly 
established a reputation as one of the leading products 
dealing with the new financial reporting landscape for 
unlisted companies.  
During the year Bloomsbury Professional also launched the 
online service, National Infrastructure Planning Service. 
We continue to invest in new digital services for academic 
customers.  Responding to increasing demand for a high 
quality online research tool for drama and literature 
students, professors and teachers, Drama Online 
was launched in March 2013 featuring content from 
Bloomsbury Methuen Drama, Arden Shakespeare and 
Faber & Faber. It currently contains over 1,000 plays in 
a fully cross-searchable format which allows students to 
interact with Character Grids and Part Books, as well as 
search for plays via cast size and monologues via gender. 
From January 2015 the collection will grow significantly to 
accommodate new content partners, Nick Hern Books and 
L.A. Theatre Works. Drama Online is used in leading higher 
education institutions around the world.

2013 also saw the launch of Actors and Performers,  
www.actorsandperformers.com, a professional community 
website for actors with blogs and advice from professionals 
and industry contact information from Actors’ Yearbook 
available on subscription.
In May 2014 we launched Bloomsbury Collections, an 
e-book platform which will make available the division’s 
entire research-led publishing programme.  We expect 
around 3,500 titles to be made available on the platform 
by the end of the calendar year.  In addition, Bloomsbury 
has recruited an institutional sales team, which will be 
responsible for selling the increasingly wide range of new 
services to libraries and institutions around the world.  They 
will also be responsible for selling Bloomsbury’s growing list 
of academic journals – currently over 50 – with new journal 
launches well advanced for this financial year.  This will 
further reduce the Group’s reliance on UK sales.
A new online platform, Bloomsbury Fashion Central, will 
be launched in 2015. It will feature Fairchild Books, Berg 
Fashion Library and Fashion Photography Archive. The 
investment in this platform aligns with the on-going 
industry migration from print to digital and will cement 
Bloomsbury’s dominant position in this niche. Beyond 
offering textbook rentals to students, the platform will 
provide a robust e-learning environment that will enable 
institutional and B2B subscription sales, raise profile and 
expand our market share in international markets. 
Adult — a spectacular year in both print and 
digital, fiction and non-fiction
Revenue was £49.9 million (2012/13: £44.3 million). Operating 
profit before highlighted items was £5.4 million (2012/13: 
£3.7 million). The operating profit margin before highlighted 
items for the division was 11% (2012/13: 8%). Print sales 
increased by 17%, while digital sales increased by 26% to 
£7.1 million, representing 14% of sales (2012/13: 13%).
Whilst US e-book sales growth has moderated, the UK and 
other markets still see robust growth with potential for 
even more as digital reading devices become ever more 
widespread in the high-growth economies of Asia, Africa, 
the Middle East and Latin America.
Samantha Shannon’s The Bone Season was simultaneously 
published worldwide and appeared on the New York Times 
and the Sunday Times bestseller lists in addition to enjoying 
success throughout the English-speaking world in print, 
digital and digital audio. We had a very successful global 
marketing campaign driving it to bestseller lists across the 
UK, the US and India. The film rights have been acquired by 
20
th
 Century Fox/Chernin Entertainment. The next volume 
of this seven-book series, The Mime Order, will be published 
in October 2014. Khaled Hosseini’s brilliant and moving 
Bloomsbury publishes a top selling series of accountancy manuals in 
association with PwC which are used by accountancy professionals.
Drama Online is a subscription service providing a resource for plays, 
critical analysis and performance featuring pre-eminent drama lists.
Berg Fashion Library is a strong selling online reference. A new online

New titles in 2014 include Kwasi Kwarteng’s War and 
Gold, Kamila Shamsie’s A God in Every Stone, Mumsnet’s 
cookbook Top Bananas, Alex Bellos’s Alex Through the

Jason Atherton’s Social Suppers and Roz Chast’s Can’t 
We Talk About Something More Pleasant? which reached 
Number One on the New York Times Graphic Books 
bestseller list in the first month of publication.
We continued to innovate with Bloomsbury Reader, Public 
Library Online, Reed’s Nautical Almanac for the iPad 
(sponsored by Aberdeen Global Asset Management), and 
most recently the launch of www.writersandartists.co.uk/
self-publishing, the essential comparison guide for authors 
to identify the best self-publishing companies.
Children’s & Educational — strategic 
investment pays off
Revenue was £23.6 million (2012/13: £21.3 million). 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £2.0 million 
(2012/13: £1.1 million). The operating profit margin before 
highlighted items for the division was 8% (2012/13: 5%).
Much of the growth this year came from sales of new 
books within the UK, with a significant proportion of that 
coming from illustrated books in line with our strategy. The 
division’s UK consumer print sales increased by 21.5% in a 
market which declined by 3.6% (source: Nielsen Bookscan).  
In the US, revenues were down by 1%, mainly due to soft 
e-book sales. 
Our strategic priorities remain focused on commercial 
global acquisitions for the consumer lists and targeted 
strategic marketing of our strong brands. Our new imprint 
Bloomsbury Activity Books and the Bloomsbury Picture 
Book list remain growth focused - the breadth of publishing 
achieved by the launch of these two lists shifts our world 
rights ownership from 43% of the list in 2011 to 63% of the 
list in 2013. 13% of sales from our consumer new releases in 
the year were illustrated titles compared to 7% in 2012/13.
The education business remains stable and profitable. 
Focus for the year has been on the development of a new 
print edition and online subscription service for Music 
Express, the UK’s best selling and award winning primary 
classroom music resource. The online service will launch in 
August 2014.  The division produced The RSC Shakespeare 
Toolkit for Primary Teachers, an active approach to bringing 
Shakespeare’s plays to life in the classroom.

Digital sales in the division fell in value in the year to 8% 
of total net sales from 10%. In the US digital sales fell from 
20% of total net sales to 16%, whereas in the UK they were 
broadly as last year. The digital market for children’s titles is 
still predominantly led by Young Adult fiction.  Bloomsbury 
Spark, our e-first imprint, launched with seven titles in 
December and sales have been good, particularly in the US.
Publishing highlights included Fortunately, the Milk... by 
Neil Gaiman. It was shortlisted for the Specsavers Children’s 
Book of the Year and chosen by the independent sector as 
the only children’s book in the Independent Bookshops’ 
Best Books of the Year. The author spoke to an audience of 
over 2,500 at a London event held in conjunction with Time 
Out and Foyles. We have successfully acquired a graphic 
novel of The Graveyard Book in two parts, a new middle 
grade novel for publication in 2016, and world rights 
(excluding North America) in a new illustrated book called 
The Sleeper and the Spindle, to be illustrated by Chris Riddell. 
Jessica Day George was in the New York Times bestseller 
list with Wednesdays in the Tower and  sales grew strongly. 
Sarah J. Maas also hit the list with her sequel to Throne of 
Glass, Crown of Midnight. This publication was supported by 
our biggest global marketing campaign of the year. Throne 
of Glass is now available in 16 languages. 
Bloomsbury Picture Books had a strong year with Shh! Don’t 
Wake the Royal Baby! by Martha Mumford and Ada Gray 
hitting the bestseller lists in July and being the biggest 
selling debut picture book of the year in the UK. 
Jim Kay has been announced as the illustrator of the colour 
illustrated editions of Harry Potter. We also launched our 
new jacket look for the children’s editions in March, by 
Jonny Duddle, and announced our year-long Harry Potter 
marketing campaign. The new editions are being published 
in September 2014.
We remain dedicated and passionate about the future 
of children’s publishing, in all formats, and continue to 
encourage a love of reading. 
Information — expanding knowledge hubs
The core activities of Information are the development of IP-
rich knowledge hubs in cooperation with external partners, 
the provision of management, publishing and consultancy 
services and the publication of business, management, 
finance and reference titles in print and digital formats.
Revenue was £3.9 million, up 2% on £3.8 million for 
2012/13. Operating profit before highlighted items was £1.1 
million, down from £2.3 million in 2012/13 mainly due to 
higher project costs and a strategic investment in new staff 
to move the division from purely a UK base to a more global 
reach. Rights and services revenue of £3.4 million made up 
89% of total revenue (2012/13: 90%).

Key achievements in the year for the division were a 
new content licence agreement with Lloyds Bank, a new 
publishing services arrangement with Ernst & Young and a 
publishing consultancy for the University of London.
Our flagship knowledge hub, www.QFinance.com, is the 
website of best practice for finance professionals created by 
Bloomsbury in partnership with the Qatar Financial Centre 
Authority.  It has several hundred thousand unique visitors 
per month, the impact of which is enhanced by the use of 
social media.  
In May 2014 we launched IZA World of Labor (wol.iza.org), 
a knowledge hub targeted at policy makers in the field of 
labour economics which covers topics such as migration 
and minimum wage. It was previewed in Washington D.C. in 
November 2013 to an audience including the World Bank 
and International Monetary Fund.  
Bloomsbury continues its provision of management 
services to the Qatar Foundation to manage Bloomsbury 
Qatar Foundation. The Open Access journals portal,  
www.qscience.com, showed good growth and its first 
journals are being tracked for impact factors, a testimony to 
the quality of the content.
This expansion of activity and customer base is helping to 
deliver the division’s strategy to increase revenues from 
digital knowledge hubs as part of the Group’s overall 
digital strategy and to broaden the base for the services, 
partnerships and consultancy in a complex economic 
environment. We are working on the renewal of two 
contracts with our long-term partners.
The investment already made, together with further 
investment in the new financial year, is intended to help 
increase the pipeline of projects and long-term contracts. 
The market for the services which Information specialises in 
remains complex, but more positive economic conditions 
will also be beneficial.  The division remains well placed to 
exploit digital, management services and other innovative 
business opportunities for the Group. 
Bloomsbury’s Strategy 
Bloomsbury is a global, fully integrated publisher of 
books and other media for general readers, children, 
students, researchers and professionals throughout the 
world. Bloomsbury uniquely offers authors access to these 
multiple markets in multiple formats throughout the world: 
in print, through e-books, through digital downloads and 
apps; in schools, in libraries, in universities, and in terrestrial 
and internet bookshops, with entrepreneurial teams in New 
York, London, New Delhi and Sydney serving all territories. 
www.QFinance.com is the website of best practice for finance 
professionals created by Bloomsbury in partnership with the Qatar 
Financial Centre Authority.
www.qscience.com is the The Open Access journals portal developed 
by Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Journals to create a unique and 
collaborative research environment for Qatar and the rest of the world.

The Academic & Professional division’s aim is to be the 
number one applied visual arts publisher in the world 
and the number one independent humanities and social 
sciences publisher in Europe, with half of its revenue 
derived from digital and subscription-based products.
The Adult division aims to be the number one UK publisher 
of choice in cookery, sport and natural history and in the 
top ten for UK quality fiction. 
Our overall strategy for Children’s & Educational books 
is to be recognised for great author care, independent 
spirit and innovation. Over the next five years we will 
develop Bloomsbury Activity books to be a leading, profit 
generating list for the division, with half of the consumer 
frontlist being illustrated books and 25% of all publishing 
being in a digital format. 
The Information division strategy is to increase revenues 
from digital knowledge hubs and broaden the base for 
services and partnerships. Over the next few years we 
intend to expand from the division’s UK base and develop a 
global capability. 
The Group is making progress towards these longer-term 
targets.
Bloomsbury’s overall long-term strategy for growth 
is centred on building its non-consumer publishing, 
specifically its Academic & Professional division, to balance 
the consumer revenues in the business. The business has 
a growing portfolio of valuable intellectual property, an 
innovative staff team and the respected Bloomsbury brand 
to help achieve its aims.
Outlook
Bloomsbury’s publishing programme for 2014/15 includes 
new titles from Tom Kerridge, Paul Hollywood and Hugh 
Fearnley-Whittingstall, as well as a range of paperbacks 
from this year’s successful hardback list including And the 
Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini, The Signature of All 
Things by Elizabeth Gilbert, The Bone Season by Samantha 
Shannon and Can’t we talk about something more 
pleasant? by Roz Chast. 
In 2014/15 we will continue to invest in the business in 
a number of areas; the launch of new digital services 
for academic and general customers, a new internal 
institutional digital sales force, a year-long Harry Potter 
marketing campaign, which will accompany the new 
jackets, and new staff for global business development at 
Bloomsbury Information.

2014/15 has a strong publishing pipeline of many new titles with the

Strategy for growth
Bloomsbury Information is the youngest of Bloomsbury’s four global divisions, having been set up in March 2011. We are 
expanding our resources to drive additional revenue and plan to establish ourselves across Bloomsbury’s global offices. 
Our focus on providing high margin services to third parties is gathering pace as the economy exits from the recession. 
Investment in additional resource will aid that growth.

Overview
In 2013/14 Bloomsbury increased sales by 11% to £109.5 million generating £13.0 million of profit before tax and 
highlighted items, up 4% on the previous year.
The results for this year largely reflect:
 ✷ strong new book sales in the Adult and Children’s & Educational divisions;
 ✷ continuing organic growth in our Academic & Professional division;
 ✷ a contribution from Hart Publishing, which we acquired in September 2013; and
 ✷ lower profits from the Information division due to higher project costs and investment to extend its global reach.
Our Continuing results history for the last four years is shown in the graph below:
*  Revenue and operating profit are for 12 months ended 28/29 February. Operating profit is stated before highlighted items. On 28 February 2012 the Company sold 
Bloomsbury Verlag, its subsidiary in Germany, following a strategic decision to concentrate on English language publishing. Results for 2011/12 and earlier years 
exclude this subsidiary.
On 2 September 2013, we acquired Hart Publishing (‘Hart’). Our other significant acquisitions in the past two years 
were Fairchild Books acquired on 30 March 2012 and Applied Visual Arts Publishing (’AVA’) acquired on 29 June 2012. 
Underlying numbers disclosed below exclude the results of Hart, Fairchild Books and AVA. All these businesses are in the 
Academic & Professional division.
There have been no changes in accounting policies in the year, with the exception of the adoption of a number of new 
accounting standards which have not had a material impact on the Group’s results.

Revenue
The Group’s revenues arise from publishing services and 
related revenue. Publishing services principally comprise 
editing, marketing, selling and distribution of titles either in 
print or digital formats. Related revenue is disclosed in the 
rights and services table below.
Group revenue for the year was £109.5 million, up 11% on 
the year ended 28 February 2013 of £98.5 million. There 
was growth year on year of 13% in the Adult division and 
11% in each of the Academic & Professional and Children’s 
& Educational divisions. The Hart acquisition contributed 
£1.8 million to revenue and £0.5 million to operating profit 
before highlighted items. 
Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Hart, Fairchild 
Books and AVA, the Group’s underlying revenue in the year 
ended 28 February 2014 of £101.5 million was up on a like-
for-like basis by 10% (2012/13: £92.5 million). 
Title sales grew by 16% year on year. Within that there was 
growth in both print and digital formats. Print sales were 
81% of total sales, up £11.9 million, 16%, year on year, 
and up £10.4 million, 15% on an underlying basis. Digital 
sales comprise e-book sales and growing online revenues. 
E-book sales were up 15% year on year to £10.5 million, 
and are 10% of Group revenues (2012/13: 9%). Given the 
nature of e-books, most of this growth was in the Adult 
division, where 14% of sales were e-books (2012/13: 13%). 
Overall 13% of sales in the US were of e-books and 9% in 
the UK. Online digital revenues had strong growth and 
were up £0.8 million, 84% to £1.7 million, and are now 2% 
of Group revenue (2012/13: 1%), mainly in the Academic & 
Professional division.

Rights and services revenue was down by £3.0 million on 
last year’s strong result. The two key areas that drive this 
revenue are copyright licence sales and management 
contract income. Copyright licences include the sale of 
foreign language or online rights to our titles. Revenue 
has reduced year on year by £2.5 million as fewer deals 
were completed and at lower amounts. Trademark licence 
revenue in 2011/12 included income from rights following 
the Bloomsbury Verlag disposal. Management contracts 
include revenues from the IZA World of Labor deal, signed 
in 2011, and from our management contract in Qatar. The 
top three revenue sources in 2012/13 delivered £3.4 million 
profit (35% of total rights and services profit) whereas in 
2013/14 the top three sources delivered £2.8 million or 43% 
of this profit.
The chart below shows where Group revenues were 
generated for the year ended 28 February 2014. 
Proportions are similar to last year, except for the new entry

Gross profit margin and operating profit
The gross margin reduced year on year from 58% to 57% 
of revenue. This is mainly because a lower proportion of 
higher margin rights and services revenues was generated 
year on year. Within this, stock costs included a one-off 
additional provision of £0.8 million in the US Academic & 
Professional division. Author costs, which consist of royalties 
and advance provision, reduced as a percentage of 
revenues year on year. 
Group marketing and distribution costs remained at 15%  
of title revenues.
The business incurred £0.7 million of extra on-going 
administration costs in 2013/14 relating to acquisitions and 
the new business in India, and invested an extra £0.4 million 
in IT, Digital Development, Production and Operations 
in facilitating the strategic move to digital workflows 
and extending Bloomsbury Information’s global reach. 
Excluding these, administration costs in the rest of the 
business were up by 4% to £33.3 million. This follows the 1% 
reduction last year in underlying administration costs.
Group operating profit before highlighted items for the 
year was £13.0 million, up 5% on last year. The operating 
profit margin before highlighted items for the Group 
was 11.9% (2012/13: 12.6%) largely reflecting the lower 
proportion of higher margin rights and services revenues 
year on year.
The acquisition of Hart and restructuring costs within 
the One Global Bloomsbury initiative resulted in costs 
which, together with intangible amortisation, have 
been highlighted separately in the financial statements. 
Intangible amortisation includes an amount of £1.1 million 
(2012/13: £0.7 million) in relation to product and systems 
development.

Divisional financial highlights are noted below and further 
information by division is given in the Divisional Review 
section of the Chief Executive’s Review.
The Academic & Professional division has grown 
significantly during 2012/13 and 2013/14 through 
acquisitions, organic growth in digital subscription-based 
publishing and innovative deals with publishing partners. 
Growth in Academic & Professional revenues is core to 
our strategy to balance consumer and non-consumer 
revenues. This division makes up 29% of Group revenue 
(2012/13: 29%). The division’s operating profit was affected 
by lower rights and services profit and a one-off £0.8 million 
additional US stock provision. Academic & Professional  
sales grew by 11% year on year. Digital sales were up  
£0.9 million, 39%, within which online digital sales were 
up £0.7 million, 76% to £1.6 million which includes sales 
of Drama Online, Churchill Archive and Bloomsbury 
Professional. On an underlying basis, before the acquisitions 
made in the last two years, title sales in the division were 
up by 11% year on year. Underlying rights and services 
revenue was down £1.0 million year on year following a 
very strong result in 2012/13.
In the Adult division sales were 13% up year on year. This 
was the strongest year for the division ever. There were 
several bestsellers on frontlist titles: And the Mountains 
Echoed by Khaled Hosseini, Tom Kerridge’s Proper Pub 
Food, Paul Hollywood’s Pies and Puds, The Bone Season 
by Samantha Shannon, Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack 
2013 and The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert. 
The increase in sales resulted in a £1.7 million increase in 
operating profit. E-book revenues rose 25% year on year 
to £7.0 million, which represented 14% of the division’s 
total revenues compared to 13% in the previous year. 
This division makes up 46% of Group revenue (2012/13: 
45%). The Lowland by Jumpa Lahiri was a finalist for the 
Man Booker Prize 2013. Our cookery titles by Tom Kerridge 
and Paul Hollywood tied into BBC TV series. Film rights to 
The Bone Season have been acquired by 20

The Children’s & Educational division sales were 11% 
up year on year. The increase was in print sales. This 
included Harry Potter Box sets, Hogwarts Library Box set and 
Fortunately, the Milk... by Neil Gaiman and in the Education 
list RSC Shakespeare Toolkit for Primary Schools. The division 
makes up 21% of Group revenue (2012/13: 22%).
The Information division generated 89% of its revenue 
from rights and services. This was mainly management 
services fees and included fees for the businesses we 
manage in Qatar and our World of Labor project with the 
IZA in Germany, which is generating £4.3 million of revenue 
over five years. The division’s operating profit before 
highlighted items was £1.1 million (2012/13: £2.3 million). 
The reduction in profit is because of higher project costs 
being incurred in 2013/14.

Acquisitions
On 2 September 2013 the Group acquired the issued share 
capital of Hart for a total consideration of £6.7 million. The 
acquisition reflected Bloomsbury’s strategy to increase 
its proportion of non-consumer revenues. Goodwill of 
£4.6 million arose on the acquisition, and intangible assets 
of £2.2 million were identified for publishing rights and 
imprints acquired. The consideration was payable in two 
instalments, commencing at the acquisition date and 
followed by an earn out which related to the period ended 
31 March 2014. The acquisition contributed £1.8 million 
of revenue and £0.5 million of incremental profit to the 
Academic & Professional division this year.
On 4 September 2013 we acquired the natural history list 
from New Holland Publishers for a cash consideration of 
£0.4 million, as part of our strategy to become the number 
one UK publisher of natural history. Goodwill of £0.1 million 
arose on the acquisition, and intangible assets of £0.2 
million were identified for publishing rights acquired. 
Interest
The net interest expense for the Group for the year was 
£0.03 million compared with an income of £0.09 million 
for 2012/13 due to lower net cash levels, which reduced 
following acquisitions.
Taxation
Taxation on continuing operations was £1.8 million for  
the year, compared to £2.0 million for the year ended  
28 February 2013. The effective tax rate was 18.7% (2012/13: 
20.6%). Excluding the effect of highlighted and other 
non-recurring items, the effective tax rate for the Group 
was 18.3% (2012/13: 21.4%), consistent with the reduction 
in the UK tax rate which impacted current and deferred tax 
and the release of some prior year provisions no longer 
required.
Earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items, 
were up by 9% year on year to 14.23 pence (2012/13: 
13.11 pence) reflecting the growth in profit before tax and 
highlighted items and the lower effective tax rate. Diluted 
earnings per share were up by 4% year on year to 10.43 
pence (2012/13: 9.99 pence).
Dividend and dividend policy
The Group has a progressive dividend policy and aims to 
keep dividend cover in excess of two. In line with this policy 
the Directors are recommending a final dividend of 4.84 
pence per share, which subject to shareholder approval at 
our Annual General Meeting on 22 July 2014, will be paid 
on 24 September 2014 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 29 August 2014. Together with the 
interim dividend, this makes a total dividend for the year 
ended 28 February 2014 of 5.82 pence per share, a 5.8% 
increase on the 5.50 pence dividend for the year ended  
28 February 2013. Over the past eight years the dividend 
has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6%.

Total as at 28 February 2013 154.0 39.2 114.8
Increase 4.1 2.9 1.2
The Group’s key assets were goodwill and intangible 
assets, net trade receivables, advance prepayments and 
inventories. 
Net assets increased by 1% to £116.0 million (2013: £114.8 
million) and net assets per share by 1% to 157 pence (2013: 
155 pence). The main movements in the balance sheet are 
explained below. 
Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets increased by £5.6 million to 
£60.8 million (2013: £55.2 million) due to:
 ✷ the acquisitions of Hart and the New Holland list 
increasing goodwill by £4.7 million and other 
intangibles by £2.4 million; 
 ✷ additions to product and systems development 
and assets under construction of £1.7 million (which 
includes Academic & Professional online knowledge 
hubs); less
 ✷ £2.8 million of amortisation and £0.4 million of 
exchange differences.
Inventories reduced 1% to £25.2 million (2013: £25.6 
million). This includes £0.6 million of stock acquired as 
part of the Hart acquisition, offset by a £0.8 million one-off 
additional stock provision in the US.
Trade and other receivables were £56.8 million (2013: £53.6 
million). The acquisition of Hart added £0.7 million to trade 
receivables and there was an increase of £2.5 million in 
trade receivables from increased trading. 
Since books sold are generally returnable by customers, 
the Group makes a provision against books sold in the 
accounting year. The unused provision at the year end is 
then carried forward and offset against trade receivables 
in the balance sheet, in anticipation of further book returns 
subsequent to the year end. A provision for the Group of 
£4.7 million (2013: £5.3 million) for future returns relating 
to 2013/14 and prior year sales has been carried forward in 
trade receivables at the balance sheet date. This provision 
was 15% of gross trade receivables (2013: 18%). The 
reduction reflects reducing return trends as more sales are 
moving to online channels and e-book sales increase.
As at 28 February 2014 the Group had 3,579 titles (2013: 
4,043) under contract for future publication, with a gross 
investment of £21.1 million (2013: £24.2 million).  After 
payment of the initial tranches of advances to authors, our 
year end commitment for future cash payments on these 
contracted titles fell to £12.2 million (2013: £14.7 million).

Equity and liabilities
At 28 February 2014 total equity was £116.0 million (2013: 
£114.8 million). The increase of £1.2 million was due to a 
decrease of £3.2 million from the cumulative currency 
translations, dividends of £4.0 million (2012/13: £3.8 million), 
offset by share-based payment transactions of £0.6 million 
and the retained profit for the year of £7.7 million (2012/13: 
£7.5 million) after highlighted items of £3.5 million (2012/13: 
after highlighted items of £2.7 million).
Current liabilities increased 15% to £37.8 million (2013: 
£32.9 million). Trade payables increased to £13.7 million 
(2013: £12.0 million) due to an increase in trading levels. 
Accruals and deferred income, which is included in trade 
and other payables, increased to £17.5 million (2013: 
£14.9 million). This includes deferred income on database 
contracts, subscription revenues and royalty payments due 
to authors, which vary year on year depending on revenue 
and authors’ royalty rates. Other payables decreased to 
£3.4 million (2013: £4.1 million) which includes £2.0 million 
to cover the third and final instalment of the Fairchild 
Books and AVA purchase prices (2013: £2.0 million second 
instalment). Provisions increased to £0.5 million (2013: £0.1 
million) to cover the £0.5 million potential earn out on the 
acquisition of Hart.
Non-current liabilities reduced 33% to £4.3 million (2013: 
£6.4 million). Within that, other payables reduced to £0.6 
million (2013: £2.5 million) due to the £2.0 million accrual of 
the final instalment of the Fairchild Books and AVA purchase 
price moving to current liabilities. The deferred tax liability 
of £3.2 million primarily relates to intangible assets arising 
on acquisitions. This is reducing as the relevant intangibles 
are amortised. 
Cash
Cash and cash equivalents were £10.0 million at the 
year end (2013: £14.6 million). The net cash inflow from 
operating activities, including the effect of highlighted 
items, was £11.1 million, £3.2 million better than 2012/13. 
Investing activities for the year ended 28 February 2014 
resulted in an outflow of £11.0 million (2013: £2.4 million) 
largely from the acquisition of Hart, instalment payments 
for Fairchild and AVA acquired in the previous year and 
the purchase of intangible assets; the outflow in 2012/13 
included the acquisitions of Fairchild Books and AVA and 
purchase of intangible assets. Hart was acquired for £6.7 
million, £0.5 million of which is due after the year end. The 
acquisitions of Fairchild Books and AVA in 2012 are being 
financed in cash in three equal annual instalments with no 
interest on the deferred cash payments. £2.0 million was 
paid in respect of these acquisitions in the year and there is 
one instalment remaining for each, to be paid in 2014/15. 
The net cash of £4.1 million used in financing activities was 
predominantly made up of dividends of £4.0 million (2013: 
£3.8 million). 
Liquidity 
The Group has an unsecured credit facility with Lloyds 
Bank. At 28 February 2014 the Group had £10 million of 
committed loan facility (2013: £10 million) and £2 million of 
overdraft facility (2013: £2 million) undrawn at the year end. 
The loan facility was drawn down to fund the acquisition 
of Hart and was repaid before the year end. The overdraft 
facility is available until November 2014 and the loan facility 
matures in July 2016. The facility is subject to two covenants 
being a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio and a minimum 
interest cover covenant. 
The Group’s net cash position changes over the course of 
the year as a result of the seasonality of the business with the 
most significant expenses being the payment of royalties in 
March and September and the most significant sale receipts 
being in February from the Christmas sales.

utlined in the table on pages 37 to 38 is a 
description of risk factors that management 
considers are relevant to the Group’s business. 
Not all the factors are within management’s 
control and other factors besides those listed below could 
also affect the Group. Actions being taken by management 
to mitigate risk factors should be considered in conjunction 
with the cautionary statement to shareholders in the 
Directors’ Report on page 52 with regards to forward 
looking statements. Details on financial risk management 
are given in note 23. 
Our strategy
The Group’s mission is to grow a high quality global 
publishing business delivering high value to its authors and 
other contributors, readers and shareholders. 
We achieve this mission through our strategy, which is to: 
 ✷ Publish authors and works of excellence and originality. 
 ✷ Deliver professional services to those seeking 
publication. 
 ✷ Combine tradition and technology to achieve 
excellence. 
 ✷ Establish solid profit streams. 
Key objectives include: 
 ✷ Grow non-consumer revenues so that they match 
or exceed our consumer revenues. This is because 
these revenues have higher margins, are generally 
a more predictable revenue stream, are less reliant 
on the retail bookshop environment and have more 
digital opportunities. Non-consumer revenues mainly 
comprise those in our Academic & Professional and 
Information divisions. 
 ✷ Continue acquisition of rights to publish outstanding 
works by undiscovered and established authors. 
 ✷ Expand internationally in English language markets. 
This reduces the Group’s reliance on the UK market 
and, in particular, takes advantage of the biggest 
academic market worldwide in the US and the 
significant growth in India. 
 ✷ Create and exploit copyright and IP including by 
licensing information databases to support major 
institutions and corporations. 
 ✷ Benefit from the digital opportunity, both in cost saving 
and market expansion.
 ✷ Deliver excellent service to our authors.
Information of how we take account of social and 
environmental matters when implementing our strategy is 
included in Corporate Responsibility on pages 39 to 45.
Overview of Bloomsbury’s processes
Bloomsbury is an independent publisher and has been 
listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange 
since 1994. Over a period of more than 25 years the business 
has built up a substantial body of publishing rights.
The Group is structured as four fully integrated worldwide 
publishing divisions — Adult, Children’s & Educational, 
Academic & Professional and Information — under a 
global brand supported by centralised sales, marketing, 
production and head office functions. Each publishing 
division reports to the Chief Executive. The Group 
encourages each publishing division to develop and grow 
diversified income streams. Each division has the capability 
to publish books in all formats but may also produce 
other products such as online content accessible through 
subscription. Each division may also use its expertise to 
provide publishing related services to clients. 
Book publishing
Publishing e-books and printed books is the main activity 
of Bloomsbury. Publishing teams acquire the intellectual 
property rights to publish the works of authors. Bloomsbury 
sells its own books typically through online retailers such as 
Amazon, through bookshops, through supermarkets and 
direct to customers.
Bloomsbury’s global production function produces books 
in all formats. Bloomsbury has produced e-books since 2005 
and as an early adopter has benefited from the worldwide 
growth in e-book sales. Printed books that are sold through 
retail outlets are normally sold on a sale-or-return basis. 
The Group does not print its own books but subcontracts 
the printing, warehouse storage and distribution of printed 
books to a number of long-term global partners.

Group strategic actions to mitigate the risks 
The Group focuses on improving its processes in order to 
address the identified risks and has implemented a number 
of key initiatives including: 
Repositioning the business towards non-consumer 
revenues 
Bloomsbury is a cash generative business and has enjoyed 
the benefit of publishing many bestselling titles over a 
prolonged period. Bloomsbury has balanced its core 
general consumer publishing business with academic and 
professional publishing. This addresses a number of risks: 
 ✷ Long-term growth potential, less sales volatility 
and higher margins: The demand for academic and 
professional books is more regular which reduces the 
volatility of book sales compared to general consumer 
publishing. 
 ✷ Barriers to entry: Since acquiring Methuen Drama in 
2006, Bloomsbury has continuously invested in growing 
its academic publishing business through organic 
growth and acquisitions of publishing businesses, lists 
of academic books and online databases. The academic 
publishing division has been consolidated into a 
substantial unified worldwide publisher with a strong  
US footprint and with a number of market leading 
subject areas.
 ✷ Established business: Bloomsbury is successfully 
developing its established position in the professional 
publishing market. 
 ✷ Exploiting intellectual property: Bloomsbury is 
developing innovative academic online products which 
are sold under annual subscriptions and which exploit 
the Group’s content assets and expertise. 
 ✷ Lower risk: Academic publishing acquisitions require 
lower advances and have lower returns of unsold 
copies from booksellers. 
Growth in emerging markets 
India has one of the world’s largest English speaking 
populations and an increasing number of highly educated 
readers of English. Bloomsbury has a growing publishing 
business in India which publishes the works of local talented 
authors in addition to the works of Bloomsbury authors 
originally published in the UK and the US. 
One Global Bloomsbury 
From 2011 the Group has implemented One Global 
Bloomsbury which is the approach of four worldwide 
publishing divisions under a global brand supported by 
centralised sales, marketing, production and head office 
functions. To support One Global Bloomsbury the Group 
has global information systems and processes. One Global 
Bloomsbury and the global processes address a number of 
risks and process areas: 
 ✷ Extended territorial reach of the sales and marketing 
teams: Sales and marketing teams have been unified 
into a single global function to meet the needs of a 
worldwide market. 
 ✷ Editorial economies of scale: Editorial teams have an 
increased focus on acquiring the world rights. 
 ✷ Functional economies of scale: The Production 
function (which takes finalised scripts from editorial 
teams and converts them into e-books and/or printed 
books), Finance and IT teams have been unified into 
global functions to support the Bloomsbury publishing 
teams based in different territories worldwide.
 ✷ Worldwide systems and processes: The Group has 
implemented centralised publishing and finance 
systems worldwide across the business allowing the 
global team to work more closely together.

Bloomsbury’s core business is the worldwide promotion of high quality literature 
and literacy for readers of all ages, which in itself has a high social value. We 
focus on integrity in all our activities, consider our impact on society and the 
environment and maintain high ethical standards. This is key to our commercial 
success and ability to deliver good returns to our shareholders, which depends 
on attracting and retaining talented authors who want us to publish them and 
customers who want to buy our products.
T
he Board recognises that the achievements 
of the Group have depended upon the high 
standards of social responsibility demonstrated 
by the Directors and employees for more than 
25 years. The Board takes account of the relevant social, 
environmental and ethical issues and associated risks and 
opportunities to the Group’s short-term and long-term 
value. The Company continues to be included in the 
FTSE4good index.
Community 
Bloomsbury has a direct impact on the community through 
its commercial activities. Our publishing teams share a 
common passion for promoting the enjoyment of reading 
and high quality literature that is often cutting edge and 
provides new authors with opportunities to establish 
themselves. We have a substantial Children’s & Educational 
division focused on promoting literacy for young readers 
of all abilities and ages including specialist ranges for 
‘Hi-Low’ pupils (high age, low attainment) which provide 
parents and teachers with the tools needed to engage their 
children in reading.
Support by Bloomsbury
Incremental to our direct commercial activities and with 
a focus mainly on promoting literature, literacy and 
education, we actively support numerous organisations 
worldwide including schools, universities, libraries and 
other good causes and charities. The following examples 
illustrate the wide range of our support worldwide:
Corporate volunteering and educational 
development examples
 ✷ A Bloomsbury UK employee travelled to Nigeria to train 
170 teachers on the importance of reading and how to 
set up an effective classroom library.
 ✷ Our India office in partnership with the Hope 
Foundation published ‘Ten Steps To Good Health’, 
a book on basic health and hygiene for children. 
The book is being promoted through the India state 
education system for distribution to school children. 
Our Australia office supported an Indigenous Literacy 
Foundation event.
 ✷ We provide work experience days for secondary school 
pupils and sponsor achievement prizes for students 
within US and UK universities. We invite students to visit 
us for presentations on working in publishing.
 ✷ We invited a student of fashion studies to review our 
existing measures as an academic visual arts publisher 
and to suggest improvements to cater for students 
with visual or learning disabilities, especially for those 
with dyslexia or dyspraxia, for our books and online 
resources.
Corporate donating examples
 ✷ Our UK, US and Australia offices donate, or provide at a 
nominal cost, a substantial quantity of books each year 
which includes donations of mainstream titles to schools 
and libraries. For example our US office has donated 
significant quantities of books to an organisation 
setting up libraries in Africa. Other book donations have 
been to good causes such as to Barnardos, Oxfam, Red 
Cross and smaller organisations local to the Bloomsbury 
office.
 ✷ The Bloomsbury Institute (the events function of 
Bloomsbury) has organised charitable fundraising 
events such as for Book Aid, with Bob Geldof and 
William Boyd as guest speakers, and for Womankind to 
celebrate International Women’s Day, with Aminatta 
Forna as guest speaker.
 ✷ We are a sponsor and partner of World Book Day 
which was established by UNESCO to promote reading 
amongst children and adults. We made a minor 
financial contribution to support and attend at the 
Children’s Choice Book Awards, run by a US-based 
charity promoting reading and literacy.

We make a small number of targeted minor cash donations 
each year to not-for-profit organisations that support 
literature, literacy and education examples, of which 
in recent years have included donations to BookAid 
International, the Independent Publishers Guild and 
the Churchill Centre in support of our digitization of the

We encourage the spare time involvement of staff 
worldwide on supporting good causes and on the 
promotion of literature, literacy and education. These 
voluntary activities by employees are often directly or 
indirectly assisted by the business and by Bloomsbury 
colleagues. Examples of the many such activities recently 
undertaken are as follows:
Staff volunteering examples
 ✷ Our employees, both privately and through a 
Bloomsbury coordinator, are involved in formal 
volunteer reading schemes and regularly attend state 
schools and organise reading groups in libraries. These 
provide supervised reading support to young readers 
who are often from disadvantaged backgrounds 
where their opportunities to develop reading skills may 
be hindered. Bloomsbury employees also voluntarily 
attend schools and colleges to give talks on careers, 
such as in publishing and IT, with young people and 
assist with interview practice.
 ✷ In spare time, employees are unpaid public speakers 
at presentations, and they publish articles and host 
discussions on various publishing topics such as Open 
Access, how to write books and be published and 
careers in publishing. Our employees also support 
voluntary associations such as for editors promoting the 
publication of children’s books.
 ✷ In one Bloomsbury office the employees take turns to 
volunteer each week at a local charity for homeless and 
vulnerably housed people.
Staff donating examples
 ✷ Bloomsbury employees often call on their colleagues 
for fundraising sponsorship such as with cake sales, 
dress down days, marathons and other employee 
inspired activities. Our offices put up teams to 
participate in events such as charitable races.
Many employees worldwide are involved in their local 
communities promoting literacy, literature and education 
such as sitting on committees or as governors of schools, 
and by supporting special interest groups.
Diversity
We have a diverse workforce and management team led 
by a diverse Board. The majority of senior managers and 
employees worldwide in the Group are women. As at 28 
February 2014 the numbers of employees by each gender is:
Female Male
All employees of the 
Group
[1]
 365 (71%) 147 (29%)
Senior managers of the 
Group
[2]
5 3
Directors of the Group 
parent company 2 5
[1] Excludes Non-Executive Directors and workers who are freelance consultants 
and temporary staff.
[2] Includes the heads of publishing divisions, Group functions and country 
heads who are not Executive Directors on the parent company Board. 
Excludes two female statutory directors of UK subsidiary companies who, 
through their role as a statutory director, do not contribute significantly to 
the Group.
The aim of the Board is that at least one third, or the 
nearest number to a third, of Directors on the Board 
should be women. The Board comprises two women out 
of a total of seven Directors so achieves the aim. The Board 
is progressively refreshed and new appointments are 
selected by the Nomination Committee using independent 
search consultants based on merit as the best candidate for 
the role.
Employees and human rights
We recognise that people are a key asset and employment 
policies are directed at creating a workplace that attracts, 
motivates, develops and retains high calibre employees.
Supported by territory heads of human resources, the 
managing directors of the four publishing divisions, the 
heads of each Group function and managing directors of 
regional offices have responsibility for the employment 
matters (including human rights) of their teams. The 
Chief Executive has overall Board level responsibility for 
employment matters. For example, where employment 
matters have a Group wide impact or cannot be resolved 
at a lower level in the business then they may be referred to 
the Chief Executive. 
The senior management team monitors joiners, leavers, 
head count, pay rates and other KPIs but the Group does 
not disclose all of these for commercial reasons that are in 
the interest of the shareholders.

Key features of the Group’s employment policies and 
practices are: 
 ✷ Openness: Bloomsbury provides a high degree of 
openness and transparency on its activities and 
performance through information provided to 
employees. Employees are kept updated daily, 
weekly and monthly on sales, book releases, project 
achievements, corporate news and feedback from 
external media and other sources. The Bloomsbury 
Institute arranges regular events, which enable staff to 
meet socially. Weekly and other regular team meetings 
and internal annual conferences bring employees 
together from across the Group’s worldwide sites 
allowing team members to formally and informally 
share information about the business and develop 
strong working relationships. 
 ✷ Engagement: we promote a friendly collegiate culture 
in which employees are encouraged to discuss their 
concerns and issues with their line managers and 
senior colleagues. The senior management team 
meets frequently to discuss employee matters and is 
supported by regular operational meetings attended 
by managers covering all the Group’s worldwide sites. 
 ✷ Ethical behaviour: we expect employees, Directors, 
subcontractors and others to exercise the highest 
ethical standards at all times in respect of the 
relationships and dealings that Bloomsbury has with 
its customers, authors and agents, suppliers and 
other third parties. Bloomsbury has whistle-blower 
procedures, which it publishes at www.bloomsbury-ir.
co.uk enabling employees to have their concerns 
confidentially addressed. It also has a formal policy on 
ethical behaviour, which is included within employment 
terms. 
 ✷ Employee development: Bloomsbury is acquisitive 
and has benefited from an intake of high calibre 
entrepreneurs who support the Group’s capacity 
to innovate. The Group develops its management 
structure to serve the changing needs of customers 
and authors. This creates opportunities for suitably 
high calibre individuals to progress to increasing levels 
of seniority as they gain capabilities and expertise. 
External recruitment is supported by territorial Human 
Resources functions enabling vacancies across sites 
worldwide to be filled internally where employees of an 
appropriately high calibre seek new opportunities. 
 ✷ Performance and merit: senior employees agree 
personal objectives and are rewarded based on 
performance determined by business results and 
appraisals. Senior managers are accountable for the 
performance of their teams and determine the most 
appropriate approach to performance management 
for each team. Promotions and external recruitment 
are based on merit and ensure that the most suitable 
person is selected for each position. 
 ✷ Employee participation: the Group offers UK employees 
the opportunity to participate in an all employee HM 
Revenue and Customs approved Sharesave scheme to 
encourage employee participation in the performance 
and growth of the Group. High performing senior 
managers may also be eligible to participate in the 
Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan. 
 ✷ Flexible working: we have family friendly working 
practices such as flexible working hours and recognise 
that experienced employees returning to work 
following maternity, paternity or other career breaks 
are an asset. 
 ✷ Equality of opportunity: Bloomsbury has a diverse 
workforce and follows a policy that no employee 
or other person receives more or less favourable 
treatment on the grounds of gender, sexual 
orientation, colour, race and ethnic origin, nationality, 
religion, disability or age. This extends to any person 
known to be HIV positive. The Human Resources 
function monitors compliance with the policy and 
with applicable legislative requirements to ensure 
the equality of opportunity in the recruitment, 
selection and promotion of employees. Grievance 
and disciplinary procedures protect employees from 
discriminatory behaviours and attitudes. 
 ✷ Disabled persons: Group policy is to offer equal 
treatment in respect of the recruitment, training, career 
development and promotion of disabled persons. 
Should people become disabled during the course of 
their employment, the Group will seek to retain their 
services and to provide retraining where necessary.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OUR BUSINESS
Bloomsbury Annual Report 2014 FRONT Proof 9.indd   41 11/06/2014   16:47:04 23265-04 11 June 2014  Proof 9
 ✷ Human Rights: Bloomsbury is committed to meeting 
its responsibility to respect human rights. The nature 
of the business puts it at low risk of contributing to 
adverse human rights impacts. The heads of human 
resources monitor for human rights issues and ensure 
any remedial action that would be needed is taken 
promptly. Bloomsbury is committed to complying 
with employment and other legislation applicable to 
the locations in which it employs people ensuring the 
human rights of individuals are protected. 
Health and safety
The Company Secretary reporting to the Chief Executive in 
respect of Health and Safety (‘H&S’) heads an H&S team 
that ensures Group-wide compliance with H&S policy. 
At least annually the Board and senior team review H&S 
including risk assessments, developments and incident 
reports. The H&S team works closely with management 
and employees to ensure that the H&S policy is effectively 
communicated, implemented and maintained across the 
business. Managers of the worldwide sites are accountable 
for ensuring their areas of the business are in compliance 
with H&S policy.
The Group maintains H&S risk assessments and accident 
logs for all its locations worldwide (including where 
there is no local legal requirement to do so) and staff 
are encouraged to report all accidents or near misses. 
During the year there were no fatalities or serious injuries. 
Accidents reported have typically included infrequent 
bumps and scalds from hot drinks associated with the office 
environment. 
Environment 
The Board recognises that a responsible approach to the 
environment is attractive to its existing and prospective 
customers and authors. Customers can require Bloomsbury 
to demonstrate that the Group is a good corporate citizen 
during the tender process for new and existing contracts. 
The Executive Committee (which consists of the Executive 
Directors and the managing directors of the publishing 
divisions and Group functions) has responsibility for 
environmental matters of their teams. These people 
report to the Chief Executive who has overall Board level 
responsibility for environmental matters and issues. 
The impact on the environment of our business 
predominantly arises from the activities the Group 
subcontracts to its suppliers including the printing, 
production, distribution, recycling and disposal of printed 
books. Bloomsbury also has office-based editorial, product 
development, sales and administrative activities, which 
operate through an employee workforce based at offices 
in the UK, the US (New York), India (New Delhi) and Australia 
(Sydney). 
Our policy is to reduce both the financial cost to 
the business and the impact of the business on the 
environment. We employ specialist independent 
external advisors, Trucost, to monitor our impact on the 
environment. Key areas where we are active in reducing the 
direct and indirect environmental impact of the business 
include: 
 ✷ Online print: we are increasingly moving to e-books 
and online products that have very little direct 
environmental impact and will save on using natural 
resources. Our strategy embraces digital publishing 
and the potential benefits this may bring to the 
environment. 
 ✷ Book printing: we monitor the impact of our 
major suppliers and engage with them to reduce 
environmental impact where possible. We stipulate 
that the pulp used to produce the papers for our books 
comes from well-managed forests and encourage our 
suppliers to obtain Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 
accreditation and use FSC certified papers. The majority 
of our UK and European suppliers are FSC chain of 
custody certified and we select certified colour printers 
in Asia where we can. 
 ✷ Building and office facilities: most of our employees 
travel to work by public transport and we support part-
time and home-working. For most employees we have 
implemented separate recycling bins for different waste 
materials so that a significant proportion of our office 
waste is recycled. Our office policy is to turn off lights 
out of hours when not in use. 
We have previously taken advice from the Carbon Trust 
and continue to apply their recommendations to reduce 
our carbon footprint. For example, we use point of use 
instead of bottled water coolers, fit energy efficient lamps, 
ensure heating systems are regularly maintained and 
programmed efficiently and turn off unnecessary electrical 
equipment out of hours amongst other measures.

Environmental targets 
Our target is to beat the greenhouse gas and waste 
production normalised tonnes per £m revenue averaged 
for the previous two years. By setting such a target we are 
focused on continuously increasing our efficiency at using 
natural resources. 
Our direct operations are predominately office-based 
and have been independently assessed as having a low 
impact on the environment. The Group’s consumption of 
natural resources, although relatively minor, is significantly 
impacted by ambient weather conditions beyond our 
control and by the buildings we lease. Over the most recent 
three years we have changed offices in London, New 
York, New Delhi and Sydney and reduced the number of 
buildings we occupy which has helped us to reduce our 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 impacts (see below). 
Greenhouse gases
Our independent external advisor, Trucost, has calculated 
the tables below based on data we have provided. 
We report on our waste production and greenhouse 
gas emissions in alignment with the 2006 Government 
Guidelines, Environmental Key Performance Indicators, 
Reporting Guidelines for UK Businesses. In respect of 
greenhouse gases we report consumption of natural gas, 
vehicle fuel and electricity in kWh, converted to CO
2
-e 
following the protocols provided by the Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Emissions 
have been categorised against the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol scopes of reporting. This information is unaudited.

Directors 
The names of the Directors as at the date of this report, together with biographical details, are set out on pages 46 and 47, 
which forms part of the Directors’ Report. The Directors serving on the Board of the Company during the year were  
as follows: 
Date appointed Date resigned
Executive Directors

Wendy Pallot – –
Chairman and Independent Non-Executive Directors
Sir Anthony Salz 29 August 2013 –

Details of Directors’ service contracts and Directors’ 
interests in shares, awards and options are shown in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 81. Other 
than as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
none of the Directors held any interest, either during or 
at the end of the financial year, in any material contract 
or arrangement with the Company or any subsidiary 
undertaking. The terms of termination of the Directors’ 
contracts are described in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report set out in pages 65 to 81 which includes details 
of any agreements by which the Company would pay 
compensation to its Directors for loss of office, for loss of 
employment or would make payments in respect of a 
change of control of the Company.
Company policy is to appoint Directors to the Board on 
the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. 
This may be as part of the progressive refreshing of the 
Board, to reappoint a Director retiring by rotation, to fill a 
vacancy arising as a result of a retiring Director or as part of 
measures taken to enhance the skills, experience, capability 
and balance of the Board. 
The effect of the Company’s Articles of Association is to 
require that new Directors appointed by the Board must 
offer themselves for election at the next Annual General 
Meeting. Accordingly, Sir Anthony Salz, Jill Jones and 
Stephen Page shall retire at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’). All three being eligible offer 
themselves for election. 
The Articles require that one third of Directors who have 
remained in office for the longest period since being 
elected or re-elected and any Director who did not stand 
for re-election in either of the two proceeding AGMs must 
retire by rotation. Accordingly, Nigel Newton, Ian Cormack 
and Richard Charkin shall retire at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. Each Director being eligible offers 
themselves for re-election.
The Chairman, and the Senior Independent Director in 
respect of the Chairman, on behalf of the Board confirms 
that each of the Directors proposed for election and 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting continues to 
contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment 
to the role (including commitment of time for Board and 
committee meetings and any other duties).
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to 
the extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred 
as a result of their office. The Group has maintained 
insurance throughout the year for its Directors and officers 
against the consequences of actions brought against them 
in relation to their duties for the Group.

Directors’ conflicts of interest 
Procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the 
Directors’ conflict of interest duties set out in the Companies 
Act 2006. These procedures have been complied with during 
the year and the Board considers that these procedures 
operate effectively. During the year, details of any new 
potential conflict matters were submitted to the Board for 
consideration and, where appropriate, these were approved. 
Authorised conflicts or potential conflict matters will be 
reviewed by the Board on an annual basis. 
Charitable and political donations 
The Group made charitable donations of £6,200 in respect 
of the year (2013: Nil). Details of the non-cash support given 
by the charitable and voluntary activities of the Company 
are as set out in the Corporate Responsibility section on 
pages 39 to 45. 
No political donations were made by the Group during the 
current or previous year. 
Financial instruments 
Details of financial risk management are given in note 23. 
Share capital and rights attaching to the 
Company’s shares 
The share capital of the Company comprises a single class 
of ordinary 1.25p shares (‘Ordinary Shares’). As at the date 
of this Directors’ Report, there were 73,844,724 fully paid 
issued shares, all listed on the London Stock Exchange, with 
a further 24,614,880 Ordinary Shares that the Directors are 
authorised to issue. Details of the issued share capital of the 
Company can be found in note 20 together with details of 
the shares issued and cancelled during the year. 
No Ordinary Shares carry special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. At a general meeting of the 
Company every member has one vote on a show of hands 
and on a poll one vote for each share held. The notice of a 
general meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting 
rights either by proxy or present in person in relation to 
resolutions to be passed at a general meeting. 
Under the Articles of Association, any share in the Company 
may be issued with such rights or restrictions, whether in 
regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise as 
the Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution 
determine (or, in the absence of any such determination, as 
the Directors may determine). 
No shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, 
entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a 
general meeting or to exercise any other rights conferred 
by being a shareholder if he or she or any person with an 
interest in shares has been sent a notice under section 793 
of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon public 
companies the power to require information with respect 
to interests in their voting shares) and he or she or any 
interested person failed to supply the Company with the 
information requested within 14 days after delivery of that 
notice. The Board may also decide to apply to the court 
for an order under section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 
so that no dividend is payable in respect of those default 
shares and that no transfer of any default shares shall be 
registered. These restrictions end seven days after receipt 
by the Company of a notice of an approved transfer of 
the shares or all the information required by the relevant 
section 793 notice, whichever is earlier. 
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer which is 
not a fully-paid share, although such discretion may not be 
exercised in a way which the Financial Conduct Authority 
regards as preventing dealing in the shares of that class 
from taking place on an open proper basis. The Directors 
may likewise refuse any transfer of a share in favour of more 
than four persons jointly. 
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions in the 
transfer of Ordinary Shares in the Company other than 
certain restrictions that may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); 
and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority whereby certain employees and Directors of the 
Group require approval of the Company to deal in the 
Company’s shares. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of the securities or voting rights. 
Share dilution 
The Company adheres to “ABI Principles of Remuneration” 
issued in November 2013 by the association of British 
insurers in respect of dilution limits. In particular: 
 ✷ The rules of the Company’s LTIP scheme ensure that 
commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury 
shares, when aggregated with awards under all of 
the Company’s other schemes, do not exceed 10% of 
the issued ordinary share capital (adjusted for share 
issuance and cancellation) in any rolling 10 year period. 
 ✷ The Remuneration Committee ensures that appropriate 
policies regarding flow-rates exist in order to spread 
the potential issue of new shares over the life of relevant 
schemes so that the limit is not breached.

 ✷ Commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury 
shares under executive (discretionary) schemes do 
not exceed 5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital 
of the Company (adjusted for share issuance and 
cancellation) in any rolling 10 year period. The 
implicit dilution commitment is provided for at point 
of grant even where, as in the case of share-settled 
share appreciation rights, it is recognised that only a 
proportion of shares may in practice be used. 
As set out below in this report, the Bloomsbury Employee 
Benefit Trust purchases shares in the market to be used for 
satisfying LTIP awards and other employee share options 
that vest. 
Authorities to purchase shares, to allot shares 
and pre-emption rights 
Notice of the 2014 Annual General Meeting and explanatory 
foreword to the meeting on pages 149 to 165 form part of 
the Directors’ Report and set out: 
 ✷ an ordinary resolution renewing the authority for 
the Directors to allot shares under section 551 of the 
Companies Act; 
 ✷ a special resolution renewing the authority given to 
the Directors to disapply statutory pre-emption rights 
under section 571 of that Act to allow shares to be issued 
for cash or treasury shares to be sold for cash on a non-
pre-emptive basis; and 
 ✷ a special resolution renewing the authority given to the 
Directors to purchase the Company’s own shares on 
the stock market. 
Employee Benefit Trust 
Throughout the financial year Ogier Employee Benefit 
Trustee Limited (‘Trustee’) acted as the trustee of the 
Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). As at 28 
February 2014 the EBT held 898,244 Ordinary Shares of 1.25 
pence in the Company being approximately 1.2% of the 
issued Ordinary Share capital. The EBT did not make any 
purchases of shares in the Company between 28 February 
2014 and the signing of this report. The Trustee may vote on 
shares held by the EBT at its discretion, but waives its right to 
a dividend. 
Share purchases of own shares 
During the year the Company made no purchases of its 
own shares. 
Substantial shareholdings 
As at the date of signing of this report, substantial 
shareholdings of 3% or more of the shares in the Company 
notified to the Company prior to signing of this report or

Changes of control 
The Group has established close relationships over a long 
period within the publishing markets in which it operates. 
It relies heavily on its goodwill and reputation and in 
particular on its reputation as an autonomous independent 
publisher with authors, customers and key employees that 
could be affected by a change of control.
The Company’s share incentive schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid (see note 21 for further details of the share 
incentive schemes). Under these provisions, a change of 
control of the Company would normally be a vesting event 
facilitating the exercise of awards, typically subject to the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Contracts and arrangements essential  
to the business 
The Group has a diverse base of authors, customers and 
general suppliers so that its dependency on any one 
individual author, customer or supplier is reduced. Primarily 
for printed books, the Group develops longer term 
relationships with a reduced number of business partners, 
printers and distributors to maximise process efficiencies 
and economies of scale. Failure of a main supplier could 
disrupt the supply of books to market or result in increased 
cost of working whilst alternative arrangements are made. 
The Group depends on its reputation as there is a tendency 
for its authors and customers to behave collectively in the 
selection of their publishing service provider. 
Future developments 
The Group intends to continue to develop its range 
of publishing businesses and other services. Although 
the primary focus of the Group is on organic growth, 
acquisitions will be considered. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for at least until June 2015, being the period of the detailed 
going concern assessment reviewed by the Board. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the consolidated and Company financial 
statements in accordance with Going Concern and 
Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009, 
published by the Financial Reporting Council in October 
2009. Further going concern disclosure is given in the 
financial statements as noted in note 2c of the significant 
accounting policies on page 91. 
Cautionary statement 
Under s417 of the Companies Act 2006, a company’s 
Directors’ Report is required, among other matters, 
to contain a fair review by the Directors of the Group’s 
business through a balanced and comprehensive analysis 
of the development and performance of the business of 
the Group and the position of the Group at the period end, 
consistent with the size and complexity of the business. The 
Directors’ Report together with all sections incorporated 
into it by reference has been prepared only for the 
shareholders of the Company. Its sole purpose and use is 
to assist shareholders to exercise their governance rights. 
In particular, the Directors’ Report has not been audited 
or otherwise independently verified. The Company and its 
Directors and employees are not responsible for any other 
purpose or use or to any other person in relation to the 
Directors’ Report. 
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future 
developments and other forward looking statements 
that are subject to risk factors associated with, among 
other things, the economic and business circumstances 
occurring from time to time in the sectors, countries and 
business divisions in which the Group operates. These 
factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed 
under Risk Factors on pages 35 to 38. These and other 
factors could adversely affect the Group’s results, strategy 
and prospects. Forward looking statements involve risks, 
uncertainties and assumptions. They relate to events and/ 
or depend on circumstances in the future which could 
cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from 
those currently anticipated. No obligation is assumed to 
update any forward looking statements, whether as a result 
of new information, future events or otherwise. 
Auditor 
a) Reappointment of the Auditor 
A resolution to reappoint KPMG LLP as Auditor will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
b) Statement as to Disclosure of Information to the 
Auditor 
The Directors who were in office on the date of approval 
of these financial statements have confirmed that, as far as 
they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Auditor is unaware. Each of the Directors have 
confirmed that they have taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that it has been communicated to the Auditor.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the Annual Report and the financial 
statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group and parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.  
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent Company financial statements on the 
same basis.  
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the Group and parent Company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:  
 ✷ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;  
 ✷ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;  
 ✷ state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and  
 ✷ prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent Company will continue in 
business.  
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and 
those regulations.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website.  Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Annual General Meeting 
The notice of the 2014 Annual General Meeting of 
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc is set out in pages 154 to 165. An 
explanation of the resolutions to be put to shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting on 22 July 2014 is set out on 
pages 149 to 153 which forms part of this Directors’ Report. 
Safe Harbour
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe harbour limits 
the liability of Directors in respect of statements in and 
omissions from the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report. Pages 1 to 165 of the Annual Report are included 
within the Directors’ Report by reference and so are 
included within the safe harbour.
The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report were approved 
by the Board on 11 June 2014.

and Transparency rules

knowledge: 
a. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
b. the Annual Report and financial statements include a 
fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a

and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and

T
he Board takes its responsibility to achieve sound 
governance of the Bloomsbury Group seriously 
and continuously maintains high standards of 
corporate governance that focus on serving the 
interests of the shareholders. 
The Company’s compliance throughout the year with the 
main principles of The UK Corporate Governance Code 
edition dated September 2012 (the ‘Code’) in addition to 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority is set out 
below. The UK Corporate Governance Code is published 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.
uk). The Financial Conduct Authority has yet to change the 
Listing Rules and therefore requires that certain compliance 
statements are made in relation to the predecessor edition 
of the Code, namely The UK Corporate Governance Code 
edition dated June 2010. The Company confirms that it has 
complied throughout the year to 28 February 2014 with the 
provisions of both editions of the Code (the ‘Codes’) except 
as noted below.
Confirmation of compliance with the Codes
The Board confirms that it has applied the principles and 
complied fully with all provisions of the Codes in respect of 
the year ended 28 February 2014 except for the following 
provision: 
 ✷ B.2.1 requires that the Chairman of the Board or an 
Independent Non-Executive Director should chair the 
Nomination Committee. The Committee comprises 
three Independent Non-Executive Directors, the 
Independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, 
and the Chief Executive who continues to chair the 
Committee. The Board considers that provision B.2.1 is 
complied with fully in all other respects. 
The Board has reviewed the structure of the Committee 
and concludes the Committee continues to ensure that 
the best interests of the shareholders are served. The Board 
considers that the Main Principle and Supporting Principles 
of B.2 are applied effectively.
The Company has a balanced Board that is progressively 
refreshed. Leading external recruitment consultants 
are appointed for the selection of new Directors and 
advise on the recruitment. Directors are appointed to the 
Board objectively on merit from diverse backgrounds 
and approximately one third of the Board are women. 
Performance appraisals of each Independent Non-
Executive and Executive Director are conducted by the 
Chairman (the assessment of the Chairman is led by 
the Senior Independent Director) as part of the Board’s 
rigorous annual evaluation process which assesses the 
skills and experience of the Board against the needs of the 
business.
During the year the Committee reviewed the structure 
and composition of the Board and how the Board can best 
support the business with achieving the Board’s strategy. 
As a result, the Board has been increased to seven Directors 
by the appointment on 20 August 2013 of Stephen Page, 
an additional Independent Non-Executive Director. This 
brings the Board to three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, the Independent Chairman of the Board and three 
Executive Directors. Stephen Page has been appointed to 
the Audit Committee and to the Nomination Committee, 
which increases the numbers of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors on each of these committees from two to three. The 
composition of the Board and Board committees described 
below apply to the situation following the appointment of 
Stephen Page on 20 August 2013.
Board and the Directors
Board effectiveness 
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for ensuring 
that the Company is appropriately managed and that it 
achieves its objectives. The Board determines the strategy 
for the Group and sets and monitors targets for the 
management team to achieve the strategy. 
The Board comprises the Independent Non-Executive 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director, a further two 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, the Chief Executive, 
the Finance Director and a further Executive Director. The 
biographies of the Directors appear on pages 46 and 47. 
During the year the Board met 14 times including six 
main meetings, two meetings to approve the Interim 
Management Statements and six meetings to consider 
specific matters such as the recommendations of Board 
committees mainly for the appointment of new Directors 
and the change of External Auditor. Board meetings 
included reviewing the Company’s strategic direction, 
operating and financial performance and overseeing 
that the Company is adequately resourced and effectively 
controlled.
The agendas for all main Board meetings provide standing 
items for each Director to provide updates on areas of 
their responsibility and items for the chairs of each Board 
committee to update the Board. 
The Board has approved the matters specifically reserved 
for consideration by the Board. The Board determines the 
responsibilities and authority of its committees, Board sub-
committees, individual Directors and the level of authorities 
delegated to the management of the business. The Audit 
Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 
Committee have terms of reference approved by the 
Board that can be found on the Company’s website, www.

Matters considered at Board meetings during the year have 
typically included: 
 ✷ review and setting of strategy for the Company’s 
operations; 
 ✷ review of the management accounts, short and long-
term forecasts, key performance indicators and full year 
forecasts; 
 ✷ approval of the annual and interim results and Interim 
Management Statements; 
 ✷ review and approval of the annual budget; 
 ✷ regular reports by the Chief Executive, proposals and 
updates on developing business operations, significant 
investments, major initiatives, other organisational 
changes and health and safety;
 ✷ reports of the chairs of Board committees and minutes 
following committee and sub-committee meetings; 
 ✷ review and approval of decisions, transactions and 
sensitive policies that are significant to the Company 
such as dividends, the organisational, legal and capital 
structure of the Company, acquisitions of literary titles, 
businesses and companies and major contracts; 
 ✷ risk management and review of the risks of the 
Company; and 
 ✷ evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board including 
the appropriateness of the terms of reference of Board 
committees. 
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head 
of the Company, with the Chairman responsible for 
the effective operation of the Board, encouraging 
the active participation of all Directors, and the Chief 
Executive responsible for the strategic running of the 
Company’s businesses. The Board has approved formal 
statements describing the role and remit of both the 
Chairman and Chief Executive, which further emphasise 
this division of responsibilities. The Executive Directors 
regularly hold formal meetings with senior managers as a 
management team to assist the Chief Executive in fulfilling 
his operational objectives. This management team makes 
recommendations to the Board and seeks approval from 
the Board where required. The Non-Executive Directors 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on 
strategy at meetings specifically set up for the purpose, 
which are attended by all Board members. 
All Directors and Board committees have access to the 
advice and services of the Group Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and for advising the Board, through the 
Chairman, on governance matters. They also have access 
to independent professional advice, if required, at the 
Company’s expense. 
The Chairman has held regular meetings during the year 
with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors present to discuss relevant matters. 
Policy on Board diversity 
More information on diversity is found in the report on 
Corporate Social Responsibility on pages 39 to 45. 
The majority of the senior management team, which 
includes the Executive Directors and senior managers, 
are women. The Board has set a target that a minimum of 
one third of Directors (to the nearest number of Directors) 
should be women. The Board comprises seven Directors, 
of which two are women, which is ahead of the minimum 
25% target representation level to be achieved by 2015 as 
recommended by the Davies Review.
The policy of the Board is that all Directors should be 
appointed purely on merit regardless of their gender or 
background.
Director independence 
The Board considers each of the Non-Executive Directors 
who served during the year to be independent in character 
and judgement and does not consider that there are 
any relationships or circumstances which affect, or could 
appear to affect, their independent judgement.

Board evaluation 
The Board conducts a formal evaluation annually that considers the balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Board, its diversity including gender, how the Board works together as a unit and other factors relevant 
to its effectiveness. The evaluation reviews the progress made by the Board with developing strategy and with the 
underlying processes supporting the effective operation of the Board including the quality of information it receives. 
The evaluation of the Board and of each individual Director is through: 
 ✷ one-to-one interviews, using evaluation questionnaires 
to facilitate discussion, of Directors with the Chairman to 
appraise the performance of the Director on the Board 
and to discuss any improvements needed to the Board 
processes;
 ✷ the chair of each Board committee leads the evaluation 
of their committee; 
 ✷ the Chief Executive conducts additional management 
appraisals of the Executive Directors and the senior 
management team; 
 ✷ the Board discusses the findings and recommendations 
for improvement actions in respect of evaluations of 
the Board, each Director, the Board committees and the 
processes supporting the Board; and 
 ✷ the Chairman may hold further one-to-one interviews 
with Directors to follow up issues and actions if 
applicable.
The performance appraisal of the Chairman is led by the 
Senior Independent Director. The appraisal is undertaken 
using assessment questionnaires and a one-to-one 
interview of the Chairman with the Senior Independent 
Director who takes account of the confidential views of the 
other Directors.

Upon completing the interviews, the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director make formal reports to the Board 
on the findings with recommendations for actions to be 
implemented by the Board, by individual Directors, by the 
Group Company Secretary and by senior management 
in the business. Where needed the Chairman holds 
confidential follow up meetings with individual Directors to 
address concerns they have raised or to address concerns 
raised about them. The Board monitors progress in 
implementing the actions. 
Board committees are evaluated annually against the terms 
of reference for the committee and against adherence 
to relevant regulation such as the Code. The committees 
approve the evaluations and make recommendations to 
the Board on any changes needed to the Board processes 
and terms of reference.
The conclusions of the Board evaluations are considered 
by the Nomination Committee when reviewing the 
structure and composition of the Board and succession 
planning. As a result of the review of performance, the 
Chairman on behalf of the Board confirms that each of the 
Directors proposed for re-election at the AGM continues 
to contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment 
to the role (including commitment of time for Board and 
committee meetings and any other duties). 
Training and development of the Directors 
The Board evaluation including Director appraisals by the 
Chairman considers whether each Director has refreshed 
their skills and knowledge sufficiently and provides an 
opportunity for Directors to identify where training and 
development can assist them in the performance of their 
duties. Development may include, for example, meetings 
with senior managers to gain an improved understanding 
of the business. 
Directors are provided with extensive Director knowledge 
checklists to help them self-assess their personal learning 
needs and they have access to numerous relevant 
publications by Bloomsbury. Formal training is provided 
to the Board by the External Auditor and external 
remuneration consultants who assign time in meetings 
to provide updates on and to explain topical areas of 
corporate governance, remuneration, auditing and 
financial reporting. 
The Board is progressively refreshed, bringing in new skills 
and experience to the pool of knoweldge on the Board 
from which each Director on the Board can learn. 
Nomination Committee 
The Committee comprises three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, the Independent Chairman of the Board, and the 
Chief Executive, Nigel Newton, who chairs the Committee. 
The Committee met five times during the year. 
The Committee operates under terms of reference 
agreed by the whole Board, and which are available on 
the Company’s website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. Its 
role is to review the composition of the Board, consider 
succession planning and nominate to the Board, for 
approval, candidates to fill Board vacancies. The Committee 
determines the Directors who should stand for re-election 
at the AGM in accordance with the Articles of Association 
of the Company. The Board formally approves the 
appointment of all new Directors on the recommendation 
of the Committee. 
Appointment of new Directors 
The Board adopts a formal and rigorous approach to the 
appointment of Directors. The following outlines the Board 
appointment process typical to that followed: 
 ✷ the need to appoint a new Director is identified by 
an existing Board member retiring or by a review 
by the Committee of the Board’s structure, balance, 
succession planning and the need for progressive 
refreshing which may take account of the findings of 
the Board’s evaluation of the skills and capabilities of 
Board members; 
 ✷ the Committee considers the strengths and weaknesses 
of the Board and the senior management team and the 
needs of the business in order to define the experience 
and capabilities required for a new appointment;
 ✷ the Committee determines the recruitment process;
 ✷ an independent external recruitment consultant is 
appointed and briefed on the requirements for a role 
to be filled. The external consultant filters a long list of 
the highest calibre candidates meeting the criteria from 
a wide range of sources and conducts background 
research to discover any issues with candidates. Further 
filtering by the external consultant may include 
discussing candidates with people who know of them 
and meeting candidates to assess them;
 ✷ the external consultant recommends the long list of 
candidates to the Committee. One or two Directors 
supported by the external consultant will interview the 
candidates and formulate a shortlist to recommend to 
the Committee. References are taken;

Bloomsbury Annual Report 2014 FRONT Proof 9.indd   57 11/06/2014   16:47:05 23265-04 11 June 2014  Proof 9
 ✷ the Committee, sitting together supported by 
the external consultant, interviews the shortlisted 
candidates. The Executive Directors will also meet 
with shortlisted candidates or join the interviews and 
provide feedback to the Committee;
 ✷ the Committee may recommend a candidate for an 
appointment or may request that further candidates 
are found; and
 ✷ the Board approves appointments recommended by 
the Committee.
During the year The Willis Partnership was engaged as 
independent executive search consultants to support 
with the appointment of Jill Jones, Stephen Page and 
Sir Anthony Salz. The Willis Partnership has no other 
connection with the Company.
The Group Company Secretary ensures that new Directors 
receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining 
the Board. Newly appointed Directors are provided with 
induction packs and one-to-one meetings are arranged 
for them with the senior management team. Directors 
are provided with a detailed knowledge self-assessment 
questionnaire to help them consider any further training 
needs they may have.
The significant shareholders are invited to contact or meet 
with a new Chairman. Any request by a shareholder to meet 
with a new Director would be considered. Investors will 
typically get the opportunity to meet with new Directors at 
presentations and meetings from the announcements of 
the results.
Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are subject to reappointment by the 
shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their 
appointment and thereafter at intervals of no more than 
three years.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for periods of three 
years upon the end of which their appointment terminates 
subject to their reappointment by recommendation of the 
Nominations Committee approved by the Board. A policy 
is followed of progressive refreshing of the Board and the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors can be expected 
to retire from the Board at the end of their first, second or 
during their third three year period. 
The notice periods by the Company of the Directors are  
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages  
65 to 81.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises two Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and the Independent Chairman of 
the Board and is chaired by Jill Jones. The Committee met 
seven times during the year. The role of the Committee is 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages  
65 to 81.
Audit Committee 
Financial and business reporting
In accordance with principle C.1, provision C.1.1 and 
provision C.3.4 of the Code, the Board confirms that, in 
the opinion of the Board and the Committee, the Annual 
Report including the financial statements on pages 86 to 
146, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy.
In accordance with Code provision C.1.2, the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 45 provides an explanation of the 
basis on which the Company generates and preserves value 
over the longer term (the business model) and the strategy 
for delivering the objectives of the Company.
The Directors’ Report on page 52 confirms that the business 
is a going concern in accordance with Code provision C.1.3.
Risk management and internal control
In accordance with principle C.2 and provision C.2.1 of 
the Code, the Committee has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and 
internal control systems. The Committee has reviewed the 
Company’s statement on internal control systems prior to 
endorsement by the Board and has reviewed the policies 
and processes for identifying, assessing and managing 
business risks.
Operation of the Audit Committee
The Committee comprises three Independent Non-
Executive Directors. The chair of the Committee is Ian 
Cormack. The Committee met on four occasions during 
the year. The Board is satisfied that the experience of Ian 
Cormack is sufficient for him to meet the experience and 
qualification requirements to be a member of the Audit 
Committee with recent and relevant financial experience 
under the Code and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules. 
The terms of reference of the Committee can be found on 
the Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk, and set 
out the role and authority of the Committee. Responsibilities 
and matters reserved for the Committee include:
 ✷ review of significant financial information, including 
assumptions, judgements of management and critical 
accounting policies, to be published externally; 
 ✷ oversight of the relationship and process with the 
External Auditor;

 ✷ reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s systems 
of internal control and risk management; 
 ✷ reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function; and 
 ✷ recommending to the Board changes to the 
Committee’s terms of reference.
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making 
a recommendation on the appointment, reappointment 
and removal of the External Auditor.
The Committee typically invites the External Auditor, 
Internal Auditor, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, 
Finance Director and Executive Director to attend meetings. 
It meets at least once in respect of each reporting period 
and a standard item on the agenda for every meeting 
is a meeting with the External Auditor alone without 
management present. 
The Committee’s annual evaluation, which forms part 
of the Board evaluation, reviews how the Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities. The findings of the evaluation 
and recommendations arising are reported to the Board. 
The Committee formally reviews the whistle-blowing 
arrangements of the Company by which staff may, in 
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or other matters. The 
Committee’s objective is to ensure that arrangements 
are in place for the proportionate and independent 
investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up 
action.
The Committee reviews the plans, findings and 
recommendations of the Internal Auditor, and 
management’s responses to internal audit 
recommendations. It ensures that the internal audit 
function is adequately resourced in light of the system of 
risk management and has appropriate standing within the 
Company. The Committee approves the appointment and 
removal of the Head of Internal Audit who for the financial 
year up to the time of signing the Annual Report was the 
Company Secretary.
As a standing item, each Committee meeting agenda 
includes a discussion with the External Auditor without 
management present which provides the opportunity for 
the Committee and External Auditor to raise any concerns 
that they may have.
Significant issues in relation to the financial 
statements 
In accordance with Code Provision C.3.8, the following 
are the issues that the Committee considers significant in 
relation to the financial statements and how these issues are 
addressed. 
For each item below the Committee has reviewed the 
assumptions and judgements made and has considered 
the risks to the integrity of information reported in the 
financial statements. In accordance with the Code the 
Committee has taken account of the disclosure of the 
issues when forming an opinion on the fair, balanced and 
understandable view of the Annual Report.
1. Inventories provision
The level of inventories is set out in note 16 on page 117.
For each line of inventory, a provision is made against the 
cost of the inventory, where the net realisable value is less 
than cost. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs necessary to make the sale. 
The estimated selling price for each inventory line is a 
judgement based mainly on recent selling patterns for a 
title. A formulaic provision is applied to each inventory line 
where titles have been published for more than one year. 
The Committee considered the judgements applied to 
estimating the selling prices of inventory to ensure that the 
total level of provision for all inventory is adequate.
2. Sales returns provision
The level of sales return provision is set out in note 17 on 
page 118.
Printed books are normally sold on a sale-or-return basis. 
The timing of returns of unsold books is uncertain. A 
provision is made against sales for the expected future 
returns of books that have not occurred by the end of an 
accounting period. This provision is a judgement based 
on the assumption of the time lag following a sale before a 
return is made and the calculation of the historical returns 
rate. 
The Committee considered the judgements made in 
estimating the key assumptions to ensure that the sales 
return provision is adequate.

3. Revenue recognition
Included within rights and services revenues are licences 
and selling rights over Bloomsbury’s intellectual property 
to third parties, as stated in note 3 to the financial 
statements. These include bundled online rights, which 
consist of a small number of large sized deals. The revenue 
recognised in any one period mainly reflects the value of 
contracted performance obligations satisfied in that period. 
The revenue recognition treatment for more complex 
deals is reviewed by the External Auditor as soon as they are 
contracted. 
The Committee considered the judgements applied to the 
most significant bundled online rights contracts to ensure 
that the revenue recognition treatment was adequate. 
4. Valuation of goodwill on acquisition of companies
The carrying value of goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
companies (or group of companies) by the Group is set out 
in note 12 on page 112. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units 
(‘CGUs’) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is 
less than its carrying value, an impairment charge reduces 
goodwill and is recognised in the Income Statement. There 
is more detail on this process in note 2j to these financial 
statements. The recoverable amount is based on future 
cash flow projections based on a Board approved budget 
and the five year plan. 
During the year the Board changed the definition of the 
CGUs so that each global publishing division constitutes 
a CGU, reflecting the One Global Bloomsbury business 
restructure.
The Committee considered the judgements and 
assumptions made in selecting CGUs and performing the 
impairment tests for each CGU, to ensure that the carrying 
value for goodwill was adequately supported. In particular, 
the Committee reviewed the annual budget and five year 
plan for the Group as approved by the Board which is used 
as the basis for forecasting future cash flows from the CGUs.
5. Unearned advance provision
Prepayments and accrued income in the Group Statement 
of Financial Position, in note 17 on page 117, include net 
unearned author advances of £20.8 million (2013: £21.0 
million).
A provision is made against gross advances (paid and 
payable) to the extent that they are not expected to be fully 
earned from anticipated future sales of a title. This provision 
is a judgement that depends on recent royalty earnings 
and known future new format releases.
The Committee considered the assumptions made for a 
sample of contracts to ensure that the net carrying value of 
advances was adequately supported.
Non-audit services
The Committee has approved a formal policy on 
the provision of non-audit services to safeguard the 
independence and objectivity of the External Auditor and 
reviews the level of non-audit fees relative to audit fees. The 
policy prohibits the External Auditor from being engaged 
on work where their independence could be threatened 
and requires the pre-approval by the Committee of all non-
audit services where the fees of the External Auditor would 
exceed £5,000. Further safeguards are employed such as 
audit and non-audit work being performed by different 
teams from the External Auditor.
Approach to the appointment of the   
External Auditor.
The 2013 Annual Report (for the year ended 28 February 
2013) notes that the Committee anticipated tendering 
the appointment of the External Auditor following the 
2013 AGM. This tender has been completed and, on 
the recommendation of the Committee, the Board has 
appointed KPMG LLP as External Auditor for the Group and 
for the Company.

Reasons for tendering
Code provision C.3.7 requires FTSE 350 companies to 
put the external audit contract out to tender at least 
every 10 years. Whilst Bloomsbury is below the FTSE 350 
the Committee considers it appropriate that provision 
C.3.7 should apply. This adopts best practice including 
the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Audit 
Committees published September 2012. The incumbent 
External Auditor prior to the tender, Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP, 
was contracted for more than 10 years without tender since 
having first been approved by the shareholders at the 2002 
AGM on 27 June 2002.
Conduct of the tender
The tender was conducted as follows:
 ✷ the Committee considered the reasons for tendering 
and approved putting the external audit out to tender;
 ✷ the tender process was run by the Finance Director 
overseen by the Committee;
 ✷ a long list of eight firms was selected including the Big 
Four and medium sized firms;
 ✷ based on the resources, infrastructure, geographical 
coverage, expertise in the fields of Bloomsbury’s 
business and general knowledge of each firm a shortlist 
of three firms was proposed by the Finance Director 
and approved by the Committee. This included Baker 
Tilly, KPMG and Grant Thornton;
 ✷ the shortlisted firms agreed to the tender and provided 
responses to detailed Request For Information (RFIs). 
The firms were given wide access to the information of 
the business and its employees. Interviews with Board 
members and key staff were held as requested by the 
firms;
 ✷ during July and August 2013 the Committee sitting 
together interviewed each firm and considered 
proposal documents submitted by each firm 
supplemented by information gathered by 
Bloomsbury. The Committee evaluated each firm 
against criteria agreed by the Committee; and
 ✷ Based on the evaluations, the Committee 
recommended KPMG be appointed as the External 
Auditor. The Board approved the recommendation.
Committee’s criteria for evaluating the firms
The Committee evaluated the firms shortlisted for the 
appointment as External Auditor against the following 
criteria:
 ✷ understanding of Bloomsbury’s business and level of 
publishing industry experience; 
 ✷ audit staff and the firm;
 ✷ relationships;
 ✷ organisational and cultural fit;
 ✷ commitment and conflicts;
 ✷ audit approach;
 ✷ pro-activity, ideas and strategies;
 ✷ access to other specialists; 
 ✷ fee; and
 ✷ value the firm contributes e.g. the level of assurance 
provided.
Recommendation of appointment of  
External Auditor
Whilst KPMG, Baker Tilly and Grant Thornton each have 
strengths, the Audit Committee believes that KPMG best 
meets the criteria and, in particular, would provide a 
fresh pair of eyes to the benefit of the Company and its 
shareholders.
Review of the audit process post the appointment  
of KPMG
The Committee has reviewed and assessed the effectiveness 
of the audit process. The Committee is satisfied that KPMG 
has performed an effective audit and that the assurance 
provided by the external audit has not been significantly 
impacted by the transition of the External Auditors. The 
annual evaluation of the Board reviewed the effectiveness 
of how the external audit process integrated with the 
business processes for the Group.

Relations with shareholders 
The Board, led by the Chairman, is responsible for ensuring 
an open dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives. 
The Annual Report, Interim Report, Interim Management 
Statements, AGM, market updates and post results 
announcement presentations are the principal means 
through which the Company communicates its strategy 
and performance to shareholders. All shareholders are 
welcome to attend the AGM and investors are encouraged 
to take advantage of the opportunity given to ask 
questions. The chairs of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees attend the meeting and are 
available to answer questions, as appropriate. 
The Company maintains an active dialogue with its 
institutional shareholders and City analysts through a 
planned programme of investor relations. The programme 
includes formal presentations of results and post results 
meetings with the major shareholders and other investors 
who request meetings. The presentations are made 
available on the website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The 
meetings and presentations provide an opportunity for 
shareholders to ask questions and to meet the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors. The outcome of regular 
meetings with the main shareholders, presentations and 
post results meetings is reported to the Board. This includes 
both feedback from individual Directors and feedback 
collated from discussions by the Company’s corporate 
broker with the main shareholders. The Company’s 
corporate broker provides regular shareholder analysis 
to the Board. Feedback from shareholders and other 
members of the shareholder corporate governance 
community is used to help review and develop 
Bloomsbury’s procedures. 
The Chairman writes to the major shareholders each 
year to provide shareholders with the opportunity to 
openly discuss corporate governance matters, including 
remuneration, and raise any concerns. Following the 
meetings the Chairman reports to the Board on the 
discussions held including any feedback from the 
shareholders. The Chairman has met with one shareholder 
on corporate governance in respect of the year.
Internal control and risk management 
The Code requires the Directors to assess at least annually 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control, 
which include financial, operational and compliance 
controls, and risk management. This review has been 
carried out by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, for 
setting policy on internal control, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control. The role of management is 
to implement Board policies on risk and control. The system 
of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, 
and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material financial misstatement or loss. 
The Board operates both formally, through Board and 
committee meetings, and informally, through regular 
contact amongst Directors. High level decisions on such 
matters as strategy, financial performance and reporting, 
dividends, risk management, major capital expenditure, 
acquisitions and disposals are reserved for the Board or 
Board committees. For its regular formal meetings, the 
Board receives appropriate information in advance from 
management. Other decisions outside of these areas are 
delegated to the Company’s management, which reports 
to the Executive Directors. 
The Board has put in place an on-going process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Company in accordance with the guidance of 
the Turnbull Committee on internal control. This process 
has been in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report. The process 
is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf 
of the Board to ensure that the procedures implemented 
continue to be effective and, where appropriate, 
recommendations are made to management to improve 
the procedures. The Company’s system of internal financial 
control aims to safeguard the Company’s assets, ensure 
that proper accounting records are maintained, that the 
financial information used within the business and for 
publication is reliable, that business risks are identified and 
managed and that compliance with appropriate legislation 
and regulation is maintained.

Internal control and risk management framework 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
of the Company is the responsibility of the Finance Director 
and is overseen by the Audit Committee and the Board. This 
includes responsibility for ensuring appropriate internal 
controls are in place over financial reporting processes and 
related IT systems. The Audit Committee monitors the risks 
and associated controls over financial reporting processes, 
including the consolidation process. 
Relevant features of the Company’s system of internal 
controls and risk management in relation to the financial 
reporting process and preparation of the Group financial 
statements include: 
 ✷ Organisational culture: The Company has a highly 
skilled, professional and committed workforce. 
The Board is committed to developing a culture of 
openness, integrity, competence and responsibility. 
The Board concentrates mainly on strategic and 
significant organisational issues, approving objectives 
and monitoring, at a high level, the financial and 
operational performance against objectives. 
 ✷ Risk and control review: The Executive Committee 
(which comprises the senior management team and 
Executive Directors) maintains the matrix of Group 
level risks and control assessments for each risk. This is 
supported by the Internal Auditor and by formal risk 
reviews by the Executive Committee. The head of each 
Group function maintains the matrix of risks and control 
assessments for their function. This ensures that risks 
and control issues from around the Group worldwide 
are reported openly to the senior management team 
and addressed. The Board has regularly reviewed 
the significant Group and functional risks to ensure 
appropriate action is taken to address the risks. The 
Audit Committee has reviewed the financial risks and 
issues that could impact on reporting when considering 
the financial statements.
 ✷ Financial internal control and risk review: The 
Finance Director formally reviews the internal financial 
controls taking account of the risks within the financial 
information systems and reports the findings of this 
review to the Audit Committee. Analytical review of 
operating results and detailed control questionnaires 
completed for the publishing divisions and overseas 
offices supplement management’s knowledge of the 
business for the evaluation of the risks and assessment 
of the internal financial controls. The Audit Committee 
also receives reports on the internal controls and risks 
provided by the Internal Auditor. The Audit Committee 
receives other reports from management relevant to 
the internal financial controls such as reports on the 
progress of key projects. 
 ✷ Authority levels: The Board sets the level of authority 
required, before Board approval is needed, to commit 
the Company or to undertake transactions. It also 
approves budgets and other performance targets. 
The publishing divisions and Group functions operate 
within these authority levels and budgets. The Executive 
Directors determine the authority to be delegated to 
individual managers. 
 ✷ Financial management reporting: The Board 
approves the annual Group budget. Sales are 
reported daily, weekly and monthly. Financial results 
of the business operations are reported monthly and 
compared to budget and forecasts. Detailed forecasts 
for the Company are updated regularly and reviewed 
by the Board. 
 ✷ Book title acquisition procedures: Established 
procedures, such as the review and approval by an 
Executive Director of acquisition proposals of rights to 
new books, are operated within set authority limits and 
used for transactions in the ordinary course of business. 
Acquisitions exceeding delegated authority limits 
require approval by the Board. Significant acquisitions 
of companies and businesses are approved by the 
Board. The Board has set authorised limits for the total 
author advances held on the Statement of Financial 
Position as a percentage of net assets and for the total 
value of committed but unpaid advances.

 ✷ Accountability: The Company has clearly defined 
lines of responsibility headed by the Chief Executive 
and Executive Committee to control the publishing 
divisions and business functions. Detailed operational 
and financial performance data are monitored by 
supervisory management to ensure the performance 
of operations is in line with targets. The reasons for 
variances and underperformance are established by 
supervisory line management and followed up with 
managers and staff.
 ✷ Overseas offices: Each overseas office has a local 
manager or managing director who is responsible for 
operational effectiveness and local internal controls. 
Accounting for the Group is centralised and overseas 
subsidiaries hold limited cash balances. Senior 
managers and Executive Directors regularly visit the 
overseas offices and the finance function conducts 
operational review visits to review the procedures. The 
Board has implemented a Group whistle-blower policy 
and an anti-bribery and corruption policy which are 
communicated to all staff worldwide and found on the 
Company’s website at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
 ✷ Internal Audit: An internal audit function conducts 
risk-based audits of the processes agreed with the 
Audit Committee to review the internal controls. Its 
conclusions are communicated to senior management 
and the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
considers reports from External and Internal Audit to 
ensure that adequate measures are being taken by 
management to address risk and control issues. The 
Group Company Secretary is the Head of Internal Audit 
and reports to the chair of the Audit Committee and 
the Chief Executive in respect of risk management and 
internal audit work.

ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended 
28 February 2014 (the ‘Report’). The Report has been 
prepared on behalf of the Bloomsbury Board by the 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) and has been 
approved by the Board. 
Outline of the Remuneration Report
The Report is split into the following two sections:
 ✷ Part A, the Remuneration Policy Report, which sets 
out the Remuneration Policy for the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors which, subject to shareholder 
approval, operates from 1 March 2014 and will become 
formally effective from the 2014 AGM; and
 ✷ Part B, the Annual Report on Remuneration, which 
discloses how the Remuneration Policy will be 
implemented for the year ending 28 February 2015  
and how it was implemented for the year ended  
28 February 2014. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report will be subject 
to a binding shareholder vote and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the forthcoming AGM on 22 July 2014. In future the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report will be subject to a 
binding vote every three years (sooner if changes are made 
to the policy) and the Annual Report on Remuneration will 
be subject to an annual advisory vote.
Performance and Reward for 2013/14
Bloomsbury delivered another good performance for the 
year ended 28 February 2014 against the background of 
a publishing market place that continues to evolve and a 
relatively stable economic environment. The Committee 
set stretching annual bonus targets (see below) for the year 
and it is to the credit of the business that it has beaten the 
threshold target for PBTA allowing bonuses to be paid at an 
average rate of 17% of the maximum bonus.
The 2010 long-term incentive awards, which were 
determined by a combination of earnings per share 
(50% of awards) and relative total shareholder return 
performance (50% of awards), only vested at 50% of the 
maximum in 2013/14 as while the maximum earnings per 
share target was exceeded, the threshold total shareholder 
return target was not met.
Remuneration Policy for 2014/15
The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the 
Executive Director Remuneration Policy to ensure it 
promotes the attraction, motivation and retention of the 
high quality Executive Directors who have been key to 
delivering the Company’s strategy in the past and who 
will be key to delivering sustainable earnings growth 
and shareholder return in the future. For 2014/15 the 
Committee has concluded that:
 ✷ basic salaries should be increased by 3% in line with 
the general workforce for the Group (this follows a pay 
freeze in respect of the previous year);
 ✷ there will be no changes to other elements of fixed 
pay (i.e. benefit and pension provision) except that the 
pension contribution for Wendy Pallot of 10% of basic 
salary should be increased in line with market norms to 
15% of basic salary;
 ✷ the structure and quantum of the annual bonus 
arrangement continues to work well. Therefore, the 
maximum bonus potential will remain at 100% of salary 
and the structure of the 2014/15 annual bonus will be 
broadly similar to that operated for 2013/14. A claw-
back provision, introduced for 2014/15, will operate in 
respect of the annual bonus for the Executive Directors; 
and
 ✷ the long-term incentive policy, operated under 
the Bloomsbury Share Plan 2005 (‘PSP’), whereby 
conditional share awards are granted annually with 
vesting based on earnings per share (50%) and relative 
total shareholder return (50%) performance conditions 
and continued service, provide a strong alignment 
between the senior executive team and shareholders. 
However, as a result of the PSP nearing the end of its 
10 year life, shareholder consent for a replacement 
plan will be sought at the 2014 AGM. The new plan will 
be broadly similar to the plan it replaces although, 
subject to shareholder approval, it will be aligned to 
market practice both in respect of quantum (annual 
award levels will be increased from 75% of salary for the 
Chief Executive and 66% of salary for other Directors 
to 100% of salary for all Executive Directors) and a 
number of provisions will be aligned to best practice 
(e.g. threshold vesting levels will be reduced, maximum 
and exceptional award limits reduced and claw-back 
provisions will operate).

Shareholder feedback
In applying the Remuneration Policy, the Committee’s 
priority is to ensure that the interests of the shareholders 
and, where beneficial to the shareholders, other 
stakeholders are served whilst the Executive Directors and 
senior management team are treated fairly. In reaching its 
decisions the Committee considers the views and feedback 
it receives from shareholders and other members of the 
shareholder corporate governance community together 
with the views of management. Major shareholders 
and representative bodies were consulted in early 2014 
in respect to the proposed changes to the long-term 
incentive policy. 
In conclusion, the Committee considers that the 
Remuneration Policy will incentivise the sustainable delivery 
of the Board’s strategy, strong financial performance and 
the creation of long-term shareholder value.

Chair of the Remuneration Committee

PART A – Remuneration Policy Report
Introduction
The Committee has adopted the principles of good 
governance relating to Directors’ Remuneration as set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued June 2010 
and September 2012 (the ‘Codes’). This Report, together 
with the Annual Report on Remuneration, complies with 
the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’), the UKLA Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and Directors’ 
Remuneration: the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Codes relating to Directors’ Remuneration 
throughout the year. 
In determining Remuneration Policy the Committee applies 
the key principles that remuneration should:
 ✷ attract and retain suitably high calibre Executive 
Directors and ensure that they are motivated to achieve 
the highest levels of performance including delivering 
strategic initiatives and objectives;
 ✷ align the interests of the Executive Directors with those 
of the shareholders; and
 ✷ not pay more than is necessary.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received 
in relation to the AGM each year. This feedback, plus any 
additional feedback received during any meetings from 
time to time, is then considered as part of the Group’s 
annual review of the Remuneration Policy. In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee will seek to engage directly 
with major shareholders and their representative bodies 
should any material changes be made to the Remuneration 
Policy. Major shareholders and representative bodies were 
consulted in early 2014 in respect to the proposed changes 
to the long-term incentive policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to 
approve last year’s remuneration report and any matters 
discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase 
for the broader employee population when determining 
the annual salary increases for the Executive Directors. 
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the 
design of the Group’s Executive Director Remuneration 
Policy, although the Committee will keep this under review. 
The relative increase in CEO pay for the year under review, 
as compared with that of the general workforce, is set out in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration. The Committee also 
considers environmental, social and governance issues and 
risk when reviewing executive pay quantum and structure.

Notes to the Summary Policy Table:
1. A description of how the Company intends to 
implement the policy set out in this table from the 
2014 AGM onwards is set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on pages 72 to 81.
2. Remuneration arrangements below Board level tend to 
be skewed more towards fixed pay with less of a focus on 
share-based long-term incentive pay. These differences 
have arisen from the development of remuneration 
arrangements that are market competitive for the 
various categories of individuals.
3. The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the 
annual bonus scheme reflect the Committee’s belief that 
any incentive compensation should be appropriately 
challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit 
growth and personal and strategic objectives. 
4. The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to 
the PSP were selected by the Remuneration Committee 
on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term 
returns to shareholders and the Company’s financial 
growth and are consistent with the Company’s 
objective of delivering superior levels of long-term 
value to shareholders. The TSR performance condition 
is monitored on the Committee’s behalf by New Bridge 
Street whilst the Group’s EPS growth is derived from the 
audited financial statements.
5. While PSP awards currently vest after three years 
subject to continued service and performance targets, 
the Committee will consider developments in best 
practice when setting future long-term incentive grant 
policies and, in particular, whether the introduction 
of a post vesting holding period, in addition to the 
existing shareholding guidelines, is appropriate for the 
Company.
6. The all-employee Sharesave scheme does not have 
performance conditions. 
7. For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company 
to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors (such as the payment of a pension, 
payment of last year’s annual bonus or the vesting/
exercise of share awards granted in the past). Details of 
any payments to former Directors will be set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Discretion of the Committee
The Committee will operate the annual bonus and PSP 
schemes according to the respective scheme rules (or 
relevant documents) and in accordance with the applicable 
regulations. Executive Director incentive schemes and 
remuneration plans are designed to align the interests of 
management with those of the shareholders and are kept 
as simple as possible. Where the outcome of incentives is 
not as the Committee intended it may use its independent 
discretion to intervene and modify the outcomes to 
align the interests of management with those of the 
shareholders.
The Committee has adopted terms of reference based on 
best practice and may apply its independent discretion in  
a number of ways through its conditional approval 
including for:
Share-based incentives
 ✷ granting of all discretionary share awards/options and 
determining the participants (including for Executive 
Directors and below the Board), timing of grants, size 
of awards, performance conditions and how vested 
awards should be satisfied;
 ✷ running the Sharesave scheme to ensure that the 
scheme is run within applicable dilution limits;
 ✷ vesting of all discretionary share awards/options 
including the timing and level of vesting;
 ✷ non-routine vesting of all-employee share options 
in the unlikely event needed to ensure the effective 
operation of the schemes under the applicable 
regulations and rules;
Annual bonuses
 ✷ making annual bonus awards to the Executive Directors 
and determining the level of awards, targets and 
conditions and calibration of bonuses;
 ✷ the Group bonus pool and the level of bonus pay-outs 
for the Executive Directors and managers below Board 
level who participate in the Group bonus scheme;
 ✷ bonus payments to Executive Directors following the 
assessment of performance measures and achievement 
against bonus objectives;

Routine payments
 ✷ all changes to Executive Director basic salaries, pensions 
and eligibility to benefits; and
Non-routine payments
 ✷ all non-routine payments to the Executive Directors 
including but not limited to leavers, new appointees

Notes:
 ✷ The minimum performance scenario comprises the 
fixed elements of remuneration only, based on salary 
and pension as per the policy for 2014/15 and estimated 
benefits based on 2013/14.
 ✷ The target level of bonus is taken to be 50% of the 
maximum bonus opportunity (100% of salary), and 
the target level of PSP vesting is assumed to be 50% of 
the face value assuming a normal grant level (100% 
of salary). These values are included in addition to the 
components/values of minimum remuneration. 
 ✷ Maximum assumes full bonus pay-out (100% of salary) 
and the full face value of the PSP (100% of salary), in 
addition to fixed components of remuneration.
 ✷ For simplicity, no share price growth has been factored 
into the calculations. The value of any Sharesave awards 
and notional dividends accruing on vested LTIP shares 
has been excluded.
Executive Director Share Ownership Guidelines
Under the guidelines the Executive Directors are expected 
to build and maintain a shareholding valued at 100% of 
basic salary with no upper limit on the number of shares 
they may hold. A time limit is not set to accumulate the 
shareholding, however, Executive Directors are required to 
retain all shares arising from vested PSP awards (net of tax) 
or purchase shares until the shareholding guideline is met. 
The number of shares needed to satisfy the shareholding is 
recalculated annually at the close of the next business day 
following the announcement of the full year results taking 
account of changes to basic salary.
Remuneration earned by the Executive 
Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the Directors are 
given in the bibliographic details on pages 46 and 47. 
The Committee considers that the external appointments 
of the Executive Directors have no detrimental impact 
on the performance of their duties. The Committee has 
approved that each Executive Director may retain his or her 
remuneration earned from external appointments up to 
£15,000 per year.

Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director 
would be set in accordance with the terms of the 
Company’s prevailing approved Remuneration Policy 
at the time of appointment and would take into account 
the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate 
for a candidate of that experience and the importance of 
securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to 
attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set 
initially at a below mid-market level on the basis that it may 
progress towards the mid-market level once expertise 
and performance have been proven and sustained. The 
annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of 
salary and grants under the PSP would be limited to 100% 
of salary (150% of salary in exceptional circumstances). 
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash 
and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or 
incentive pay forfeited by an Executive leaving a previous 
employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that 
these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in 
terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance 
conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any 
variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior 
role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms. In 
addition, any other on-going remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
and/or incidental expenses as appropriate.
If appropriate the Committee may agree, on the 
recruitment of a new Executive Director, a notice period in 
excess of 12 months but to reduce this to 12 months over a 
specified period.
At the Board’s discretion, early termination of an Executive 
Director’s service contract may be undertaken by way of 
payment of salary and benefits in lieu of the required notice 
period (or shorter period where permitted by the contract 
of service or where agreed with the Executive Director) 
and the Committee would take such steps as necessary to 
mitigate the loss to the Company and to ensure that the 
Executive Director observed his or her duty to mitigate loss. 
Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period 
of the financial year served although it will be pro-rated 
for time and paid at the normal payout date. Any share-
based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under 
the Company’s share plans will be determined based on 
the relevant plan rules. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, ill-health, injury, disability, 
redundancy, retirement, sale of employing business or 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, 
“good leaver” status may be applied.  For good leavers, 
awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the 
proportion of the performance period actually served. 
However, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion 
to determine that awards vest at cessation of employment 
and/or not to pro-rate awards.
Non-Executive Directors
Each of the Non-Executive Directors (‘NEDs’) has similar 
general terms for their agreement which can be found 
on Bloomsbury’s investor relations website at www.
bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The agreements provide for three 
months notice by the Director or by the Company with the 
option for the Company to terminate an appointment at 
any time on payment of three months fees in lieu of notice. 
Termination of the agreements is without compensation. 
Details of the NED agreements are as follows:

The annual fees of NEDs, excluding the Chairman, are 
determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
The annual fee of the Chairman is determined by the other 
NEDs and the Executive Directors. NEDs receive a basic 
annual fee plus an extra annual amount for additional 
responsibilities such as chairing Board committees. The fees 
of the NEDs and Chairman are periodically reviewed against 
benchmark data provided by external remuneration 
consultants. Where NEDs and the Chairman receive an 
increase in annual fee this is normally limited to the annual 
increase in salaries for Bloomsbury employees. The NEDs 
and Chairman do not participate in the Company’s annual 
bonus or share incentive schemes including Sharesave. 
PART B — Annual Report on Remuneration
The following provides details of the Remuneration Policy

this report, as indicated, have been audited.
Part B-1 (Audited Information) Implementation 
of the Remuneration Policy for the year ending 
28 February 2015
Executive Directors
Basic salary
From 1 March 2014, the Group’s employees generally, 
including the Executive Directors, received a pay increase 
of 3% reflecting the strong underlying performance of 
the business. From 1 March 2013 in respect of the previous 
year, increases for higher paid employees including 
the Executive Directors were limited to 0% subject to 
adjustments for increased responsibilities.
The basic salaries for the Executive Directors from 1 March 
2014 are as follows:
Pensions
In accordance with the policy, pension contributions will 
be set at 15% of basic salary for Nigel Newton and Wendy 
Pallot. No pension contributions will be made by the 
Company for Richard Charkin.
Other benefits
Benefits will continue to comprise of a car or car allowance 
(excluding Richard Charkin), medical cover, permanent 
health cover, life assurance and Company schemes offered 
to staff generally such as buying books for private use at the 
staff discount rate.
Annual bonus
For 2014/15, the maximum bonus potential will continue 
to be set at 100% of salary based on profit with 30% of 
the bonus paid subject to achieving further objectives 
including 10% on personal objectives and 20% on  
strategic objectives.
The Group Management Bonus scheme used in previous 
years for the Executive Directors will continue to be 
adopted for 2014/15. Under this scheme bonuses for the 
Executive Directors and approximately 40 managers are 
paid from a bonus pool determined by the Committee. The 
bonuses for the participants of the scheme are scaled back 
where the pool is not sufficient to pay maximum bonuses. 
The maximum bonus for each participant is capped 
and depends on them achieving their individual bonus 
objectives.
The pool is calculated as the excess of Adjusted Profits 
(before bonus) above a stretching target set by the 
Committee. No bonuses are paid if Adjusted Profits fall 
below the target.

Long-term incentives
As a result of the current PSP (Bloomsbury 2005 
Performance Share Plan) reaching the end of its 10 year life, 
shareholder consent for a new plan, based on the existing 
arrangements but updated in a number of areas to comply 
with best practice (including the reduction of the threshold 
vesting level and introduction of claw-back), will be sought 
at the 2014 AGM. 
Reflecting market practice for a FTSE SmallCap company, 
the PSP individual annual award limits under the current 
PSP will, subject to shareholder approval, be reduced in the 
new PSP from 150% of salary to 100% of salary. Further, the 
exceptional limit of 300% of salary in the current PSP will be 
reduced to 150% of salary. 
The annual PSP awards to be granted in 2014 will be subject 
to the following targets:
 ✷ Absolute EPS (50%) – 25% of this part of an award will 
vest for annualised growth in EPS over the performance 
period of RPI +3% increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting 
for annualised growth in EPS over the performance 
period of RPI + 8%; and
 ✷ Relative TSR (50%) – the Company’s TSR measured 
against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap 
(excluding investment trusts). 25% of this part of an 
award will vest at median increasing pro-rata to 100% 
vesting at top quartile or higher. 
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most 
appropriate measures of long-term performance for 
the Group, in that they ensure Executive Directors are 
incentivised and rewarded for the earnings performance of 
the Group as well as returning value to shareholders.
The awards will be subject to claw-back provisions. 
Subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee, 
the Executive Directors may participate in the Company’s 
Sharesave scheme if operated during 2014/15.

Annual bonus
Bonuses, which are capped at 100% of salary, were awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of the year ended  
28 February 2014 at a rate of 17% of salary. This bonus award follows the Committee’s assessment of performance against 
personal and strategic objectives and Adjusted Profits (before bonus) exceeding a target of £13 million.
Vesting of PSP awards
The PSP awards granted on 8 December 2011 are set to vest on 8 December 2014 based on EPS performance over the three 
years ended 28 February 2014 for 50% of awards and relative TSR over the three years from grant. As disclosed in previous

[1] The shareholding guideline was introduced during the year ended 28 February 2013 and can be found on the Company’s website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
The guideline requires that the Executive Director must retain shares vesting from the PSP awards net of tax until the shareholding guideline has been met. The 
number of shares needed to satisfy a shareholding is recalculated at the close of the next business day following the announcement of the full year results (the 
‘Review Date’). The recalculation is based on the Executive Director’s prevailing base salary and the closing mid market share price (165.25 pence) on the Review 
Date.
[2] The shareholdings shown are as at the date the Directors stood down from the Board being on 11 July 2013 for Sarah Jane Thomson and 29 August 2013 for 
Jeremy Wilson.
[3] Owned includes shares held directly by the Director and indirectly by a nominee on behalf of the Director where the Director has the beneficial interest. It includes 
the shares of the Director and of connected persons defined under the Model Code annexed to the UKLA Listing Rules.
There were no changes in the interests of any Director between 1 March 2014 and the date of this report.
No Director has or has had any interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, contract or arrangement (excluding service 
agreements), which is or was unusual in its nature or conditions or significant to the business of the Group during the 
current or immediately preceding financial year.
The closing market price of an Ordinary Share at 28 February 2014 was 177.0p (2013: 104.0p) and the range of intra-day 
market prices from 1 March 2013 to 28 February 2014 was 104.0p to 185.0p (2013: 101.6p to 148.0p).
Bloomsbury operates an HMRC approved Sharesave scheme for which all UK employees are eligible to participate. The 
following Sharesave options granted to the Executive Directors were outstanding at the year ended.

Remuneration Committee
Responsibilities and activities of the Committee
The Committee determines the Remuneration Policy and annual remuneration plans for the Executive Directors for 
approval by the Board. In particular, the Committee approves for each Executive Director the basic salaries, pensions, other 
benefits, bonus awards and the awards made under Bloomsbury’s Long Term Incentive Plan. The Committee approves all 
payments of bonus and the vesting of PSP awards before payments are made for each Executive Director. 
The Committee considers it is appropriate for the Executive Directors to determine the remuneration plans of senior 
management. In respect of employees below the level of the Board, the Committee approves the bonus pool from which 
bonuses are paid and approves the grant and vesting of all share incentives before payments are made.
Membership
For the year ended 28 February 2014 up until signing the Report the Committee has comprised three Non-Executive 
Directors as follows:
Director Appointed Resigned
Jill Jones (Chair of the Committee) 23 July 2013 —
Sarah Jane Thomson (Chair of the Committee) — 11 July 2013
Sir Anthony Salz 29 August 2013 –
Jeremy Wilson — 29 August 2013
Ian Cormack — –
The Group Company Secretary, Michael Daykin FCIS FCA, acts as secretary to the Committee. Sarah Jane Thomson chaired 
the Committee from 28 May 2010 until her resignation on 11 July 2013. All meetings or business of the Committee were 
conducted during the year with two Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman present.
The Committee met formally on 7 (seven) occasions during the year including 3 (three) occasions without the Executive 
Directors present and on four occasions with an Executive Director attending at the request of the Committee for specific

Assistance to the Committee
During the year the Committee took advice from external remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, which does not 
perform other services for and has no other connection with the Company (a statement to this effect is included on the 
Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk). The Committee is free to choose its advisors and is satisfied that New Bridge 
Street continues to provide advice that is objective and independent. Fees paid to New Bridge Street for 2013/14 totalled 
£14,131.
The Committee received assistance from the Group Company Secretary and, where specifically requested by the 
Committee, the Chief Executive and Finance Director. The Committee has considered any feedback received from the 
major shareholders during the year as part of Bloomsbury’s on-going investor relations programme and considers the 
reports and recommendations of shareholder representative bodies and corporate governance analysts.

Opinion and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended 28 February 2014 set out on 
pages 86 to 146. In our opinion: 
 ✷ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
28 February 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 ✷ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 ✷ the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
 ✷ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion on the financial statements the risks of material misstatements that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
The risk Our response
Revenue – revenue recognised in year ended 28 February 2014 of £109.5m
Returns provision – balance as at 28 February 2014 of £4.7m, balance as at 28 February 2013 £5.3m
Refer to pages 59 and 60 (Audit Committee Report), page 93 (accounting policy) and pages 101 and 118 (financial disclosures)
 
In some cases contracts entered into by the Bloomsbury 
Information division are complex. These arrangements 
may include: the licensing or outright sale of the Group’s 
intellectual property; the provision of on-going consultancy 
services; or a bundled combination of these.  
The complexity of the contractual terms may require the 
Group to make judgements in assessing when the triggers 
for revenue recognition have been met, particularly that 
the Group has sufficiently fulfilled its obligations (licensing, 
consultancy or outright sale) under the contract to allow 
revenue to be recognised. 
The Group typically sells its books on a sale or return basis. 
Estimating the level of returns from customers may have 
a material impact on the reported result. As such this is a 
significant focus area for our audit. 
For all individually significant Bloomsbury Information 
contracts signed during the year, our audit procedures 
included, among others:
 ✷ performing a detailed assessment of the contractual 
terms to identify the separate milestone delivery dates to 
the respective customer;
 ✷ identifying from the contracts the triggers for revenue 
recognition and subsequent assessment of the 
allocation of revenue to each period; 
 ✷ where revenue has been recognised, we obtained, on 
a sample basis, evidence that the Group had fulfilled its 
obligations under the contract. This included, where 
appropriate, evidence of customer acceptance; and
 ✷ for revenue on licensing arrangements that was 
recognised by the Group on delivery of the intellectual 
property, we considered whether there were any 
remaining contractual obligations or separate 
deliverables in the agreement which may preclude the 
recognition of revenue.  
For the returns provision, our procedures included, among 
others, an assessment of historical returns from customers 
and comparing this against the returns rate used in the 
underlying provision calculation as at 28 February 2014.  This 
specifically focused on the actual returns rate in 2012 and 
2013 financial years compared to those anticipated by the 
directors. 
We re-performed the Group’s return rate calculation and 
obtained evidence of actual returns post year end to assess 
the adequacy of the provision made as at 28 February 2014.
We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in respect 
of the key judgements and estimates descriptions and 
the amounts recognised as revenue during the period or 
deferred at the balance sheet date.

The risk Our response
Goodwill and intangibles – value at 28 February 2014 - £60.8m
Refer to page 60 (Audit Committee Report), pages 94 and 95 (accounting policy) and pages 112 to 114 (financial 
disclosures)
The Group has completed a number of significant 
acquisitions in the past three years. The recoverability of 
the goodwill and associated intangible assets is dependent 
on individual businesses acquired sustaining sufficient 
profitability in the future and the Group realising synergy 
savings associated with the acquisitions. Due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting 
future cash flows, which are the basis of the assessment of 
recoverability, this is a significant risk area that our audit is 
focused on. 
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing of 
the budgeting procedures upon which the forecasts are 
based and assessing the integrity of the discounted cash 
flow model. We used our own internal valuation specialist to 
challenge the assumptions used, in particular the inputs and 
methodology used to determine the discount rate used to 
calculate the present value of projected future cash flows. 
Our work included comparing the assumptions made by 
the Group in compiling the discount rate to market data. 
We considered the historical accuracy of key assumptions 
by comparing the accuracy of the previous estimates of 
revenue and cost growth to the actual amount achieved. 
We sensitised key assumptions, including revenue growth 
rate and the discount rate, and considered whether the 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions 
properly reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of 
goodwill and intangibles.
Advances – value at 28 February 2014 - £20.8m
Refer to page 60 (Audit Committee Report), page 96 (accounting policy) and pages 117 to 118 (financial disclosures)
The Group pays advances to its authors prior to the delivery 
of a manuscript. The Group recovers these advances from 
future sales by deducting royalties due to the author under 
the terms of the relevant royalty agreement. 
The advances balance is made up of a significant number 
of individual advances to authors and requires the Group to 
track sales made.  
In determining whether advances are recoverable, the 
Group must make judgements over the likely future sales of 
individual titles. Where insufficient sales are forecast by the 
Group, a provision is recorded. 
This is a significant risk area as there is inherent uncertainty 
regarding the future sales of individual titles.
In this area our procedures performed included, among 
others, testing the key controls in the advance process, 
including contract approval, and testing the accuracy 
of recording of contract information on the underlying 
accounting systems. This included agreeing the value of the 
advance paid and the royalty rate due to the author to the 
signed contract.
For individually significant advances held on balance 
sheet at the reporting date, we assessed the assumptions 
underlying forecast sales with directors and title editors, 
corroborating where possible to after date sales. 
In addition we analysed the accuracy of historical estimates 
of recoverability, both by genre and by title, by comparing 
forecasts made in prior period to actual outcomes. We also 
considered the adequacy of the disclosures in note 17 in the 
light of relevant accounting standards.

The risk Our response
Inventory – value at 28 February 2014 - £25.2m
Refer to page 59 (Audit Committee Report), page 96 (accounting policy) and page 117 (financial disclosures)
The Group has significant inventory balances. Estimates 
of stock obsolescence may have a material impact on the 
reported result. As such this is a significant focus area for our 
audit. 
In this area our procedures performed included, among 
others, performing independent counts at the third party 
stock handler and comparing the figures recorded to the 
reported stock take results.  We also assessed the accuracy of 
the inventory reconciliation performed by the Group, which 
included obtaining confirmation from the third party stock 
handler of amounts held. 
We assessed the recoverability of aged inventory items 
based on sales made in the year ended 28 February 2014 
and the Group’s internal forecast sales for future periods. In 
addition we assessed unit costing of stock by comparing, on 
a sample basis, the unit cost stock was recorded at against 
the sales price achieved in the year. 
 We considered the write offs made in the year and assessed 
whether the level of historical write offs was consistent with 
the year end stock provision. We also evaluated whether 
the Group’s provisioning policy was consistently applied 
and that, based on an assessment of historical write-offs, 
remained appropriate. 
We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in respect 
of inventory obsolescence as included in the Bloomsbury 
Annual Report. 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £675,000. This has been determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before income taxation (of which it represents 7.1%) which we consider to be one of the 
principal considerations for members of the Company in assessing the financial performance of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through 
our audit with a value in excess of £34,000 in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believed 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed by component audit teams at locations in the UK and USA. These 
audits covered 93% of total Group revenue; 100% of Group profit before taxation and 97% of total Group assets. The 
Group team also performed analytical procedures over the components in Australia and India, which accounted for the 
remaining 7% of revenue.
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes at the key reporting components of the Company were all 
performed to component materiality levels. These materiality levels were set individually for each component and agreed 
with the group audit team and ranged from £400,000 to £500,000. 
Detailed instructions were sent to all the auditors in these locations. These instructions covered the significant areas that 
should be addressed by the component auditors (which included the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed 
above) and set out the information required to be reported back to the group audit team. The group audit team visited 
locations in both the UK and USA. Telephone meetings were also held with the auditors at these locations.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the Annual Report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 ✷ we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
Statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
 ✷ the Audit Committee Report on pages 58 to 61 does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ✷ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 ✷ the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ✷ certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 ✷ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 ✷ the Directors’ Statement, set out on page 52, in relation to going concern; and
 ✷ the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 54 to 64 relating to the Company’s compliance with the 
nine provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 53, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description  
of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at

The Directors believe that the Group’s diversification of product and geographical spread together with its monitoring 
and forecasting processes place the Group well in managing its business risks. The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading performance, indicate that the Group is able to operate within 
the level of its current available facilities including compliance with the bank facility covenants. Details of the bank facility 
and its covenants are shown in note 23c.
After making enquiries of senior management and reviewing cash flow forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 
until June 2015, being the period of the detailed going concern assessment reviewed by the Board. They therefore 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. 
d) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical judgements and areas 
where the use of estimates is significant are disclosed in note 2v. 
e) Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were adopted by the Group for the year ended 28 February 2014 and have 
not had a material impact on the Group financial statements:
 ✷ Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’( effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013);

The Directors are currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations 
or amendments issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. 
They have not been adopted early by the Group and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements.
f) Basis of consolidation
i. Business combinations
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
 The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 ✷ the fair value of consideration transferred; plus
 ✷ the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; less
 ✷ the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 Where the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
  The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such 
amounts are generally recognised in the income statement.
  Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with the business combination are expensed as incurred.
  Any contingent consideration payable is measured and recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement.
  For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, the Group applies IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2004) in accounting for 
business combinations. All changes to contingent consideration in respect of these acquisitions are recognised as an 
adjustment  to goodwill.
ii. Subsidiaries
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
  Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies to obtain 
economic benefit for the Group. The financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
 Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with accounting policies adopted by the Group to ensure consistency.
  All subsidiaries except Bloomsbury Publishing India Private Limited have a reporting period end of 28 February. 
Bloomsbury Publishing India Private Limited has a reporting period end of 31 March, which aligns with the Indian 
government’s financial year. 
iii. Loss of control
  On the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests 
and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is 
recognised in the income statement.

iv. Transactions eliminated on consolidation
  All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated 
on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of 
the asset transferred.
g) Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received from the provision of goods, services and rights falling within 
the Group’s ordinary activities, after deduction of trade discounts, value added tax and anticipated returns. 
 — Revenue from book publishing is recognised when title passes. A provision for anticipated returns is made based 
primarily on historical return rates. If these do not reflect actual returns in future periods then revenues could be 
understated or overstated for a particular period.
 — Revenue from the sale of publishing and distribution rights, including film, paperback, electronic, overseas publishing 
rights and sponsorship, is recognised on receipt of contractual documentation or receipt of funds, whichever occurs 
first. 
 — Revenue from database contracts is recognised in accordance with the stages of completion of contractual services 
provided. The degree of completion is calculated as a proportion of the content generated against the contractually 
agreed milestone, for example number of words generated. Where the degree of completion of milestones cannot be 
reliably measured, revenue is only recognised in full on completion. 
 — Revenue from management services contracts is usually recognised on a straight line basis over the period that the 
service is provided.
 — Revenue from e-book sales is recognised when content is delivered.
h) Foreign currencies
i. Functional and presentation currency 
  Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). These consolidated financial 
statements are presented in sterling (£) as this is the most representative currency of the Group’s operations. All 
financial information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise stated.
ii. Transactions and balances
  Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded in the functional currency at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at closing rates of exchange at the date of the statement of financial position. 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement within administrative expenses.
iii. Group companies
  The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 — Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date 
of that statement of financial position;
 — Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates; and
 — All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation 
reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign entity these exchange differences are recycled to the income statement. 
  Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity

i) Taxation
  The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
i. Current tax
  The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
ii. Deferred tax
  Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally 
recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 
profit. 
  Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be generated 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
  Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. 
iii. Current and deferred tax for the year
  Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or 
charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or equity respectively. 
j) Goodwill and other intangible assets
i. Goodwill
  Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business 
(see note 2f i) less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
  For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of 
cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
  A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is 
less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the 
unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement. An 
impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. 
  On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal. 
ii. Other intangible assets
  Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Bloomsbury Annual Report 2014 BACK Proof 9.indd   94 11/06/2014   16:41:47 23265-04 11 June 2014 4:35 PM  Proof 9
  Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over their expected 
useful lives by equal annual instalments at the following rates:
Publishing rights — 5% to 20% per annum
Imprints — 3% to 5% per annum
Subscriber and customer relationships — 6% to 17% per annum
Product and systems development — 14% to 20% per annum
  Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted prospectively 
if appropriate.
iii. Product and systems development
  Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of systems, such as software products, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Likewise costs incurred in developing a product, typically an online platform, are 
recognised as intangible assets.
  Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially feasible, 
future economic benefits are probable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development and use the 
asset.
k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated in order to write down their cost less residual value using the straight-line 
method over their expected useful lives at the following rates: 
Short leasehold improvements — over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and fittings — 10% per annum
Computer and other office equipment — 20% per annum
Motor vehicles — 25% per annum
Depreciation is pro-rated in the years of acquisition and disposal of an asset. The estimated useful lives, residual value 
and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income 
statement.
l) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At the end of each reporting period the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
m) Inventories
Inventories include bound stock. The cost of work in progress and finished goods represents the amounts invoiced to the 
Group for origination, paper, printing and binding. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions are made for slow 
moving and obsolete stock.
n) Royalty advances to authors
Advances of royalties to authors are included within prepayments and accrued income when the advance is paid less any 
provision required to adjust the advance to its net realisable value. The royalty advance is expensed at the contracted or 
effective royalty rate as the related revenues are earned.
o) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be 
estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. When 
a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present 
value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
p) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group has become a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as below:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at fair value after provision for bad and doubtful debts and anticipated future sales returns. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group, repayable 
on demand.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
q) Operating leases
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as an 
operating lease by the lessee. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

r) Employee benefits
i. Defined contribution plans
  Pension costs relating to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period 
for which related services are rendered by the employee. 
ii. Defined benefit plans
  Until 1997 a subsidiary company operated a defined benefit pension scheme. The retirement obligation recognised in 
the balance sheet represents the net of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method.
  Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged 
or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The service cost, representing 
benefits accruing over the year, is included in the income statement as an operating cost. Net interest is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit obligation and is presented as finance costs or finance income.
iii. Termination benefits
  Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic 
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan either to terminate employment before the normal retirement date, 
or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
iv. Share-based payment transactions
  The Group issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date 
of equity-settled share-based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. 
  Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes and sharesave scheme are equity settled. The fair values of 
such options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model or a modified version of the same, based on publicly 
available market data. 
  Awards granted under the Group’s performance share plan are equity settled. Half of any award granted under the 
plan is subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is 
calculated using the Stochastic model. The other half of any award granted under the plan is subject to an Earnings Per 
Share performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
s) Employee benefit trust
The Company operates an employee benefit trust and has de facto control of shares held by the trust and bears their 
benefits and risks. The Group considers the trust to be substantially under its control and so consolidates the financial 
information of the trust as stated in note 2.f. The Group records the assets and liabilities of the trust as its own and shares 
held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Finance costs and administrative expenses 
are charged as they accrue.
t) Segmental reporting
Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’), regarded as the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The CEO views the Group primarily from a nature of business basis, reflecting the divisional performance of Adult, 
Children’s & Educational, Academic & Professional and Information. Segment results that are reported to the CEO include 
items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Performance is 
evaluated based on operating profit contributions using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Group’s financial 
statements.
u) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as liabilities once they are appropriately authorised.

v) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
reasonable expectations of future events. The resultant estimates will, by definition, not necessarily equal the related actual 
results and may require adjustment in subsequent accounting periods. The estimates and assumptions that may cause a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are:
Revenue recognition 
Certain contracts entered into by the Bloomsbury Information division may include: the licensing or outright sale of the 
Group’s intellectual property; the provision of ongoing consultancy services; or a bundled combination of both. The 
Group considers contractual terms and makes judgements in assessing when the triggers for revenue recognition have 
been met, particularly that the Group has sufficiently fulfilled its obligations under the contract to allow revenue to be 
recognised.
Book returns
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which 
is then carried forward and offset against trade receivables in the statement of financial position in anticipation of book 
returns received subsequent to the reporting period end. The provision is calculated by reference to historical returns 
rates and expected future returns.
Author royalty advances
A provision is made by the Group against advances on published titles which may not be covered by royalties on 
anticipated future title sales or subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all 
published titles advances. If it is unlikely that royalties from future title sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down the 
advance, a provision is made in the income statement for the difference between the carrying value and the anticipated 
recoverable amount from future earnings.
Inventory
At the end of each reporting period a review is carried out on all published titles where inventory is held. A provision is 
made by the Group against unsold inventory on a title by title basis, with regard to historical net sales and expected future 
net sales, to value the inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Impairment reviews
IFRS requires management to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite life assets and, for finite life assets, 
to test for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable. The Group currently undertakes an annual impairment test covering goodwill and other indefinite life assets 
and also reviews finite life assets to consider whether a full impairment review is required. 
Intangible assets recoverability is an area involving management judgement, requiring assessment as to whether the 
carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash 
flow projections which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash 
flows, certain assumptions are required to be made. Note 12 details the assumptions used.

b) Factors affecting tax charge for the year
The tax on the Group’s profit before tax differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom of 23.08% 
(2013: 24.17%). The reasons for this are explained below:
Year ended 28 February 2014 Year ended 28 February 2013
  £’000 % £’000 %
Profit before taxation 9,479 100.00 9,847 100.00

of corporation tax in the UK of 23.08% (2013: 24.17%) 2,188 23.08 2,380 24.17
Effects of:

 Utilisation of Bloomsbury Verlag losses in the UK – – (43) (0.44)
Tax charge for the year 1,776 18.73 2,029 20.60
The £484,000 includes an adjustment to align the prior year Group tax charge with recently submitted tax returns and the 
write off of old payable balances no longer due.
c) Factors affecting tax charge for future years
The UK current tax rate will be reduced from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and to 20% with effect from 1 April 
2015 in line with previously substantively enacted legislation. The rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities has 
also been reduced to 20%, creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected in the consolidated income statement and 
partly in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

9. Acquisitions
Hart Publishing 
On 2 September 2013 the Group acquired the issued share capital of Hart Publishing Limited (‘Hart’), the Oxford-based 
legal publisher, from the management shareholders. An initial consideration of £6.5 million was paid in cash on completion 
from Bloomsbury’s own cash reserves. A further cash consideration of up to a maximum of £0.5 million is payable on the 
achievement of certain revenue and title number targets for the period ending 31 March 2014. The Group expects these 
targets to be met. This is net of a working capital adjustment of £288,000 as the closing working capital was less than the 
target closing working capital anticipated at the point of acquisition. The acquisition is consistent with Bloomsbury’s 
strategy to increase its proportion of academic and professional revenues to 50% of total sales in five years’ time. Around 
50% of Hart’s revenue is generated outside the UK, thereby increasing Bloomsbury’s benefit from the global book market. 
The acquisition will also enable the Company to further develop its e-book publishing and expand the Bloomsbury 
Professional digital suite of services.
The table below summarises the fair values to the Group included in the consolidated financial statements of the major 
categories of assets and liabilities of Hart at the date of acquisition:

Identifiable intangible assets of £2,196,000 consist of publishing rights of £621,000, imprint of £1,110,000 and customer 
relationships of £465,000. The publishing rights have a useful life of between 10 and 13 years, imprint 20 years and customer 
relationships 14 years. 
The gross contractual trade receivable at acquisition is £556,000, of which £16,000 is the best estimate of the contractual 
cash flows that are not expected to be collected.
Transaction costs of £159,000 have been expensed in the year within administrative expenses. 
From 2 September 2013, revenue of £1,753,000 and profit attributable to owners of the Company of £538,000 have been 
included in the consolidated income statement in relation to Hart.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 March 2013 the revenue and profit attributable to Shareholders of the combined 
entity from continuing operations for the current year would have been £110,648,000 and £7,738,000 respectively. These 
pro forma amounts do not include any possible synergies from the acquisition. The pro forma information is provided for 
comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily 
indicative of future results of operations of the combined companies.
New Holland
On 4 September 2013 the Group acquired the natural history list from New Holland Publishers for an initial consideration of 
£389,000. A further cash consideration of £50,000 will be payable a year after the acquisition date subject to New Holland 
providing a complete set of novation agreements in respect of the authors. 
Goodwill of £116,000 and intangible assets of £209,000 were recognised on acquisition. The intangible assets consist 
entirely of publishing rights. The publishing rights have a useful life of 13 years. 
Prior year acquisitions
Fairchild Books
On 30 March 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Fairchild Books from Fairchild Fashion Media, a unit of 
Advance Magazine Publishers Inc, for a cash consideration of £3,823,000 ($6,117,000). This was net of a working capital 
adjustment of £239,000 ($383,000) as the closing working capital was less than the target closing working capital 
anticipated at the point of acquisition. The consideration is being paid in cash in three equal annual instalments, 
commencing at the acquisition date. The acquisition of Fairchild Books makes the Group a market-leading publisher of 
textbooks and educational resources for students of fashion, merchandising, retailing and interior design. 
The table below summarises the fair values to the Group included in the consolidated financial statements of the major 
categories of assets and liabilities of Fairchild Books at the date of acquisition.

Identifiable intangible assets of £1,188,000 consist of publishing rights of £940,000 and customer relationships of £248,000. 
The publishing rights have a useful life of 15 years and customer relationships 9 years. A gain of £210,000 as a result of 
a bargain purchase was recognised within highlighted items in administrative expenses in the prior year consolidated 
income statement. The transaction resulted in a gain mainly because of the significant adjustment on alignment of the 
returns policy.

The gross contractual trade receivable at acquisition was £778,000 of which £203,000 was the best estimate of the 
contractual cash flows that were not expected to be collected.
Transaction costs of £49,000 were expensed in the prior year within administrative expenses. 
From 30 March 2012 revenue of £5,177,000 and profit attributable to owners of the Company of £1,876,000 were included

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 March 2012 the revenue and profit attributable to shareholders of the combined

As part of the acquisition, Bloomsbury Publishing Inc. entered into a promissory note and guarantee to pay to Advance 
Magazine Publishers Inc. $4,333,334 in two annual instalments to satisfy the outstanding consideration on this acquisition. 
One instalment of $2,166,667 is outstanding at 28 February 2014. Bloomsbury Publishing Plc guaranteed the payment of 
this amount on behalf of its subsidiary.
Applied Visual Arts
On 29 June 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Applied Visual Arts Publishing (‘AVA’) from Applied Visual 
Arts Publishing SA and AVA Publishing (UK) Limited for £1,755,000 (CHF 2,579,000). The consideration is being paid in 
three equal annual instalments from the date of acquisition. The acquisition of AVA enhances Bloomsbury’s Academic 
& Professional division. AVA is a publisher of textbooks and educational resources for students and professionals in the 
applied visual arts and has a strong following in the design community.

From 29 June 2012 revenue of £824,000 and loss attributable to owners of the Company of £53,000 were included in the

11. Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share for the year ended 28 February 2014 is calculated using a weighted average number of 
Ordinary shares in issue of 72,852,467 (2013: 72,331,464) after deducting shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust. 
The diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares to take account 
of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares, which are in respect of unexercised share options and the performance share plan.

Management have aligned the monitoring of goodwill to how it reviews the performance of the business. Goodwill is 
monitored by management at the publishing division level. 2013 has been restated to reflect the alignment. The following

Impairment testing
The recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill has been considered with regard to value in use calculations. These 
calculations use the pre-tax future cash flow projections of each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) based on the Board’s 
approved budgets for the year ended 28 February 2015 and the Board approved five-year plan. The calculations include 
a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of the five-year plan with a long-term growth rate assumption 
applied.
The key assumptions for calculating value in use are:
 
 
 
Discount

Other US business units 9.7 – 10.4 0.8 – 7.9 2.4
Discount rates
The discount rates applied to the cash flows are calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of 
capital for the Group. This is adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates. The Group has considered 
the impact of the current economic climate in determining appropriate discount rates. 
Growth rates
Growth rates have been calculated on those applied to the Board approved budget for the year ended 28 February 
2015 and five-year plan. They incorporate future expectations of growth in backlist revenues and identified new revenue 
streams.

Long-term growth rates
The five-year forecasts are extrapolated to perpetuity on the basis that the relevant CGUs are long established business 
units.
Gross margin
Gross margins have been based on historic performance and expected changes to the sales mix in future periods. 
Sensitivity
The Group has not identified any reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of 
goodwill of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

Due to changes in the statutory tax rate in the UK, deferred tax is provided at 20% (2013: 23%) which is the rate that has 
been substantively enacted to apply from 1 April 2015. The impact of the change in tax rate is a credit of £263,000 (2013: 
£105,000), of which £268,000 (2013: £110,000) has been recognised in the deferred tax charge in the consolidated income 
statement and the remainder recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Deferred tax assets in respect of losses are only recognised to the extent that it is anticipated they will be utilised in the 
foreseeable future.

The Group had deferred tax assets not recognised in the financial statements as follows:
 
 
 
28 February
2014
£’000
28 February
2013
£’000
Unused tax losses 598 994
Non-trading losses 425 541
Total 1,023 1,535
These deferred tax assets are recoverable against available taxable profits of the same type or from the same trades in 
future years. They have not been recognised in the financial statements as it is not sufficiently certain that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the losses.
The gross tax losses on which no deferred asset has been recognised were £2,989,000 (2013: £4,320,000). This relates to tax 
losses for a subsidiary in the UK. These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At 28 February 2014 the Group had non-trading losses of approximately £2,126,000 (2013: £2,352,000). A deferred tax asset 
has not been recognised in respect of non-trading losses carried forward as it is not clear whether sufficient non-trading 
income against which the losses may be offset will arise in the Group in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the Group controls the timing of remittance and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

As at 28 February 2014 £5,120,000 (2013: £4,403,000) of other receivables are expected to be recovered after more than  
12 months.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. The 
Group’s exposure to credit and currency risks is disclosed in note 23. Trade receivables principally comprise amounts 
receivable from the sale of books due from distributors. The average number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the 
Group was 97 days (2013: 100 days). 
The majority of trade debtors are secured by credit insurance and in certain territories by overseas third party distributors.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made with reference to specific debts, past default experience, trading 
history and the current economic environment. Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables

The property provision includes amounts provided for onerous lease commitments and dilapidations. The timing of cash 
flows for onerous lease commitments is dependent on the terms of the leases.
The Group acquired Oxford International Publishers Limited (t/a Berg Publishers) in 2008. The contingent consideration 
arrangement is based on average revenues for the Berg Fashion element of the business and is payable based on results 
for the years ended 28 February 2015 and 29 February 2016. The maximum potential undiscounted amount of all future 
payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is £1,000,000, of 
which £377,000 has been recognised at 28 February 2014.
The Group acquired Hart Publishing Limited in 2013. The contingent consideration arrangement is based on the 
achievement of certain revenue and title number targets for the period ending 31 March 2014. The maximum potential 
undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent 
consideration arrangement is £500,000, of which £500,000 has been recognised at 28 February 2014 (see note 9).

Group are potential beneficiaries of the EBT. The results and net assets of the EBT are included in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group. 
During the year ended 28 February 2014 327,824 shares held by the EBT were used to satisfy share option exercises under 
the Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan (see note 21). 39,245 EBT shares were used to satisfy the dividends due on the 
vested shares exercised. 
The market value of the 898,244 shares of the Company held at 28 February 2014 (2013: 1,265,313) in the EBT was £1,590,000 
(2013: £1,316,000). Whilst the trustee has power to subscribe for Ordinary Shares and to acquire Ordinary Shares in the 
market or from Treasury, it is not permitted to hold more than five per cent of the issued share capital without prior 
approval of the Shareholders.
As at the date of signing this Annual Report, the Trust held 898,244 Ordinary Shares of 1.25 pence, being approximately 
1.2% of the issued Ordinary Share capital. 
Retained earnings
The retained earnings reserve comprises profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company and other items 
recognised through other comprehensive income and directly through equity as presented on the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity.

21. Share-based payments
Options over shares of the ultimate parent undertaking, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, have been granted to employees of 
the Group under various schemes. 
The total share-based payment charge to the income statement for the year was as follows:
Year ended

2014

Year ended
28 February
2013
£’000
Equity settled share-based transactions 597 547
Cash settled share-based transactions 89 68
Total 686 615
National Insurance contributions are payable by the Company in respect of some of the share-based payment transactions. 
These contributions are payable on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments and are 
therefore treated as cash settled awards. The Group had an accrual for National Insurance at 28 February 2014 of £48,000 
(2013: £68,000), of which none related to vested options. 
a) The 1994 Approved Executive Share Option Schemes (‘Approved 1994 ESOS’)
All Approved 1994 ESOS options outstanding at 28 February 2014 and 28 February 2013 have vested. No options have been 
granted under the scheme since 2004. 
Grants under the Approved 1994 ESOS were made on an annual basis to selected employees, with the exercise price 
of options being not less than the higher of the nominal value of an Ordinary Share and the average middle market 
quotation of an Ordinary Share for the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer of options under the Scheme. If 
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of the grant or if (except in certain circumstances) the 
employee leaves the Group, the options lapse.

b) The Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan 2005 (‘the PSP’)
The Group operates the PSP for Directors and senior employees. Awards under the scheme are granted as conditional 
share awards. The number of Ordinary Shares comprised in an award is calculated using a share value equal to either the 
average middle-market price of the Ordinary Share for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or the 
middle-market price on the dealing day before the award date. 
The vesting period is three years and the level of vesting is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) and 
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance conditions. For details of the performance conditions see the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 81. Awards are not exercisable after the vesting date and awards that vest on the 
vesting date are automatically exercised. Except in certain circumstances awards lapse if the employee leaves the Group.

model. The inputs were:

Expected term 3 years 3 years
Expected volatility n/a 25.17%
Risk free interest rate n/a 0.73%
Fair value charge per award 171.63 pence 109.58 pence
The expected volatility was based on Bloomsbury’s share price volatility over the period prior to grant equal in length to 
the expected three year performance period. Half of each award is subject to an EPS performance condition (which is not 
factored into the valuation). Half of each award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return condition whereby performance is 
compared to the FTSE Mid 250 companies (excluding Investment Trusts) over a three year period from the date of grant. 
A median ranking results in 30% of shares subject to this performance condition vesting, rising to 100% for a top quartile 
ranking. The discount for this TSR condition is calculated at the date of grant using the Stochastic model.

c) Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005
The Group operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings related share option scheme under which employees 
are granted options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company in three, five or seven years’ time, dependent upon 
their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions to a savings account over the period of the savings term. The 
Sharesave Plan is open to all UK employees.

22. Retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs
The pension costs charged to the income statement of £602,000 (2013: £692,000) relate to the Group’s defined 
contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. 
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to the income statement of £597,000 (2013: £702,000) represents contributions payable to 
these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. At 28 February 2014 there were no prepaid 
contributions (2013: nil).
Defined benefit plan
A subsidiary company operates a defined benefit scheme for some staff which is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. 
Accrual of benefits ceased in 1997, with the scheme now operated as a closed fund. There is no obligation in respect of 
medical costs. The scheme is actuarially valued every three years. The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at  
29 February 2012 and updated to 28 February 2014 by a qualified independent actuary.
Contributions are paid by the employer at the rate of £1,725 per month, plus expenses as and when required. 
Contributions paid to the scheme during the year were £34,000 (2013: £31,000). The Directors’ best estimate of the 
contribution to be paid for in the year ending 28 February 2015 is £33,000. 
The Group’s policy is to fund the deficit in the scheme by additional contributions to meet the scheme’s commitment to 
members.

Financial risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets 
and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from the key risks of market risk 
(including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Board has approved the Group Treasury policies and procedures by which the Group Treasury function is to be 
managed. The Group Treasury Function is headed by the Group Finance Director and is part of Bloomsbury’s Finance 
Department. It operates under a delegated authority from the Board.
The treasury management policies and procedures focus on the investment of surplus operating cash likely to be needed 
in order to support Bloomsbury’s on-going operations, foreign currency requirements and interest rate risk management. 
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The policies are reviewed at least on an annual basis 
by the Group Finance Director and any amendments are approved by the Board. The Board is assisted in its oversight role 
by Internal Audit, who undertakes regular reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are 
reported to the Audit Committee. 
a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in 
interest rates. The Group incurs costs in the same currencies as it earns revenue, creating some degree of natural hedging. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by Group 
Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets so as 
to control exposure to the relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as 
funding, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group has significant interest bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and as such cash flows are 
dependent on changes in market interest rates.

£’000
Variable rate financial assets 9,237 14,078
Fixed rate financial assets 800 547
Total 10,037 14,625
Fixed rate financial assets are short-term bank deposits with a maturity date range of one day to one month. 
Variable rate financial assets are cash at bank. The average rate of interest during the year was 0.2% (2013: 0.3%). The 
Group had no interest-bearing financial liabilities at 28 February 2014 or 28 February 2013.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate financial assets
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore a change in 
interest rates at 28 February 2014 would not affect the income statement. 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The Group derived the following sensitivities to assess the impact of changes in interest rates, based on the effect of 
the market volatility in the current climate and the previous 12 months. The analysis assumes all other variables remain 
constant.

(ii) Currency risk
The Directors believe that in its current circumstances the Group’s risk from foreign currency exposure is limited and no 
active currency risk management by hedging is considered necessary, as a significant proportion of revenues are matched 
by expenditure in the same local currency creating some degree of natural hedging.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group derived the following sensitivities based on the outstanding foreign currency denominated financial assets 
and liabilities at the year end. The sensitivity analysis includes loans to foreign operations within the Group where the 
denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or the borrower. 
The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates 
between the current and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change

b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s trade and rights revenue receivables. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The amounts presented in the statement 
of financial position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on 
trading experience and the current economic environment. An analysis of the relevant provisions is set out in note 17.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings as assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies.
The Group determines its concentration of credit risk based on the individual characteristics of its customers and publicly 
available knowledge of specific circumstances affecting those customers. The Group defines counterparties as having 
similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final 
customers are set by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit 
limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to 
established international groups whose business includes a number of publishing interests and clients. The Group’s risk is 
limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are secured by credit insurance and in the US credit 
risk for significant amounts outstanding through distributors rests with the distributor.

c) Liquidity risk
The Directors do not consider that the Group currently has a significant exposure to liquidity risk, as the Group has no 
borrowing and has sufficient cash deposits to meet its debts as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow budgets and forecasts are prepared by the operating entities of the Group, aggregated for the Group and 
regularly reviewed by the Board, and the actual cash position of the Group and each entity is compared monthly against 
budget. This allows management to ensure that each operating entity and the Group have sufficient cash to meet 
operational needs. Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balance required for working capital 
management is invested in interest bearing accounts and money market deposits. 
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc. At 28 February 2014 the Group had at its disposal

28. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s 
registered office can be found on page 148. The Company is primarily involved in the publication of books and other 
related services.
29. Significant accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations adopted by the European 
Union (‘EU’) at the time of preparing these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least until June 2015, being the 
period of the detailed going concern assessment reviewed by the Board.
The Company accounting policies are consistent with the Group policies set out in note 2 of the consolidated financial 
statements. Key additional policies are stated below. 
b) Parent company result
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to 
present the Company income statement or statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s profit for the year was 
£4,705,000 (2013: £1,293,000). 
c) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Company financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and in any future years affected. Critical judgements and areas 
where the use of estimates is significant are disclosed in note 2v for the Group and are applicable for the Company.
d) Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were adopted by the Company for the year ended 28 February 2014 and 
have not had a material impact on the Company financial statements:
 ✷ Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’(effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013);
 ✷ IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013); and 
 ✷ Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Financial statement presentation’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 July 2012). Other comprehensive income items have been presented on the basis of whether they are potentially 
reclassifiable to the income statement. 
The Directors are currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations 
or amendments issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. 
They have not been adopted early by the Company and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s 
financial statements.

e) Investment in subsidiary companies
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less accumulated impairment in the statement of financial position. 
Investments are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there are any indicators of impairment. Any 
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the year they occur.
f) Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees of the Group. Equity-settled 
share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of equity-settled share-based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Company’s share option schemes and sharesave scheme are equity settled. The fair values of 
such options have been calculated using the Black–Scholes model or a modified version of the same, based on publicly 
available market data. 
Awards granted under the Company’s performance share plan are equity settled. Half of any award granted under 
the plan is subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards 
is calculated using the Stochastic model. Half of any award granted under the plan is subject to an Earnings Per Share 
performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Black–Scholes model.
The Company recharges a share of the share-based payment charge to subsidiaries. This recharge is made via 
intercompany transactions.

Due to changes in the statutory tax rate in the UK, deferred tax is now provided at 20% (2013: 23%) which is the rate that 
has been substantively enacted to apply from 1 April 2015. The impact of the change in tax rate is a charge of £6,000 (2013: 
£13,000), of which £1,000 (2013: £8,000) has been recognised as a deferred tax charge in the income statement and the 
remainder recognised in equity.

Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the Group controls the timing of remittance and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Non-current amounts owed by Group undertakings represent loan balances due from subsidiary companies. These loans 
are technically repayable on demand, however there is no intention to demand repayment of the loans within the next 
12 months. As at 28 February 2014 £2,001,000 (2013: £2,328,000) of prepayments and accrued income are expected to be 
recovered after more than 12 months.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values. The 
Company’s exposure to credit and currency risks is disclosed in note 40. Trade receivables principally comprise amounts 
receivable from the sale of books due from distributors. The average number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the 
Company was 199 days (2013: 204 days).

assets and liabilities at the year end. 
The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates 
between the current and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible 
change in foreign exchange rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity:

b) Credit risk 
The Company has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final 
customers are set by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit 
limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to 
established international groups whose business includes a number of publishing interests and clients. The Company’s risk 
is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are secured by credit insurance. 
c) Liquidity risk
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc. At 28 February 2014 the Group had at its disposal 
£12 million of undrawn borrowing facilities (2013: £12 million) comprised of a £10 million committed revolving loan facility 
and a £2 million overdraft. The overdraft facility is available until November 2014 and the loan facility matures in July 2016. 
The facility is subject to two covenants being a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest cover covenant.

To Bloomsbury Shareholders and, for information only, to the holders of share options and awards under the 
Company’s share incentive schemes
This document is important and requires your immediate attention.
1. If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take, you are recommended to seek your own financial advice 
immediately from your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant, fund manager or other appropriate 
independent financial adviser authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
2. If you sell or have sold or otherwise transferred all of your shares, you should send this document together with the 
accompanying Form of Proxy as soon as possible to the purchaser or transferee or to the stockbroker, bank or other

Dear Shareholder
The 2014 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Company”) is to be held at 50 Bedford 
Square, London WC1B 3DP on Tuesday 22 July 2014 at 12 noon. The formal notice convening the AGM is set out on pages 
154 to 165 below.
Information regarding the AGM, including the information required by section 311A of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
“Act”), is available from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
The AGM is an important opportunity for the Directors to listen to the Shareholders and respond to their questions. It is 
also when Shareholders are asked to vote in favour of various resolutions related to the running and management of the 
Company. Therefore below are explanatory notes relating to the resolutions that you will be asked to consider and vote on 
at the AGM. Resolutions 1 to 12, 16, 17 and 18 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and resolutions 13, 14 and 15 will be 
proposed as special resolutions.
As at 12 noon on the date of this notice, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 73,844,724 Ordinary Shares of 
1.25 pence each (subject to any changes which will be notified to you at the beginning of the AGM). Each Ordinary Share 
carries the right to one vote at a General Meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the 
Company as at 12 noon on the date of this notice is 73,844,724.
As a Shareholder, you are entitled to attend and vote but, if you are not able to attend, then you may appoint one or more 
proxies to attend, speak and vote on your behalf.
As your vote is important to us, whether or not you intend to come to the AGM, you are asked to return the Form of Proxy 
enclosed with this document. Completing the Form of Proxy will not prohibit Shareholders from attending, and voting at, 
the AGM in person.
Ordinary Business to be proposed at the 2014 Annual General Meeting
Resolutions 1 (ordinary resolution) – Report and Accounts
To receive the report of the Directors and the financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2014, together with the 
report of the auditors.
Resolutions 2 and 3 (ordinary resolutions) – Approval of (i) Annual Statement by the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee and Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration and (ii) the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy Report.
Under new legislation that came into force in the UK on 1 October 2013, the Company is required to offer an advisory vote 
on the implementation of the Company’s existing Remuneration Policy in terms of the payments and share awards made 
to Directors during the year (the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Annual 
Report on Remuneration) and a separate binding vote on the Company’s forward looking Remuneration Policy (the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report).
Resolution 2 seeks Shareholder approval for the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and 
the Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration as set out on pages 65 to 66 and 72 to 81 respectively of the  
2014 Annual Report and Accounts (for the year ended 28 February 2014).

Subject to such approval, the proposed effective date of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report is 22 July 2014, being 
the date of the AGM of the Company.
Resolutions 4 (ordinary resolution) – Final Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of 4.84p per share for the year ended 28 February 2014. If approved, the 
recommended final dividend will be paid on 24 September 2014 to all Shareholders who are on the register of members 
on 29 August 2014. Payments will be made by cheque or BACS (where there is an existing dividend mandate). The final 
dividend equates to an aggregate distribution to Shareholders of approximately £3.53m making approximately £4.25m 
for the interim and final dividend together.
Resolutions 5 to 10 (ordinary resolutions) – Re-election and election of Directors
In accordance with article 86.2 of the Articles of Association, any Director appointed after the 2013 AGM (held on 23 July 
2013) has to retire and may stand for election at the 2014 AGM.  Sir Anthony Salz (appointed on 29 August 2013), Jill Jones 
(appointed on 23 July 2013) and Stephen Page (appointed on 20 August 2013) will retire at the AGM and, being eligible, 
offer themselves for reappointment. The Board has considered the appraisal of the performance of each Director falling 
due to retire and recommends the reappointment of such Directors.
In accordance with article 78.1 of the Articles of Association, one-third of the Directors who are subject to retirement by 
rotation are required to retire at the AGM.  Richard Charkin (who was last reappointed as a Director at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company held in 2012) will retire at the AGM and, being eligible, offers himself for reappointment. The 
Board has considered the appraisal of the performance of Richard Charkin and recommends he is reappointed.
In accordance with article 78.2 of the Articles of Association, each Director who has not stood for re-election at each of 
the preceding two AGMs is subject to retirement by rotation and is required to retire at the AGM.  Nigel Newton and Ian 
Cormack will retire at the AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for reappointment. The Board has considered the 
appraisal of the performance of each Director falling due to retire by rotation and recommends the reappointment of 
both Directors.
Resolutions 11 (ordinary resolution) – Reappointment of the auditors and authority for the Board to 
determine their remuneration
As explained below, the external audit has been put out to tender following which, on the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, the Board appointed  KPMG LLP as the auditor.
Under Resolution 11, the Board recommends to the Shareholders that KPMG LLP be reappointed for a further year so 
that they are able to audit the Company’s report and accounts for the year ended 28 February 2015 and the Board be 
authorised to determine the level of the auditors’ remuneration.
Change of External Auditor
The 2013 Annual Report noted that the Audit Committee anticipated tendering the appointment of the external auditor 
following the 2013 AGM.  This tender has been completed and, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board 
has appointed KPMG LLP as external auditor for the Group and for the Company.
Reasons for tendering
Code provision C.3.7 requires FTSE 350 companies to put the external audit contract out to tender at least every ten years.  
Whilst Bloomsbury is not a FTSE 350 company the Audit Committee considers it appropriate that provision C.3.7 should 
apply.  This adopts best practice including the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Audit Committees published 
September 2012.  The incumbent external auditor prior to the tender, Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP, was contracted for more 
than 10 years without tender, having first been approved by the Shareholders at the 2002 AGM on 27 June 2002.
Conduct of the tender
The tender was conducted as follows
 y The Audit Committee considered the reasons for tendering and approved putting the external audit out to tender.
 y The tender process was run by the Finance Director overseen by the Audit Committee
 — A list of 8 firms was selected, including the Big Four and some medium sized firms.
 — Based on the resources, infrastructure, geographical coverage, expertise in the fields of Bloomsbury’s business and

general knowledge of each firm a short list of three firms was proposed by the Finance Director and approved by 
the Committee.  This included Baker Tilly, KPMG and Grant Thornton.
 — The shortlisted firms agreed to the tender and provided responses to detailed Request For Information (RFIs).  The 
firms were given wide access to the information of the business and its employees. Interviews with Board members 
and key staff were held as request by the firms.
 — During July and August 2013 the Audit Committee interviewed each firm and considered written proposals 
submitted by each firm supplemented by information gathered by Bloomsbury.  The Audit Committee evaluated 
each firm against criteria agreed by the Audit Committee.
 — Based on these evaluations, the Audit Committee recommended KPMG be appointed as the external auditor. The 
Board approved the recommendation.
Criteria for evaluating the firms
The Audit Committee evaluated the firms shortlisted for the appointment as external auditor against the following criteria:
 y Understanding of Bloomsbury’s business and level of publishing industry experience 
 y Audit staff and the firm
 y Relationships
 y Organisational and cultural fit
 y Commitment and conflicts
 y Audit approach
 y Pro-activity, ideas and strategies
 y Access to other specialists 
 y Fee
 y Value the firm contributes eg the level of assurance provided
Recommendation of appointment of external auditor
Whilst KPMG, Baker Tilly and Grant Thornton each have strengths, the Audit Committee believes that KPMG best meets the 
criteria and, in particular, would provide a fresh pair of eyes to the benefit of the Company and its Shareholders.
Special Business to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
Resolution 12 (ordinary resolution) – Authority to allot Ordinary Shares
This replaces the general authority, last given at the 2013 AGM, for the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares pursuant to 
Section 551 of the Act. This resolution, if passed, would give the Directors the authority to allot up to 24,614,880 Ordinary 
Shares of 1.25 pence with a nominal value of £307,686, representing approximately 33.33% of the issued Ordinary Share 
capital of the Company at the date of this notice.
This authority, if granted, will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting and 15 
months from the date of passing this resolution. The Board has no present intention of exercising the authority granted by 
this resolution save in connection with the new share schemes referred to below. The Board intends to seek its renewal at 
subsequent Annual General Meetings of the Company.
As at the date of signing the Directors Report for the 2014 Annual Report, the Directors have beneficial holdings of Ordinary 
Shares in the Company which in aggregate amount to approximately 2.1% of the Ordinary Shares in issue. The Directors 
have been granted conditional share awards under the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Performance Share Plan 2005 and 
options granted under the Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005 that if they were to fully vest would entitle the Directors 
to further Ordinary Shares which in aggregate would amount to approximately 2.3% of the Ordinary Shares in issue. 
As  referred to below it is intended that the Directors be granted share awards or options under the replacement share 
schemes.

Resolution 13 (special resolution) – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption provisions
This resolution authorises the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares for cash without first offering them, pro rata, to existing 
Shareholders pursuant to Section 571 of the Act.
The maximum nominal value of new Ordinary Shares which may be so allotted under this authority is £46,152 or 3,692,160 
shares of 1.25 pence being equivalent to approximately 5% of the entire issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company 
at date of this notice. This authority would expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General 
Meeting and 15 months from the date of passing this resolution.
Resolution 14 (special resolution) – Authority for the Company to purchase Ordinary Shares
With the authority of Shareholders in general meeting, the Company is empowered by the Articles of Association to 
purchase Ordinary Shares subject to the provisions of the Act. The Directors believe it is prudent to seek general authority 
from Shareholders to be able to act if circumstances arose in which they considered such purchases to be desirable. The 
Directors have no current intention to exercise the authority granted by this resolution and it will only be exercised if and 
when, in the light of market conditions prevailing at that time, the Directors believe that such purchases would increase 
earnings per share and would be for the benefit of Shareholders generally.
This resolution authorises the Company to purchase its own Ordinary Shares and either, depending on the circumstances 
at the time and subject to the provisions of the Act, to hold these as treasury shares or to cancel them. This authority would, 
if granted, expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting and 15 months from the 
date of passing this resolution.
The Company would be authorised to make market purchases of up to 7,384,472 Ordinary Shares of 1.25 pence with a 
nominal value of £92,306, being equivalent to approximately 10% of the issued Ordinary Share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) of the Company at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) shall be not more than 5% 
above the average market value of the Company’s equity shares for the 5 business days prior to the day the purchase is 
made. The minimum price (exclusive of expenses) that may be paid shall be the nominal value of an Ordinary Share (1.25 
pence).
Resolution 15 (special resolution) – Approval that a General Meeting may be called on not less than 14 clear 
days notice.
Under the Act, the notice period for general meetings (other than an AGM) is 21 clear days’ notice unless the Company 
(i) has gained Shareholder approval for the holding of general meetings on 14 clear days’ notice by passing a special 
resolution at the most recent AGM; and (ii) offers the facility for all Shareholders to vote by electronic means. The Company 
would like to preserve its ability to call general meetings (other than an AGM) on less than 21 clear days’ notice. The shorter 
notice period would not be used as a matter of routine, but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the 
meeting and is thought to be in the interests of Shareholders as a whole. This resolution seeks such approval. Should this 
resolution be approved it will be valid until the end of the next AGM. This is the same authority that was sought and granted 
at last year’s AGM.
Resolutions 16 (ordinary resolution) – Replacement of existing share incentive plan
This resolution seeks authority from Shareholders for the implementation of a replacement long-term incentive 
arrangement currently intended to be used for the Company’s Executive Directors and senior management.
The proposed Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Performance Share Plan (the “2014 PSP”) would replace the Company’s 
existing performance share plan (the Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan 2005 approved by the Shareholders on 27 
September 2005 (“2005 PSP”)) which was otherwise due to expire in 2015.
The design of the 2014 PSP has been developed by the Remuneration Committee and, as with the 2005 PSP, will provide for 
discretionary annual share-based awards in the case of senior employees ordinarily vesting three years from grant, subject 
to continued service and to the extent to which objective performance criteria are met over a three-year measurement 
period. 
A summary of the principal terms of the 2014 PSP together with details of the performance conditions proposed for the first 
awards under the 2014 PSP to the Company’s Executive Directors, is set out in the Appendix to the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Bloomsbury Annual Report 2014 BACK Proof 9.indd   152 11/06/2014   16:41:53 23265-04 11 June 2014 4:35 PM  Proof 9
Resolutions 17 (ordinary resolution) – New share option plan
This resolution seeks authority from Shareholders for the implementation of a new discretionary share option plan.
The proposed Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Company Share Option Plan (the “2014 CSOP”) will provide scope for the 
grant of market value options to selected employees. 
Options under the 2014 CSOP will ordinarily become exercisable three years from grant subject to the participant’s 
continued service and to the extent to which any applicable performance conditions are satisfied.  The 2014 CSOP will have 
the facility to grant both HMRC tax-favoured options and non tax-favoured options. 
Whilst  the 2014 PSP may be operated for Executive Directors and selected senior executives, it is intended that the 2014 
CSOP will be operated only for below Board level employees (not Executive Directors of the Company) at the Remuneration 
Committee’s discretion. 
A summary of the principal terms of the 2014 CSOP is set out in the Appendix to the Notice of Annual General Meeting .
Resolutions 18 (ordinary resolution) – Renewal of Sharesave plan
This resolution seeks authority from Shareholders to update the terms of the existing Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005 
approved by the Shareholders on 27 September 2005 (the “2005 Sharesave”) due to expire in 2015 to become the 
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Sharesave Plan (the “2014 Sharesave”).
Sharesave schemes are “all-employee” savings-related share option plans under which UK-based employees may sign 
up to savings contracts to save, from 6 April 2014, up to £500 per month over a three or five year savings term.  On the 
maturity of the contracts, participants can elect to use their savings (and any interest) to exercise a linked discounted share 
option to acquire shares on HMRC tax-favoured terms or ask for the return of the savings (and any interest).
A summary of the principal terms of the 2014 Sharesave is set out in the Appendix to the Notice of Annual General Meeting .
The Remuneration Committee believes that the new and updated plans will result in strategically-focused-equity-based 
long-term incentive arrangements that will improve the alignment of interests between employees and Shareholders.

Notes:
1. Only the holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend the meeting and vote. A member entitled to attend and 
vote may appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote on his behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the 
Company. A Form of Proxy is enclosed for your use. Further copies of the Form of Proxy may be obtained from the 
registered office of the Company or from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
2. If a member wishes his proxy to speak on his behalf at the meeting, he or she will need to appoint his own choice of 
proxy (who is not the Chairman) and give instructions directly to the proxy. The completion and return of a Form of 
Proxy will enable a Shareholder to vote at the Annual General Meeting without having to be present at the Annual 
General Meeting, but will not preclude him or her from attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if 
he or she should subsequently decide to do so.
3. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different 
shares. A member may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more 
than one proxy, please sign and date the Form of Proxy and attach a schedule listing the names and addresses (in 
block letters) of all your proxies, the number of shares in respect of which each proxy is appointed (which, in aggregate, 
should not exceed the number of shares held by you) and indicating how you wish each proxy to vote or abstain from 
voting. If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, insert “Chairman of the Meeting” in the box 
which is used to identify the name of the proxy on the relevant proxy card.
4. To be valid, the enclosed Form of Proxy must be lodged with the Company’s Registrars, Capita Asset Services, not later 
than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the Annual General Meeting.
5. Shareholders included on the register of members (in relation to Ordinary Shares held in CREST, pursuant to  
Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) at 6 pm on 18 July 2014 will be entitled to attend and 
vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of Ordinary Shares registered in their name at that time. 
Changes to the register of members after that time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend or vote at the meeting.
6. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information 
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the Shareholder by whom he/she 
was nominated (“Relevant Member”), have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy 
for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to 
exercise it, he/she, under any such agreement, may have a right to give instructions to the Relevant Member as to the 
exercise of voting rights.  Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in the Company remains the Relevant 
Member (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and you should continue to contact them (and not the Company) 
regarding any changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest in the Company (including any 
administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from you.
7. The statement of the rights of Shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in this regard can only be exercised by Shareholders of the Company.
8. Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by Shareholders of the Company under 
section 527 to 531 of the Act, the Company may be required to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter 
relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s Accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are 
to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing 
to hold office since the previous meeting at which Annual Report and Accounts were laid in accordance with section 437 
of the Act. The Company may not require the Shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses 
in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under 
section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the 
statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any 
statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
9. A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise, on its behalf, 
all its powers as a member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers over the same 
share.

APPENDIX
Summary of the principal terms of the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Performance Share Plan (the “2014 PSP”), 
the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Company Share Option Plan (the “2014 CSOP”) and the proposed updated 
form of the Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005 to become the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Sharesave Plan (the 
“2014 Sharesave”)
(each a “Plan” and together, the “Plans”)
This Appendix first describes the unique main features of each Plan and then describes those features which are common 
to all of the Plans.
Main principal terms of the 2014 PSP 
Operation
The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Committee”) will supervise the operation of 
the 2014 PSP.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company and its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the 
2014 PSP at the discretion of the Committee.
Grant of awards 
The Committee may grant awards to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company (“Shares”) within six weeks following 
the Company’s announcement of its results for any period. The Committee may also grant awards within six weeks 
of Shareholder approval of the 2014 PSP or at any other time when the Committee considers there are exceptional 
circumstances which justify the granting of awards. Subject to Shareholder approval of the 2014 PSP, it is intended that the 
first awards under the 2014 PSP will be made during the 2014/15 Financial Year.
The Committee may grant awards as conditional shares or as nil (or nominal) cost options. The Committee may also 
decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, 
although it does not currently intend to do so. 
Individual limit
An employee may not receive awards in any financial year over Shares having a market value in excess of 100 per cent. of 
his or her annual base salary in that financial year. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, this limit 
may be increased at the discretion of the Committee to 150 per cent. of an employee’s annual base salary. 
Performance conditions 
The vesting of awards granted to the Company’s Executive Directors will be subject to such performance conditions as the 
Committee determines.
The Committee may also determine that the vesting of awards granted to others shall be subject to such performance 
conditions (if any) as the Committee determines.
Awards made to Executive Directors in the 2014/15 Financial Year would be subject to two independent performance 
conditions measured over a performance period comprising three financial years of the Company, being the period from 
1 March 2014 to 28 February 2017 (the “Performance Period”). 
One half of such awards will be subject to a performance condition based on the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) 
performance over the Performance Period. The following vesting schedule will apply:
Compound annual growth rate in EPS over the 
Performance Period in excess of annualised RPI 
Percentage of the half of the award subject to the EPS 
measure that vests 
3% or less 0%
3% 25%
Between 3% and 8% Between 25% and 100% pro-rata on a straight-line basis
8% or greater 100%

The other half of the awards granted to the Company’s Executive Directors in 2014 will be subject to a performance 
condition based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance over the Performance Period relative 
to the TSR performance over the same period of a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of FTSE 
SmallCap Index (including the Company but excluding investment trusts) as at the start of the Performance Period. Subject 
to the satisfaction of the underpin condition referred to below, the following vesting schedule will apply:
Rank of the Company’s TSR performance relative to 
the TSRs of the comparator group companies over the 
Performance Period
Percentage of the half of the award subject to the TSR 
measure that vests
Below median 0%
Median 25% 
Between median and top quartile On a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% 
Top quartile or above 100%
The relevant TSR figures will normally be averaged over a three month period at the beginning and end of the 
Performance Period.
Irrespective of the extent to which the TSR performance condition has been achieved, the Committee may, in its discretion, 
scale back the level of vesting of the TSR element of such awards to such extent as it considers appropriate (including to 
nil) in the event that the Committee determines that the Company’s TSR performance is not reflective of the Company’s 
underlying financial performance for the period.
The Committee can set different performance conditions for Executive Directors from those described above for future 
awards.
Different or no performance conditions may apply in the case of other grants.
The Committee may vary any performance conditions applying to existing awards if an event has occurred which causes 
the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the Committee 
considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions 
would have been but for the event in question.
Vesting of awards
Awards granted to Executive Directors shall normally vest no earlier than three years after grant. The Committee may 
specify such normal vesting date as it considers appropriate in the case of awards to others.  
Awards will ordinarily vest to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been satisfied and provided 
the participant is still employed in the Company’s group. Once vested, awards in the form of nil (or nominal) options will 
normally be exercisable up to the tenth anniversary of grant unless they lapse earlier.
Dividend equivalents
The Committee may decide that participants will receive a payment (in cash and/or Shares) on or shortly following the 
settlement of their awards, of an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on those Shares between 
the time when the awards were granted and the time when they vest (or, in the case of awards structured as nil (or 
nominal) cost options, until the expiry of any post-vesting holding period that may apply). This amount may assume the 
reinvestment of dividends. 
Leaving employment
As a general rule, an award will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold employment or be a Director within the 
Company’s group. However, if a participant ceases to be an employee or a Director because of his death, ill-health, injury, 
disability, retirement, redundancy, his employing company or the business for which he works being sold out of the 
Company’s group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then his award will vest on the date when it 
would have vested if he had not ceased such employment or office. 
The extent to which an award will vest in these circumstances will depend upon two factors: 
(i) the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisfied over the normal measurement period; and

(ii) the pro-rating of the award to reflect the reduced period of time between its grant and vesting, although the 
Committee can decide not to pro-rate an award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
Alternatively, if a participant ceases to be an employee or Director in the Company’s group for one of the “good leaver” 
reasons specified above, the Committee can, instead, decide that his award will vest on the date of cessation, subject to: (i) 
any applicable performance conditions measured at that time; and (ii) pro-rating by reference to the time of cessation as 
described above. 
Corporate events
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation) all awards will 
vest early subject to: (i) the extent that any performance conditions have been satisfied at that time; and (ii) the pro-rating 
of the awards to reflect the reduced period of time between their grant and vesting, although the Committee can decide 
not to pro-rate an award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a 
new holding company unless the Committee decides that awards should vest on the basis which would apply in the case of 
a takeover.
If a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed which, in the opinion of the Committee, would affect the 
market price of Shares to a material extent, then the Committee may decide that awards will vest on the basis which would 
apply in the case of a takeover as described above.
Variation of capital
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or in the event of a demerger, payment of a special dividend 
or similar event which materially affects the market price of the Shares, the Committee may make such adjustment as it 
considers appropriate to the number of Shares subject to an award and/or the exercise price payable (if any). 
Overall Plan limits
Awards may be satisfied using new issue Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market. 
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than:
(a) 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the 2014 PSP and any other employee share 
plan adopted by the Company; and
(b) 5 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the 2014 PSP and any other executive share plan 
adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue Shares for the purposes of these limits unless institutional investors decide that they 
need not count.

Main principal terms of the 2014 CSOP
Operation
The Committee will supervise the operation of the 2014 CSOP.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company and its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the 
2014 CSOP at the discretion of the Committee.
General
The 2014 CSOP is divided into two parts, both of which are identical in all material respects unless otherwise indicated in this 
summary. Part A is intended to be approved by HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) so that options granted under it may 
qualify for beneficial tax treatment in the UK. Part B will be used to grant non-tax favoured options.
Grant of options
The Committee may grant options to acquire Shares within six weeks following the Company’s announcement of its results 
for any period. The Committee may also grant options within six weeks of Shareholder approval of the 2014 CSOP or at any 
other time if the Committee considers there are exceptional circumstances which justify the granting of options. 
Individual participation
An employee may not receive options in any financial year over Shares with a market value exceeding 100 per cent. of his 
annual base salary in that financial year. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, this limit may be 
increased at the discretion of the Committee to 150 per cent. of an employee’s annual base salary. 
Under Part A of the 2014 CSOP, the aggregate market value of Shares at the date of grant subject to unexercised HMRC 
approved options granted by the Company shall not exceed £30,000 (or such other limit as may from time to time apply 
under the relevant legislation) per employee.
Option price
The price per Share payable upon exercise of an option will not be less than:
(a) the middle-market price of a Share on the London Stock Exchange on the dealing day immediately before the date of 
grant (or such other dealing day(s) as the Committee may decide); and
(b) if the option relates only to new issue Shares, the nominal value of a Share.
Performance conditions
There is currently no intention to grant options under the 2014 CSOP to Executive Directors of the Company. In the event 
options are granted to any such individuals however, appropriately challenging performance conditions would apply.
Options granted to other individuals will be subject to performance conditions (if any) as the Committee considers 
appropriate. 
The Committee may vary any performance conditions applying to existing options if an event has occurred which causes 
the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the Committee 
considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions 
would have been but for the event in question.
Exercise of options
Options will ordinarily become capable of exercise after three years in the case of Part A options or at such other time 
(other than in the case of any grants to the Company’s Executive Directors) as the Committee specifies in the case of Part B 
options. 
Options will become exercisable to the extent that any performance conditions have been satisfied and provided the 
participant remains employed in the Company’s group. Options will lapse on the day before the tenth anniversary of the 
date of grant or after such shorter period as determined by the Committee at the time of grant. 
Shares will be allotted or transferred to participants within 30 days of exercise. 
The Committee can decide to satisfy Part B options by the payment of a cash amount or by delivering Shares equal in value 
to the gain made on the exercise of the option (which may include net settlement).

Leaving employment
As a general rule, an option will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold employment or be a Director within the 
Company’s group. However, if a participant ceases to be an employee or Director in the Company’s group by reason of his 
death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, TUPE transfer, his employing company or the business for which he works 
being sold out of the Company’s group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then his option will 
become exercisable on the date of cessation and remain exercisable for a limited period thereafter. 
The extent to which an option will become exercisable in these circumstances will depend upon the extent to which any 
performance conditions have been satisfied by reference to the date of cessation. The Committee may also, if it sees fit, pro-
rate the option to reflect the reduced period of time between its grant and vesting.
Corporate events
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation) all options will 
become exercisable early and remain exercisable for a limited period. 
The extent to which options will become exercisable in these situations will depend upon the extent to which any 
performance conditions have been satisfied by reference to the date of the corporate event. The Committee may also, if it 
sees fit, pro-rate the option to reflect the reduced period of time between its grant and vesting.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, options will be replaced by equivalent new options over shares in a 
new holding company unless the Committee decides that options should become exercisable on the basis which would 
apply in the case of a takeover as described above. 
If a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed which, in the opinion of the Committee, would affect the 
market price of Shares to a material extent, then the Committee may decide that options will vest on the basis which would 
apply in the case of a takeover as described above.
Variation of capital
In the event of any variation in the Company’s share capital, the Committee may make such adjustment as it considers 
appropriate to the number of Shares under option and the price payable on the exercise of an option. 
Options granted under Part B of the 2014 CSOP which are not tax-advantaged may also be adjusted in the event of a 
demerger, special dividend or other similar event which materially affects the market price of Shares.
Overall Plan limits
Options may be satisfied using new issue Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market. 
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than:
(a) 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the 2014 CSOP and any other employee share 
plan adopted by the Company; and
(b) 5 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the 2014 CSOP and any other executive share 
plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue Shares for the purposes of these limits unless institutional investors decide that they 
need not count.

Main principal terms of the 2014 Sharesave
General
The operation of the 2014 Sharesave will be supervised by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”). 
Eligibility
Employees and full-time Directors of the Company and any designated participating subsidiary who are UK resident tax 
payers are eligible to participate. The Board may require employees to have completed a qualifying period of employment 
of up to five years before the grant of options. The Board may also allow other employees to participate. 
Grant of options
Options can only be granted to employees who enter into HMRC approved savings contracts, under which monthly 
savings are normally made over a period of three or five years. Options must be granted within 30 days (or 42 days if 
applications are scaled back) of the first day by reference to which the option price is set. The number of Shares over which 
an option is granted will be such that the total option price payable for those Shares will correspond to the proceeds on 
maturity of the related savings contract. 
Individual participation
Monthly savings by an employee under all savings contracts linked to options granted under any sharesave scheme may 
not exceed the statutory maximum (currently £500). The Board may set a lower limit in relation to any particular grant.
Option price
The price per Share payable upon the exercise of an option will not be less than the higher of: (i) 80 per cent. of the average 
middle-market quotation of a Share on the London Stock Exchange on the five days preceding a date specified in an 
invitation to participate in the 2014 Sharesave (or such other day or days as may be agreed with HMRC); and (ii) if the 
option relates only to new issue Shares, the nominal value of a Share.
The option price will be determined by reference to dealing days which fall within six weeks of the announcement by the 
Company of its results for any period or at any other time when the Board considers there to be exceptional circumstances 
which justify offering options under the 2014 Sharesave. 
Exercise of options
Options will normally be exercisable for a six-month period from the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement of the 
related savings contracts. Earlier exercise is permitted, however, in the following circumstances:
✶ ✶following cessation of employment by reason of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, a relevant transfer 
under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 or the business or company that the 
employee works for ceasing to be part of the Company’s group;
✶ ✶where employment ceases more than three years from grant for any reason other than dismissal for misconduct; and 
✶ ✶in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or winding-up of the Company, except in the case of an internal 
corporate re-organisation when the Board may decide to exchange existing options for equivalent new options over 
shares in a new holding company.
Except where stated above, options will lapse on cessation of employment or directorship with the Company’s group. 
Shares will be allotted or transferred to participants within 30 days of exercise. 
Variation of capital
If there is a variation in the Company’s share capital then the Board may, subject to HMRC approval where relevant, make 
such adjustment as it considers appropriate to the number of Shares under option and the option price. 
Overall Plan limit
Awards may be satisfied using new issue Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market. 
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than 10 per cent. of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company under the 2014 Sharesave and any other employee share plan adopted by the 
Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue Shares for the purposes of these limits unless institutional investors decide that they 
need not count.

Other principal terms common to all of the Plans
Life of Plans
Awards and/or options (as relevant, hereinafter referred to collectively as “awards”) may not be granted more than 10 
years after Shareholder approval of the Plans. 
No payment is required for the grant of an award. 
Awards are not transferable, except on death. Awards are not pensionable.
Participants’ rights 
Awards will not confer any Shareholder rights until the awards have vested or the options have been exercised and the 
participants have received their Shares. 
Rights attaching to Shares
Any Shares allotted when an award vests or is exercised under the Plans will rank equally with Shares then in issue (except 
for rights arising by reference to a record date prior to their allotment).
Alterations to the Plans
The Committee may, at any time, amend the provisions of the Plans in any respect, provided that the prior approval of 
Shareholders is obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the rules governing 
eligibility, limits on participation, the overall limits on the issue of Shares or the transfer of treasury Shares, the basis for 
determining a participant’s entitlement to, and the terms of, the Shares or cash to be acquired and the adjustment of 
awards/options.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of Shareholders will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to 
benefit the administration of the Plans, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, 
exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or for any company in the Company’s group. 
Prior Shareholder approval will also not be required for any amendment to performance conditions applying to an award 
provided that the amendments are within the parameters of the adjustment powers of the relevant Plan relating to the 
amendment of performance conditions.
Overseas Plans
The Shareholder resolutions to approve the Plans will allow the Board of Directors, without further Shareholder approval, to 
establish further plans for overseas territories, any such plan to be similar to the relevant Plan, but modified to take account 
of local tax, exchange control or securities laws, provided that any Shares made available under such further plans are 
treated as counting against the limits on individual and overall participation in the relevant Plan. 
Clawback under the 2014 PSP and 2014 CSOP
The Committee may decide within three years of the vesting of an award under the 2014 PSP and/or a Part B non-tax 
favoured option under the 2014 CSOP (as relevant) that it may be subject to clawback if the Committee determines that 
there has been: (i) a material misstatement of the Company’s financial results; or (ii) an error in assessing any applicable 
performance conditions or (iii) in the event of termination of service for misconduct.

When one of the two production 
pipelines which tie the Broom 
field back to the Heather platform 
needed to be replaced, EnQuest 
decided to take the opportunity 
to increase the capacity of the 
pipeline and extend its life at the 
same time – whilst keeping to an 
exceptionally tight schedule.
Back in 2009, an unexplained 
reduction in crude oil arrival 
temperature at the Heather 
platform was the first indication 
of a problem: diagnostics 
combined with intelligent pigging 
revealed that the pipeline was 
no longer fit for purpose.
During the accelerated project define 
phase, an extensive evaluation of 
the options was undertaken to get 
the right design solution before 
the project was sanctioned – these 
included replacing the 8" diameter 
pipeline with a 10" diameter pipeline. 
This was a fast track project: close 
senior management involvement 
meant the required decisions 
were made quickly, a project team 
of highly skilled individuals was 
assembled and the supply chain 
was aligned so that as soon as the 
main contract was awarded, all the 
subcontracts instantly followed.
One main contractor was appointed 
to manage the extensive project 
elements and interfaces, from 
engineering to procurement, 
installation and commissioning. 
A reeled Pipe in Pipe solution was 
elected with the new pipeline, 
mainly constructed onshore, 
then transported to the field by 
a reel pipelay vessel and laid in 
two sections. Metre for metre, it 
was one of the heaviest pipelines 
ever installed by the contractor’s 
vessel – one of seven different 
vessels used during the project.
 
Maintaining excellent working 
relationships with contractors, 
operations and the three partners 
on the field was just one of the 
key factors behind the successful 
execution of the project within an 
impressive 12 months. The new 
pipeline tie-in was co-ordinated to 
coincide with a Heather platform 
planned maintenance shutdown to 
minimise the impact on production, 
with production coming back online 
in September 2010, with all key 
performance indicators achieved 
including zero safety incidents.

Creativity, collaboration and 
challenge were the critical factors 
underpinning EnQuest’s record 
breaking drilling programme in 
the Don fields, combined with a 
relentless focus on delivery and 
safety. Stepping up to the challenge 
of drilling a well in 50 days, the team 
completed three successful wells (S5, 
S6, W4) decisively ahead of target, 
including drilling 3,000 feet in 24 
hours – a record for the Don fields.
Retaining the same team meant 
EnQuest was able to capitalise on 
the knowledge gained during the 
first phase of activity in the Don 
fields early in 2010. Experience 
from phase one led to an innovative 
approach to the well design for 
phase two. A simplified well 
design, combined with careful risk 
assessment, allowed the drillers to 
miss out a casing section and drill 
continuously into the reservoir, 
saving considerable time.
New cranes and cuttings handling 
equipment installed on the John 
Shaw rig before it left the shipyard 
played a significant role in reducing 
the time to process the cuttings, part 
of a major investment to upgrade the 
rig. Whilst the rig was in the shipyard, 
the team focused their efforts on 
driving up performance. The whole 
team, from drillers to subsurface, 
subsea to engineering, plus all key 
service providers, were challenged to 
make their part of the project more 
efficient with impressive results: 
drilling performance accelerated 
from 1,500 to 3,000 feet per day.
The outcome of these measures 
was exceptional. The rig arrived in 
the Dons in early May and S5 was 
completed by the end of June in 41 
days against a budget of 53. Drilling 
on S6 commenced on 1 July and 
within 33 days, the team were ready 
to move on to W4, well ahead of the 
55 days planned. 43 days later, W4 
was complete, ahead of schedule and 
30% below budget. The reservoirs 
in both S5 and W4 were at the top 
end of quality expectations and 
combined with an extra month’s 
production from the accelerated 
drilling programme, production 
from the Dons rose threefold 
above 2009 to 11,660 Boepd.

Drilling the first successful new 
producer well on the Thistle 
field since 1990 was a significant 
achievement in more ways than 
one. The drilling rig was completely 
rebuilt, a newly-formed drilling 
crew arrived on the platform to 
start up a rig for the first time 
in 20 years and a new well was 
completed safely and under budget. 
The condition of the drilling rig 
had degraded during 20 years of 
inactivity requiring an extensive 
US$70 million investment to bring 
it back up to standard, including 
installing a top drive. By early 2010 a 
new drilling crew had been mobilised 
but before they arrived on the 
platform, team-building exercises 
onshore – that included production 
and maintenance staff – ensured 
that the teams integrated rapidly 
offshore. Underpinned by the ‘Team 
Thistle Charter’ that set out a clear 
vision for the future of the field 
and defined key values/working 
behaviours, this proved a powerful 
tool in building a high-performing, 
enthusiastic and committed team.
The safe start up of the newly 
refurbished rig in February 2010 was 
a significant milestone and source 
of pride for the team. Working 
initially on the A46 workover and 
the partial abandonment of four 
wells undertaken on behalf of the 
field’s previous owners, the new rig 
commenced drilling SFB-P1, the new 
well, in September. A relentless focus 
on planning and execution resulted 
in delivery of the project in 47 days, 
ahead of schedule and under budget. 
The well came onstream at a healthy 
800 Boepd and added to 2P reserves 
demonstrating the future potential 
of the reservoir, extending the life 
of this mature asset and adding 
value to the EnQuest portfolio.

Notes:
1 Reserves and resources are quoted on a pro-forma working interest basis for the 12 calendar months of 2010 as if the assets previously owned by Petrofac 
and Lundin Petroleum were owned by EnQuest throughout the period.
2 Proven and Probable Reserves and Contingent Resources have been assessed by the Group’s internal reservoir engineers, utilising geological, 
geophysical, engineering and financial data. 
3 The Group’s Proven and Probable Reserves have been audited by a recognised Competent Person in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set 
out under the 2007 Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
4 Contingent Resources relate to technically recoverable hydrocarbons for which commerciality has not yet been determined and are stated on a most 
likely technical case or ‘2C’ basis.
5 Attributable to partial decommissioning of the Sullom Voe Terminal (‘SVT’) LPG processing plant during the year, resulting in Heather, Broom and Thistle 
light ends components delivered to the terminal being reclassified, with the propane no longer forming part of the saleable production revenue stream. 
Some of this propane value is now recovered by a reduced contribution to terminal fuel and flare costs.
6 Attributable to the change from offshore loading to direct export via SVT during the year. As described in note 5, following partial decommissioning of 
the SVT LPG processing plant in 2010, propane and butane volumes do not form part of the saleable production revenue stream. Instead, the surplus light 
ends recovered offshore will contribute to increased SVT oil production and terminal fuel and flare costs.
7 All volumes are presented pre SVT value adjustment.
8 The values presented include some licences offered to the Group in October 2010 which had not legally commenced as at 31 December 2010.
9 On 10 December 2010, the Group assigned 30% of its equity in the Elke P995, Block 28/3a licence to KUFPEC under a Sale and Purchase Agreement.
10 On 11 February 2011 the Group sold its 48.75% interest in the Slovenian Petisovci project. The Group had acquired its interest in Petisovci through its 
acquisition of Stratic in November 2010 and Contingent Resources of 12.47 MMboe related to this asset were therefore excluded from the Group’s 
Contingent Resources at 31 December 2010.

of why people make mistakes  
and promoting a proactive safety 
management culture across 
the Group.
This is part of a 10 point HSE 
improvement programme for 2011, 
that also includes improving life/work 
balance and promoting healthy 
working. Heather and Thistle achieved 
silver awards as part of the Scottish 
Government’s ‘Healthy Working Lives’ 
initiative and we intend to promote 
this initiative across the whole 
Company in 2011. 
c ontributing to our community
EnQuest’s broader community policy 
is to assist in the development of local 
community programmes where we 
operate, in consultation with local 
government, public and other 
stakeholders. These have been 
focused mainly on environmental  
and youth projects in Aberdeen.
Projects supported include Solstice 
Nurseries, an organisation that 
provides work experience and training 
in horticulture and garden maintenance 
for people who have experienced 
mental health problems and want to 
return to work; a local primary school 
and support for a local amateur 
swimming club.
Corporate projects have included 
support for Fairbridge (“Supporting 
Inner City Youth”) and for Crisis UK.
In addition to current EnQuest 
charitable funding for small scale 
environment, youth or local 
community projects in Aberdeen, 
local charities are nominated for 
annual fundraising activities by staff. 
Many staff also give their time to help 
such organisations and EnQuest tries 
to facilitate such initiatives; in addition 
to the benefits they provide directly  
to the charities, these projects also 
contribute to team building and to 
staff morale. As we continue to grow, 
we believe we can make a positive 
impact on the communities within 
which we operate; we aim to increase 
these activities during 2011.
EnQuest is currently updating its 
Charity Committee structures and  
its existing policies on CSR and HSE; 
once these policies have been revised 
and approved they will be available 
on the Company’s website at  
www.enquest.com. In an important 
step, EnQuest launched its Code  
of Conduct during 2010; further 
details of which can be found in  
the Chairman’s Statement, earlier 
within this report.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 38

EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 43
Biographical details of all the Directors can be found on 
pages 38 and 39.
Directors’ election and rotation
With regard to the retirement and re-election of Directors, 
the Company is governed by its Articles of Association (the 
‘Articles’), the Combined Code and the Companies Act. 
Directors have the power to appoint a Director during the 
year but any person so appointed must stand for election 
at the next Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). A retiring 
director is eligible to stand for re-election. The Directors  
of the Company are fully committed to supporting the 
principles of good governance outlined in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which was published by  
the Financial Reporting Council in June 2010 and which 
replaces the existing Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance for accounting periods beginning on or  
after 29 June 2010. The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that all directors of FTSE 350 companies 
should be subject to annual election by shareholders. The 
Directors have decided to adopt this provision of the new 
UK Corporate Governance Code early, on a voluntary basis.
In accordance with the above provisions, each of the 
Directors of the Company will retire and, being eligible, 
offer themselves for re-election at the next AGM, with the 
exception of Robin Pinchbeck, who will not be standing  
for re-election. 
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles, relevant statutory law 
and any direction that may be given by the Company in  
the AGM, the business of the Company is managed by the 
Directors who may exercise all powers of the Company. 
Directors’ indemnity provisions 
Under the Company’s Articles, the Directors of the 
Company are indemnified out of the assets of the 
Company against all costs, charges, expenses, losses or 
liabilities sustained or incurred in or about the execution  
of their duties. Such qualifying third party indemnity 
provision remains in force as at the date of approving  
the Directors’ Report.
share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital, which is 
divided into Ordinary shares of £0.05 each (‘Ordinary 
shares’). Each Ordinary share carries one vote.
The Company’s issued share capital and total voting rights 
as at 4 April 2011 comprises 799,462,905 Ordinary shares 
issued and outstanding, which constitutes 100% 
of the total voting rights of the Company. All of the 
Company’s issued Ordinary shares have been fully paid  
up. Further detail on the Ordinary shares issued during  
the financial year can be found in note 17 of the financial 
statements on page 73.
Further information regarding the rights attaching to the 
Company’s Ordinary shares can be found in note 17 to the 
financial statements on page 73. No person has any special 
rights with respect to control of the Company. 
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding  
of, or the transfer of, Ordinary shares, both of which are  
governed by the Company’s Articles and the current 
legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s Ordinary shares that 
may result in restrictions on transfers of, or voting rights  
in connection with, Ordinary shares. 
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares  
during 2010 or in 2011 up to and including 4 April 2011, 
being the date of this report.
c ompany share schemes
The Group Employee Benefit Trust holds 0.9% of the issued 
share capital of the Company in trust for the benefit of 
employees and their dependents. The voting rights in 
relation to these shares are exercised by the trustees.

Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to 
auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of the approval  
of the Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware; and each Director 
has taken all steps that they ought to have taken as 
Directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Responsibility statements under the Dt R
The Directors who held office at the date of the approval  
of the Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best of their 
knowledge, the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and the 
Directors’ Report and the Group Operating and Financial 
Review include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
a udit and auditors
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of 
the auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended to 
the Board that the existing auditors, Ernst & Young LLP be 
reappointed. Ernst & Young LLP has expressed their 
willingness to continue as auditors. An ordinary resolution 
to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors of the 
Company and authorising the Directors to set their 
remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 
Financial risk and financial instruments
Information on financial risk management, including credit 
and liquidity risks and information about financial 
instruments, is set out in the Financial Review on pages 30 
to 33 and the notes to the financial statements on pages 59 
to 79 respectively. 
going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Business Review on pages 10 to 
37. The financial position of the Group, its cash flow, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in 
the Financial Review on pages 30 to 33. In addition, note 24 
to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together 
with 2P reserves of 88.5 MMboe. As a consequence, the 
Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the annual financial statements.
Approved by the Board on 4 April 2011.

The Board currently comprises the Chairman, three 
Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors. The 
Directors’ biographies are set out on pages 38 and 39. No 
group of individuals dominate the Board’s decision making 
process and none of the Directors has any conflict of 
interest between their duties to the Company and their 
private interests.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive has been clearly established, set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board in 2010. 
In the opinion of the Board, Jock Lennox and Helmut 
Langanger, are fully independent for the purposes of the 
Combined Code. However, the other Non-Executive 
Directors, Alexandre Schneiter and Robin Pinchbeck, due 
to their association with Lundin Petroleum AB and Petrofac 
Limited, respectively, are not deemed to be independent 
for the purposes of the Combined Code. 
Notwithstanding the fact that Alexandre Schneiter and 
Robin Pinchbeck are not deemed independent for the 
purpose of the Combined Code, the other Directors, having 
given full consideration to this issue, agreed that their 
knowledge of the Company’s business and the experience 
they bring to their roles, outweighed the resulting non-
compliance with the Combined Code. The Board is also 
satisfied that it maintained a sufficient degree of 
independence throughout the year to enable it to 
discharge effectively and properly its obligations under  
the Combined Code. 
In order to achieve full compliance with the Combined Code, 
it was stated in the Company’s listing Prospectus dated 18 
March 2010 that Alexandre Schneiter and Robin Pinchbeck 
would stand down as Non-Executive Directors before April 
2012. As part of this process, Robin Pinchbeck will be retiring 
at the AGM on 25 May 2011 and the Board plans to appoint a 
new independent Non-Executive Director in the near future 
as replacement for Robin Pinchbeck. 
All of the Directors are subject to election by shareholders 
at the first AGM after their appointment to the Board, so 
with the exception of Robin Pinchbeck, all the Directors will 
be seeking election by shareholders at the AGM to be held 
on 25 May 2011. 
Helmut Langanger has been appointed the Senior Non-
Executive Director. A key responsibility for the Senior 
Non-Executive Director is to be available to shareholders  
in the event that they may feel it inappropriate to relay 
views through the Chairman, Chief Executive or the Chief 
Financial Officer. His role is to evaluate the performance  
of the Chairman and address any concerns that might be 
raised by the shareholders that have not been resolved 
through normal channels. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved to it for decision, which was approved by the 
Board in March 2010. Its reserved matters include 
determination of the overall strategy of the Group, to 
review business plans, trading performance and overhead 
costs, to approve major capital investment projects, 
examine acquisition opportunities and divestment 
possibilities, review significant financial and operational 
issues, and review and approve the Company’s financial 
statements, control and risk management systems.

The Board delegates the execution of its strategic 
objectives to the Executive Committee, which comprises 
the Executive Directors, Head of Business Development 
and the Head of Legal. Operational management of the 
Group on a day-to-day basis is managed by the 
Operational Committee, which comprises members of  
the Executive Committee, General Manager UKCS, asset 
managers and selected senior management. 
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant 
information to enable it to perform its duties. The Company 
Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, through 
the Chairman, on all governance matters. In addition, each 
Director has access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. There is also a procedure agreed by 
the Board for Directors, in furtherance of the duties, to  
take independent professional advice if necessary, at the 
Company’s expense, up to a pre-determined limit. 
During 2010, eight scheduled meetings of the Board were 
held, seven of which were held at the Company’s registered 
office in London and one meeting held offsite. Details of 
attendance at each of those meetings, and at meetings  
of the Board Committees, are set out on page 47. 
During the year, a number of other meetings took place to 
deal with specific matters that required to be considered  
at short notice, and in each case, notice was duly given  
to all the Directors. Any Director who is unable to attend 
scheduled or short-notice Board meetings in person  
is invited to join the meeting by video or telephone 
conferencing facilities, or is given the opportunity to be 
consulted and comment in advance of the meeting by 
telephone or in writing. 
The formal agenda for each scheduled Board meeting is 
set by the Chairman in consultation with the Company 
Secretary and agreement from the Chief Executive. Formal 
minutes of all Board and committee meetings are 
circulated to all Directors prior to the next Board meeting 
and are considered for approval at that Board meeting. In 
addition, the Chief Executive is in frequent contact with the 
Non-Executive Directors between meetings in order to 
keep them updated with progress on the Group’s business. 
The Chairman also meets the Non-Executive Directors 
informally, without any Executives present, on a regular 
basis to discuss matters in respect of the business. 
The Board has in place a procedure for the consideration 
and authorisation of conflicts or possible conflicts with the 
Company’s interests. In accordance with the Directors’ 
interests provisions in the Companies Act 2006, all the 
Directors are required to submit details to the Company 
Secretary of any situations which may give rise to a conflict, 
or potential conflict, of interest. The Board monitors and 
reviews potential conflicts of interest on a regular basis. 
Board committees 
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a 
Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee, 
each of which has formal Terms of Reference approved by 
the Board. The Terms of Reference for each of these 
committees satisfy the requirements of the Combined 
Code and are reviewed internally on an ongoing basis by 
the Board. Copies of the Terms of Reference are available 
on the Company’s website. 
The committees are provided with all necessary resources 
to enable them to undertake their duties in an effective 
manner. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
committees and minutes of all committee meetings are 
available to all Directors. 
Set out below are reports from the Audit Committee, 
Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee. 
a udit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises two independent Non-
Executive Directors and the Chairman. Currently, its 
members are Jock Lennox (Chairman), Dr James Buckee 
and Helmut Langanger. Dr Buckee is currently a member  
of the Audit Committee as the remaining Non-Executive 
Directors are not independent. This will be reviewed once 
one or more independent Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed in due course. Mr Lennox has recent and 
relevant financial experience; he is Audit Committee 
chairman of a number of public companies. No members  
of the Audit Committee have ongoing links with the 
Company’s auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
The main responsibilities of the Committee include:
monitoring the integrity of the financial statements,  >
including annual and interim reports and any other 
formal announcement relating to the Company’s 
financial performance; 
considering the establishment of an internal   >
audit function;
reviewing the Company’s internal control procedures  >
and risk management systems;
making recommendations to the Board on the  >
appointment, review and removal of external auditors; 
establishing the external auditors’ remuneration; >
monitoring external auditors’ independence;  >
monitoring the policy on external auditors’   >
non-audit services; and
identifying any matters in respect of which it considers  >
that action or improvement is needed and making 
recommendations to the Board as to the steps to  
be taken. 
The Audit Committee engages in numerous ad hoc 
discussions and in 2010 had two formal meetings to 
discharge its responsibilities as set out in its Terms of 
Reference. At the request of the Audit Committee, the 
Chief Financial Officer and a senior member of the finance 
department attended each of these meetings. The Chief 
Executive also attended both meetings as an observer, on 
being invited to do so by the Committee. In addition, the 
external auditors attended both meetings and received 
copies of all Audit Committee papers. 
In fulfilling its responsibility to monitor the integrity of 
financial reports to shareholders, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the accounting principles, policies and practises 
adopted in the presentation of public financial information. 
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving  
the interim and annual financial statements remains with 
the Board. 
As part of the process when the Company became listed 
on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the 
Board reviewed the need for an internal audit function, and 
concurred that the control systems in place together with 
management oversight were sufficient to highlight any 
areas of weakness in the financial reporting systems, so no 
internal audit function was established. At the end of 2010, 
the Audit Committee reviewed the need for an internal 
audit function and agreed to appoint Deloitte LLP to 
provide outsourced internal audit services to the Company.

The Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s procedures  
for staff to raise concerns in confidence about possible 
financial reporting or other misconduct. The Committee 
considered any concerns raised, how these were 
investigated and follow-up action taken.  
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Langanger 
and its other appointees are Dr Buckee and Mr Lennox. The 
Chief Executive may also be invited to attend meetings as 
and when deemed appropriate. 
The main responsibilities of the Committee include:
setting the remuneration policy for the Chairman,  >
Executive Directors and senior executives; 
assessing and determining total compensation  >
packages available to the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors; 
monitoring the remuneration of senior management  >
other than the Executive Directors whose remuneration 
it sets; 
making recommendations to the Board for its approval,  >
and that of shareholders, on the design of long-term 
share incentive plans and making recommendations for 
the grant of awards to Executives under such plans; and 
determining policy and scope for pension rights and any  >
compensation payments and ensuring compliance with 
the Combined Code in this respect. 
The Remuneration Committee engages in numerous  
ad hoc discussions and in 2010 had four formal meetings  
to discharge its responsibilities as set out in its Terms  
of Reference.
Further information on the Committee can be found in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 49 to 52. 
n omination Committee
The Nomination Committee currently comprises Mr Bseisu, 
Mr Langanger, Mr Lennox and Dr Buckee who is the 
Chairman. 
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in its 
responsibilities relating to the composition of the Board,  
its size and structure whilst also evaluating the balance  
of skills, knowledge and experience of the Directors.  
The composition of the Board is also taken into account 
and it is the responsibility of the Committee to identify  
and nominate candidates for approval by the Board to fill 
vacancies, appoint new Directors to replace those retiring 
and make the appropriate recommendations to the Board. 
The Committee meets at least twice a year and the Terms 
of Reference of the Committee are to be found on the 
Company’s website.
The main responsibilities of the Committee include:
reviewing the size, structure and composition of the  >
Board in order to recommend changes to the Board and 
to ensure the orderly succession of Directors; 
formalising succession planning and the process for new  >
Director appointments; 
identifying, evaluating and recommending candidates  >
for appointment or reappointment as Directors or 
Company Secretary, taking into account the balance of 
knowledge, skills and experience required to serve the 
Board; and
reviewing the outside directorships/commitments   >
of Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee engages in numerous ad hoc 
discussions and in 2010 had two formal meetings to 
discharge its responsibilities as set out in its Terms of 
Reference. The Committee ensures, amongst other things, 
that there is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new Directors. 
induction and training
New Directors receive induction on their appointment to 
the Board covering the activities of the Group and its key 
business and financial risks, the Terms of Reference of the 
Board and its committees and the latest financial 
information about the Group.
The Chairman ensures that Directors update their skills, 
knowledge and familiarity with the Company required to 
fulfil their roles on the Board and on Board committees. 
Ongoing training is provided as necessary and includes 
updates from the Company Secretary on changes to the 
Listing Rules, requirements under the Companies Act and 
other regulatory matters. Directors may consult with the 
Company Secretary at any time on matters related to their 
role on the Board.

Board performance evaluation 
An evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
committees, the individual Directors and the Chairman, 
was conducted at the end of 2010 by the Chairman and  
the results of the review were then fed back to the Board  
as a whole. 
Following the evaluation, the Directors concluded that  
the Board and its committee operate effectively and also 
consider that each Director is contributing effectively and 
demonstrates commitment to the role. 
internal controls
The Company’s system of internal controls is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute reassurance against misstatement or loss.  
The Board will continue to review and improve the system 
of internal controls. EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 48
The Board recognises the need for effective internal 
controls and for evaluating and managing the risks of the 
Company. Such matters are brought to the attention of the 
Board at its formal Board meetings or ad hoc discussions. 
High level controls in operation include:
review of management accounts with comparison of  >
actual performance against prior periods and budget; 
approval of orders, authorisation of invoices and two  >
signatures required to make a transfer from the principal 
bank accounts;
recognition of all control accounts;  >
prior approval by the Board for major investments; and  >
segregation of duties between relevant functions   >
and departments. 
The Board is aware of the need to conduct regular risk 
assessments to identify any deficiencies in the controls 
currently operating over all aspects of the Company. A 
formal risk assessment was conducted by the Board in 
2010 on internal controls to cover material contracts both 
financial and operational and risk management systems. 
Financial reporting procedures were reviewed as part of 
the process to become listed on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange and a full Board memorandum 
was prepared. Having considered the findings, the Board 
were able to confirm that the financial reporting 
procedures established provided them with a reasonable 
basis on which to make proper judgements on the  
financial position and prospects of the Company  
on an ongoing basis. 
Details of principal risk and uncertainties are discussed in 
the Business Review on pages 18 and 19. 
The Company has established a Code of Conduct policy 
which all employees and contractors are required to 
comply with. This policy includes the procedures for 
whistle-blowing whereby employees can raise concerns in 
confidence about possible wrong doing. This matter is on 
the agenda at Audit Committee meetings to review and 
take action as required. 
Auditor independence 
The Audit Committee and Board recognise the importance 
and objectivity of the Group’s external auditors, Ernst & 
Young LLP, when performing their role in the Company’s 
reporting to shareholders. The external auditors are 
expected to provide the Audit Committee with information 
about policies and processes for maintaining 
independence and monitoring compliance with current 
regulatory requirements, including those regarding the 
rotation of audit partners and staff. 
The overall performance, independence and objectivity of 
the auditors is reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee has a policy in respect of the 
provision of non-audit services to the Company by the 
external auditor. Fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP, during 
2010 amounted to US$369,000 for audit related services 
and US$794,000 for non-audit services. 
Communication with shareholders 
Communications with shareholders are given high priority 
by the Board. EnQuest will send its maiden 2010 Annual 
Report and Accounts to all registered shareholders. In 
order to ensure that the Board develop a strong dialogue 
with shareholders, during 2010, the Executive Directors 
and senior management met with institutional investors in 
London and across the UK as well as other European and 
North American cities. These roadshows, combined with 
the attendance of various Directors and senior 
management at several oil and gas sector conferences, 
provided for comprehensive and engaging dialogue  
with shareholders.
The Company issues its results and other news releases 
promptly and publishes them on the Company’s website  
at www.enquest.com. Other corporate information  
issued during the year is also available on the website. 
Shareholders and other interested parties can subscribe  
to receive news updates by email by registering online  
on the website. 
At the 2011 AGM, a business presentation will be provided 
for the benefit of shareholders. The Chairman will aim to 
ensure that the respective Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees attend the AGM to answer 
questions and that the other Directors also attend.

Helmut Langanger and Jock Lennox are considered by the 
Board to be independent as explained in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 45 to 48. 
Remuneration policy – overview
EnQuest’s remuneration policy for 2010 and subsequent 
financial years is designed to encourage behaviour and 
performance among Executive Directors and senior 
management which the Remuneration Committee believes 
is in the best interest of shareholders. 
A key objective of the Remuneration Committee is to 
establish a level of remuneration which is sufficient to 
attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors  
and senior management and to align their remuneration 
with the achievement of the Company’s strategic,  
business and financial objectives and thereby enhance 
shareholder value. 
As part of the preparation for the Company becoming 
listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, 
the Remuneration Committee first met in March 2010 to 
determine the remuneration programme for the Executive 
Directors and senior management going forward, and took 
advice from Deloitte LLP to provide independent guidance 
on setting the remuneration framework for the year.  
Deloitte LLP also provide internal audit and tax advisory 
services to the Company. The Company’s legal advisers, 
Ashurst LLP, also provided assistance to the Committee in 
respect of the Company’s share incentive arrangements. 
Deloitte LLP and Ashurst LLP were not appointed by the 
Remuneration Committee. The proposed remuneration 
framework developed with Deloitte LLP was based on the 
following principles:
the remuneration framework should reflect the growth  >
focus of EnQuest and provide emphasis on the 
long-term horizon;
total remuneration should be competitive versus  >
compensation benchmarks of UK oil and gas companies 
of a similar size to EnQuest; and
the remuneration structure should be consistent with  >
UK corporate governance principles and best practice. 
Based on independent advice and guidance provided by 
Deloitte LLP, the Remuneration Committee approved its 
remuneration framework for the Executive Directors and 
senior management based on the following criteria:
basic salaries would be median or below benchmarked  >
salaries against UK oil and gas companies of a similar 
size to EnQuest; and
the variable elements of remuneration would be  >
structured so that individuals can achieve total 
remuneration that is upper quartile subject to 
achievement of challenging performance standards.
The Remuneration Committee believes establishing a 
remuneration framework which sets the fixed elements  
at median or below and provides incentives capable of 
delivering upper quartile pay for delivery of superior 
performance is the most effective way in which to ensure 
that the Executive Directors and senior management are 
incentivised to deliver the Company’s strategic goals and 
thus deliver long-term shareholder value.
The Company’s annual remuneration programme currently 
consists of three primary components: base salary and 
benefits, annual performance pay, and long-term incentive 
awards granted under the Company’s current share 
incentive plans. 
The amount of base salary, annual performance pay and 
long-term incentive awards granted to the Executive 
Directors during 2010 are set out in the remuneration table 
on page 52.
Reward component 
Base salary and benefits
Base salary and benefits comprise a portion of the total 
remuneration; whilst annual performance pay and 
long-term incentives represent a significant component of 
total remuneration. Remuneration that is ‘at risk’ means 
remuneration that may or may not be paid to the Executive 
Directors is dependent on whether the individual is able to 
meet or exceed their applicable performance targets 
together with achievement of corporate performance 
targets. The ‘at risk’ element of total remuneration is used 
to promote long-term shareholder value and does not 
represent remuneration that is ‘at risk’ in the short-term. 
The greater the Executive Directors’ impact is upon driving 
the long-term business objectives, the higher the risk/
reward portion of the remuneration. 
The base salary and benefits of the Executive Directors are 
reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and 
any changes take effect from 1 January each year. In 
conducting the base salary review, the Committee takes 
into consideration factors such as current competitive 
market conditions and particular skills, such as leadership 
ability and management effectiveness, experience, 
responsibility and proven or expected performance of the 
particular individual. The Committee obtains information 
regarding competitive market conditions from our 
management and external benchmarking agencies,  
as required.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 50
The Chief Executive (with the assistance of the Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee) evaluates annually the 
performance of each of the Executive Directors and direct 
reports and recommends adjustments to base salary which 
are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee for 
approval. Compensation of the Chief Executive is reviewed 
by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and 
subsequently approved by the Committee.
For 2010, the basic salaries for the Executive Directors 
were set at £375,000 for Amjad Bseisu, £285,000 for  
Nigel Hares and £220,000 for Jonathan Swinney. The 
Committee carried out a review of salaries for 2011, and 
agreed that these would be frozen at 2010 levels.
The Company provides a defined contribution pension plan 
and benefits such as car allowance for certain employees 
below Executive Director level. In lieu of such benefits for 
the Executive Directors, the Company pays an allowance  
of £30,000 per annum (£40,000 for the Chief Executive). 
annual performance pay 
The discretionary performance pay scheme applies to  
all employees and Executive Directors and is based on 
individual and Company performance against objectives. 
Each measure is given a respective weighting, with the 
Executive Directors receiving 80% of performance pay 
based on Company performance targets and 20% based 
on individual performance targets. The Executive 
Directors’ individual performance is measured through 
personal performance contracts which were set and 
approved by the Remuneration Committee at the time 
when the Company became listed on the Main Market of 
the London Stock Exchange in April 2010, and then 
reviewed at the end of 2010. The Company’s performance 
objectives are based on annually defined Key Performance 
Indicators (‘KPIs’). The Board set the Company’s KPIs at 
the time when the Company became listed on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange, which required the 
achievement of operational targets, financial performance, 
HSE standards and portfolio growth over the remainder of 
the 2010 financial year. 
The choice of the Company performance targets for 2010 
and their respective weightings, reflects the Committee’s 
belief that any short-term performance pay should be tied 
both to the overall performance of the Company and the 
individual’s performance. 
The maximum level of performance pay for the Executive 
Directors is set at 100% of base salary, with the ability to 
increase this to 200% of base salary for outstanding 
individual and Company performance. Part of the 
performance pay will be paid in cash and part in shares 
which vest after two years, subject to continued 
employment. The actual level of performance pay awarded 
to the Executive Directors for performance in 2010 is 
shown in the remuneration table on page 52. 
The maximum level of performance pay for senior 
management was set between 30% to 60% of base salary, 
with the ability to increase this to between 60% to 120%  
of base salary for outstanding individual and Company 
performance. Senior management, together with all 
employees who receive performance pay, may be eligible 
to receive non-performance based matching shares, 
determined by reference to the number of shares  
acquired using the annual performance pay. 
l ong-term share incentives 
In order to encourage Executive Directors and selected 
senior management to deliver superior levels of long-term 
performance for the benefit of shareholders, the 
Remuneration Committee’s policy is to award these 
individuals with share incentives under the long-term 
incentive plan. The current arrangement is the EnQuest 
PLC Performance Share Plan 2010 (‘2010 PSP’), which was 
approved at a special meeting of shareholders held on 18 
March 2010. At the same meeting, shareholders approved 
the establishment of the EnQuest PLC Restricted Share 
Plan 2010 (‘2010 RSP’) and the EnQuest PLC Deferred 
Bonus Share Plan 2010 (‘2010 DBSP’). 
2010 RSP 
The 2010 RSP was established for use at the time when the 
Company became listed on the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange in April 2010 in order to facilitate the 
deferral of IPO bonuses and to grant retention focused 
awards. The Remuneration Committee granted an 
aggregate of 5,809,675 share awards to Executive 
Directors and selected employees on 1 April 2010 and  
19 April 2010. Other than being subject to continued 
employment, the RSP awards have no performance 
targets, and vest in tranches over two, three and four years 
from the date of grant, save in relation to Nigel Hares’ 
awards of which one-quarter will vest on the first 
anniversary of the date of grant. Going forward, the 2010 
RSP will be available as a retention tool for selected 
employees below Executive Director level, whereby awards 
may be made to selected individuals who join the Company 
part way through the year, having left accrued benefits 
with a previous employer. In this regard, the Remuneration 
Committee granted an aggregate of 699,856 share awards 
to selected senior employees on 13 October 2010. 
2010 DBSP 
Under the 2010 DBSP, employees, below Executive 
Director level, are invited to defer a proportion of their 
annual cash bonus into Company shares. Under the plan, 
the shares which are acquired with a participant’s cash 
bonus are called ‘Invested Shares’. Following such an 
investment, the Company will generally grant the 
participant an additional award over a number of shares 
being a specified ratio to the number of Invested Shares 
and these awards are called ‘Matching Shares’. The 
Remuneration Committee granted an aggregate of 195,365 
Matching Shares on 19 April 2010, which were awarded to 
participants on the basis of a 1:1 ratio to the Invested 
Shares. No further awards were granted under the 2010 
DBSP during the year.   
2010 PSP 
The 2010 PSP enables Executive Directors and selected 
senior employees to be granted conditional awards over 
Ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally 
dependent on both continued employment with the 
Company and the extent to which pre-determined 
performance conditions are met over a specified period  
of three years. The scheme is intended to incentivise the 
participants to create shareholder value whilst retaining 
due focus on the underlying financial performance of the 
Company and to align their interests closely with those  
of shareholders. 
The value of Ordinary shares awards to a participant under 
the 2010 PSP in any financial year is subject to a limit of 
200% of base salary, although a 300% of salary limit can be 
awarded to an individual by the Remuneration Committee 
in exceptional circumstances. 
No awards under the 2010 PSP have been made as at the 
date of this Report.

n on-executive Directors 
The remuneration of each of the Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chairman) is determined by the Chairman  
and the Executive members of the Board within limits set out in the Articles and having taken independent advice on 
appropriate levels. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee (in his absence), again based  
on independent advice. The Company’s policy is to set levels of fees so as to ensure that they are sufficient to attract 
experienced individuals and reflect the increased responsibilities of the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Non-Executive Directors’ annual fees for 2010 were £200,000 for Dr James Buckee and £45,000 for each of the 
other Non-Executive Directors. In addition to this, an annual fee of £8,000 is payable to Jock Lennox and Helmut 
Langanger for their roles as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committee respectively. Actual fees paid for  
the year ended 31 December 2010 are shown in the remuneration table on page 52. 
As stated in the Company’s listing Prospectus dated 18 March 2010, Dr James Buckee received a one-off award over 
1,416,880 Ordinary shares on 1 April 2010 in recognition of his appointment as Chairman of the Board, and the shares  
will vest on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in the Company’s share incentive arrangements and are not entitled to  
a bonus or pension contribution. 
s ervice contracts/letters of appointment 
The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated by either the 
Director concerned or the Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination.  In the event of termination by the 
Company (other than as a result of a change of control), the Executive Directors would be entitled to loss of salary and 
cash benefit allowance for the notice period. Depending on the circumstances of termination, the Executive Directors 
may be entitled, or the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to allow the Executive Directors, to receive  
a pro-rated proportion of their outstanding awards under the long-term share incentive plans. 
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of an Executive Director’s employment, the Executive 
Director is entitled to compensation of a sum equal to his/her annual basic salary as at the date of termination of 
employment.  
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment.  Their 
terms of appointment may be terminated by each party giving three months notice in writing. The letters of appointment 
set out the time commitment expected by the Company and the Board is satisfied that each of the Non-Executive 
Directors commits sufficient time to fulfil their duties as a Director of the Company.    
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available for 
inspection on request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 25 May 2011.

EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 53
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom law and those 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the European Union.
Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the 
Group financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group financial statements the Directors 
are required to:
select suitable accounting policies in accordance with  >
IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors and then apply them consistently;
present information, including accounting policies, in a  >
manner that provides relevant reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
provide additional disclosures when compliance with  >
the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s 
financial position and financial performance;
state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to  >
any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable   >
and prudent.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group 
and enable them to ensure that the Group financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
wof fraud and other irregularities.
statement of Directors ’ res Ponsibilities in 
relation to t He grou P financial statements EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 54
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of 
EnQuest PLC for the year ended 31 December 2010 which 
comprise the Group statement of comprehensive income, 
Group balance sheet, the Group statement of changes in 
equity, the Group statement of cash flow and the related 
notes 1 to 26. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
r espective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the Group financial statements 
set out on page 53, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s  >
affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of its profit for the 
year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS   >
as adopted by the European Union; and
have been prepared in accordance with the  >
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
a ct 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the Group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  >
by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and  >
explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the Directors’ statement, set out on  > page 44, in relation 
to going concern;
the part of the Corporate Governance Report relating   >
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions  
of the June 2008 Combined Code specified for our 
review; and
certain elements of the report to shareholders by the  >
Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company 
financial statements of EnQuest PLC for the year ended 
31 December 2010 and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having  
been audited.

EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 59
notes to t He grou P financial statements
1. Corporate information 
EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the ‘Company’) is a limited 
liability Company registered in England and is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and Stockholm NASDAQ OMX 
market. 
The Group’s principal activities are the exploration for, and 
extraction and production of hydrocarbons in the UK 
Continental Shelf.
The Company was incorporated on 29 January 2010 as a 
holding Company to effect a business combination 
between Lundin North Sea BV (‘LNS’) and Petrofac Energy 
Developments Limited (‘PEDL ’).
On 5 April 2010 the Company acquired 100% of the 
voting shares of PEDL and on 6 April 2010 acquired 100% 
of the voting shares of LNS. Both acquisitions were 
satisfied by the allotment and issuance of Ordinary shares 
in the Company. 
On 6 April 2010, following completion of the PEDL and LNS 
acquisitions, the Company was admitted to the Official List 
and to unconditional trading on the main market for listed 
securities of the London Stock Exchange. On 9 April 2010, 
the Company was admitted to unconditional trading on the 
Stockholm NASDAQ OMX market, as a secondary listing.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2010 were authorised for issue in accordance 
with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 4 April 2011.
A listing of the principal Group companies is contained in 
note 26 to these Group financial statements.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
basis of preparation
The Group financial information has been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to 
the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2010 and applied in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow 
set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2010.
The Group financial information has been prepared on  
a historical cost basis. The presentation currency of the 
Group financial information is United States dollars and  
all values in the Group financial information are rounded  
to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except where 
otherwise stated. 
Going concern concept
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that 
the use of the going concern basis is appropriate because 
there are no material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the ability of the Group to continue as a going 
concern. 
Group formation
The combination of LNS with EnQuest has been accounted 
for as a capital restructuring under the pooling of interests 
method. The combination of PEDL with LNS has been 
accounted for using the acquisition method, with LNS 
identified as the acquirer.
The approach adopted has a number of consequences 
including that:
the Group’s financial statements are prepared on the  >
basis that EnQuest and LNS had always been combined, 
with the results of LNS being included for the year 
ended 31 December 2010 and EnQuest results being 
included from its incorporation date of 29 January 2010; 
comparative data for the statement of comprehensive 
income within these Group financial statements only 
relates to LNS as EnQuest was not incorporated in the 
comparative period;
the Group’s equity reflects the capital restructuring of  >

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the 
sole right to exercise control over the operations and 
govern the financial policies generally accompanying a 
shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. The 
existence and effect of potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when 
assessing the Group’s control. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group and are de-consolidated from the date that 
control ceases.
Intercompany profits, transactions and balances are 
eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of 
subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Unincorporated jointly controlled assets
Oil and gas operations are conducted by the Group as 
co-licensees in unincorporated joint ventures with other 
companies. The Group’s financial statements reflect the 
relevant proportions of production, capital costs, operating 
costs and current assets and liabilities of the joint venture 
applicable to the Group’s interests. The Group’s current 
joint venture interests are detailed on page 3.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, 
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of 
any controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. Those petroleum reserves and resources that are 
able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment 
of fair values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, 
resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be 
reliably determined, are not recognised. EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 60
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
(continued)
New standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted new and revised IFRS that are 
relevant to its operations and effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010. The principal 
effects of the adoption of these new and amended 
standards and interpretations are discussed below:
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment (Revised)
The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 that clarified the 
scope and the accounting for Group cash-settled share-
based payment transactions. The Group adopted this 
amendment as of 1 January 2010, the amendment did not 
have any impact on the financial position or performance 
of the Group.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised) and IAS 27 
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
(Amended)
IFRS 3 (Revised) introduces significant changes in the 
accounting for business combinations occurring after 
1 January 2010. Changes affect the valuation of non-
controlling interests, the accounting for transaction costs, 
the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of a 
contingent consideration and business combinations 
achieved in stages. The Group adopted this revised 
standard as of 1 January 2010. Retrospective application 
has been applied to 2009 equity comparatives where 
appropriate, however there is no impact on the financial 
position or performance of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2009.
IAS 27 (Amended) is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2009 and prescribes the accounting 
treatment in respect of a change in ownership interest in 
a subsidiary, allocation of losses incurred by a subsidiary 
between controlling and non-controlling interests and 
accounting for a loss of interest in a subsidiary. This may 
affect the Group where there is a change in ownership 
interest in any of its subsidiaries. The amendment did not 
have any impact on the financial position or performance 
of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the Group, but not yet 
effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s 
financial statements are listed below. This listing is of 
standards and interpretations issued, which the Group 
reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date.  
The Group intends to adopt those standards when they 
become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and 
Measurement
IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work 
on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification 
and measurement of financial assets as defined in IAS 39. 
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2013. In subsequent phases, the IASB  
will address classification and measurement of financial 
liabilities, hedge accounting and derecognition. The 
completion of this project is expected in mid-2011. The 
adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification 
and measurement of the Group’s financial assets. However, 
the Group determined that the effect shall be quantified in 
conjunction with the other phases when issued to present  
a comprehensive picture. 
Improvements to IFRS’s (Issued in May 2010)
The IASB issued improvements to IFRS, an omnibus of 
amendments to its IFRS standards. The amendments have 
not been adopted as they become effective for annual 
periods on or after either 1 July 2010 or 1 January 2011. 
The Group does not expect that adoption of the 
amendments will have any impact on its financial position 
or performance.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and 
judgements when preparing the financial statements of the 
Group. Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements 
could have an impact on the carrying amount of assets  
and liabilities and the Group’s result. The most important 
estimates and judgements in relation thereto are:
Estimates in oil and gas reserves
The business of the Group is the exploration for, 
development of and production of oil and gas reserves. 
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are used in the calculations 
for impairment tests and accounting for depletion and 
decommissioning. Changes in estimates of oil and gas 
reserves resulting in different future production profiles will 
affect the discounted cash flows used in impairment testing, 
the anticipated date of decommissioning and the depletion 
charges in accordance with the unit-of-production method.
Estimates in impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
For details of policy see Impairment of assets (excluding 
goodwill) and refer to the further economic assumptions 
above within Estimates in oil and gas reserves.
Decommissioning provision 
Amounts used in recording a provision for decommissioning 
are estimates based on current legal and constructive 
requirements and current technology and price levels for 
the removal of facilities and plugging and abandoning of 
wells. Due to changes in relation to these items, the future 
actual cash outflows in relation to decommissioning are 
likely to differ in practice. To reflect the effects due to 
changes in legislation, requirements and technology and 
price levels, the carrying amounts of decommissioning 
provisions are reviewed on a regular basis. 
The effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior 
year adjustments and are dealt with prospectively. While 
the Group uses its best estimates and judgement, actual 
results could differ from these estimates.
In estimating decommissioning provisions, the Group 
applies an annual inflation rate of 2% and an annual 
discount rate of 5%.
Estimates in impairment of goodwill
Determination of whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment requires an estimation of the value in use of 
the cash-generating units (‘CGU’) to which goodwill has 
been allocated. The present value calculation requires the 
entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the CGU and a suitable discount rate. In calculating 
the present value in use of the CGU, the Group has applied 
an oil price assumption of US$85 per barrel, escalated at 
2% per annum and discounted at a pre-tax rate of 19%.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
(continued)
Taxation
The UK’s Corporation tax legislation is relatively complex. 
The Group’s operations are subject to a number of specific 
rules which apply to UK North Sea exploration and 
production. In addition, the tax provision is prepared 
before the relevant companies have filed their UK 
Corporation tax and supplementary charge returns with 
HMRC and significantly, before these have been agreed.  
As a result of these factors the tax provision process 
necessarily involves the use of a number of estimates  
and judgements. 
The Group recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax 
losses where it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available for utilisation. This requires management to make 
judgements and assumptions regarding the amount of 
deferred tax that can be recognised as well as the 
likelihood of future taxable profits.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (‘functional currency’). The Group financial 
statements are presented in United States dollars, the 
currency which the Group has elected to use as its 
presentation currency.
In the accounts of the Company and its individual 
subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than a 
Company’s functional currency are recorded at the 
prevailing rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. 
At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
rate of exchange as at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of 
exchange at the date the fair value was determined.  
All foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Classification and recognition of assets and liabilities
Non-current assets and non-current liabilities including 
provisions consist, for the most part, solely of amounts that 
are expected to be recovered or paid more than 12 months 
after the balance sheet date. Current assets and current 
liabilities consist solely of amounts that are expected to be 
recovered or paid within 12 months after the balance sheet 
date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
Cost comprises the purchase price or construction cost 
and any costs directly attributable to making that asset 
capable of operating as intended. The purchase price or 
construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the 
fair value of any other consideration given to acquire 
the asset. 
Oil and gas assets are depleted, on a field-by-field basis, 
using the unit-of-production method based on entitlement 
to proven and probable reserves, taking account of 
estimated future development expenditure relating to 
those reserves. 
Depreciation on other elements of property, plant and 
equipment is provided on a straight-line basis at the 
following rates:
Office furniture and equipment 25% – 100%
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and 
method of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if 
appropriate at each financial year end.
No depreciation is charged on land or assets under 
construction. 
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 
The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is included in the 
statement of comprehensive income when the item  
is derecognised. Gains are not classified as revenue.
Capitalised costs
Oil and gas assets are accounted for using the successful 
efforts method of accounting.
Intangible oil and gas assets
Expenditure directly associated with evaluation or 
appraisal activities is capitalised as an intangible asset. 
Such costs include the costs of acquiring an interest, 
appraisal well drilling costs, payments to contractors and 
an appropriate share of directly attributable overheads 
incurred during the evaluation phase. For such appraisal 
activity, which may require drilling of further wells, costs 
continue to be carried as an asset whilst related 
hydrocarbons are considered capable of commercial 
development. Such costs are subject to technical, 
commercial and management review to confirm the 
continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value. 
When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off  
in the statement of comprehensive income. When such 
assets are declared part of a commercial development, 
related costs are transferred to property, plant and 
equipment oil and gas assets. All intangible oil and gas 
assets are assessed for any impairment prior to transfer 
and any impairment loss is recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income.
Oil and gas assets
Expenditure relating to development of assets including the 
construction, installation and completion of infrastructure 
facilities such as platforms, pipelines and development wells, 
is capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Changes in unit-of-production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production 
calculations are dealt with prospectively, not by immediate 
adjustment of prior years’ amounts. 
 
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction  
of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended 
use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time 
as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised as interest 
payable in the statement of comprehensive income  
in accordance with the effective interest method. EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 62
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising 
the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument. 
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair 
value hedging instruments are recorded in the profit or 
loss, together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged asset or liability.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised 
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in shareholders’ 
equity are transferred to the profit or loss in the period 
when the hedged item will affect the profit or loss. When a 
hedging instrument no longer meets the requirements for 
hedge accounting, expires or is sold, any accumulated gain 
or loss recognised in shareholders’ equity is transferred to 
profit and loss.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are 
accounted for in a similar manner as cash flow hedges.  
The gain or loss accumulated in shareholders’ equity is 
transferred to the profit or loss at the time the foreign 
operation is disposed of.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the 
profit or loss.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision 
for impairment. 
Inventories
Inventories of consumable well supplies are stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value, cost being 
determined on a first in first out (‘FIFO’) basis. Inventories 
of hydrocarbons are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. 
Under/over-lift 
Under-or over-lifted positions of hydrocarbons are valued 
at market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. An 
under-lift of production from a field is included in current 
receivables and valued at the reporting date spot price or 
prevailing contract price and an over-lift of production 
from a field is included in current liabilities and valued at 
the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract price.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in 
hand, outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid 
interest bearing securities with original maturities of three 
months or less. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
(continued)
Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its oil and gas assets to assess whether there is 
an indication that those assets may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In calculating the asset 
fair values the Group has applied an oil price assumption  
of US$85 per barrel, escalated at 2% per annum and a 
discounted pre-tax rate of 19%.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be 
less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but only so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
entity at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that such carrying value may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
is allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit 
or units to which goodwill is allocated represents the 
lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill 
relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
cash-generating unit and related goodwill, an impairment 
loss is recognised.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating 
unit and part of the operation within the unit is disposed of, 
the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is 
included in the carrying amount of the operation when 
determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured 
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of 
and the portion of the cash-generating units retained.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
(continued)
Equity
Share capital
The balance classified as equity share capital includes the 
total net proceeds (both nominal value and share premium) 
on issue of registered share capital of the Parent Company. 
The pooling of EnQuest and LNS on 6 April 2010 has 
resulted in the share capital of LNS being retrospectively 
adjusted to reflect the capital structure of EnQuest as of 
the beginning of the earliest comparative period 
presented. Share issue costs associated with the issuance 
of new equity are treated as a direct reduction of proceeds. 
Merger reserve
Merger reserve represents the difference between the 
market value of shares issued to effect business 
combinations less the nominal value of shares issued, and 
the consolidation adjustments that arise under the 
application of the pooling of interest method.
Cash flow hedge reserve
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as 
other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge 
reserve. Upon settlement of the hedge instrument, the 
change in fair value is transferred to the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Share-based payments reserve
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are 
measured at the fair value of the services received, and the 
corresponding increase in equity is recorded directly at the 
fair value of the services received. The share-based 
payments reserve includes treasury shares.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings contain the accumulated results 
attributable to the shareholders of the Parent Company. 
Employee benefit trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from 
the share-based payments reserve and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is 
also recognised in equity, with any difference between the 
proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to 
reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares.
Provisions
Decommissioning
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full 
when the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove 
a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which 
it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that liability 
can be made. The amount recognised is the present value 
of the estimated future expenditure. An amount equivalent 
to the discounted initial provision for decommissioning 
costs is capitalised and amortised over the life of the 
underlying asset on a unit-of-production basis over proven 
and probable reserves. Any change in the present value of 
the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment  
to the provision and the oil and gas asset. 
The unwinding of the discount applied to future 
decommissioning provisions is included under finance 
costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events,  
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial 
asset) is derecognised where:
the rights to receive cash flows from the asset   >
have expired;
the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from  >
the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them  
in full without material delay to a third party under  
a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows  >
from the asset and either (a) has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender, on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability 
such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts 
together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised 
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or a shorter period where appropriate. 
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue 
can be reliably measured. 
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales 
from the processing or sale of hydrocarbons on an 
entitlement basis, when the significant risks and rewards  
of ownership have been passed to the buyer.
Tariff revenue is recognised in the period in which the 
services are provided at the agreed contract rates.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 64
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
(continued)
Exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of Financial 
Statements, certain items are presented separately. The 
items that the Group separately presents as exceptional  
on the face of the statement of comprehensive income are 
those material items of income and expense which because 
of the nature and expected infrequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better the elements of 
financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate 
comparison with prior periods and to assess better  
trends in financial performance.
Depletion of fair value uplift to property, plant and 
equipment on acquiring strategic investments
IFRS requires that a fair value exercise is undertaken 
allocating the cost of acquiring controlling interests to the 
fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities. Any difference between the cost of 
acquiring the interest and the fair value of the acquired net 
assets, which includes identified contingent liabilities, is 
recognised as acquired goodwill. The fair value exercise  
is performed as at the date of acquisition.
The Directors have determined that for strategic 
investments it is important to separately identify the 
earnings impact of increased depletion arising from the 
acquisition date fair value uplifts made to property, plant 
and equipment over their useful economic lives. As a result 
of the nature of fair value assessments in the oil and gas 
industry the value attributed to strategic assets is 
subjective, based on a wide range of complex variables at  
a point in time. The subsequent depletion of the fair value 
uplifts bears little relationship to current market conditions, 
operational performance or cash generation. Management 
therefore reports and monitors the business performance 
of strategic investments before the impact of depletion of 
fair value uplifts to property, plant and equipment and the 
uplift is excluded from the business result presented in the 
Group statement of comprehensive income.
Leases
For a lease to qualify as a finance lease, substantially all of 
the risks and benefits of ownership must pass to the lessee. 
In all other cases the lease will be classified as an operating 
lease. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits such as salaries, social 
premiums and holiday pay, are expensed when incurred. 
Pension obligations
The Group’s pension obligations consist of defined 
contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension 
plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions.  
The Group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The amount charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income in respect of pension 
costs reflects the contributions payable in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable during the  
year and contributions actually paid are shown as either 
accrued liabilities or prepaid assets in the balance sheet.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in 
exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled 
transactions’) of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees  
is measured by reference to the fair value at the date  
on which they are granted. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any service or 
performance conditions, other than conditions linked  
to the price of the shares of EnQuest PLC (‘market 
conditions’) or ‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over 
the period in which the relevant employees become fully 
entitled to the award (the ‘vesting period’). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The statement of comprehensive income 
charge or credit for a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and 
end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon  
a market or non-vesting conditions, which are treated as 
vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Equity awards 
cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date  
of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the 
award at that date is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Taxes
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that 
are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the Group financial statements. 
However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit  
or loss. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 65
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities are offset, only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred 
income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Production taxes
In addition to corporate income taxes, the Group’s financial statements also include and disclose production taxes on net 
income determined from oil and gas production. 
The Group distinguishes between income tax and production tax. Production tax relates to Petroleum Revenue Tax 
(‘PRT’) and is accounted for under IAS 12 since it has the characteristics of an income tax as it is imposed under 
Government authority and the amount payable is based on taxable profits of the relevant fields. Current and deferred

(d) t ax losses 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for the carry-forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses/credits can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets of US$5,149,000 (2009: nil) were recognised in 2010 on the acquisition of Stratic (note 11) in relation 
to unutilised tax losses. The tax losses relate to UK trading losses arising in Stratic Energy UK Limited prior to 2010, 
recoverability of which is dependent on future taxable trading profits in excess of those arising from the reversal of 
deferred tax liabilities in that company. It is anticipated that Stratic Energy UK Limited will generate taxable trading profits 
in the future in excess of the losses carried forward, and this company had taxable trading profits in 2010.
8. earnings per share 
The calculation of earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. The denominators for the purposes of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per 
share for each period have been adjusted to reflect the capital restructure in accordance with IAS 33, ‘Earnings per Share’ 
(note 2).

a cquisition of stratic
On 5 November 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Stratic, an oil and gas company 
operating principally in the United Kingdom. The acquisition was satisfied by the issue and allotment of 24,434,983 
EnQuest Ordinary shares (note 17). 
The acquisition of Stratic enhanced the Group’s proven and probable oil and gas reserves in the UKCS and also 
consolidated its position in the West Don asset, providing a further 17.25% working interest in the asset.

completed within 12 months of the acquisition.
From the date of acquisition, Stratic has contributed US$6,511,000 to revenue and US$70,000 to the net profit before tax 
of the Group. If the above combination had taken place at the beginning of 2010, net profit of the Group would have been 
US$28,767,000 and revenue would have been US$608,210,000.
The goodwill recognised above is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the assets and 
activities of Stratic with those of the Group. None of the recognised goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes. 
Business combination expenses of US$5,289,000 relating to the above transactions have been expensed in the year 
(2009: nil).
lns capital restructuring 
On 6 April 2010, EnQuest acquired 100% of the voting rights of LNS, an oil and gas exploration and production company 
operating in the UK Continental Shelf. The acquisition was satisfied by the issue and allotment of EnQuest Ordinary shares 
(note 17). For financial reporting purposes, the combination of LNS with EnQuest has been accounted for as a capital 
restructuring under the pooling of interests method.
On 6 June 2010, LNS changed its name to EnQuest North Sea BV. 
a cquisition of PeDl
On 5 April 2010, EnQuest acquired 100% of the voting shares of PEDL, an oil and gas development and production 
company operating in the UK Continental Shelf. The acquisition, which was satisfied by the issue and allotment of 
EnQuest Ordinary shares (note 17), has been accounted for using the acquisition method. The Group financial  
statements include the results of PEDL for the period from its acquisition date.

The fair value of the purchase consideration transferred to acquire PEDL was derived from the opening day share price  
of EnQuest shares on 6 April 2010, as quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
From the date of acquisition, PEDL has contributed US$281,612,000 to revenue and US$75,759,000 to the net profit 
before tax of the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the period, the net profit before tax of  
the Group for the period would have been US$54,311,000 and revenue would have been US$614,357,000.
The goodwill recognised above is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the assets and 
activities of PEDL with those of the Group. None of the recognised goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes. 
On 6 May 2010, PEDL changed its name to EnQuest Dons Limited.
Business combination expenses of US$1,733,000 relating to the above transactions have been expensed in the period

Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to a single cash-generating unit (‘CGU’), the UKCS, 
being the Group’s only operating segment and therefore the lowest level that goodwill is reviewed by the Board. 
impairment testing of goodwill 
The Group performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2010. In assessing whether goodwill has been 
impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU, including goodwill, is compared with its recoverable amount.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 72
12. Goodwill (continued)
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined on a value in use basis using a discounted cash flow model 
comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections. The discount rate used is derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted 
average cost of capital. Risks specific to assets within the CGU are reflected within the cash flow forecasts. 
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The key assumptions required for the calculation of value in use of the CGU are:
oil prices >
production volumes >
discount rates >
Oil prices are based on management’s assessment of oil price using publicly available forecast commodity prices. For the 
purposes of calculating value in use, management has applied an oil price assumption of US$85 per barrel, escalated at 
2% per annum.
Production volumes are based on life of field production profiles for each asset within the CGU. The production volumes 
used in the value in use calculations are supported by the Group’s independent reserve assessment experts.
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’). The WACC 
takes in to account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the 
Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on its interest-bearing borrowings. Segment risk is incorporated by applying 
a beta factor based on publicly available market data. The discount rate applied to the Group’s pre-tax cash flow 
projections is 19% (2009: n/a).
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
There are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could erode the estimated amount of US$640,000,000 
by which the calculated value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU. These are discussed below:
oil price: management has considered the possibility of lower oil prices in the future. Revenue for the Group’s future oil  >
production is directly linked to the market price of Brent blend oil. A fall in the price for Brent blend production would 
directly impact the Group’s revenue and potentially the economic life of assets in the CGU. It is estimated that the 
long-term price of oil that would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of the CGU would 
be in the order of US$65 per barrel, escalated at 2% per annum.
production volumes: estimated production volumes are based on detailed data for the Group’s portfolio of assets  >
taking in to account asset-by-asset development plans agreed by management as part of the planning process. It is 
estimated that production would need to fall by 24% across all assets for the whole of the next 19 years to cause the 
recoverable amount to fall below the carrying amount of the CGU.

Also, during the year ended 31 December 2010, following a decision taken to discontinue field specific exploration 
activities on certain licences, US$48,021,000 of capitalised evaluation costs were impaired and written off

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 15 to 30 day terms. 
Trade receivables are reported net of any provisions for impairment. As at 31 December 2010 no impairment provision for 
trade receivables was necessary (2009: nil). 
Joint venture receivables relate to billings to joint venture partners and were not impaired. One joint venture receivable  
of US$547,000 was past due at 31 December 2010 (2009: nil) but was not impaired.
As at 31 December 2010 other receivables of US$8,194,000 (2009: nil) were determined to be impaired due to doubt  
over recoverability of well abandonment expenses from previous field owners incurred under Intervening  Period and 
Decommissioning Liability Agreements (note 4).
The carrying value of the Group’s trade, joint venture and other receivables as stated above is considered to be a 
reasonable approximation to their fair value.
16. Cash and cash equivalents
The carrying value of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their 
fair value. 
17. Share capital
The share capital of the Company as at 31 December was as follows:
2010
us $’000
2009
US$’000
Authorised, issued and fully paid
799,462,905 Ordinary shares of £0.05 each

60,990 32,164
Share premium 52,184 –
113,174 32,164
The comparative figure for the share capital at 31 December 2009 is adjusted to reflect the restructuring of EnQuest and 
LNS under the pooling of interests method (note 2).
The share capital comprises only one class of Ordinary share. Each Ordinary share carries an equal voting right and right 
to a dividend.
On incorporation, the Company issued and allotted two Ordinary shares of £1.00 each. On 18 March 2010 the Board 
approved a 20:1 share split whereby each £1.00 Ordinary share was converted to 20 Ordinary shares of £0.05.
On 5 April 2010, the Company issued and allotted, in aggregate, 345,629,616 Ordinary shares of £0.05 each to the 
shareholders of Petrofac Limited, the ultimate holding Company of PEDL, in consideration for the transfer of PEDL’s 
voting shares to EnQuest.
On 6 April 2010, the Company issued and allotted 422,436,246 Ordinary shares of £0.05 each to Lundin Petroleum AB, 
the ultimate holding Company of LNS, in consideration for the transfer of LNS’s voting shares to EnQuest.
On 7 April 2010, 6,962,020 Ordinary shares of £0.05 each were issued and allotted to the Company’s Employee Benefit 
Trust to satisfy awards to be made under the Company’s share-based incentive schemes.
On 8 November 2010, a further 24,434,983 Ordinary shares of £0.05 each were issued and allotted to the shareholders  
of Stratic in consideration for the transfer of Stratic’s voting shares to the Company. Following this transaction, and at 
31 December 2010, the Company had an issued share capital of 799,462,905 Ordinary shares of £0.05 each. EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 74
18. Share-based payment plans
On 18 March 2010, the Directors of the Company approved three share schemes for the benefit of Directors and 
employees, being a Performance Share Plan, a Deferred Bonus Share Plan and a Restricted Share Plan. No awards under 
the Performance Share Plan were granted to employees in 2010.
Deferred bonus Share Plan (‘DbSP’)
Directors and selected employees are eligible to participate under this scheme. Participants may be invited to elect or  
in some cases, be required, to receive a proportion of any bonus in Ordinary shares of EnQuest (‘Invested Awards’). 
Following such award, EnQuest will generally grant the participant an additional award over a number of shares bearing  
a specified ratio to the number of his or her invested shares (‘Matching Shares’). The awards granted in 2010 will vest 25% 
on the second anniversary of the date of grant, a further 25% after year three and the final 50% on the fourth anniversary 
of the date of grant. The invested awards are fully recognised as an expense in the period to which the bonuses relate.  
The costs relating to the matching shares are recognised over the four year vesting period and the fair values of the 
equity-settled matching shares granted to employees are based on quoted market prices adjusted for the trued up 
percentage vesting rate of the plan.
Details of the fair values and assumed vesting rates of the DBSP scheme are shown below:

* Includes invested and matching shares.
The charge recognised in the 2010 statement of comprehensive income in relation to matching share awards amounted  
to US$72,000 (2009: nil).
Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’)
Under the Restricted Share Plan scheme, employees are granted shares in EnQuest over a discretionary vesting period, 
which may or may not be, at the direction of the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of EnQuest, subject 
to the satisfaction of performance conditions. Awards made in 2010 under the RSP will vest over periods between one 
and five years. At present there are no performance conditions applying to this scheme nor is there currently any intention 
to introduce them in the future. The fair value of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year 
are based on quoted market prices adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the relevant vesting period.

The charge recognised in the year ended 31 December 2010 amounted to US$2,997,000 (2009: nil). 
The Company has recognised a total charge of US$3,070,000 (2009: nil) in the statement of comprehensive income 
during the year, relating to the above employee share-based schemes.

18. Share-based payment plans (continued)
l ong-t erm incentive Plan scheme (‘lti P’)
Prior to the formation of EnQuest PLC, LNS participated in the Lundin Petroleum Group LTIP scheme which consisted of 
an annual grant of units that converted into cash payment at vesting. The cash payment was determined at the end of 
each vesting period by multiplying the number of units by the share price. The LTIP had a three year duration whereby the 
initial grant of units vested equally in three tranches; one third after one year, one third after two years and the final third 
after three years. The demerger of LNS from the Lundin Petroleum Group resulted in all LTIP awards vesting due to the 
change in control, resulting in total costs of US$717,000 for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: US$608,000).
 
Share Option programme
LNS participated in the Lundin Petroleum Group Share Option programme prior to the formation of EnQuest PLC, 
whereby warrants were issued to employees enabling them to buy shares in Lundin Petroleum AB. All incentive warrants 
issued under this scheme expired by 30 June 2010.

(i) Revolving credit facility
On 17 March 2010, in anticipation of the corporate restructuring with LNS and the acquisition of PEDL, the Group 
established a two year US$280,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with Bank of Scotland and BNP Paribas 
which is secured on the assets of the Group. Under the terms of the facility agreement, the Group has the ability to draw 
loans to a maximum value of US$200,000,000 and utilise Letters of Credit (‘LoC’) to a maximum aggregate value of 
US$80,000,000. 
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at US LIBOR (relative to each agreed loan period) plus a margin of  
2.25% to 3.25%, dependent on specified covenant ratios. A facility non-utilisation commitment fee is payable at 50%  
of the interest margin.
At 31 December 2010 there were no borrowings under the Group’s facility agreement (2009: nil) and LoC utilisation of 
US$74,000,000 (2009: nil).
(ii) Term loan
At 31 December 2009, LNS had a term loan under the Lundin Petroleum AB Group term loan facility with BNP Paribas.  
On 31 March 2010, in anticipation of the combination of LNS with EnQuest, this term loan was assigned from LNS to 
Lundin Petroleum BV. The resulting liability between LNS and Lundin Petroleum BV, net of a long-term loan receivable  
by LNS, was capitalised on 6 April 2010.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 76

Provision for decommissioning
The Group makes full provision for the future costs of decommissioning its oil production facilities and pipelines on  
a discounted basis.
The provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs, which are expected to be incurred up to 2030 
assuming no further development of the Group’s assets. The liability is discounted at a rate of 5.0% (2009: 5.5 %).  
The unwinding of the discount is classified as finance cost (note 6).
These provisions have been created based on internal estimates. Assumptions, based on the current economic 
environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future 
liability. These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, 
actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning 
works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning 
liabilities is likely to depend on the dates when the fields cease to be economically viable. This in turn depends on future  
oil prices, which are inherently uncertain.

Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on terms of between 10 and 30 days. Certain trade and 
other payables will be settled in currencies other than the reporting currency of the Group, mainly in GBP.
Accrued expenses include accruals for capital and operating expenditure in relation to the producing oil and gas assets.
The carrying value of the Group’s trade and other payables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable 
approximation to their fair value.
22. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
Leases
The Group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for office premises. These leases 
have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between one and five years. The future minimum rental commitments 
under these non-cancellable leases are as follows:

Lease payments recognised as an operating lease expense during the year amounted to US$1,163,446 (2009: US$649,000). 
Capital commitments
At 31 December 2010, the Group had capital commitments excluding the above lease commitments amounting  
to US$78,602,000 (2009: US$24,485,000).

24. Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial instruments is 
to manage short-term cash flow and raise finance for the Group’s capital expenditure programme.
The Group’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with fluctuations in oil price, foreign 
currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, 
which are summarised below. Also presented below is a sensitivity analysis to indicate sensitivity to changes in market 
variables on the Group’s financial instruments and to show the impact on profit and shareholders’ equity, where 
applicable. The sensitivity has been prepared for periods ended 31 December 2010 and 2009 using the amounts of debt 
and other financial assets and liabilities held at those reporting dates.
Commodity price risk – oil prices
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in oil prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil. 
The Group did not hedge this risk in the years ending 31 December 2010 and 2009.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 78
24. Risk management and financial instruments (continued)

31 December 2009 35,790 (35,790) 14,810 (14,810)
During 2010, the Board of EnQuest approved a policy to hedge up to a maximum of 50% of annual oil production. In the 
fourth quarter of 2010, the Group entered in to four zero premium oil price collars for 2011 to hedge, partially, its exposure 
to fluctuations in oil prices. Each collar will hedge the price of approximately 1,000,000 barrels of oil in 2011. These 
derivative instruments are designated effective cash flow hedges and had a nil fair value at 31 December 2010 (2009: nil).
Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than 
the Group’s functional currency. The Group manages this risk by converting US$ receipts at spot rates periodically and as 
required for payments in other currencies. Approximately 6% of the Group’s sales and 79% of costs are denominated in 
currencies other than the functional currency.
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and equity (due to change in the fair value of monetary 
assets and liabilities) of a reasonably possible change in United States dollar exchange rates with respect to different currencies:

31 December 2009 (1,752) 1,752 (876) 876
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, international oil and gas operators and at 31 December 2010 there were no trade 
receivables past due (2009: nil), and one joint venture receivable past due of US$547,000 (2009: nil). Receivable 
balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary. 
At 31 December 2010, the Group had one customer accounting for 97% of outstanding trade and other receivables  
(2009: one customer, 83%) and three joint venture partners accounting for 82% of joint venture receivables (2009: nil). 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, 
the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the 
carrying amount of these instruments.
Cash balances can be invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved 
limits and with a view to minimising counter-party credit risks.
Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash flow requirements on a regular basis relative to its 
existing bank facilities and the maturity profile of these facilities. Specifically the Group’s policy is to ensure that sufficient 
liquidity or committed facilities exist within the Group to meet its operational funding requirements and to ensure the 
Group can service its debt and adhere to its financial covenants. Throughout the year and at 31 December 2010 the Group 
was in compliance with all financial covenant ratios agreed with its bankers. 
At 31 December 2010, the Group had US$206,000,000 (2009: nil) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities available 
which are due to expire in March 2012 and replacement borrowing facilities are expected to be arranged during 2011.

24. Risk management and financial instruments (continued)
Capital management
The Group’s management is committed to delivering and enhancing shareholder value, and building upon the progress 
made during the current year. The Board believes that this can best be achieved by reinvesting in the Group’s core 
business and through pursuing selective acquisitions and development opportunities. In light of the Group’s commitment 
to investment in ongoing production operations development, exploration projects and acquisitions, the Directors do  
not recommend payment of a dividend at this time. This is, however, re-assessed by the Board on a regular basis.
The Group seeks to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency 
whilst also maintaining flexibility for future acquisitions. The Group keeps under review the costs and access to debt 
funding to ensure it has an appropriate flexibility. Note 19 to the financial statements provides further details of the 
Group’s financing activity.
Capital for the Group is equity attributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company, and is in the Group statement  
of changes in equity on page 57.
The Group monitors capital using the gearing ratio and return on shareholders’ equity as follows:
2010

Net gearing ratio (B/C) n/a 79%

25. Post balance sheet events
On 11 February 2011 the Group sold its 48.75% interest in the Petisovci project (‘Petisovci’) in Slovenia in return for 150, 
903,958 new Ordinary shares in Ascent Resources plc (‘Ascent’), representing a 22.2% equity stake in Ascent. The Group 
had acquired its interest in Petisovci through its acquisition of Stratic in November 2010. As part of the transaction the 
Group also received a nil-cost option to receive a further 29,686,000 new Ordinary shares in Ascent, subject to certain 
criteria related to the successful development of Petisovci.
On 23 March 2011 it was announced that supplementary Corporation tax on UK oil and gas production is to be increased 
from 20 per cent to 32 per cent with effect from 24 March 2011, thereby increasing the combined rate of tax on UK oil and 
gas production from 50 per cent to 62 per cent on ring fence profits and from 65 per cent to 81 per cent for fields liable to 
petroleum revenue tax. The government has stated that the supplementary Corporation tax rate may be reduced back to 
20 per cent if oil prices stay low (below US$75 per barrel) for a sustained period, however it is not clear at this time if this 
will be incorporated into legislation. This change in UK tax legislation does not impact the 2010 Group financial results as 
these changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, however it is likely to have a material effect 
on the value of the Group’s deferred tax liabilities and assets and income tax charge in future reporting periods.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Company for that period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply   >
them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable   >
and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards   >
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern  >
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable

EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 81
We have audited the parent Company financial statements 
of EnQuest PLC for the period ended 31 December 2010 
which comprise the Company balance sheet, and the 
related notes 1 to 12. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed. 
r espective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 81, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to  
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements  
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s  >
affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of its loss for the 
period then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United  >
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the  >
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
a ct 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be  >
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the  >
financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent Company 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the  >
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent Company financial statements and the part  >
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  >
by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and  >
explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent Company 
financial statements of EnQuest PLC for the year ended 
31 December 2010 and on the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described  
as having been audited.

EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 83
1. Corporate information 
The Company financial statements of EnQuest PLC (the 
‘Company’) for the period ended 31 December 2010 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Directors on 4 April 2011.
EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the ‘Company’) is a limited 
liability company registered in England and is the holding 
Company for the Group of EnQuest subsidiaries (together 
‘the Group’). The Company was incorporated on 
29 January 2010 as a holding Company to effect a business 
combination between Lundin North Sea BV (‘LNS’) and 
Petrofac Energy Developments Limited (‘PEDL’).
The Group’s principal activities are the exploration for, and 
extraction and production of hydrocarbons in the UK 
Continental Shelf.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
basis of preparation
The separate financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards on 
a historical cost basis. The functional and presentation 
currency of the separate financial statements is United 
States dollars and all values in the separate financial 
statements are rounded to the nearest thousand 
(US$’000) except where otherwise stated. 
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company 
as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern concept
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that  
the use of going concern basis is appropriate because 
there are no material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a 
going concern. 
investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any 
provision for impairment.
Amounts due from/to subsidiaries
Amounts due from/to subsidiaries are non-interest bearing 
short-term funding to and from subsidiaries. These are 
recognised at the fair value of consideration received  
or paid, less any provision for impairment.
c ash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash  
in hand, outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid 
interest bearing securities with original maturities of  
three months or less. 
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising 
the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument. 
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair 
value hedging instruments are recorded in the profit or 
loss, together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged asset or liability.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised 
through the statement of recognised gains or losses.  
notes to tH e financial statements
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the profit or loss. Amounts 
accumulated in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the 
profit or loss in the period when the hedged item will affect 
the profit or loss. When a hedging instrument no longer 
meets the requirements for hedge accounting, expires  
or is sold, any accumulated gain or loss recognised in 
reserves is transferred to profit and loss.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are 
accounted for in a similar manner as cash flow hedges.  
The gain or loss accumulated in the statement of 
recognised gains and losses is transferred to the profit  
or loss at the time the foreign operation is disposed of.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Employee benefit trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from 
the share-based payments reserve and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is 
also recognised in equity, with any difference between the 
proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to 
reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in 
exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled 
transactions’) of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees  
is measured by reference to the fair value at the date  
on which they are granted. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any service or 
performance conditions, other than conditions linked  
to the price of the shares of EnQuest PLC (‘market 
conditions’) or ‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over 
the period in which the relevant employees become fully 
entitled to the award (the ‘vesting period’). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The profit or loss charge or credit for a 
period represents the movement in cumulative expense 
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon  
a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as 
vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Equity awards 
cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date  
of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the 
award at that date is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
The Company operates a number of share award schemes 
on behalf of the employees of the Group which are described 
in detail in note 18 of the Group financial statements. EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 84
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The reserve for the share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded 
to employees and transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards.

Change in Corporation tax rate
The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK Corporation tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a 
period of four years from 2011. The first reduction in the UK Corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% was substantively 
enacted on 20 July 2010 and will be effective from 1 April 2011. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge 
accordingly. Any deferred tax expected to reverse in the year to 31 December 2011 has been remeasured using the 
effective rate that will apply for the period.
The aggregate impact of the proposed reductions from 27% to 24% would reduce the deferred tax asset by approximately 
US$91,000.
6. l oss attributable to members of the Parent Company
The loss dealt with in the financial statements of the Parent Company is US$8,371,000 (2009: nil). There were no other 
recognised gains or losses in the period (2009: nil).

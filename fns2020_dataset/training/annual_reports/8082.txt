Infonic is a global leader in providing business 
software solutions. The company’s three divisions 
deliver software to blue-chip international clients 
including Thomson Reuters, Shell, Fujitsu, PwC, 
Dredging International, RJ Reynolds, the U.S. Army, 
the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the UK Ministry of 
Defence, and the French and Singapore Governments.
Our expertise is focused on document and text 
capture, distribution and analysis.
Geo-Replicator
Our Geo-Replicator software uses powerful, patented 
data compression and synchronisation technology to 
replicate data rapidly between servers and laptops 
and server-to-server. This is vital where servers are 
separated geographically and data transmission would 
ordinarily be slow and where personnel work remotely 
but need access to replicated data in the ﬁ eld. The 
software works with Microsoft SharePoint as well 
as other key platforms such as IBM’s Lotus Notes. 
Geo-Replicator’s software is relied upon by a diverse 
set of clients such as the US Navy, BP Alaska T ankers, 
Christian Aid and the Federal Aviation Administration.
Document Management
Infonic’s Document Manager software makes possible 
the digital capture, storage, search and retrieval of any 
type of document, including scanned images, word 
documents, e-mails and pdfs. Our software enables 
businesses to dispense with hard copy ﬁ ling and stores 
documents in secure folder systems which permitted 
users can access simultaneously. We are the preferred 
supplier of document management software to DHL, the 
global leader in international freight and Konica Minolta 
Business Solutions, the imaging and printing company. 
Our global clients include TNT , Optimax, Dairy Crest, 
Christian Salvesen, Friends of the Earth and the T exas 
Department of Public Safety.
Text Analytics
We are leaders in the ﬁ eld of computational linguistics, 
which is the science of using computers to decompose 
and understand language. Our primary text analytics 
software product, Sentiment, automatically 
understands, analyses and reports on the underlying 
events and sentiment behind thousands of news stories, 
reading unstructured news in milliseconds and 
presenting the end user with an instant understanding 
of content. Sentiment has a number of applications 
such as giving ﬁ nancial traders a time advantage in 
understanding whether the news sentiment behind 
a stock is positive, negative or neutral. We are working 
in partnership with Thomson Reuters to embed the 
Sentiment software in the Thomson Reuters data 
management system which is used by banks and 
hedge funds.

Case Study: Document Manager
In 2007 Infonic became a preferred supplier of Document 
Management software to DHL UK, the global leader in 
international freight.
Delivering success
Infonic’s Document Management team has a proven 
track record of delivering successful solutions within 
DHL UK and has steadily increased the use of 
Document Manager throughout DHL ’s UK operations. 
Document Manager is installed on servers at 35 DHL UK 
sites, and is used by DHL employees and customers 
across a further 100+ sites. 
DHL uses Infonic Document Manager to capture, 
store and provide user access to millions of operational 
documents. including more than ﬁ ve million Proof 
of Delivery documents, supplier invoices and 
HR documents.
Document Manager is also an integral part of the 
Business Solutions DHL provides to other organisations. 
These include major clinical trials projects and a 
three-year supply chain contract with the UK’s Mitchells 
& Butlers pub chain.
DHL is a large and dynamic company with many 
different operating systems. The ease with which 
Document Manager integrates with DHL ’s existing 
business systems including Oracle HRMS and legacy 
T ransport Management and Finance Systems continues 
to be critical to the successful working of all the software 
within DHL.
Planned rollout projects should see total document 
volumes handled by Document Manager inside DHL 
increase by 50% during 2008, and hopefully extend to 
territories including the Middle East and Eastern Europe. 
Infonic customers in the logistics sector also include: 
CEVA, T radeteam, TNT , Stan Robinson, RH Freight, 
Salvesen and SwissPort.

Case Study: Sentiment
Thomson Reuters is the world’s leading provider of news 
and data for professional markets and is the exclusive 
distributor of Infonic’s automated sentiment analysis 
technology within the ﬁ nancial services sector, under the 
brand name of RNSE (Reuters News Sentiment Engine).
This relationship began in early 2006 when Infonic and 
Thomson Reuters agreed to test a prototype of the 
automated sentiment analysis software within a number 
of major hedge funds and investment banks. This 
sentiment analysis engine produced “sentiment scores” 
for Thomson Reuters news articles covering a number 
of the most frequently traded shares. For example, every 
Thomson Reuters news article on Vodafone Group Plc 
was automatically attributed a score between zero 
and one – zero being wholly negative, and one 
wholly positive.
Infonic then partnered with Thomson Reuters to develop 
a commercial solution which Thomson Reuters could sell 
to the world’s major banks, investment funds and hedge 
funds. Thomson Reuters has trained its sales force and 
embedded the technology into its global data centres 
and has dedicated technical and sales staff working on 
the project.
Quantifying the market’s moods
Financial traders aim to make money under all market 
conditions. Any additional data or analysis which gives 
them an advantage is highly coveted. Sentiment can 
tell the traders whether news coverage behind a stock 
is positive, negative or neutral with the resulting 
sentiment/price gap providing an arbitrage opportunity 
that can add signiﬁ cant value in a fast-moving trading 
environment. The Thomson Reuters RNSE data is fed 
directly to “algorithmic” trading systems which then 
allow computers to determine whether to buy or sell 
particular shares.
Infonic’s Sentiment software is being installed on a 
growing number of client sites alongside existing 
proprietary trading systems. The software is also 
being deployed within Thomson Reuters’ own RNSE 
computers which provide trading banks with an 
enriched ﬁ nancial news service.
Algorithmic trading was one of the fastest growing areas 
in equity trading in 2007. It is set to penetrate other asset 
classes including commodities and foreign exchange 
in 2008. Infonic will continue to provide cutting edge 
solutions across these markets. 
T oday in the US and the UK, over one third of all share 
trades are executed exclusively by computers. This 
proportion is set to grow as only computers can 
realistically manage the increasingly huge volumes 
of news and data being generated every day within 
the ﬁ nancial markets.
Our sentiment engine is one of the most accurate 
commercially automated sentiment products 
available on the market today.

Infonic’s technology delivers 
efﬁ cient replication of content both 
ways between ship and shore. infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 9
Case Study: Geo-Replicator
The US Navy is Infonic’s largest customer. The Navy’s 
Distance Support Program uses Infonic Geo-Replicator 
on over 260 ship servers. Most of the Navy’s land bases 
also have Infonic’s Geo-Replicator software installed. 
The Navy uses Geo-Replicator software to support a 
range of its activities around the globe. The software’s 
patented compression algorithms enable transmission 
of the Navy’s technical manuals, safety information and 
training materials over limited bandwidth satellite 
networks to users at sea. 
Geo-Replicator also enables US Navy engineers on 
board ship to send aggregated engine sensor data 
back to shore based engineers to support maintenance 
scheduling. This highly complex data is gathered 
by shipboard diagnostic systems and sent via 
Geo-Replicator to shore based engineers and 
designers to be analysed. 
Fourteen ancillary commands are now using 
Geo-Replicator technology to support their commands 
for such things as morale and welfare information. 
Over a million Navy ﬁ les are being updated using 
Geo-Replicator every day.
Before Infonic’s Geo-Replicator was installed the Navy’s 
information updates were either not sent, or burned to 
CD and mailed monthly to each ship. By updating 
documents and data every night with Geo-Replicator the 
US Navy has improved ship battle readiness and safety. 
It has also reduced maintenance cycle times by 20% and 
saved millions of dollars in annual maintenance costs by 
making it possible to transmit data to and from ships.

• Federal Aviation Administration, USA
• United States Air Force
• United States Army

Chairman’s Statement
I am delighted to be able to report 
that all of our technologies are selling 
well in our chosen markets. Our 
full-year results clearly demonstrate 
that our innovative software appeals 
to a broad and increasing range 
of multinational customers. 
When reporting half-year results I stated that 
Mark and his team have transformed a research 
and development business into a proﬁ table, sales 
and marketing-led global software corporation. 
The Company is now EBITDA positive which puts 
us in a strong position going forward. 
This has been the single largest challenge of the last 
twenty four month period, however, I am pleased 
to report that the overall value of contracts won and 
delivered during the year, as well as the very healthy 
sales pipeline, shows that they have succeeded 
in achieving their goal and have created a very 
sustainable company. infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 11
Introduction 
I must commend the entire team for the way that they 
have worked to cope with increased volumes of complex 
customer sales, installations and support. The hard work 
invested and the processes that they have honed during 
2007 will reap dividends in 2008 and beyond.
2008 is off to a strong start with our Document 
Management and T ext Analytics divisions trading 
particularly well. We look forward to building on the 
success of 2007 and the diversity of our product range, 
and customers, gives us conﬁ dence in our ability to 
achieve our ﬁ nancial targets for the year.
Business progress and core strategy
2007 was the critical year in which the Group 
consolidated its position, completed the integration of 
the ﬁ ve businesses we acquired between 2004 and 
2006 under the single Infonic plc brand, and redeﬁ ned 
our strategy around the three core product areas of 
Document Management, Geo-Replication and 
Text Analytics. 
Strengthening our proposition and our team
An important area of focus which has already begun 
to yield results was the strengthening of our UK and 
international sales teams. Simultaneously, we instituted 
substantial cost savings by providing central shared 
administrative functions across the Group. 
The Infonic value proposition, to help our customers 
capture, distribute and analyse important documents 
and text stored within their businesses, remains 
compelling, and a strong differentiator for us in the 
markets in which we operate. 
Continuous programme of investment is bearing fruit
Our heavy investment in research and development, 
such as implementing the key Microsoft SharePoint 
2007 server-to-server replication release for our 
Geo-Replicator product, allowed us to win a landmark 
contract worth £8.3m with the UK Ministry of Defence 
as part of the EDS Atlas consortium.
We also secured strategic partnerships with Konica 
Minolta and Thomson Reuters, increased the number 
of our customers, and sold for the ﬁ rst time into new 
geographical markets, such as France, Germany, 
Switzerland and Norway. Our strong belief in our 
products is supported by the knowledge that they 
are used in a variety of critical environments where 
it is essential to install software engineered to the 
highest standards. 
The strategy is yielding strong results
We recorded strong organic growth with our strategy of 
focusing on core products in tightly deﬁ ned markets and 
geographies. Although our products have global appeal 
it is easy for a company of our size to become too thinly 
spread, therefore, an absolutely essential element of 
our operations revolves around proﬁ table, focused, 
achievable sales activity.
Recognised revenues for the year topped £8.8m, which 
is more than 37.5% higher than the £6.5m recorded in 
for the previous 18 month accounting period, or 49.2% 
higher than the preceding 12 months. 
In addition, our Operating Proﬁ t before depreciation, 
amortisation & exceptional costs was a healthy £2m 
compared with a negative £2.4m in the previous period 
and, importantly, positive cash ﬂ ow from operating 
activities was over £2.2m.
Successful fundraising
In December 2007 we completed a successful 
fundraising which raised £3.1m from institutional 
investors, despite difﬁ cult market conditions for raising 
ﬁ nance. We were particularly pleased that a number of 
sizeable institutions chose to subscribe for shares and 
join our strong and supportive institutional shareholder 
base. We are using the funding to invest further in 
sales and marketing and to enhance the functionality 
of our products. 
Outlook
Whilst organic growth has been sustained and 
continues to be encouraging, it is still central to the 
company’s strategy to consider further acquisitions if we 
identify synergies with potential acquisitions that will be 
earnings enhancing. 
We are monitoring world markets carefully and continue 
to focus, if possible, on niches that can experience rapid 
return on investment from our technologies. We are 
conﬁ dent of continued growth and expansion in 2008, 
built upon the ﬁ rm foundations put in place in 2007.

After three years of acquisition 
activity, 2007 was the year we 
drove our business forward 
through strong organic growth. 
Utilising shared, centralised 
corporate expertise across the 
whole Group, we rolled out major 
new releases for our software solutions, sold into 
new sectors and adopted a coherent uniﬁ ed branding.
We instituted cost savings as a result of the 
centralisation of functions, and ploughed the 
proceeds into investing in our sales force. 
We raised £3.1m towards the end of 2007 which 
will further fuel the development and growth of 
the company.
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Review infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 13
Results
The Group’s revenues for the year to 31 December 2007 
were £8.8m (18 months to 31 December 2006: £6.5m), 
up 37.5%, or 49.2% comparing like-for-like trading periods. 
This strong but focused revenue growth, combined with 
careful cost management of our underlying business, 
resulted in a reduction of administrative expenses from 
£8.2m for the 18 months to 31st December 2006 down to 
£6.3m for the current period under review.
Revenue per employee grew from £80,600 in 2006 to 
£113,400 in 2007, an increase of 53.3%.
The Group made an operating proﬁ t before 
depreciation, amortisation and exceptional costs of 
£2m (2006: loss of £2.4m). 
At 31 December 2007 we had £4.4m in cash, which 
has been topped up post year end by the previously 
announced receipt of £3.1m less expenses from a 
placing of ordinary shares.
Geographic coverage
£7.6m or 85.6% of the Group’s recognised revenue was 
generated in the UK, £1.0m or 11.0% in the US, and just 
under £0.3m, or 3.4% in the rest of the world (Europe 
and Asia-Paciﬁ c). 
T owards the end of 2007 we made several key strategic 
hires in North America. We can report strong interest 
from our Singapore operation serving the Asia-Paciﬁ c 
region and an extremely strong pipeline in Germany. 
We hope that all of these regions will form a greater 
proportion of our revenues in 2008. 
Dealing with the three business divisions in turn
Geo-Replicator
Geo-Replicator generated £5.4m of revenue in 2007 
worldwide, representing 60.8% of the Group total. 
Several landmark deals were contracted and delivered 
during the year, most notably with the UK Ministry of 
Defence and the US Department of Defense.
This technology was acquired in its basic form at the 
end of 2005 for £3.9m.
We are pleased that in the last two years we have 
re-engineered the business to produce £7.6m 
of recognisable revenue and £3.3m of proﬁ t 
from operations.
Our Geo-Replicator product, which used to be known as 
iOra, works with Microsoft SharePoint as well as other 
key platforms, such as IBM’s Lotus Notes.
SharePoint is a widely used collaboration and storage 
sharing platform which scales information from the 
workgroup up to the enterprise platform, but it does not 
have any built-in replication ability. 
Infonic’s Geo-Replicator allows data items to be 
replicated quickly across the SharePoint platform 
between the server and laptops and server-to-server. 
This is essential where servers are separated 
geographically and the transmission of data items would 
ordinarily be slow, and also where personnel work 
remotely but need access to replicated information in 
the ﬁ eld. 
Our software uses unique and powerful patented data 
compression and synchronisation technology to give 
effect to this. Our software is relied upon and is 
invaluable in terms of the ﬁ elds our clients operate in, 
such as the armed forces, humanitarian relief, shipping 
and oil companies.  Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 14 infonic.com
In November 2007 we launched our Geo-Replicator 
SharePoint 2007 release, which is a major development 
from our previous SharePoint 2003 release. 
The division secured an £8.3m contract win to supply 
Geo-Replicator to the UK Ministry of Defence as part of 
the EDS Atlas consortium directly resulting from this 
SharePoint 2007 release.
During the fourth quarter of 2007 the Board decided to 
defer the recognition of the majority of the deal value of 
the US Navy Collaboration at Sea Program to 2008 due 
to budget allocation delays within the Program. 
However, the Program has informed us that their 
internal delays have no impact on their desire to roll-out 
our software to up to 1,000 servers globally. We look 
forward to completing this installation and continue to 
extend our reach into other programs within the US 
Navy and Marine Corps.
Whilst the main focus of the company’s activities during 
2007 has been server-to-server sales for the SharePoint 
2007 release, we continue to support clients using the 
SharePoint 2003 release and to provide related 
consultancy advice, including to clients such as Fujitsu 
and PwC. This technology leads the market and is 
well-placed to serve a burgeoning market for software-
based information replication. 
Document Management
In 2007 our Document Management division generated 
£2.8m in revenue, 31.6% of the Group’s total revenue. 
This division was acquired at the beginning of 2006, 
since when we have enhanced the offering and almost 
doubled sales growth. During the 30 month period to 
31st December 2007 the division generated £1.1m in 
proﬁ t from operations, against a purchase price of £1.4m.
This is an established product line for the Group, 
providing consistent revenues, but with opportunities for 
future growth. 
Our proprietary Document Manager software (formerly 
known as T okOpen) enables the digital capture, storage, 
search and retrieval of any type of document, including 
scanned images, word documents, e-mails and pdfs. 
Our software allows businesses to dispense with hard 
copy ﬁ ling and stores documents in secure folder 
systems which permitted users can access 
simultaneously.
We have continued to invest in and develop these 
products. In September 2007 we launched the new look 
T okOpen 2.4, which has a new Microsoft Vista-style 
appearance and interface. 
In 2007 we also launched our .Net Document Manager 
version, which provides enhanced functionality in a web-
based version. 
We also established some important strategic alliances 
to promote the sales of this product in 2007. We became 
the preferred supplier of Document Management 
software to Iris Enterprise, in connection with its 
Exchequer ﬁ nance accounting package, and we entered 
into new partnering relationships with PS Financials and 
RDT in relation to their packages. 
Most signiﬁ cantly, we became the preferred supplier of 
Document Management software under a new strategic 
partnership with Konica Minolta Business Solutions, the 
imaging and printing company.
During the year we were pleged to deliver some 
important Document Management solutions to clients 
including Norwich Primary Care T rust, and for Swiss 
Ports, as part of its SAP integration. SAP integration is a 
strength of the product which we continue to build upon.
Customers range in diversity from the Emergency 
Animal Hospital of North West Austin, T exas to 
Mansﬁ eld Oil, and from Christian Salvesen to Friends of 
the Earth. This is a product line with a wide appeal to 
customers due to the clear technological differentiation 
and rapid return on investment. Consequently, we 
believe it is poised for even better results in 2008.
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Review infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 15
Text Analytics 
Our primary text analytics software product Sentiment, 
automatically understands, analyses and reports on the 
underlying events and sentiment behind thousands of 
news stories, reading unstructured news in milliseconds 
and presenting the end user with an instant 
understanding of the content. It is the result of years of 
complex research into practical applications for 
computational linguistics, which is the science of using 
computers to decompose and understand language. We 
lead in this ﬁ eld. 
The Sentiment product has a variety of applications, 
such as enabling ﬁ nancial traders to understand the 
news sentiment behind certain stocks. Sentiment can 
tell the trader whether news coverage behind a stock is 
positive, negative or neutral. The resulting real-time 
sentiment ‘signal’ has been proven in testing to assist in 
pinpointing pricing movements before they occur. The 
resulting sentiment/price gap results in an arbitrage 
opportunity that can add signiﬁ cant value to complex 
trading environments.
Thomson Reuters partnership:
Infonic spent 2007 preparing its Sentiment software for 
revenue generation. 
During the year we also secured a partnership with  –
Thomson Reuters to embed our Sentiment software 
into the Thomson Reuters data management layer 
for ﬁ nancial institutions like banks and hedge funds. 
Scores generated from the software are sent to  –
trading companies to aid algorithmic trading. 
T raders can analyse news and market sentiment for  –
the ﬁ rst time, in relation to price movements. 
Various ﬁ nancial organisations are already using  –
the system. 
The system can either be used as part of a wider  –
system deployed by the client, or on a platform 
hosted by Thomson Reuters. 
Thomson Reuters have some 370,000 terminals  –
which they host across the globe with over 2,600 
customers.
We hope to provide more detail about sales progress  –
in this lucrative marketplace during the course of 
2008 in conjunction with Thomson Reuters own 
marketing team but early signs are very 
encouraging.
Our Sentiment team also comprises an intelligence team 
which provides consultancy services to corporate 
customers, providing tracking and analysis of comment 
being made about the client, online. T rading in this 
online area has been steady throughout the year with 
signiﬁ cant revenues being generated at customers such 
as Weber Shandwick and Fitch Ratings. 
Outlook
We have a range of powerful and innovative software 
technologies which we continued to enhance in 2007. 
We have also solidiﬁ ed our presence in the niche sectors 
in which we operate and believe that the momentum we 
are currently experiencing can only continue with the 
increased need to organise and understand digital data. 
We have invested in an experienced sales and marketing 
team with blue chip backgrounds to ensure strong 
international growth. 
T rading has been encouragingly strong in 2007 and the 
year marked a turnaround point for us ﬁ nancially. We are 
seeing a rise in the size and scope of projects and we are 
very excited about our progress.
We are conﬁ dent that we will continue to see returns on 
this strategy in 2008 and beyond, helped by the funding 
we secured in December 2007.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Shareholders of Infonic plc
At 31 December 2007
We have audited the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”) of Infonic plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 
which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, Group Statement of 
Recognised Income and Expense, the accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 30. These Financial Statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
shareholders as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ Responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and for preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report required to be audited in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Financial Statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report required to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether, in 
addition, the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether 
in our opinion the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Financial Statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁ c 
information presented in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the 
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Financial Statements. This other 
information comprises the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Review, the Directors’ Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report required to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the 
preparation of the Financial Statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial Statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s  –
affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its loss for the year then ended;
the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; –
the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of  –
the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007;
the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and –
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Financial Statements. –

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
GENERAL INFORMATION
Infonic plc is a company listed on the AIM market and incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered 
ofﬁ ce is given at the back of this report. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief Executive’s Review. The 
Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign 
operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
Going concern
The directors have reviewed projections for the 12 month period from the date of signing of these Financial Statements. Based on the level of projected 
income, current and expected level of costs and additional borrowings obtained after the year end, the directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to 
prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis. Should there be any shortfall in projected income or signiﬁ cant delay in receipts or 
signiﬁ cant overrun in costs, without additional funding this may cause the Company and Group to have insufﬁ cient resources to trade as a going concern.
Basis of preparation of Financial Statements
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with EU-endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International 
Financial Reporting Intermediate Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to 
exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or 
where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁ cant to the Financial Statements, are disclosed in Note 1.
The Financial Statements of Infonic pic (the Company) have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom accounting standards.
1 Summary of signiﬁ cant Group accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
First–time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Group has adopted IFRS for the ﬁ rst time in its respective Financial Statements.
The Group has applied IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” to provide a starting point for reporting under IFRS. 
The date of transition to IFRS was 1 July 2005, and all comparative information in these Financial Statements has been restated to reﬂ ect the Group’s 
adoption of IFRS.
The transition to IFRS reporting has resulted in a number of changes to the ﬁ nancial statements, the Notes thereto and the accounting policies, 
compared with previous annual reports. These changes are set out in Note 28. The accounting policies that have been applied in the opening balance 
sheet have also been applied throughout all periods presented in the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements.
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or not yet relevant
IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” requires companies to adopt management approach to reporting on their operating segments. This standard is effective 
for the year ending 31 December 2009.
A revised version of lAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” will require information in ﬁ nancial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared 
characteristics, and introduce a statement of comprehensive income. The revision is effective for the year ending 31 December 2009.
A revised version of lAS 23 “Borrowing Costs” removes the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale. This revision is effective for borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets for which the 
commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009.
An amendment to IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” clariﬁ es that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only, and speciﬁ es 
that all cancellations whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. This amendment is effective for the year 
ending 31 December 2009.
IFRIC 11 “IFRS 2 – Group and T reasury Share T ransactions” considers how certain grants of equity instruments should be treated under IFRS 2 “Share-
based Payment”. The interpretation is effective for the year ending 31 December 2008.
IFRIC 12 “Service Concession Arrangements” addresses how service concession operators should apply existing IFRSs to account for the obligations 
they undertake and rights they receive in service concession arrangements. As none of the Group entities is involved in public-to-private service 
concession arrangements, this interpretation is not relevant to the Group.
IFRIC 13 “Customer Loyalty Programmes” addresses accounting by entities that grant loyalty award credits to customers who buy goods and services. 
This interpretation is effective for the year ending 31 December 2009. infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 25
IFRIC 14 “lAS 19 – The Limit on a Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction” provides guidance on how to assess the 
limit in lAS 19 “Employee Beneﬁ ts” on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset. This interpretation is effective for the year ending 
31 December 2008.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the Financial 
Statements of the Group, except for additional disclosures on segregated results and the statement of comprehensive income, when the relevant 
standards come into effect.
Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial Statements of Infonic plc and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2007.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Control is the power to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain 
beneﬁ ts from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
The acquisition of subsidiaries has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value 
of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition. Identiﬁ able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁ able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. There has 
been no retrospective adoption of IFRS 3, business combinations, in respect of acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Amounts reported in the Financial Statements of 
subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
The Group treats transactions with minority interests as transactions with parties external to the Group. Disposals to minority interests result in gains and 
losses for the Group that are recorded in the Income Statement. Purchases from minority interests result in goodwill, being the difference between any 
consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets in the subsidiary.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in its associates. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns different from 
those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that 
are subject to risks and returns different from those of other geographical segments.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the Financial Statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its 
“functional currency”). The Financial Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£), which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
The assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
Balance Sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net 
investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to the ‘Currency T ranslation Reserve’ in equity. 
T ranslation differences on non-monetary ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or fair value, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less 
estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
Property, plant and equipment – 2 years
Motor vehicles – 5 years
Scanning bureau – 3 years
Leasehold improvements – 3 years
Fixtures and ﬁ ttings – 3 years
Material residual value estimates are updated as required, but at least annually, whether or not the asset is revalued.
An asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount, and are recognised in the Income Statement.
When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings. Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 26 infonic.com
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
1 Summary of signiﬁ cant Group accounting policies (continued)
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
A ﬁ nance lease is one in which a signiﬁ cant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. Assets obtained under ﬁ nance 
leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the Balance Sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. The interest element of the rental 
obligations is charged to the Income Statement over the period of the lease, and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding.
An operating lease is one in which a signiﬁ cant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor. Rentals payable under operating 
leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identiﬁ able net 
assets acquired, is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. The net book value of goodwill at 1 July 2005 (the date the IFRS 1 exemption applied from) has been treated as deemed cost.
Computer software is included as an intangible asset only when it is separately identiﬁ able from the computer hardware.
Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, unless such lives are 
indeﬁ nite. Development costs are amortised. Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each Balance Sheet date. Other intangible assets are 
amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Computer software – 2 years
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when the 
following criteria are met:
completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for sale; –
management intends to complete the asset and use or sell it; –
the entity is able to use or sell the asset; –
the generation of probable future economic beneﬁ ts is demonstrable; –
adequate technical, ﬁ nancial and other resources exist to complete the development and use or sell the asset; –
the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be reliably measured. –
If these criteria are not met, development costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development costs are amortised from the point at which the asset is ready for use on a straight-line basis over 5 years. Development assets 
are tested annually for impairment.
Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiﬁ able cash ﬂ ows (cash-generating 
units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those 
cash-generating units that are expected to beneﬁ t from the business combination on which the goodwill arose, and represent the lowest level within the 
Group at which management monitors the related cash ﬂ ows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, other intangible assets with an indeﬁ nite useful life, and those intangible 
assets not yet available for use, are tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a ﬁ nite life are 
tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reﬂ ecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use, based on an internal discounted cash ﬂ ow 
evaluation. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no 
longer exist. Impairment losses are charged to administrative expenses.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets are recognised in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is made for diminution in value where 
appropriate. Interest receivable and payable is accrued and credited/charged to the Income Statement in the period to which it relates.
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable.
T rade payables are recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable.
T rade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 27
Trade receivables
T rade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Signiﬁ cant 
ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or ﬁ nancial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are 
considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits, bank overdrafts, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash, and are subject to an insigniﬁ cant risk of changes in value.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on the taxable proﬁ t for the year.
Deferred tax is provided in full with no discounting, using the liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities and their tax bases, except when, at the initial recognition of the asset or liability, there is no effect on accounting or taxable proﬁ t or loss. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date, and that are expected to apply when 
the temporary difference reverses.
Tax losses available to be carried forward, and other tax credits to the Group, are recognised as deferred tax assets, to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be future taxable proﬁ ts against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of the tax expense in the Income Statement, except where they relate to items 
that are charged or credited directly to equity (such as the revaluation of land), in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly 
to equity.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, not of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference 
between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statements over the period of the borrowings 
using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classiﬁ ed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after 
the Balance Sheet date.
Provisions
These are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, when it is probable that an outﬂ ow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation, using a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a ﬁ nance cost.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁ ed as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Employee beneﬁ ts
The Group supports various personal pension arrangements. The Group also operates a deﬁ ned contribution stakeholder pension scheme. This is a 
scheme under which the Group pays ﬁ xed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold sufﬁ cient assets to pay all employees the beneﬁ ts relating to service in current and prior years. Agreed 
contributions are charged to the Income Statement as they become payable.
The Group operates an equity-settled, share based compensation plan. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. At each Balance Sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It 
recognises revisions of original estimates in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 28 infonic.com

For the year ended 31 December 2007
1 Summary of signiﬁ cant Group accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services provided in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities, excluding VA T and trade discounts. Revenue is recognised upon the performance of services or the transfer of risk to the 
customer.
Revenue from the sale of goods under managed contracts is recognised when all of the following conditions have been satisﬁ ed:
the Group has transferred to the buyer the signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, which is generally when goods are despatched to  –
customers, 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; –
it is probable that the economic beneﬁ ts associated with the transaction will ﬂ ow to the Group; –
the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably; –
a signed agreement is in place; –
no speciﬁ c vendor obligations remain. –
Revenues from consulting services provided on a time basis are recognised at the time the service is performed.
Revenue from maintenance contracts are recognised over the term of the contract on a straight line basis.
Deferred income arises where services are invoiced in advance of performance. The amount is released to the Income Statement in subsequent periods 
with reference to the stage of completion at the Balance Sheet date.
Interest
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortised cost of a ﬁ nancial asset and allocates the interest income over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the ﬁ nancial 
asset to the net carrying amount of the ﬁ nancial asset.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by deﬁ nition, seldom equal the related 
actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁ cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year are:
The Group conducts annual impairment tests of goodwill. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-
use calculations. These calculations require the entity to estimate the future cash ﬂ ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable 
discount rate to calculate the present value.
Research and development expenditure
Capitalisation of research and development expenditure requires the entity to consider the probable economic beneﬁ ts that are expected to be delivered 
from a research and development project. This in turn requires the entity to estimate the future cash ﬂ ows that are expected to arise as well as a suitable 
discount rate. infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 29
2 Company accounting policies
The Financial Statements of Infonic plc (the Company) have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom accounting standards.
The principal accounting policies of the Company:
a) Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less amounts written off.
b) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Company and obligation to pay more tax in the future, 
or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely that not that they 
will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
c) Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
d) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insigniﬁ cant risk of changes in value.
e) FRS 20 ‘Share based payments’
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees are rewarded 
using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to 
the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for example, proﬁ tability and sales 
growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit to equity.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of 
the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share options expected to 
vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any 
expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where appropriate share 
premium.
3 Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of ﬁ nancial and other risks that include the effect of changes in debt market prices and foreign currency 
exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk management programme in place that seeks to limit the adverse 
effects on the ﬁ nancial performance of the Group by monitoring levels of debt ﬁ nance and the related ﬁ nance costs. The Group does not use derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments to manage interest rate costs and, as such, no hedge accounting is applied.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group undertakes sale and purchase transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These currencies (primarily the US dollar) are reasonably 
stable, and the risk is managed by maintaining bank accounts denominated in those currencies.
Credit risk
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made. No debt ﬁ nance is currently 
utilised. The amount of exposure to any individual party is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the Board.
No credit limits were exceeded during the year, and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties. Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 30 infonic.com
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
3 Financial risk management (continued)
Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term debt ﬁ nance that is designed to ensure that the Group has sufﬁ cient available funds 
for operations and planned expansions. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash ﬂ ow. 
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and beneﬁ ts for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, 
issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Fair value estimation
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables is assumed to approximate to their fair values, due to their short-term 
nature. 
Other risks and uncertainties
Other key business risks affecting the Group are set out below.
Risks are formally reviewed by the Board, and appropriate processes are put in place to monitor and mitigate them. If more than one event occurs, it is 
possible that the overall effect of such events would compound the possible adverse effects on the Group.
Computer risk
Our ofﬁ ces use sophisticated scheduling software to manage the activities of the business. Failure of these systems would cause serious disruption. 
Back-ups of all systems are taken on a regular basis and the Group has developed disaster recovery measures to use in the event of our major software 
product failing. 
Contract risk
In order to retain our contracts, the Group must ensure that it continues to operate to high standards of quality and meet the needs of our customers. Prior 
to contracts reaching their normal termination dates, we advise customers of the beneﬁ ts of extending the contractual relationship. There is a risk that 
they will not be re-awarded.
Global market conditions
Signiﬁ cant parts of the world economy have slowed down in 2008, which could affect the sales of the Company’s solutions. Infonic feels that some of its 
businesses are likely to be protected from this, particularly because some of its products are sold to non-commercial clients, such as in the government 
sector, educational establishments and the armed forces. 
Competition
Some of the Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive markets, where there are a variety of similar technologies. Competitors may develop 
rival technologies which could undermine sales of our solutions. In order to mitigate this risk, we continue to monitor market conditions, pricing and 
industry developments, enhancing our sales channels and functionality as appropriate. We undertake routine market research to understand our 
customers’ expectations and whether their needs are being met.
Employees
The performance of the company depends on the retention of key staff. To mitigate these issues, the Company has implemented a number of measures 
that are designed to retain key individuals. infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 31

Impairment test for goodwill
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairments, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may have been impaired. 
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These use pre-tax cash ﬂ ow projections, based on ﬁ nancial budgets 
approved by management, covering a ﬁ ve-year period. Cash ﬂ ows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates given below. The 
growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are:
      Geo- Document
      Replicator Management Sentiment
Gross margin     95% 95% 95%
Growth rate     10% 7.50% 25%
Discount rate     10% 10% 10%
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU within the business segment.
Management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development. The weighted average growth 
rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates used are pre-tax and reﬂ ect speciﬁ c risks relating to the 
relevant segments. infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 35

expire ﬁ ve years after the date of grant. The options issued at 2.4655p expire ten years after the date of grant. During the year ended 31 December 2007

options at 5.5p. Most employees agreed to surrender their 7p options in return for new options exercisable at 5.5p a share. Employees leaving the company 
before the date of exercise of their options may only retain those options subject to Board approval. Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 38 infonic.com

17 Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same ﬁ scal authority. Deferred tax liabilities are temporary timing differences arising on tangible and 
intangible assets.
The offset amounts are as follows:
       2007 2006
       £ £
Deferred income tax assets to be recovered within 12 months    – – 
Deferred income tax liabilities to be settled after more than 12 months    776,484 562,208 
Deferred income tax liabilities (net)     776,484 562,208 
The movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows:
        Intangibles 
        £ 
At 1 January 2007       562,208 
Charged to income statement      214,276 
At 31 December 2007       776,484 
The deferred tax charge arises from the capitalisation of development costs, but which are deducted in determining taxable proﬁ t. The development 
costs have a tax base of nil. The temporary differences is the difference between the carrying amount of the development costs and their tax base of nil.
The Group has UK trading corporation tax losses available to be carried forward for offset against future taxable proﬁ ts amounting to approximately 
£14,023,000 (2006 – £12,853,000). These tax losses will reduce the tax charge of future periods until the Group achieves sufﬁ cient proﬁ ts to utilise the 
losses. These losses give rise to a deferred tax asset of approximately £2,664,000 (2006 – £2,442,000). No deferred tax assets have been recognised as 
there is currently insufﬁ cient certainty that the assets will be recorded. Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 40 infonic.com

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
22 Earnings per share
Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year / period.
       2007 2006
Loss attributable to equity (£)     (2,108,192) (11,544,744)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue    178,155,366 93,069,857 
Basic earnings per share (pence per share)     (1.2) (12.4)
An adjusted proﬁ t / (loss) per share of 0.9p (2006: (3.0p)) has been calculated as the directors feel that adding back amortisation of other intangible assets 
and exceptional items more fairly reﬂ ects the underlying business.
Adjusted proﬁ t / (loss) is calculated as follows:
       2007 2006
Loss for the purpose of basic earnings per share (£)    (2,108,192) (11,544,744)
Add back:
Amortisation of other intangible assets     661,137 272,135 
Exceptional costs      3,125,270 8,462,436 
       3,786,407 8,734,571 
Earnings / (loss) for the purpose of adjusted earnings per share (£)   1,678,215 (2,810,173)
Weighted average number of shares     178,155,366 93,069,857 
Adjusted earnings / (loss) in pence per share     0.9p (3.0)p
No diluted loss per share is presented as the effect on the exercise of the options would be to decrease the loss per share.

On 1 July 2007, the Group acquired 78% of the share capital of Corpora Software (Asia Paciﬁ c) Pte Limited, which has since been re-named Infonic Software 
(Asia Paciﬁ c) Pte Limited. The acquired business contributed revenues of £33,111 and net loss of £38,663 to the Group for the period from 1 July 2007 to 
31 December 2007. The principal activity of the acquired business is to sell the Groups software products in the Asia Paciﬁ c region. If the acquisition had 
occurred on 1 January 2007, Group revenue would have been £70,321, and loss before allocations would have been £118,935. These amounts have been 
calculated using the Group’s accounting policies, and by adjusting the results of the subsidiary to reﬂ ect the additional depreciation and amortisation that 
would have been charged had the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets applied from 1 July 2007, together with 
the consequential tax effects.

30 Reconciliation of previous GAAP to IFRS
Restatement of ﬁ nancial information under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
This is the ﬁ rst year that the Group has presented its ﬁ nancial statements under IFRS. The Company reported under UK GAAP in its previously published 
ﬁ nancial statements for the period ended 31 December 2006. The following reconciliations after the application of its IFRS accounting policies as detailed 
in note 1 to the accounts above have been prepared and are set out below together with explanatory notes on the impact of the transition to IFRS.
The areas of accounting that are most signiﬁ cantly impacted are:
the treatment of purchased goodwill –
accounting for business combinations –
the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates –
the capitalisation of development costs – infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 45

1 Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortised but instead is reviewed annually for impairment. The Group has elected to not apply IFRS 3 
retrospectively, therefore the net book value of goodwill has been frozen at 30 June 2005 with no further amortisation charged on goodwill held at that 
date or on subsequent acquisitions.
An impairment review is also required at the date of transition under IFRS 1 in accordance with the guidelines set out in IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ 
regardless of whether any indications of impairment exist. The Group reviewed the goodwill held at the date of transition and an impairment was made.
b) Research and Development
Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets research and development projects which meet certain criteria are capitalised and amortised over the period of their 
economic beneﬁ t. The Group has determined that it has certain projects which meet the IAS 38 criteria and therefore should be capitalised.
2 Deferred taxation
Deferred tax under UK GAAP was not provided due to materiality.
IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ requires that full provision be made for all taxable temporary timing differences except those arising on goodwill. The principal 
impact of adopting IAS 12 has been to recognise deferred tax liabilities on the temporary differences arising on capitalisation of research and 
development projects. Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 46 infonic.com
The directors present their Report, together with the Group Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report, for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Principal activities and business review
The principal activities of the Company during the year under review were software sales and marketing supported by ongoing product development.
The results for the year to 31 December 2007 are set out in the Group income statement on page 21.
Business environment
The three divisions of the Company operate in slightly differing business environments, although there are many commonalities. 
Document Management
The Document Management software market is highly fragmented. There are a number of large market leaders, Infonic’s Document Manager solution 
operating in the middle tier of providers and document management functionality, where there are many competitors. 
Infonic has differentiated its product from its competitors by concentrating on marketing in particular sectors which need Document Management 
software, such as logistics and accounts payable. Infonic has also been concentrating on developing channels for the sale of Document Manager, such 
as it being sold as part of Finance and Human Resource systems, and as part of a case management solution for insurance brokers. 
Infonic’s Document Manager has an easy to use user interface and it is competitively priced. Infonic has also developed a hosted solution for its software 
in addition to the deployed model. 
Geo-Replication
Companies can deal with the delays in synchronising data items between geographically remote servers and servers to laptops in two different ways: by 
investing in faster hardware such as routers, or implementing specialised software, such as using Infonic’s Geo-Replicator product. The Geo-Replication 
market space is serviced by a relatively limited number of specialised suppliers. 
Infonic distinguishes itself in the market in terms of the functionality of its Geo-Replicator offering, which offers unique compression and virtualisation 
technologies. Infonic also sees providing consultancy advice in relation to the set up of client SharePoint portals as a key area to help win business for its 
Geo-Replicator product. 
Text Analytics (Sentiment)
The text analytics business space is very specialist with a small number of participants, as it is an emerging technology. There are comparatively few 
competitors. 
Infonic has concentrated on developing the accuracy of the results of its automated sentiment software engine, which is on par with human checking, 
and on ensuring that its software can deal with large data throughputs.
Strategy
The Company’s objectives are 
to grow through the development of its separate business areas, which are supported by a few centrally pooled corporate support functions;  –
to develop its sales reach, and market awareness; and –
to seek out acquisition and joint venture opportunities which add value to the Company.  –
The Company develops its businesses accordingly to the relevant market conditions for the particular division.
Over 2007 the Company invested in developing its sales function, particularly in newer markets like continental Europe, the Asia Paciﬁ c region and North 
America, where it believes there are the most opportunities for higher growth. 
While 2007 was the year for consolidating the Group following on from the acquisitions made in the previous years, the Group will continue to consider 
strategic acquisitions of other software providers whose products and businesses would complement Infonic’s existing businesses. 
Research and development
We will continue to invest in enhancing the software of our business divisions, trying where appropriate to be proactive in terms of assessing what 
developments will provide market leading functionality and which may result in revenue growth. The directors regard the investments in research and 
development as integral to the continuing success of the business. 
Future outlook
We believe that the Document Management business can continue to grow, particularly through targeting sales of the product in different sectors, and 
through channels, packaging Document Manager as part of larger solutions.
Infonic feels that there is considerable scope for the development of the Geo-Replication market, such as the implementation of the Company’s 
technology in the raw materials extraction industries and in different regional markets.
The text analytics market is still at an early stage of development and so potential customers need to be educated in terms of the availability and 
application of this powerful technology, but we are conﬁ dent that demand will increase. 
We therefore believe that each of the Company’s businesses will grow healthily in 2008 in their respective sectors.

Policy and practice on payment of creditors
The Group seeks to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers whenever it is satisﬁ ed that the supplier has provided the goods or services in 
accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The Group does not have a standard or code which deals speciﬁ cally with the payment of suppliers.
Branches outside the UK
The Group has operations in the United States of America and Singapore, and a sales reseller ofﬁ ce in Germany. 
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Financial Statements for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The directors have 
elected to prepare the Company Financial Statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). The Financial Statements are 
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Group for that year. In 
preparing these Financial Statements the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; –
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; –
state that the Group Financial Statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and parent company ﬁ nancial statements in  –
accordance with UK GAAP , subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; and
prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business, in which  –
case there should be supporting assumptions or qualiﬁ cations as necessary.
The directors conﬁ rm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the Financial Statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the 
Company and the Group, and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group 
Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group, and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The directors have implemented International Financial Reporting Standards for the ﬁ rst time this year, in respect of the Group Financial Statements, as 
required by the Alternative Investment Market. The 2006 accounts have been restated to comply with these new standards.
The impact of the transition on the Group’s results is set out in note 30.
Provision of information to auditors
So far as each of the directors is aware at the time the report is approved:
there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and –
the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the  –
auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
Since the previous Annual General Meeting our auditors CLB Littlejohn Frazer have changed their name to Littlejohn. A resolution to reappoint Littlejohn 
will be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting.
This report was approved by the Board on 19 May 2008 and signed on its behalf.
Nick Sarker
Company Secretary 
Directors’ Report infonic.com Infonic plc (formerly known as Corpora plc) | Annual Report 2007 49
The following statement of corporate governance reﬂ ects the position of the Company as at 31 December 2007.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s corporate governance policy and recognises the importance of high standards of integrity, and consistently 
seeks to apply the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) to the extent that they are appropriate for, and applicable 
to, a company of Infonic’s size quoted on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). 
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors meets regularly to review strategic, operational and ﬁ nancial matters, including proposed acquisitions and divestments.
It approves the interim and annual Financial Statements, the annual ﬁ nancial plan, signiﬁ cant contracts and capital investment in addition to reviewing 
the effectiveness of the internal control systems and business risks faced by the Group.
Where appropriate, it has delegated authority to committees of directors. Information is supplied to the Board in advance of meetings and the Chairman 
ensures that all directors are properly briefed on the matters being discussed. The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer are separate and 
have been so throughout the year.
Non-executive directors are appointed for non-speciﬁ ed terms, and re-appointment is not automatic. All of the non-executive directors have extensive 
business experience and are considered by the Board to be independent.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and all the directors are able to take independent professional advice, if 
necessary, at the Company’s expense. Directors offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment and 
thereafter in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
Board Committees
The non-executive directors serve on the Nomination, Remuneration and Audit Committees. Mark Thompson also serves as an executive representative 
on each of these committees.
In accordance with its terms of reference the principal function of the Audit Committee is to determine the appropriateness of accounting policies to be 
used in the Group’s annual results. In addition the Committee is responsible for assessing the Group’s audit arrangements and the Group’s system of 
internal controls, and reviewing the half-yearly and annual results before publication. It also recommends the appointment of the Company’s external 
auditors. The Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer attend the meetings by invitation. The auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee has met twice during the year.
In accordance with its terms of reference the Nomination and Remuneration Committee determines the level and make-up of remuneration (including 
bonuses and options) of the executive directors and certain senior management. This also includes formulation of remuneration policy throughout the 
Group, embracing both share options and bonuses. The Committee also evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and 
considers all new Board appointments and re-appointments against this evaluation. 
Operating Board
The Operating Board comprises the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and senior managers within the Group. The Operating Board meets on a fortnightly basis to 
discuss policy and operational issues. Those issues outside the delegated authority levels set by the plc Board are referred to the plc Board for its decision.
Relations with shareholders
The Board welcomes the views of shareholders. 
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is used as an opportunity to communicate with shareholders. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the 
Company’s AGM, in order to take advantage of the opportunity to ask questions of the directors. 
Additional information is supplied through the circulation of the trading updates, the Interim Report and the Annual Report and Accounts. During the 
year the Company issued a series of announcements to the Stock Exchange. The Chief Executive, and other directors from time to time meet individual 
institutional shareholders and provide such information as is permissible in order to facilitate a better understanding of the Group’s business and operations.
Shareholders may also contact the Company in writing.

Internal control
The Group maintains an ongoing process in respect of internal control to safeguard the shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets and to facilitate 
the effective and efﬁ cient operation of the Group. These processes enable the Group to respond appropriately, and in a timely fashion, to signiﬁ cant 
business, operational, ﬁ nancial, compliance and other risks which may otherwise prevent the achievement of the Group’s objectives. The Group 
recognises that it operates in a highly competitive market that can be affected by factors and events outside its control. It is committed to minimising risks 
arising wherever possible and accepts that internal controls, rigorously applied and monitored, are an essential tool in achieving this objective.
The key elements of Group internal control, which have been fully effective during the year to 31 December 2007 are set out below:
the existence of a clear organisational structure with well deﬁ ned lines of responsibility and delegation of authority from the Board to its executive  –
directors and operating divisions;
a procedure for the regular review of reporting of business issues and risks by operating divisions; –
regular review meetings with the operating management; –
the establishment of prudent operating and ﬁ nancial policies. –
The directors have overall responsibility for establishing ﬁ nancial and other reporting procedures to provide them with a reasonable basis on which to 
make proper judgements as to the ﬁ nancial position and prospects of the Group, and have responsibility for establishing the Group’s system of internal 
control and for monitoring its effectiveness. The Group’s systems are designed to provide directors with reasonable assurance that physical and ﬁ nancial 
assets are safeguarded, transactions are authorised and properly recorded and material errors and irregularities are either prevented or detected with 
the minimum delay. However, systems of internal ﬁ nancial control can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
The key features of the systems of internal ﬁ nancial control include:
comprehensive ﬁ nancial planning process with an annual ﬁ nancial plan approved by the Board; –
monthly comparison of actual results against plan; –
regular reporting to the Board on treasury and legal matters; –
clearly deﬁ ned investment control guidelines and procedures. –
The majority of the Group’s ﬁ nancial and management information is processed and stored on computer systems. The Group is dependent on systems 
that require sophisticated computer networks. The Group has established controls and procedures over the security of data held on such systems.
Internal audit
The need for an internal audit function is reviewed on an annual basis by the Audit Committee taking into account the size and complexity of the Group. 
At present there is no intention to establish an internal audit function.

Remuneration policy
The Company’s policy for the current year and subsequent years is to ensure that remuneration packages paid to directors are competitive when 
compared to similar companies and to recognise the long-term growth plans of the Company whilst ensuring due consideration of short-term objectives, 
in order to closely align the interests of the directors with those of the Company and the shareholders. Within these overall objectives the Company 
provides basic salary, beneﬁ ts, share options and pension contributions. Details of performance conditions relating to the Share Option Scheme can be 
found under the relevant headings below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises all of the non-executive directors and Mark Thompson, determines Group remuneration policy and the 
remuneration of executive directors and certain other senior management (including bonuses and options). Mark Thompson does not attend meetings 
at which his own remuneration is being determined and neither do any of the non-executive directors at which their remuneration is discussed.
Pensions
The Company operates a deﬁ ned contribution scheme of which eligible employees, including the executive directors, are entitled to be members. 
The Company’s standard contribution rate for these employees, including the executive directors, is a matching contribution of either 3% or 5% of basic 
salary including earnings above the HM Revenue and Customs earnings cap.

calendar.

Results
I am delighted to report a record set of results for the
year ended 31 December 2005. These results show
the effectiveness of the operating structure which was
put in place in the final quarter of 2004 and the
Group is now in excellent shape.
The financial highlights for the year are:-
• Turnover from continuing operations up by 22% 
to £232.8 million (2004: £190.2 million)
• EBITDA up by 88% to £12.8 million (2004:
£6.8 million)
• Profit before goodwill amortisation and taxation 
up by 107% to £8.8 million (2004: £4.3 million)
• Profit before taxation up by 244% to £5.046
million (2004: £1.465 million)
• Operating margin before goodwill amortisation,
other income, interest and taxation increased to
4.4% (2004: 2.5%)
• Fully diluted underlying earnings per share
increased by 16% to 6.04 pence (2004: 5.2 pence)
• Basic earnings per share increased to 2.4 pence
(2004: 0.0 pence)
• Net cash inflow from operating activities increased
to £13.2 million (2004: £8.9 million)
• Year end net debt reduced to £8.2 million (2004:
£14.1 million) with net interest covered 7.6 times
by operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and other income (2004: 5.5 times)
Proposed dividend
The improved financial performance of the Group
during 2005 allows the Board to propose a
significantly improved dividend of 1.25 pence which,
subject to Shareholder approval, will be paid on 3 July
2006. This is a 25% increase on the last dividend paid
to shareholders on 4 July 2005.
Operational review
2005 was a year of consolidation in order to drive the
benefits from the integration of the previous year’s
acquisitions into the Group’s new operating structure.
2005’s results include new segmental reporting
disclosures which reflect the reporting structures now
implemented within the Group.
Our Security and Specialist Services operations
performed extremely well in 2005 reporting an
operating profit before goodwill amortisation of
£5.3 million on a turnover of £68.9 million
(2004: £1.7 million operating profit before goodwill
amortisation on a turnover of £30.3 million). The
performances of both First Security Group Limited
and TASS (Europe) Limited which were both
acquired in the second half of 2004 have exceeded
our expectations.
Our Integrated Services operations reported an
operating profit before goodwill amortisation of
£4.8 million on a turnover of £163.9 million
(2004: £3.0 million operating profit before goodwill
amortisation on a turnover of £159.8 million) despite
Chairman’s Statement
A L R Morton Chairman 
All key financial indicators
demonstrate very healthy
growth in 2005 MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    5
suffering a £0.4 million “hit” to profits caused by the April 2005
administrative receivership of the Rover Group. The Chief Executive’s
Review sets out the many significant contract wins which our operations
secured in 2005 and we are particularly pleased that 2006 will see the
commencement of a new five year relationship with Prudential Property
Investment Managers to provide operational and facilities management
services at 14 retail destinations across the UK. The annual value of this
contract is expected to be in the region of £20 million.
Strategy
We are well positioned to benefit from the further consolidation which
is likely to occur in the outsourced business services markets in which
we operate. Although these markets are competitive, we see many
exciting opportunities for profitable growth including “bolt on”
acquisitions. Our immediate focus, however, is to continue to
expand organically in 2006 and produce further healthy growth in
earnings per share.
Outlook
The Board is encouraged by current trading and is enthusiastic and
confident about the Group’s prospects for 2006.
A L R Morton
Chairman
15 March 2006
We see many exciting opportunities for profitable growth
  6 MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005
Overview
We provide over 60 different facilities services to 
more than 1,000 customers at some 3,500 different
locations across the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
We employ in excess of 13,500 people.
We aim to be the facilities provider of choice to
customers in the retail, industrial, commercial and
public sectors in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
We deliver both multiple services on large contracts at
multiple locations or a bespoke, single service to a
customer on just one site. Our service breadth is wide
enough to include the provision of facilities services to
Sainsbury’s at 395 of their stores throughout the UK and
the provision of stewarding services to Chelsea Football
Club for every match they play at Stamford Bridge.
Approach
We strongly believe in the benefits of self performance
which means that, wherever possible, the services we
provide are undertaken by our own employees. The
single key factor which sets us apart in the facilities
services market place is our ability to effectively manage
the self performed services we provide to our customers.
It is our ability to deliver a wide range of high quality
self performed services which leads to close working
relationships with our customers. We become an
effective partner with our customers through our
willingness to understand their business needs. This
leads to high retention rates when contracts are
retendered and strong forward order visibility. Strong
earnings visibility provides us with the confidence to
invest in our own employees, their training needs and
the support structures which sit behind the front line
of service provision.
Our operating model sounds simple. After ten
acquisitions and three disposals since 1998, we know
what we can do and we have developed an operating
model which works. The results for 2005 show that
our operating model is working very effectively.
Financial review of 2005
Turnover in 2005 increased by 22% over 2004.
Operating profit before goodwill amortisation
increased by 88% over 2004 to £10.2 million. Net
operating margins before goodwill amortisation were
4.4% in 2005 (2.7% in 2004). Profit before goodwill
amortisation and taxation increased by 107% to 
£8.8 million. Fully diluted underlying earnings per
share were 6.04 pence (2004: 5.2 pence).
Net Group debt at 31 December 2005 was 
£8.2 million which included £6.9 million of net bank
borrowings. Net Group debt reduced by £5.9 million
during 2005 mainly as a result of £13.2 million of 
net cash inflow from operating activities. The Group
enjoys banking facilities of £29.2 million and our net
debt position is forecast to reduce further in 2006 
as our operations continue to generate cash. The
management of debtors showed healthy improvement
in 2005 and the 31 December 2005 debtor position
was £1.84 million lower than the position at the
previous year end despite rising turnover levels.
We have introduced a segmental analysis for 2005
which separately shows the results of our Integrated
Services activities and our Security and Specialist
Services activities. The segmental analysis reflects the
reporting structures now established within the Group.
Our Integrated Services activities increased operating
profit before goodwill amortisation by 62.8% over
2004 on turnover which increased by 2.6% over
2004. 2004 had been a difficult year for our
Integrated Services activities because of the loss of
work at the Bluewater and Touchwood Shopping
centres and the completion of the reorganisation
exercises which were required to integrate the
acquisitions made in previous years. 2005’s budget
was, therefore, consciously set with low turnover
growth but with significant profit improvement and
we are delighted that this has been successfully
achieved. Turnover growth will increase in 2006 as a
Chief Executive’s Review
John R Foley Chief Executive
We have close working
relationships with our
customers which lead to 
high retention rates MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    7
All of our operations enjoyed a number of significant
contract wins in 2005
 
result of the significant number of new contracts secured in
the second half of 2005 and profit will grow accordingly.
Our Security and Specialist Services operations reported an
operating profit before goodwill amortisation of £5.3 million
on turnover of £68.9 million (2004: operating profit before
goodwill amortisation of £1.7 million on turnover of 
£30.3 million). The net operating margin before goodwill
amortisation increased from 5.6% in 2004 to 7.7% in 2005.
TASS and SSD remain the subject of earn out arrangements
which we anticipate will eventually result in £4.25 million 
of further payments to the vendors if the stretching profit
performance targets are achieved.
The Group entered 2005 with a £1.7 million loan stock
investment in Booth Industries Group PLC. £0.529 million 
of the loan stock was redeemed in March 2005 with a
related premium and we have been notified that a further
£0.5 million will be redeemed in March 2006.
Operational review
The major challenges which faced us at the start of 2005
concerned the management of the introduction of licensing
of all employed security officers throughout our security
operations and the continuing upgrading of our support
systems so that we can continue to improve the quality of
service delivery to our customers through the use of the
latest technology and equipment.
Licensing has been the dominant issue facing all
organisations which operate in the security marketplace.
We have three operations which employ a significant number
of officers (First Security, MacLellan Attlaw and MacLellan
International). All three operations have made great efforts
to be on top of the relevant training and vetting issues so
that we fully comply with the Security Industry Authority’s
requirements. We are confident that we will obtain Approved
Contractor Status at the earliest possible opportunity.
Our Integrated Services activities continued to make further
positive advances on the systems development front and
MacLellan International’s IT Steering Group was particularly
busy during the year. New business analytics software has
been successfully introduced which provides for both a
speedier and more detailed level of financial and operational
information to be available to our managers. The “Order
Point” System introduced in 2004 which raises orders within
a single, safe electronic catalogue portal has been rolled out
throughout the company. The MacLellan Audit Process
System has been successfully introduced to many of our
larger multi site contracts and the response from our
customers has been very positive.
Our Security operations further developed their control 
room capabilities and increased the scope of their services 
to provide a range of very specific value added services 
to complement their core manned guarding capabilities.
Growth
All of our operations enjoyed a number of significant
contract wins in 2005.
MacLellan International secured major new contracts with
Sainsbury’s, Somerfield, Superdrug, Southwark Council,
BAe Systems, BMI, Cushman Wakefield, Mellon Bank and
Prudential Property Investment Managers. MacLellan
International’s confirmed forward order book currently sits 
at approximately £470 million and over 90% of its 2006
turnover budget is already secured.
First Security has extended the range of its operations outside
the M25 and along the M4 corridor with contract wins at Sony
and Newbury Business Park as well as securing new work for
Reuters, Somerset House, CSFB and Societe Generale.
MacLellan Attlaw commenced new work with South West
Trains during 2005 and continues to develop its integrated
security offering into the retail sector with a combination of
a specialist training service capability, an electronic security
offering and a nationwide manned guarding capability.
MacLellan Attlaw is also a Specialist at events security and
has secured a major contract win at the new Wembley
Stadium where work is expected to commence late in 2006.
TASS continued to secure a number of significant contract
wins in the cradle maintenance and fall arrest markets in
which it operates and 90% of its turnover budget for 2006 is
already secured. SSD Window Cleaning won new contracts
during 2005 with Bruntwood Estates, Mainstay Housing
Corporation and ABN Amro.
Our employees
I would like, on behalf of the Board, to thank our
management and employees for their continuing
commitment and hard work.
In addition, the courage and willingness to help others of
many of our employees is also something which the Board
would like to recognise. Last summer was of course
dominated by the dreadful events of 7 July. Above and
beyond the call of duty is perhaps an over used and clichéd
phrase but it certainly applies in the case of our employees’
response to the Tavistock Square bombing where a number
of First Security’s officers and MacLellan International
employees were working at the BMA. In addition, many
MacLellan Attlaw security officers were working at rail
network locations. Throughout the City of London on that
day many of our employees were called upon in ways they
had never experienced before and, hopefully, will never
experience again. Their actions showed real courage and 
we are proud to have such strong characters in our team.
Challenges for 2006
I said last year that the biggest single challenge for 2005
was to deliver significant growth at the earnings per share
level through continuing organic growth and improved
operating performance. The same applies for 2006; once
again, management is looking forward to the challenge.

Directors, Officers and Advisers MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    9
The Directors present their report together with the audited financial statements of the Company and of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Activities
MacLellan Group plc is the holding company of a group which provides specialist facilities management, support and security services to retail, commercial, industrial, travel and public sector
clients in the United Kingdom and, through a branch, in Eire. The principal subsidiary undertakings are set out on page 37.
The Chairman’s statement on page 4 and the Chief Executive’s review on page 6 give a review of the results for the year, the Group’s present position, future prospects and strategy.
Results and dividends
On turnover for the year of £232,781,000 (2004: £190,165,000) the Group’s profit after interest but before goodwill, exceptional items and taxation amounted to £8,830,000
(2004: £6,731,000); there were no exceptional items in the year (2004: £2,471,000). The Group’s profit for the financial year amounted to £2,406,000 (2004: £30,000).
The new Financial Reporting Standard (FRS 21) requires dividends to be debited to the profit & loss account when they are paid or approved at an Annual General Meeting. Previously, the
Companies Act 1985 required that proposed dividends be reported in the profit & loss account. In applying this change in accounting practice, the previously reported figures for 2004 have
been restated. The retained profit for the financial year amounts to £1,392,000 (2004 restated: loss of £553,000).
The Directors recommend the payment of a dividend for the year of 1.25p per ordinary share and 0.4375p per preference share amounting in aggregate to £1,269,000 (2004: £1,014,000);
a resolution to declare a final dividend will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Directors
The Directors of the Company at the date of this report are shown on page 8. Further information on their interests in the share capital of the Company and their contractual arrangements
is given in the Remuneration Report on page 14.
The Directors retiring by rotation are A L R Morton and S R Shipley who, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
Share capital
Changes in the authorised and issued share capital of the Company are set out in note 16 to the financial statements.
Resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to renew for a maximum of fifteen months the authority for the Directors to allot ordinary shares and to exclude shareholders’
pre-emption rights in certain specified circumstances subject, in both cases, to the limits set out in the resolutions. Save for the allotment of shares to satisfy contractual obligations relating 
to additional consideration payable on acquisitions made during 2003 and 2004, the exercise of share options or any conversion of the convertible preference shares, the Directors have 
no present intention of making allotments pursuant to these proposed authorities.
In addition, the Directors are seeking a general authority for the Company to purchase its own shares up to a maximum of approximately 10% of the existing issued ordinary shares within the
parameters set out in the resolution and in accordance with Stock Exchange and other regulatory conditions. Any exercise of the authority for the Company to purchase its own shares would
be subject, under the Company’s articles of association, to the consent of the convertible preference shareholders. The Directors consider it important to have the flexibility of this authority for
future planning; however, there are no intentions to act on this authority in the immediate future.
Report of the Directors 10 MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005
Substantial shareholdings
At 14 March 2006, the Company had been notified of the following interests in holdings of shares in excess of 3% of the ordinary share capital which at that date comprised 99,803,624
shares of 5 pence each:
Name Percentage shareholding Number of shares
BriTel Fund Trustees Limited 10.2% 10,166,667
Axa S.A. and its group companies 10.1% 10,056,562
Fidelity International Limited and its direct and indirect subsidiaries 9.97% 9,945,914
Morley Fund Management Limited 6.1% 6,097,373
(a subsidiary of Aviva plc)
Seraffina Holdings Limited 6.0% 6,000,000
Canada Life Marketing Group 4.1% 4,098,333
F&C Institutional UK Smaller Companies Fund 3.1% 3,118,000
The convertible preference share capital comprising 5,000,000 shares of 10 pence each is registered in the name of National Westminster Bank Plc. As explained in note 16 to the financial
statements, these shares are regarded as equity.
So far as the Board is aware, there are no other holdings of 3% or more in the share capital of the Company which are required to be disclosed.
Creditor payment policy
The Group does not follow any code or standard on payment practice. It is the responsibility of each business segment in the Group to agree appropriate terms and conditions for its transactions
with suppliers; these range from standard written terms to individually negotiated contracts. Payments to suppliers should be made in accordance with those terms and conditions, provided that
the supplier has met its obligations under those terms and conditions. Group trade creditors at 31 December 2005 represented 32 days (2004: 41 days) of purchases. MacLellan Group plc is 
a holding company and has creditors only in respect of that activity.
Treasury
Policy
The Group’s treasury policy is to match the relevant financial instrument with the returns expected from the related investment. This policy enables the use of short-term funding for ongoing
operations and longer-term funding for significant capital investment and for significant acquisitions. Consequently, the Directors have negotiated access to overdraft and term loan facilities
with the Company’s bankers, as well as other asset financing arrangements.
Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s trade and transactions are carried out in sterling and carry no exchange risk. The Group’s foreign exchange risks arise principally as a result of the operations
carried out in Eire. The Group’s policy is to not hedge the translation exposure of the profits and balance sheets of the foreign business back into sterling; however, overseas acquisitions and
businesses would normally be financed with debt in the relevant currency of that business. These are not viewed as a significant area of risk by the Directors because of the relative size of
the business to the Group, but are continually monitored so that appropriate action can be taken.
Report of the Directors continued MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    11
Interest rate risk
The Directors seek to minimise the effect of changes in interest rates on the Group’s earnings by retaining the flexibility to adjust the mix of interest bearing financial instruments between
fixed and variable rate instruments.
Employees
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment made by persons with reduced mobility, bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and abilities of the applicant concerned.
In the event that an employee becomes disabled, every effort is made to ensure their continued employment and to arrange appropriate training. It is the policy of the Group that the
training, career development and promotion of a person with reduced mobility should, as far as practicable, be identical to that of a person who does not suffer from a disability. The Group
has continued its policy of regularly consulting and communicating with its employees through newsletters, briefing meetings, announcements on notice boards and distribution of the
annual report.
Donations
Charitable donations amounted to £11,540 (2004: £2,800). There were no political contributions in either year.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution concerning their re-appointment as auditors will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting.
By order of the Board
Stephen R Shipley
Secretary
15 March 2006
Report of the Directors continued 12 MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005
Corporate Governance
As the company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange, compliance with “the Code” is not mandatory . However, the Board is mindful of its
recommendations and believes in providing a framework for establishing good corporate governance and accountability; the following is a summary of procedures supporting this approach.
Board of Directors
The Board comprises three executive and three non-executive Directors one of whom is the Chairman. This composition and the operation of the Board is adequate to ensure a balance of
power and authority with the Company’s non-executive Directors representing an influential and independent element on the Board. The Board meets regularly during the year and has a
schedule of matters reserved for its approval. It is responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy and for authorising significant financial and legal transactions.
It reviews and approves the operational plans of the trading businesses and monitors progress towards achievement of those plans.
The Remuneration and Audit Committees comprise the non-executive Directors and have met at the appropriate times during the year; Mr Morton is chairman of both Committees. There is
no nomination committee as any new Board appointments are managed by the Board rather than delegated to a committee.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for ensuring that the remuneration packages of executive directors are appropriate to attract, motivate and retain the correct calibre of individuals.
The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of internal controls and reviews the interim results and annual financial statements. The Company’s Auditors attend meetings to discuss the
results and the annual audit, and are available to the Audit Committee throughout the year as and when required.
Directors’ remuneration
The Group’s policy on the remuneration of Directors and senior executives is given in the Remuneration Report on page 14.
Relations with shareholders
The Chief Executive and executive Directors hold regular meetings with major shareholders to discuss the Group’s strategy and financial performance.
Annual General Meeting
All Directors attend the Annual General Meeting and are available to answer questions put to them by shareholders.
Internal control
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The internal control system has been developed to meet the specific
needs of the Group and the particular business risks to which it is exposed. However, by its nature any system of internal control can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
During the year the Board has defined and maintained procedures as part of a continuous review of the Group’s internal controls. These procedures have been designed to assist in the
achievement of business objectives, to safeguard the Group’s assets against unauthorised use or disposition, to ensure compliance with regulations and to maintain proper accounting records
and reliable financial information for use within the business or for publication. Key procedures that have been established are: MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    13
• Control environment
There is an established Group organisation structure which clearly defines lines of responsibility and delegation of authority.
• Risk management
Operating company management has a clear responsibility for identifying risks facing the business and for putting in place procedures to mitigate and monitor these. Risks are assessed
during the business planning and annual budgeting processes which are monitored by management and the Board.
• Financial control procedures
The Group has a comprehensive system of financial reporting. The annual Group budget, which defines the structure, size and expenditure levels of the business, is presented to the Board
for approval. Monthly actual results are reported against budget and any significant variances are examined by management and remedial action taken. The Group has in place control
procedures including authorisation limits for transactions, procedures to ensure complete and accurate accounting, reliability of data processed and the control of assets.
• Monitoring processes
A number of processes are in place whereby control is monitored. These include the exercise of authority by the Board of Directors, the monthly reporting processes which include regular
senior management meetings, review of business issues and risks, financial results and working capital, contract status reviews, resource allocation and health and safety issues.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Remuneration Report
The Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises A L R Morton (Committee Chairman), A M Howarth and G W S Lockyer. By invitation, J R Foley (Chief Executive) assists the Committee in its
deliberations on remuneration appropriate for the Group.
Remuneration policy
The Committee is responsible for determining remuneration packages for each of the executive directors. The Group’s terms of employment for executive directors and senior management 
are designed to attract, retain and motivate an executive team with qualities appropriate for their responsibilities to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives and to position the executives’
interests in the Group alongside those of shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing shareholder value.
Executive remuneration
The principal components of executive remuneration are basic annual salary with benefits, annual bonus payments, share option incentives and pension contributions.
Basic salary
Salaries for executives are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are effective from 1 April in each year. This review ensures that basic salaries remain at appropriate levels for
the responsibilities involved. Benefits include private medical insurance and life assurance together with motor expense and permanent health insurance benefits where contractually entitled.
Discretionary annual bonus
Annual bonus payments are restricted to an appropriate percentage of basic salary for each executive and mainly take into account the trading performance and earnings per share
performance of the Group. The annual bonuses are set to incentivise executives to achieve predetermined targets.
Pension benefits
The Company contributes to the personal pension plan of one Director and operates an executive pension plan (money purchase) for another Director; there has been no change in the basis
of these plans during the year. No pension contributions are paid by the Company for any other Directors of the Company. In addition, the Group operates a number of pension plans to
ensure that all employees in the Group are able to join a scheme after an initial qualifying period; further details of these schemes are given in note 18 to the financial statements.
Share incentive schemes
Share options are used to encourage participants to identify with the interests of shareholders. The Company operates two schemes approved by the Inland Revenue and one scheme
established outside the Inland Revenue requirements. In addition, stand alone options were approved by shareholders in 1996 in respect of two executive Directors.
Options granted under these schemes have been at the mid-market closing share price on the business day prior to the date of grant. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten
years from the date of grant. Grants to individuals are phased over a number of years. At 31 December 2005 there were options over a total of 5,007,500 ordinary shares that remain capable
of being exercised in accordance with the rules of the schemes at prices ranging from 34.0 pence to 96.83 pence per share. MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    15
The MacLellan Sharesave Scheme 2001, a SAYE share option scheme, was approved by the Inland Revenue on 20 June 2001 and an offer to employees took place in July 2001 with 
savings contracts of three or five years’ duration; there have been no further offers to employees since that date. The price at which options may be granted under the scheme is not less 
than 80% of the mid-market price immediately prior to the offer date. At 31 December 2005 there were 30 participants in the scheme (2004: 77) with options to acquire a total of 207,485
(2004: 329,632) ordinary shares of 5p each at a price of 58p per share. During the year, 8 participants exercised options over 41,009 shares and the remaining options are exercisable on 
the completion of the five year savings contracts during 2006.
Options held by the Directors under these schemes are set out on page 17.
Service contracts
The Company’s present policy on the duration of Directors’ service contracts is as follows:
• executive Directors have rolling contracts terminable on no more than one year’s notice served by the Company except in the event of a change in control of the Company when the
required notice period is doubled and on six to twelve months written notice by the Director;
• non-executive Directors are appointed on fixed term contracts of two years duration and thereafter terminable on three months written notice by either party. The Chairman’s appointment 
is terminable at any time on six months written notice served by either party.
All Directors are appointed subject to the Articles of Association of the Company, which requires Directors to retire and to seek election at the first AGM following their appointment;
thereafter, one third (or the number nearest thereto) of the Board, being those who have been longest in office since last re-elected, must retire and offer themselves for re-election.
Non-executive Directors
The basic fees payable to non-executive Directors are set by the Board. Where a non-executive Director provides services to the Company which are outside the normal scope of the
directorship this may be remunerated separately.
Details of fees payable in respect of non-executive Directors are set out below.

Company law requires Directors to prepare a report and financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that the above requirements have been complied with in the preparation of the financial statements. The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group website, for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors acknowledge that information published on the Group website is accessible in many countries and that different
legal requirements may apply to the dissemination of information through the web.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 20 MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005
Independent Auditors’ Report
Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of MacLellan Group plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of MacLellan Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the Group
Profit and Loss Account, the Group and Company Balance Sheets, the Group Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Reconciliation of Movements in Group Shareholders’ Funds,
the Group Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you 
if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other information comprises the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Report of the Directors, the statement on Corporate Governance and the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    21
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2005 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

D. NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS
During the year the Group entered into finance lease arrangements in respect of assets with a total capital value of £12,000 (2004: £1,434,000). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, the Companies Act 1985 and in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.
The principal accounting policies and estimation techniques are summarised below. Financial reporting standards in respect of retirement benefits (FRS 17), post balance sheet events (FRS 21) and financial
instruments: disclosure and presentation (FRS 25) have been implemented where applicable and information on their effect has been given in the appropriate notes to the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements. The results of subsidiary undertakings and businesses acquired or
disposed of during the year are included from the date control is acquired or up to the date of disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisition, being the excess of consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired, is accounted for as follows:
l on acquisitions completed prior to 27 September 1998 goodwill was eliminated directly against reserves
l on acquisitions completed subsequent to 27 September 1998 goodwill is capitalised and then amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 10 goodwill previously eliminated against reserves will remain eliminated.
On the subsequent disposal or cessation of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal or cessation is calculated after charging the gross amount of any related goodwill previously taken 
to reserves.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, MacLellan Group plc has taken advantage of the exemption not to include a company profit and loss account.
Turnover
Turnover, which excludes value added tax and sales between Group undertakings, represents the invoiced value of services rendered and goods supplied and is recognised according to the value of work
done and invoiced. Whilst a number of contracts are secured for periods in excess of one year, invoicing arrangements are such that revenue is recognised as services are provided.
Intangible fixed assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed subsequent to 27 September 1998 is capitalised and amortised over 20 years being the period over which the Directors estimate that the values of the
businesses acquired are expected to exceed the values of the underlying assets.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are shown at cost, being purchase cost together with any incidental costs of acquisition, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis at rates
appropriate to the expected useful economic lives and estimated residual values of the assets within the following ranges:
Freehold land not depreciated
Freehold buildings 2% per annum
Leasehold land and buildings over the lesser of the period of the lease or 50 years
Plant, equipment and office fixtures 8 - 50% per annum
Motor vehicles 25 - 33% per annum
Fixed asset investments
Investments are held at cost unless, in the opinion of the Directors, any diminution in value is believed to be permanent. Income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
Stocks

Trade debtors
Trade debtors are carried at their estimated realisable value after providing for debts where collection is doubtful or where there are exceptional circumstances.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided for in full on all timing differences and is calculated, without applying discount factors, at the average tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are
expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that, in the view of the Directors, there are expected to be appropriate taxable profits within the foreseeable future from which the
asset can be deducted.
Leases
Assets obtained under finance lease contracts are included as tangible fixed assets at their capital value and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The corresponding liability, net of finance 
charges, is recorded as a creditor and the finance element of the liability is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the contract. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to 
the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Pensions
Costs in respect of pension contributions to money purchase schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred. Pension costs of the MacLellan 2000 Scheme
(final salary) are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the expected average working lives of scheme members in accordance with the recommendations of
qualified actuaries.
Foreign exchange
The trading results of overseas businesses are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling through the relevant period. The net assets of overseas businesses are expressed in sterling at the
rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Differences on exchange arising from the opening net assets of overseas businesses are taken to reserves. Exchange differences arising in the normal
course of trading and on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the profit and loss account. 30 MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005

7. DIVIDENDS
2005 2004 
£000 £000
Ordinary shares: 1.0 pence per 5 pence share (2004: 0.75 pence) 996 570
Convertible preference shares: 0.35 pence per 10 pence share (2004: 0.2625 pence) 18 13
1,014 583
The new Financial Reporting Standard (FRS 21) requires dividends to be debited to the profit and loss account when they are paid or approved at an Annual General Meeting. Previously, the Companies 
Act 1985 required that proposed dividends be reported in the profit and loss account. In applying this change in accounting practice, the previously reported figures for 2004 have been restated with the
effect that shareholders’ funds at 31 December 2004 have been increased by £1,014,000 (2003: £583,000).
No interim dividend has been declared. In 2004 there was no interim dividend; the final dividends of 1.0 pence per ordinary share and 0.35 pence per convertible preference share were approved at 
the Annual General Meeting held on 5 May 2005 and paid on 4 July 2005 (2004: final dividends of 0.75 pence per ordinary share and 0.2625 pence per convertible preference share were approved 
at the Annual General Meeting held on 6 May 2004 and paid on 1 July 2004).
8. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated on the following earnings and weighted average number of shares in issue:
2005 2004
Number of Number of
Earnings shares Earnings shares
£000 ‘000 £000 ‘000
Basic EPS: Earnings available to equity shareholders 2,406 101,437 30 85,969
Effect of dilutive securities:
Options – 989 – 857
Diluted EPS: Adjusted earnings 2,406 102,426 30 86,826
Under FRS 25, equity shareholders now includes both ordinary shareholders and convertible preference shareholders; the number of ordinary shares is the aggregate of ordinary shares in issue and the
ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of the convertible preference shares. It is intended that part of the earnout consideration will be settled in shares which, therefore, are potentially
dilutive; however these are not included above as, at the balance sheet date, no earnout settlements in shares were certain.
The Directors consider that a more appropriate measure of the performance of the Group excludes, principally, the effect of goodwill which is a non-cash item. This measure of the underlying earnings per
share has been calculated on the above profit available to equity shareholders adjusted for restructuring and non-recurring items, goodwill amortisation and related taxation. The calculations of earnings
per share can be reconciled as follows:

Adjustment to provisional fair values
The Directors have reviewed the provisional fair values of the net assets acquired with First Security Group Limited and TASS (Europe) Limited and consider that no adjustment is necessary to the 
provisional values established at acquisition.
Additionally, the Directors have reviewed the performance targets required for earnout consideration to become payable in respect of businesses acquired in 2003 and 2004. As a result of this review, 
the earnout liabilities of the Group have been reduced by £0.4 million.
The total liability for earn out consideration in respect of Tasker (U.K.) Limited and TASS (Europe) Limited is included in these financial statements at £4.25 million of which the Directors estimate that 
a total of £2.125 million will be satisfied in shares to be issued.

Ordinary shares to be issued
Under the terms of the agreements for the acquisition of Tasker (U.K.) Limited and of TASS (Europe) Limited, further consideration is payable dependent upon the performance of the businesses. 
This further consideration may be satisfied by cash and/or the issue of shares. The Directors have reassessed the consideration payable and estimate that £2.125 million (2004: £2.375 million) of that
consideration will be satisfied in shares and £2.125 million in cash (included in other creditors).
Convertible preference shares
The holder of the convertible preference shares is entitled, pari passu with the holders of ordinary shares, to share in dividends paid by the Company. In the event of a winding up or other return of capital
by the Company, the surplus assets shall be applied first in paying to the holder of the convertible preference shares an amount equal to the issue price of the shares; the balance shall be divided amongst
the holders of ordinary shares.
On the basis of their entitlement to dividends and other rights, these shares are regarded as equity shares under FRS 25 and accordingly the analysis shown in previous years of equity and non-equity
shareholders’ funds is no longer applicable.
The convertible preference shares are convertible by the shareholder at any time on the basis of 35 ordinary shares of 5 pence for every 100 convertible preference shares held. Upon conversion, the
ordinary shares thereby issued shall rank pari passu in all respects and form one class with the existing ordinary shares. The holder is eligible to vote on any resolution which varies the rights of the
convertible preference shares. MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    41

18. PENSIONS
The MacLellan Group originally set up three pension schemes during 2000 for various categories of employee. Each of these schemes had been written under trust and approved under the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1998.
During 2004, a radical and strategic review of the pension scheme arrangements was carried out. The aim of the review was to enable the Group to consolidate and reduce the number of pension
schemes it administered and to provide employees with:
l a national firm of independent financial advisers to work with employees across the UK
l cost effective pension solutions
l easy and clear information to aid membership into a pension scheme with structured individual advice.
Consequently, the MacLellan Personal Pension Plan was introduced for all categories of employee within the Integrated Services business (subject to eligibility). This defined contribution plan is provided
through Scottish Widows and ensures compliance with Stakeholder Pension Legislation. In addition, the Group contributes to stand alone money purchase schemes of certain senior employees.

18. PENSIONS – continued
The MacLellan Group 2000 Retirement Benefits Scheme, set up in July 2000, is a funded final salary (defined benefit) scheme and offers guaranteed pension benefits based upon salary and service, and
broadly matches the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme. The scheme is offered only to employees joining the company who are entitled by legislation to receive benefits on this basis. The scheme
continues to operate alongside the MacLellan Personal Pension Plan.
Costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred and amounted to £628,000 (2004: £595,000) in respect of defined contribution schemes and £78,000 
(2004: £77,000) in respect of the defined benefit scheme. At 31 December 2005 there were outstanding contributions of £64,000 (2004: £68,000).
Financial Reporting Standard 17
Under the provisions of FRS 17, the Group has accounted for pensions using the following information concerning the MacLellan 2000 defined benefit scheme. At 31 December 2005 the scheme had
thirty five active members (2004: thirty four) and its assets and liabilities are not material in the context of the Group. However, the information below has been provided for use by readers of the financial
statements.
The contribution levels are determined by an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method. The main assumptions used by the actuary for FRS 17 purposes at 31 December were 
as follows:
2005 2004
Rate of inflation 2.8% 3.0%
Rate of salary increases 3.8% 4.0%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.8% 3.0%
Revaluation of deferred pensions 2.8% 3.0%
Discount rate 4.7% 5.25%
The scheme assets are invested in Scottish Life insurance policies which had a market value at 31 December 2005 of £387,000 (2004: £266,000). The summary of scheme funds, measured in accordance
with the requirements of FRS 17, at 31 December 2005 were as follows:
2005 2004
£000 £000
Total market value of assets 387 266
Present value of scheme liabilities (423) (272)
Deficit in scheme (36) (6)
Related deferred tax liability 11 –
Net scheme liability (25) (6)
As the impact of these amounts are not material in the context of the Group, no prior year adjustment has been made and the above net scheme liability has been included in creditors and the cost has
been included in other pension costs.
19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A summary of the Group’s treasury policy is given in the Report of the Directors.
As part of the Group’s policy to manage interest rate risks, the Group has entered into an interest rate cap in respect of approximately £5 million of its term loan liability limiting interest payable to 5.5%
plus the margin. As permitted by FRS 13, short term debtors and creditors have not been included in this note, unless otherwise stated. Except where noted, the Directors are of the opinion that the fair
values of financial assets and financial liabilities are not materially different from their book values. Financial liabilities and financial assets are denominated in sterling except for Euro denominated 
accounts of £675,000 (2004: overdraft of £28,000) translated at the year end rate. 44 MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005

The variable rate financial instruments attract interest charges based upon the clearing banks’ or Euribor base rates. Fixed rate financial liabilities consist of finance leases with interest based on market 
rates at their inception.
At 31 December 2005 the Group had undrawn but committed borrowing facilities repayable within one year of £14,469,000 (2004: £13,344,000). Financial liabilities also include £2.125 million of

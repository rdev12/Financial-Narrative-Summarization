T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 1
Over the past decade T esco has transformed 
itself into a diverse international business – 
and by following our consistent strategy we 
are well positioned for long-term growth.
Thailand – and for the first time we 
now have more Clubcard holders 
internationally than in the UK. 
It has been another significant year 
for our work on the environment and 
within local communities. As we grow, 
our customers increasingly look to 
Tesco to take the lead in these areas 
– and we are. 
In January, we opened the world’s 
first zero-carbon store at Ramsey in 
Cambridgeshire – the latest step in 
our journey to reduce the carbon 
footprint of our business. Over the 
past year we have made significant 
progress towards our long-term goals 
by reducing our emissions by 7.8% 
on our baseline 2006/7 store and 
distribution portfolio.
This year we donated over £60m to 
charities – once again exceeding our 
target to give the equivalent of 1% 
of our profits to good causes. 
These good results are testament 
to the hard work of our people. The 
Tesco team is now 472,000 strong – 
and we remain united by our goal to 
improve the shopping trip for our 
customers. I would like to thank all 
our people for their hard work which 
I know will continue in the year ahead.
David Reid
Chairman
I am pleased to report that 
the Tesco team has once again 
delivered a good set of results 
– guided by experienced 
management who have steered 
the business through recessions 
before. As markets around the 
world are emerging from this 
recession each part of our business 
is well positioned to pursue our 
strategy for growth.
We have continued to grow sales, 
profits and market share over the 
past year. We’ve also significantly 
strengthened our balance sheet.
Our acquisition in South Korea 
is performing well and delivering 
excellent results, we’ve opened 
our first three Tesco Lifespace 
shopping malls in China and we 
have made good progress building 
the infrastructure and developing 
new products for Tesco Bank.
I am also pleased to announce that we 
again increased our dividend – for the 
26th consecutive year. This consistent 
track record of delivering dividend 
growth for shareholders is unrivalled 
in the FTSE 100.
The strong Group results over the last 
year have been achieved through a 
constant focus on what matters most 
to customers in challenging times 
around the world. A good example 
of this has been our renewed focus 
on rewarding loyalty – at home and 
abroad – which has been a great 
success with customers.
In the UK, we increased our Clubcard 
investment with Double Points – 
giving customers even greater reward 
for their loyalty. 
Internationally, we launched Clubcard 
in three more countries during the 
year – in Poland, Slovakia and  2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010

business by 2050; to reduce the 
carbon impact of the products in our 
supply chain by 30% by 2020; and to 
help our customers halve their own 
carbon footprint by 2020. And we’re 
making good progress already.
We’re delivering for all stakeholders: 
an improved shopping trip for 
customers; training and good careers 
for our staff; growth and innovation 
with our suppliers; in local communities 
we’re supporting causes that matter 
to customers; and we’re delivering 
good returns to shareholders.
Looking forward
The outlook for shareholder returns 
is encouraging: we have a strong 
core UK business growing well; our 
international businesses offer significant 
upside from recovery in the short 
term and maturity in the longer term; 
our balance sheet is strengthening; 
and we’re creating value through 
good property development.
Our positions in high-growth 
international economies and non-food 
meant we were always likely to face 
strong headwinds during the recession 
but it will be these parts of our business 
which will grow fastest in the recovery 
and beyond.
I am confident that with the prospect 
of an improving global economy and 
recent investments in acquisitions and 
new selling space making a greater 
contribution going forward, returns 
will improve significantly – starting 
this year.
Sir Terry Leahy
Chief Executive
Each element of our strategy – UK, 
International, Non-food, Retailing 
Services and Community – is stronger 
now than this time last year. 
In International, our businesses have 
made good progress in a challenging 
global economic environment. Our 
strategy is working – we’ve grown 
sales, profits and market shares and 
we’ve continued to invest in the drivers 
of future growth. Our performance 
in Asia was particularly pleasing, 
our business in Europe held up 
well despite the obvious economic 
challenges and I believe the start-up 
losses in our US business will now 
begin to reduce as Fresh & Easy 
establishes itself.
Our UK business had a good year. 
By remaining focused on helping 
customers spend less and encouraging 
loyalty with an increased investment 
in Clubcard, our UK business has 
delivered a solid performance. In our 
core grocery operations, we’re growing 
ahead of the industry as a whole and 
we have been less affected by falling 
inflation than the market at large.
In Non-food we have made good 
progress. In the UK we achieved a 
particularly strong performance in 
electricals, entertainment and toys. 
Our clothing range is becoming an 
international success, led by our F&F 
range which is growing rapidly in our 
European markets and this year was 
launched in four countries in Asia. 
Our Retailing Services have grown 
sales and profits once again. We’ve 
also been building the platforms for 
future growth, particularly in Tesco 
Bank, which is making good progress 
in developing its own systems and 
people capabilities as well as working 
on a broader product range as it 
moves towards becoming a full-
service retail bank.
In the same way that we’ve stuck 
to our strategy in other parts of 
the business, we’ve also remained 
committed to our work on Community 
and the environment. In October, we 
set ourselves three challenging long-
term targets: to become a zero-carbon 
This year’s results show another 
solid performance from across 
the Group. By staying focused 
on doing the right thing for 
customers we have weathered 
the economic storm well. And by 
remaining committed to our long-
term strategy we are emerging 
from recession stronger – with 
good building blocks in place 
for future growth. Our business

Business Review
This Business Review analyses the 
performance of the Tesco Group 
in the financial year ended 
27 February 2010. It also explains 
other aspects of the Group’s 
markets, results and operations, 
including strategy and risk 
management.
The Directors present their Annual 
Report to shareholders on the affairs 
of the Group and Company, together 
with the audited financial statements 
of the Company for the 52 weeks 
ended 27 February 2010.
Long-term strategy
Tesco has a well-established and 
consistent strategy for growth. 
The rationale for the strategy is 
to broaden the scope of the business 
to enable it to deliver strong, 
sustainable long-term growth by 
following customers into large 
expanding markets at home – such 
as financial services, non-food 
and telecoms – and new markets 
abroad, initially in Central Europe 
and Asia and more recently in the 
United States. 
The strategy has five elements, 
reflecting our four established areas 
of focus plus Tesco’s commitments 
on community and the environment:
•  to be a successful international 
retailer;
•  to grow the core UK business;
•  to be as strong in non-food as 
in food;
•  to develop retailing services; and
•  to put community at the heart of 
what we do.
The strategy to diversify the 
business has been the foundation 
of Tesco’s growth in recent years. 
It was laid down in 1997, with the 
fifth element – Community – being 
added in 2007. Many of the new 
businesses that have been created 
and developed over the last 13 years 
as part of this strategy are now 
of significant scale and highly 
profitable – in fact we are now 
market leader in many of our 
markets outside the UK. In 1997 our 
International business generated 
1.8% of the Group’s profits and we 
had only just entered the Retailing 
Services markets; today these parts 
of our business represent 22% and 
16% of profits respectively.
Importantly, the strategy has 
given the business momentum to 
grow well through the economic 
downturn. By continuing to invest 
through the recession – in the 
customer offer, in infrastructure and 
in our people – we are now well 
placed to grow faster and improve 
shareholder returns as the global 
economic environment improves. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010

assets and local management teams 
and strengthens our confidence in our 
international strategy and long-term 
growth prospects. 
Asia
We have delivered a strong 
performance in Asia despite 
challenging economic conditions in 
the region. We have grown sales and 
profits well – driven by new space 
and the excellent performance of the 
stores acquired in South Korea in 
2008, which are now profitable. As 
economies generally in Asia start to 
recover we are seeing improving sales 
trends in all our businesses except 
Japan, where economic conditions 
remain subdued, with overall like-for-
like sales for Asia turning positive in 
the fourth quarter. Profits in Asia grew 
by 24% with margins strengthening 
significantly in the second half (6.1% 
compared to 4.3% in the first half). 
In International we have delivered 
a resilient performance in the 
face of challenging economic 
headwinds. Our businesses have 
made good progress – delivering 
for customers today and at the 
same time investing in the drivers 
of future growth. Our strategy is 
working – and we ended this year 
stronger than we started it.
Each of our businesses has adapted 
itself to the demands of its local market 
– with strong local management 
teams finding ways to lower costs 
and deliver great value for customers. 
Increasingly our international 
businesses are also utilising the scale 
and skill of the Tesco Group – with 
more international sourcing, Discount 
Brands now in seven markets, F&F 
clothing now in ten countries, Clubcard 
introduced in seven countries with 
more Clubcard holders internationally 
than in the UK – and the Tesco 
Operating Model sharing our global 
best practice to the benefit of all 
our businesses.
After a very tough first half of the year 
we are now seeing encouraging sales 
trends across almost all our markets; 
we saw strong improvements in like-
for-like sales in the fourth quarter 
compared to the third. 
With clear signs that our international 
markets are starting to recover we are 
planning to resume a faster pace of 
new space opening in the coming 
year. In 2009/10 we opened 5.1m sq ft 
of new space and in 2010/11 we will 
open 8.5m sq ft in addition to nine 
shopping malls in China. The 
performance of our International 
businesses through this severe 
recession has provided reassurance 
Our Asian markets offer a significant 
long-term opportunity. We have 
continued to invest through the 
downturn to ensure that we will be 
in an even stronger position as the 
economies recover. This year we 
opened 3.0m sq ft of new space 
across the region – an increase of 
more than 10% – and we plan to 
open 4.9m sq ft next year (excluding 
shopping malls). We have also 
continued to make good progress 
towards developing a strong brand in 
our most developed Asian markets 
with further expansion of Clubcard 
and our Retailing Services businesses.
The size and scale of China provides 
unique challenges for a retailer but also 
offers a huge opportunity for a business 
prepared to show flexibility and vision. 
Our strategy is to expand into less 
developed second and third tier cities 
by opening hypermarkets in leading 
shopping malls. We’ve found it hard to 
find locations with the right facilities in 
some cities – giving us an opportunity 
to develop our own malls, to ensure they 
are the right size, location and design 
to meet the needs of the new 
Chinese consumer.
During the year we opened our first 
three Tesco Lifespace shopping malls 
in Fushun (pictured), Qingdao and 
Qinhuangdao and we will open nine 
more this year. Each mall comprises 
approximately 500,000 sq ft of retail 
space over five floors and is a one-stop  12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010

Throughout the year we opened 
63 new stores in South Korea, bringing 
our total number of stores to 305
South Korea
Homeplus in South Korea delivered 
another very good performance this 
year with total sales growth of 33% 
(including 3% on a like-for-like basis) 
and profits up more than 50%. The 
integration of the former Homever 
stores has been completed successfully, 
ahead of plan, with the stores now 
trading profitably with double-digit 
like-for-like sales growth in the fourth 
quarter. South Korea also opened 63 
new stores in the year. The acquisition 
in 2008 has helped Homeplus grow 
its market share and close the gap 
with the market leader. We opened 
our first franchise store in February 
2010 with more scheduled to open 
in this financial year. South Korea is 
our largest international business 
with sales of £4.5bn and profits of 
almost £300m. 
Thailand
Tesco Lotus in Thailand has delivered 
a good performance – despite a 
background of continued political 
uncertainty – with double-digit 
profit growth on a constant exchange 
rate basis. A strong store opening 
programme has helped drive our sales 
growth this year in a market in which 
we remain the clear market leader. 
Strong productivity gains have enabled 
us to make significant investments in 
lowering prices for customers whilst 
still delivering good margins and 
positive cash flow. The launch of 
Clubcard in August 2009 marked a 
new stage in the development of our 
business and take-up from customers 
has been excellent, with four million 
customers signed up so far.
China
In China, we are laying the 
foundations for long-term growth, 
with further investments in new 
stores, supply chain infrastructure 
and management. We have focused 
on three regions – each with its own 
management team – and with a focus 
on expansion into second and third 
tier cities. We opened 17 hypermarkets 
in the year, including in our first 
three Lifespace shopping centre 
developments in Fushun, Qingdao 
and Qinhuangdao, with average tenant 
occupancy over 80% at opening. 
We plan to open 23 hypermarkets in 
2010/11 of which nine will be in new 
Lifespace malls. The mall development 
programme will be funded in part 
through joint ventures with third-party 
investors. The first such joint venture 
– incorporating three malls – was 
established in November 2009 with a 
syndicate of leading Asian investors.
Malaysia
Our business in Malaysia made good 
progress with sales growing 9% this 
year – increasing our market share. 
We continue to invest in Clubcard with 
more than one million customers 
signed up and with a dunnhumby 
team working with us locally to 
provide insight on pricing, range and 
promotions. We grew our space by 
11% this year but with the economy 
starting to show signs of recovery 
we plan to step this up to 27% growth 
in 2010/11.
Japan
In our 2008/9 Annual Report, we 
stated that with the challenging 
market conditions in Japan, we 
had only limited headroom on the 
carrying value of our Japan assets. 
Given the further deterioration in the 
retail market, it became appropriate 
to make impairments against the 
goodwill arising on the acquisition 
we made to enter the market in 2003, 
resulting in a £131m charge to the 
income statement (£82m in the first 
half and £49m in the second half).
Our team in Japan continues to 
make good progress in developing 
the business. Our new convenience 
format is receiving good feedback 
from customers who like the focus on 
fresh food and new features helping 
us to differentiate our offer, such as 
the in-store bakery, an extensive wine 
range and our first 400 own-label 
products – which after only a few 
months already account for 10% 
of sales.
India 
Our early plans in India are progressing 
well. Our local management team is 
helping our franchise partner, Trent, 
to develop its Star Bazaar hypermarket 
operation which is currently achieving 
like-for-like sales of c.40% and buys 
more than 70% of its products from 
Tesco’s wholesale business. Plans for 
our cash and carry business are also 
on track with our first store expected 
to open towards the end of this year.

causing a slow-down in customer 
expenditure. Sales growth varied 
across the region with a good 
contribution from new space helping 
sales grow in Poland and Turkey and 
stay stable in the Czech Republic and 
Hungary. Significant price deflation 
and cross-border shopping driven by 
rapid movements in exchange rates 
resulted in sales declining in Slovakia 
and Ireland. Overall, however, the 
sales trends are now improving; each 
of our European businesses showed 
an improvement in like-for-like sales 
growth in the fourth quarter. 
We have made market share gains 
across our Central European markets 
by reducing costs and lowering prices 
for customers and by continuing to 
invest in new space. Profitability in the 
region as a whole declined slightly 
compared with last year but was 
resilient given the severity of recession. 
We are continuing to invest in the 
region, opening 1.8m sq ft of new 
space during the year – less than 
originally expected, primarily as a 
result of the economic environment. 
With the outlook improving we will 
be stepping up the rate of opening 
with a plan to add 3.1m sq ft of new 
space across the region in 2010/11.
Republic of Ireland
In Ireland we have made substantial 
changes to our business, which was 
facing the dual challenge of a severe 
recession and cross-border trading. By 
integrating more of our international 
brand buying with our UK business we 
have been able to reduce the prices 
of 12,500 products by an average 
of around 20%. 
Customers are responding 
enthusiastically to our improved 
pricing and range; significant uplifts 
in volumes have now offset the impact 
of lower prices, resulting in positive 
like-for-like sales growth in the last 
few weeks of the year and a growing 
market share. These changes, 
combined with a substantial cost 
reduction programme, have enabled 
Tesco Ireland to deliver a steady 
financial performance despite the 
economic headwinds and significant 
self-imposed price deflation. The 
cost of the exceptional restructuring 
activities was £33m in total for 
the year.
Hungary
Our business in Hungary continues 
to perform well – with sales levels 
being maintained despite a very weak 
economy in which unemployment 
levels increased by more than 25% 
and consumers were hit with a 5% 
increase in sales tax. We are continuing 
to execute our strategy of investing 
in the shopping trip for customers, 
helping our overall market share to 
grow again in the last year, further 
consolidating our market leadership. 
Poland
In Poland, we have had another good 
year with strong growth in sales and 
profits on a constant exchange rate 
basis. A good performance from the 
converted Leader Price stores, the 
popularity of our Discount Brands – 
now in one in three baskets – and 
our clothing range, which achieved 
like-for-like sales growth of more than 
20%, have helped our business 
maintain positive ex-petrol like-for-
like sales growth overall. The launch 
of Clubcard in August 2009 has been 
very well received, with 1.8 million 
customers signing up so far. 
Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic our strong 
new store opening programme has 
helped us maintain sales at levels 
similar to last year and improve our 
share of a market affected by high 
unemployment and price deflation. 
Our Express and 10,000 sq ft format 
stores continue to do well with 
positive like-for-like sales growth, 
but as in most markets, growth in 
the larger stores remains subdued as 
customers curtail their spending on 
non-food in the current environment. 
The outstanding category in non-
food has been clothing with double-
digit sales growth. Our flagship My 
Narodni department store in Prague 
was reopened after a major refit 
project and we are pleased with the 
results to date. 
The first T esco 
outside the UK 
opened just 15 years 
ago – in Hungary With growing sales and improvements 
in productivity, waste and distribution 
costs, store economics are improving 
steadily. Overall trading losses were in 
line with guidance provided last year 
and reflect the fact that Fresh & Easy 
has been built with the infrastructure 
to support hundreds of stores. 
We expect to open new stores at a 
rate of around one per week this year 
with a focus on areas where the local 
economy has been less severely hit 
and where we are seeing substantially 
stronger sales performance. One of 
the benefits of the downturn is a 
slightly softer property market; we 
are now able to buy more freehold 
properties and the overall cost of 
building a store has fallen by 
approximately 20%. A combination 
of new space and organic sales 
growth means that sales growth this 
year will be more than 50%.
Although we do not expect losses to 
be much lower in 2010/11 we believe 
they have now peaked.

Slovakia
In Slovakia, the overall retail market 
has been very challenging with rising 
unemployment and sharp falls in 
industrial output. Cross-border 
shopping remained significant for 
much of the first half but abated in 
the second half after we reduced 
our prices within Slovakia to bring 
them more closely into line with 
neighbouring countries. Like-for-like 
sales growth is recovering strongly; 
from negative double digit for the 
first half to positive growth in the final 
few weeks of the year. 
A good store opening programme 
combined with investments in the 
shopping trip and customer loyalty – 
with Clubcard launching in Slovakia 
in September 2009 – have helped us 
extend our market-leading position 
further during the year. We have 
recently refitted and rebranded one of 
our large hypermarkets in Bratislava 
as an ‘Extra’ adding new departments 
such as pharmacy, photo processing, 
opticians and phone shop. This is the 
first of its type in Central Europe.
Turkey
In Turkey, whilst we slowed our rate 
of new store growth, it remained 
strong enough to offset the like-for-
like sales decline, helping us to grow 
overall sales during the year. With 
the economy showing early signs of 
recovery we are planning to resume 
a faster rate of expansion this year. 
Turkey remains an important 
strategic long-term opportunity for 
us as a large, growing and relatively 
underdeveloped retail market.
United States
In the United States, Fresh & Easy has 
been making good progress, despite 
prolonged weakness in the California, 
Nevada and Arizona economies. 
Customers are enthusiastic about 
our range, particularly the fresh food 
prepared in the Fresh & Easy kitchen, 
the store environment and the 
friendly service. As with any of our 
new businesses, we are adapting and 
improving our offer in response to 
customer feedback. During the year 
we’ve broadened the range in some 
key categories – like cereals and pet 
food – and added larger pack sizes 
for families. We have also introduced 
a range of lower-priced house brands 
to help families on a budget.
With the improvements to our range 
implemented and with the number 
of stores growing (145 stores by end 
of 2009/10), we launched media 
campaigns – in September 2009 and 
January 2010 – focusing on how 
Fresh & Easy can offer both high 
quality and low prices. A combination 
of increased customer awareness and 
the improvements we have made in-
store helped to drive stronger positive 
like-for-like sales growth in the second 
half of the year.  16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010

Clubcard –
15 years of loyalty
Clubcard is our unique way of saying thank you 
to our customers for shopping with us. Launched 
in 1995, Clubcard now has 15 million active 
members in the UK. Clubcard not only rewards 
our customers for their loyalty, but it also provides 
us with valuable insight into changing shopping 
patterns. By monitoring this data and spotting 
trends early we’re able to respond quickly and 
ensure that we’re always providing customers 
with what they want, when and where they want it.
This year Clubcard became even more rewarding. 
By increasing our investment with Double Points, 
customers earned £550m in total in vouchers. 
Double Points has encouraged more customers 
to sign up, a Clubcard is now used with a higher 
proportion of transactions than before and 18% 
more UK households are redeeming vouchers 
than a year ago.
The knowledge and expertise of operating 
Clubcard – combined with insight and analysis 
from dunnhumby – is now being adopted across 
our international businesses. We now have 
Clubcard in seven of our international markets 
– in fact we now have more Clubcard holders 
overseas than in the UK.

Sustainable 
profitable growth
* Based on our dotcom picking availability measure.
Our UK business delivered a solid 
performance in competitive 
market conditions. We are 
growing faster than the industry 
as a whole and we have achieved 
this by remaining focused – as 
always – on customers. 
Our strategy of earning their loyalty 
by helping them to spend less – with 
low prices and affordable new products 
such as the Discount Brands – deflated 
sales growth initially but it was the 
right thing to do for customers. By 
encouraging and rewarding loyalty – 
through an increased investment 
in Clubcard – we have maintained 
steadier sales growth during the year 
than the industry as a whole, which 
has seen a significant slowdown with 
the steep decline in inflation.
Excluding petrol and adjusting for 
VAT, like-for-like sales were 3.7% in 
the first half and 2.7% in the second 
half, driven by a strong volume 
performance. Achieving our target of 
opening 2m sq ft of new space during 
the year ensured that sales from new 
space made a good contribution to 
total sales growth, which was 6.5% 
for the first half and 5.7% for the 
second half (excluding petrol and 
adjusted for VAT). 
Delivering for customers through 
recession is not just about lowering 
prices and offering great promotions; 
it’s about delivering all elements of 
the shopping trip. Consequently, we 
have continued to invest in availability, 
service, range and quality with 
pleasing results:
Availability
Availability has improved again this 
year as a result of a number of 
initiatives to improve stock 
management including more 
efficient ordering systems, a greater 
focus on clearing promotional and 
discontinued lines, better in-store 
monitoring processes and storing 
stock on the top of shelves on the 
shop floor rather than in the 
warehouse. The results have not 
only increased availability based on 
our dotcom picking measure and 
reduced evening gaps in fresh food 
by 18%, but the resulting reduction 
in stock across our store network has 
made a significant contribution to our 
improved working capital position.
Service
Service remains a key differentiator. 
Our one-in-front initiative – where if 
there is more than one customer 
queuing at a single checkout we open 
another – and increased investment 
in self-service checkouts, which now 
account for a quarter of all transactions, 
continue to keep us ahead of the 
industry on customer measures of 
checkout service. We trained more 
than 200,000 staff to help them 
respond better to customer needs and 
our ‘Every Comment Helps’ initiative, 
which encourages customers to give 
instant feedback via text or email, has 
given us the benefit of 60,000 
customer comments to help us 
improve our offer and service. 
Range
Tesco’s diverse and adaptable range 
allows us to offer a wide choice for 
every customer whatever their 
budget. Through the recession we 
have helped customers with lower-
priced ranges such as Discount 
Brands and Market Value and we 
have also offered them affordable 
treats such as the Finest Restaurant 
Collection ready meals, which have 
been very popular. We continue to 
innovate our range with over 2,600 
new or improved own-label food lines 
launched this year. As the economy 
starts to emerge from recession we 
are seeing customers buy more from 
our Finest range, which returned to 
positive like-for-like sales growth in 
the year.

At Tesco we’re constantly striving to 
make things better, simpler and cheaper. 
That’s why we’ve launched three 
innovative and popular iPhone apps. 
Customers no longer have to worry 
about forgetting their Clubcard as 
our latest app enables them to scan 
their Clubcard on their iPhone. 
This app is proving extremely popular 
with customers with over 200,000 
downloads in the first three weeks 
and there will soon be versions for 
other smartphones too.
Store Finder app enables customers to 
find their nearest stores and then locate 
products (complete with prices) within 
the store – to the exact aisle. 
Our wine app allows customers to take 
a photo of a wine they like and uses 
image recognition software to identify 
iPhone apps – making life easier 
for customers
the wine, providing full product 
information and allowing customers 
to order from their phone.
Coming soon is another tesco.com 
app which will enable customers to do 
their tesco.com grocery ordering from 
their phone.

Quality
Quality – particularly in fresh food – 
remains important to customers even 
in tough times and as we emerge 
from recession this will become even 
more important. That’s why we have 
been investing in our fresh food offer 
with a wide-ranging change 
programme. Improved technical 
standards, additional specialist staff 
training, closer relationships with our 
suppliers and significant changes to 
the way we merchandise some key 
products are helping us deliver a 
stronger range and better shopping 
experience for customers. These and 
other initiatives helped Tesco win the 
‘Fresh Produce Retailer of the Year’ 
Award in 2009.
Step Change
Our UK Step Change programme 
is in its thirteenth year and continues 
to go from strength to strength. 
This year we met our £550m savings 
target. Step Change is not just about 
generating savings – each project must 
be ‘better’ for customers, ‘simpler’ for 
staff and ‘cheaper’ for Tesco. Our stock 
reduction programme is an excellent 
example of this:
•  it’s better for customers because 
it has driven a large improvement 
in availability for both food and 
non-food; 
•  it’s simpler for staff because it is 
now easier to locate stock to fill 
the shelves and stock errors can 
be identified more easily; and
•  it’s cheaper for Tesco because 
stores now hold less stock and 
fewer hours are needed to replenish 
the shelves. For example, a typical 
Tesco Extra now holds 8% less 
stock and we are now looking at 
releasing backroom space which 
can be redeployed for Retailing 
Services or Non-food. 
This year we aim to complete a 
global programme that will deliver 
savings of £800m and we’ll invest 
most of these savings back into our 
offer for customers. 
New space
Through the experience and 
expertise of our property teams we 
have developed over a number of 
years a good pipeline of new space 
opportunities. As a result we have 
the opportunity to unwind some of 
the work-in-progress we have built 
up and will be stepping up the rate 
of expansion in 2010/11. We will 
be investing £1.6bn of capital in 
the UK economy this year and 
will create thousands of jobs for 
people, including the long-term 
unemployed through our 
Regeneration Partnerships. 
Sustainable strategy
Our customer strategy is sustainable 
for the long term because we can 
differentiate Tesco in a unique way 
with Clubcard and because our low 
prices and improvements to the 
customer shopping trip are based on 
permanent productivity gains. 
Our growth strategy for the UK is also 
sustainable as it is based on taking a 
balanced approach to the key building 
blocks of top-line growth; solid like-
for-like performance and a consistent 
contribution from new stores.

Non-food 
Significant 
market share 
gains in key 
categories
As our UK non-food business continues 
to grow we’ve worked hard to create 
innovative solutions to increase storage 
and distribution capacity and efficiency 
whilst reducing our impact on the 
environment. 
Our first ever purpose-built import 
storage facility, which opened in 
Middlesbrough in August, fulfils both 
these objectives whilst also creating 
800 jobs in the local community.
The 910,000 sq ft Teesport distribution 
centre offers a traditional low bay 
assembly operation and high density 
storage within a fully automated high 
bay warehouse providing a capability of 
holding 160,000 pallets and assembling 
up to 4.5 million cases per week. The 
scale of Teesport, along with its port 
location and on-site rail infrastructure, 
has helped reduce costs in our 
T eesport – helping us get better, 
simpler and cheaper
distribution network, which in turn 
helps us keep prices low for customers.
Teesport has also delivered major 
environmental benefits by removing 
over 12,000 lorry journeys per year 
from the UK’s roads. This has made a 
significant step towards our target to 
halve distribution emissions of each 
case delivered by 2012, against a 
baseline of 2006.
Sales
UK
£9.0bn

Our non-food performance has 
been very resilient through the 
downturn. In some key categories 
we have made significant market 
share gains as more customers 
have been encouraged to try our 
non-food range in the search for 
great value and as some competitors 
have felt the strain. 
Group non-food sales rose 6.2% to 
£13.1bn, with £9.0bn in the UK and 
£4.1bn in International.
We delivered a very strong non-food 
performance in the UK with steadily 
improving like-for-like sales during 
the year. A number of categories had 
particularly strong growth:
Electricals 
With competitive prices, a great range 
– in-store and online – and over 1,000 
Tesco Tech Support advisors in our UK 
stores to help customers make their 
choice, we are rapidly growing our 
presence in the electricals market. We 
now sell one in every six microwaves 
in the UK and one in four small-screen 
TVs. Our sales in electricals have 
doubled in the last four years and 
around 20% are online.
Entertainment
Our market share in games has 
doubled in the last year as a result 
of allocating it more space in-store, 
revamping the range and layout 
and being more competitive on 
new releases. 
As part of our drive to lower prices 
for customers, we make every effort 
to cut out the middlemen and source 
products from manufacturers or 
developers. For example, we teamed 
up with DreamWorks studio for 
the exclusive rights to sell the short 
animated Christmas film Merry 
Madagascar. This groundbreaking 
relationship was the first of its kind 
in the industry and enabled Tesco 
to sell over one million Merry 
Madagascar DVDs. 
Toys
Our sales in toys have grown 25% 
this year with online sales up more 
than 60%. 
Clothing 
Sales grew by 7.3%, including positive 
like-for-like growth, to reach £1bn 
in sales for the first time, helped by a 
15% increase in children’s wear and 
the launch of our online clothing range.

Resilient 
through the 
downturn
Our ambition is to make F&F a leading 
global fashion brand, offering unbeatable 
value for money, not compromised by 
quality, design or provenance.
F&F launched in the UK in 2001 and has 
expanded rapidly since then with sales 
last year of £540m in the UK – supported 
by the launch of our online clothing site 
in October. 
F&F launched in Central Europe in 2008 
and we’re already making excellent 
progress. F&F is rapidly becoming 
established in the region with customer 
awareness of the brand growing from 
34% to 61% in the last year. 
Across our markets in Central Europe, 
Tesco is already one of the largest 
clothing retailers. In fact during the year 
we sold more F&F items – 68 million – 
than the combined populations of our 
F&F – a global brand
four countries in the region: Poland; 
Hungary; Czech Republic; and Slovakia.
We’re now building on the success in the 
UK and Central Europe to launch F&F 
across our Asian markets. This year we 
launched in China, Malaysia, South Korea 
and Thailand.
As with any brand, F&F can’t afford to 
stand still, which is why we’re broadening 
the brand’s appeal with new ranges – 
F&F Couture and F&F Jewellery. 
International clothing
Clothing is becoming a global 
strength and a good example of how 
we are bringing global scale and skill 
to our international businesses.
In our four Central European markets, 
clothing like-for-like sales grew 14% 
this year – following strong growth 
the previous year – in a market which 
has been declining overall in the 
recession. We’ve also introduced F&F 
ranges to four Asian markets this year 
– another step in developing F&F into 
a global brand.
Joint buying – whereby 95% of the 
supplier base in Central Europe is 
the same as Ireland and the UK – 
has brought the benefits of Group 
expertise and scale, helping to 
improve quality and costs.
Online
Shopping habits are changing – 
customers want to buy online as well 
as from stores and catalogues – and 
many will use a combination of these 
to research before buying. With an 
integrated multichannel approach 
we’re making it easy for customers, 
whichever way they want to shop. 
In addition to the 15,500 products 
available online through Tesco Direct, 
we now have two new specialist 
websites launched in October: 
•  www . t e s c o . c o m / c l o t h i n g 
Our new clothing site combines 
familiar Tesco labels such as 
Cherokee and F&F with some new 
Tesco lines exclusively offered online, 
plus a number of other brands. 
The site became one of the top 
ten most visited clothing websites 
within weeks of its launch. So far 
the customer feedback has been 
very strong, particularly on value 
for money and ease of shop.
•  www.tesco.com/entertainment 
The launch of Tesco Entertainment 
brought together, for the first time, 
our entire physical and digital 
entertainment offer, in a new 
and easy-to-use one-stop site. 
Customers are now able to buy 
a CD, DVD or game and a film 
or album download, all in one 
transaction. From the outset the 
new website has proved popular 
with customers.

Retailing Services at a glance
We’ve made good progress this year in our Retailing Services 
businesses: Tesco Bank; tesco.com; Telecoms; and dunnhumby. 
tesco.com – a leading 
online retailer
Including both our grocery and non-food offer, 
tesco.com is one of the largest online retailers 
in the UK, with sales of more than £2bn. Just as 
in our stores, our success comes from listening 
to customers and a constant drive to ensure 
that we provide an online ‘Every little helps’ 
shopping experience.
With more than a million active customers, our 
online grocery business is the market leader and 
the most profitable business of its kind in the 
world. It continues to grow strongly – last year we 
delivered over one billion items. We have put ease 
of use at the heart of our online shopping trip – for 
example, our ‘favourites’ feature, which makes 
shopping online easier by using Clubcard to 
remember a customer’s favourite in-store and 
online purchases. We also continue to innovate 
with our ‘price match’ on any substituted products 
and our ‘shorter than we’d like’ code life guarantee.
Tesco Direct extends the reach of our non-food 
offer with over 15,500 products available to 
customers via the internet and catalogues. 
Customers can choose to have goods delivered to 
their home or they can pick them up at one of our 
261 in-store Direct desks. This year we relaunched 
our online entertainment site, enabling customers 
to buy downloads alongside the physical product, 
and we launched our online clothing website with 
a range of 2,500 fashionable items, of which 
1,000 were exclusively online.

£3.6bn, up 4.2% on last year and 
profits were £540m, up 17.6%.
Tesco Bank
Overall, Tesco Bank has delivered a 
good performance in a challenging 
retail banking market growing profits 
by 13% to £250m. Bad debt levels 
rose during the year but have now 
stabilised and throughout have 
remained below industry averages. 
We have absorbed additional costs as 
we begin the process of moving the 
business onto its own infrastructure 
and build the team as we prepare the 
business for faster growth. 
Commercial performance
We grew the number of customer 
accounts by more than 400,000 in 
the last year – to a total of more than 
6.2 million across all products. We 
have achieved double-digit customer 
growth in our banking products, 
including 27% growth in personal 
loans. In insurance we held our 
number of policies broadly flat in a 
very competitive market; the number 
of motor insurance policies declined 
– partly as a result of a planned 
reduction in our exposure to high-risk 
drivers – but the number of policies 
in home, pet and life insurance 
increased. Our 130 in-store travel 
bureaux saw an increase in 
transactions of more than 80% 
and the number of ATMs in our 
network grew to over 2,800. 
Profit
Gross profit grew 19% to £749m with 
a good performance in banking being 
partly offset by lower profitability 
in insurance, primarily as a result of 
lower investment income linked to the 
current low interest rate environment. 
Trading profit was up 13.1% to £250m 
(compared to £221m in 2008/9 on a 
pro forma basis). Profit before tax was 
£114m – with the primary deduction 
from operating profit being the 
previously announced £127m non-
cash amortisation of intangibles 
arising on acquisition. This profit 
performance was achieved after an 
increase in operating costs – as a 
result of the change of ownership as 
the business prepares for expansion 
– and against the background of a 
32% increase in bad debts – to £177m 
which was in part offset by a credit 
relating to the unwind of the fair value 
adjustment created on acquisition.
Capital and liquidity
The Tier 1 capital ratio at the end 
of 2009/10 was 13.0%. The funding 
and liquidity position of the business 
remained robust throughout the 
period with customer deposits in 
excess of customer lending. This is 
further supported by a high-quality 
liquid asset portfolio, net short-term 
wholesale cash and investment 
grade assets worth £1.3bn. 
Management team
During the year good progress 
has been made in completing 
the recruitment of an experienced 
management team in all areas 
of the Bank: finance; risk; legal; 
commercial; treasury; and IT. All 
senior roles have now been filled. 
Infrastructure
In September 2009 we entered into 
an agreement with Fortis (UK) Ltd to 
help us build the operational platform 
and technical expertise required 
to further develop our insurance 
business. We have also selected the 
core technology platforms for the 
banking products. The migration 
programmes for both sides of the 
business are progressing well and we 
expect to be writing business on the 
new systems by the end of 2010/11. 
We have secured new premises for 
banking and insurance operations in 
Glasgow and Newcastle, which will 
open in mid 2010, creating 1,800 jobs.
New product development
Subject to regulatory approval we 
anticipate launching new savings 
products and mortgages by the end 
of financial year 2010/11, with current 
accounts to follow in the second half 
of 2011.

Growing sales 
and profits
tesco.com 
Our online businesses – including 
dotcom grocery and Direct – delivered 
another strong performance, achieving 
a 14% increase in sales with profits 
rising 26% to £136m. 
In a little over a decade we have built 
a substantial profitable business that 
has sales of £2.1bn and employs 
20,000 people. Our website is the 
third most visited retail website in the 
UK and last year our online grocery 
business delivered over a billion items.
The number of active customers 
in our online grocery business has 
grown to over one million and basket 
size has increased. Record levels of 
availability and innovations such as 
price matching on substitutions are 
improving the customer experience 
and helping to reduce the number 
of lapsed customers and calls to the 
service centre. We are reducing costs 
and carbon emissions by improving 
fuel consumption per order by 10% 
for the second year running through 
implementing new technology to 
improve driving and routing efficiency.
Tesco Direct extends the reach of our 
non-food offer to customers via the 
internet, by phone and catalogues. 
Customers can choose to have goods 
delivered to their home or they can 
pick them up at one of our 261 in-
store Direct desks. Tesco Direct had 
another good year making good 
progress on its customer service offer, 
growing sales by 28% and continuing 
on its path towards profitability.
Tesco Telecoms
Profit from our telecoms business 
grew, driven primarily by Tesco 
Mobile, which achieved a 14% 
increase in customer numbers – to 
more than two million – in a declining 
pre-pay phone market. Tesco Mobile 
also successfully entered the ‘pay 
monthly’ market this year with 
innovative tariffs and generous credit 
rewards, picking up the ‘best tariff’ 
accolade at the 2009 Mobile Choice 
Awards. Tesco Mobile remained the 
number one pay-as-you-go operator 
for customer satisfaction throughout 
2009. In December 2009, Tesco 
Mobile broadend its appeal further by 
becoming only the third UK operator 
to offer the iPhone, for which sales 
have been encouraging.
We have made good progress in 
rolling out our in-store Phone Shops 
with 105 open at year end and a 
further 100 planned by the end of 
this year. The Phone Shops are 
transforming our ability to sell 
products that require an assisted sale 
– particularly contract mobile phones.
Also in 2009 we signed a wholesale 
broadband agreement with Cable 
& Wireless, which will enable us 
to relaunch our broadband offer 
to customers in 2010 with higher 
bandwidth speeds and lower prices.

This year marks dunnhumby’s 20th 
anniversary. In addition to supporting 
Tesco’s Clubcard in seven countries 
around the world, dunnhumby serves 
other retailers and manufacturers in 
26 international markets; in fact Tesco 
now represents only around 15% of 
its sales. 
dunnhumby is growing fast – with 
profits up 28% in the year – helped 
by new engagements in the United 
States (Macy’s), Canada (Metro) and 
Colombia (Exito). dunnhumby now

Ramsey – 
the world’s first zero- 
carbon store
Tesco has been continuously developing stores 
with lower carbon footprints since 2005 and 
our new store at Ramsey in Cambridgeshire is 
the latest step on this journey. The store emits 
zero net CO
2
 in its operations.
The building is designed to use as little energy 
as possible. The frame is made from sustainably 
sourced wood, which requires much less energy 
to produce than steel. We use roof windows and 
sun pipes to bring natural daylight flooding into 
the customer and staff areas.
Any energy that the store does need is generated 
by a combined heat and power plant on site, 
which is powered from renewable sources. We 
sell any excess electricity to the National Grid.

Increasingly 
important for

We succeeded in

the world
Throughout the 
year we gave over 
£60m in donations 
to charities
We are committed to being 
a responsible neighbour within 
our local communities and 
taking a leadership role on the 
environment. This is something 
our customers expect and we 
believe is increasingly important 
for our growth.
Caring for the environment
Over the past few years we have 
played a leadership role amongst 
large businesses in tackling climate 
change, through our own actions and 
in collaboration with our customers, 
suppliers, NGOs and governments 
around the world. We have made 
great progress this year in reducing 
CO
2
 emissions across our business 
globally. Emissions from our baseline 
2007 store and distribution centre 
portfolio have fallen by 7.8% over 
the past year and new stores and 
distribution centres built since 2006/7 
are on average emitting 28.8% less 
CO
2
 than their equivalents in 2006/7.
We have delivered on our promise 
to divert 100% of store waste in the 
UK from going directly to landfill.
In 2007 Tesco invested £25m to 
create a new Sustainable Consumption 
Institute (SCI) at the University of 
Manchester. The SCI aims to answer 
some of the fundamental questions 
about how to make a consumer 
society sustainable. 
In October, the SCI held a conference 
to launch its first major report 
‘Consumers: The Key to a Low-
Carbon World’. At that conference, 
we committed ourselves to a new set 
of challenging long-term targets: to 
become a zero-carbon business by 
2050; to reduce the carbon impact of 
products in our supply chain by 30% 
by 2020; and to help our customers 
halve their own footprints by 2020.
Actively supporting local 
communities
Our Values at Tesco mean that we 
listen to our customers and respond 
to what we hear. Customers tell us 
that being part of a local community 
is important to them and they look 
to us to play an active role. Being at 
the heart of successful, thriving 
neighbourhoods is not just in the 
interest of our customers. It is in our 
interest too. We aim to use our size 
as a force for good in society.
Throughout the year, we gave 
over £60m in donations to charities 
and contributions to community 
projects including cause-related 
marketing, gifts-in-kind, staff time 
and management costs. Once again 
we have donated the equivalent of 
more than 1% of our profits to good 
causes. Additionally, including our 
Charity of the Year partnerships, 
which go from strength to strength, 
this year our staff raised over £7m 
for charity across the Group. 
We have continued to roll out 
Community Champions right across 
the Group. Community Champions 
are staff members who dedicate paid 
hours to coordinate store activities in 
their local communities. The Champions 
support local charities, organisations, 
schools and causes that local people 
really care about. We now have 
Champions in seven countries.
 
As part of the Tesco for Schools and 
Clubs scheme in the UK, this year 
we gave away £13.7m of equipment 
to 35,000 schools and clubs, a rise 
of about 50% in both the value of 
the equipment and the numbers 
participating. 
In the US, we ran our ‘Shop for 
Schools’ project for a second year. 
In this scheme, we give participating 
schools US$1 for every US$20 spent 
at Fresh & Easy stores. The first year 
of the project helped raise over 
US$130,000 for schools in California, 
Arizona and Nevada, with the school 
that raised the most money in each 
state receiving a US$5,000 bonus.
In Turkey, our Computers for Schools 
programme distributed 264 products 
including computers, printers and 
projectors to 60 schools. In Poland, 
more than 600 schools took part in 
our Tesco for Schools programme, 
an environmental contest for schools 
where children create a piece of art

Buying and selling products 
responsibly
We are committed to buying and 
selling our products responsibly and 
treating our suppliers fairly. This is not 
just the right thing to do, it is also in 
our business interest. We know that 
if you treat people decently they 
perform better. This approach also 
helps to improve the sustainability 
of our supply chain. By investing for 
the long term in businesses that 
understand our needs, our customers 
benefit through better products and 
our suppliers’ employees benefit 
through more stable and secure jobs.
In 2009, over 3,300 suppliers covering 
all our markets responded to our 
Group-wide anonymous supplier 
survey – Supplier Viewpoint. At least 
90% agreed that we pay on time, we 
are professional, we treat them with 
respect and we are committed to 
meeting customer requirements.
We have launched our Trading Fairly 
programme and recruited our first 
ethical action managers in South 
Africa and Bangladesh, who work 
with our local suppliers to improve 
conditions across the supply chain. 
We have also introduced ‘Trading 
Fairly’ Awards for our produce and 
clothing suppliers, which reward 
suppliers making particularly strong 
efforts to improve conditions 
for their employees.
At Tesco product safety is of 
paramount importance. We have a 
team of over 900 technical specialists 
working to raise standards in our 
supplier base around the world. 
They help ensure that all our products 
– from tagliatelle to TVs – are safe, 
legal, ethical and of the highest 
quality for our customers.
We know that many of our customers 
want to buy products that support 
their local businesses and economy, 
particularly in the current economic 
climate. They are also concerned 
about the environmental impact 
of the products they buy. In the UK, 
we have dedicated local buying, 
marketing and technical teams in 
each of our regional buying offices. 
We stock more than 4,000 local 
lines and work with over 400 local 
and national suppliers. We’re also 
doing more local buying in our 
international businesses. For example, 
in Poland, we sell more than 6,000 
regional products.
Giving customers healthy choices
We are committed to helping our 
customers and staff adopt healthy 
lifestyles. We aim to provide better 
information on the nutritional value 
of products so customers can make 
informed choices to improve their 
health. Across the Group we have 
exceeded our target of nutritional 
labelling on own-brand products – 
we now label 100% of eligible 
products – giving customers the tools 
they need to make healthy choices.
As part of our strategy to encourage 
customers to lead more active lives, 
we run a range of programmes 
around the world from aerobic 
competitions in Thailand to charity 
‘Runs for life’ in Slovakia and the 
Czech Republic. This year we 
succeeded in getting 6.2 million 
people active across the world.
Creating good jobs and careers
We are dedicated to creating good 
jobs wherever we are. 
During the year we opened a further 
three Regeneration Partnership stores 
in the UK, in Oldham, Birmingham 
and Litherland, near Liverpool, 
creating 380 jobs for the long-term 
unemployed. Since 2009, we have 
opened 26 Regeneration Partnership 
stores and created more than 3,200 
jobs for people who have previously 
been long-term unemployed. Half the 
jobs for each partnership are reserved 
for local people who have been 
unemployed for at least six months, 
including those with low levels of 
numeracy and literacy skills and 
people with disabilities. 
We were also one of the first 
companies to work with the UK 
Government in Local Employment 
Partnerships, designed to provide 
jobs for the long-term unemployed.
We will create 16,000 new jobs this 
year, including 9,000 in the UK. 32 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Our people at a glance
As we grow our business we’re developing our people to become 
leaders for the future.
China Graduate 
Programme – 
recruiting tomorrow’s 
leaders today
We believe that businesses perform best when 
they are run by local people for local customers. 
However, we also understand the importance of 
sharing knowledge and experience around the 
Group. Our China Graduate Programme helps 
balance both these requirements whilst ensuring 
that we recruit top talent for the future to grow 
with the business.
Each year we recruit a small number of high-
potential graduates who are fluent in both English 
and Mandarin. The graduates spend seven 
months being trained, supported and developed 
in the UK before taking up a specific role in China. 
As with all our graduates, we are committed to 
equipping these individuals with both the 
technical and leadership skills they will need to 
progress through the business. 
This unique scheme has been running for four 
years now and is gaining a strong reputation 
amongst university leavers. Last year we attracted 
almost 1,000 applicants for just 12 places. Previous 
years’ graduates have gone on to managerial roles 
across a variety of functions in China.

Our business
Our people 
Our people 
are crucial to 
our success
Our Values are ‘No-one tries harder 
for customers’ and ‘We treat 
people how we like to be treated’. 
These values are interlinked and 
underpin everything we do at 
Tesco. We know that by managing 
our people well – in a culture of 
trust and respect – they will in turn 
try their hardest for customers. 
By offering competitive pay and 
benefits and an opportunity to 
develop a long-term varied career 
with good training, we are able to 
keep our people motivated, committed 
and excited about working at Tesco. 
In the UK, for example, in our internal 
‘Viewpoint’ staff survey this year, 
we improved on 24 out of the 
25 measures and attendance levels 
improved again, putting an additional 
four million hours into our stores 
and depots.
Rewards and benefits
Our people are crucial to our 
success and it is essential that 
they feel rewarded for the work 
they do and supported in their 
development. We offer good pay 
across all our businesses, as well as 
benefits in each market that reflect 
employees’ priorities. 
Despite the tough global market in 
2009 we continued to invest in pay 
at the annual review. We focused 
on our core rates and in a tough 
financial year our pay competitiveness 
improved in most markets.
In many developing markets, 
employees place most value on good 
basic pay and being paid fairly for 
overtime and these are our priorities. 
In Malaysia, for example, where there 
is no legal minimum wage, the 
minimum a Tesco employee will 
receive is 30% more than the Poverty 
Line Index. In Thailand this year we 
introduced a staff discount linked 
to Clubcard.
In the UK, our reward package leads 
the market on pay and benefits. We 
are one of the few FTSE businesses 
to still have an open defined benefit 
pension scheme, which is greatly 
valued by staff. We regularly offer 
staff the opportunity to experience 
our brand. For example, we offer staff 
great deals on our Retailing Services 
– Tesco Mobile offers exclusive staff 
tariffs and Tesco Bank offers deals on 
Home Insurance, Life Insurance and 
Travel Money – which not only reward 
our staff but encourage them to 
become advocates for our services. 
Through share ownership and share 
incentive schemes, 195,000 of our 
people have a personal stake in Tesco. 
Employees were awarded shares 
worth a record £98m last May 
through our Shares In Success 
scheme. Over 55,000 staff were able 
to benefit when Save As You Earn 
schemes matured in February, giving 
them access to shares worth £144m.
Training and development
We are committed to providing 
opportunities for our people to get 
on and turn their jobs into careers. 
Last year we had more people on 
development programmes than 
ever before.
We have continued to develop our 
apprenticeship training in the UK. 
Since 2004, 83% of the employees 
who embarked on the scheme have 
been awarded an Apprenticeship in 
Retail Skills – equating to five GCSEs 
at grades A* to C. This training is 
completed entirely in the workplace. 
The first 17 students to complete the 
Tesco Foundation Degree graduated 
in July. The Foundation Degree in 
Retail – delivered and awarded by 
Manchester Metropolitan University 
– is a two-year development 
programme aimed at providing work- 
focused retail training to managers at 
Tesco. We now have 60 people on the 
scheme and are working on ways to 
make it grow.
We believe that even in difficult times 
it is essential to invest in future talent. 
That’s why this year, while many other 
businesses were cutting their graduate 
schemes, we increased our graduate 
intake to 810, including 535 in Asia. 
Tesco Academy
As a leading global company, Tesco 
aims to offer the very best training 
and development for all its employees. 
The Tesco Academy helps provide an 
opportunity to get on for all our 
people. It develops thousands of 
world-class leaders through excellent 
training in leadership, management 
and technical skills.

the development of our people in 
Asia keeps pace with the rapidly 
growing business.
In the UK, our European Academy 
provides a hub to bring our managers 
and directors from around the world 
to the UK. We annually bring our 
100 most senior leaders together 
to share the long-term strategy, 
develop their leadership skills and 
build their network. The aim is to 
develop confident leaders and create 
a community of experts.
Developing leaders
As our business grows and diversifies 
we need more leaders to run the 
many substantial businesses and 
functions within the Group, several of 
which would rank as major companies 
in their own right. 
We now have 480 people at Director 
level in the business. Of these, 50% 
work in our International business – 
a combination of local hires and 
people moving from the UK business. 
We also understand the importance 
of increasing mobility. As a global 
business we’re developing leaders 
with a global perspective and now 
have 34% of our Directors with at 
least one year of experience outside 
their home country. 
This year we enrolled our second 
group of senior Directors on to our 
Advanced Leadership Programme – 
an 18-month course aiming to 
accelerate capability and prepare 
individuals to become future business 
leaders. The first intake graduated 
earlier this year. By July all will have 
been promoted, with two thirds 
working outside the UK.
Our Work Level 3 to 4 Options 
programme is our main vehicle for 
the internal development of our future 
directors. Programmes have been 
running very successfully in the UK 
for around three years, and we have 
rolled the programme out to Asia, 
Europe and the US in the last year.
Whistle-blowing
Our whistle-blowing policy and 
helpline is now in place in all countries. 
‘Protector Line’ is a 24-hour 
confidential telephone line and email 
address for employees to raise ethical 
issues and also report grievances. 
All calls are logged and investigated 
by the appropriate function and all 
serious matters are brought to the 
attention of the CEO. The feedback 
is monitored by the compliance 
committee in each business. The 
Group Audit Committee annually 
reviews the number of calls and the 
quality of investigation and reviews 
plans to ensure our staff are aware 
of the facility. 
In 2009 we received around 1,700 
employment-related calls to the 
helpline across the Group. This is an 
increase from last year, showing that 
employees are gaining confidence in 
the service. Most calls relate to 
personnel issues, commercial issues, 
security and trading law. Personnel 
issues are referred back to the store or 
resolved through grievance procedures.
Diversity and inclusivity 
We strive to provide an inclusive 
environment where all difference 
is valued, people are able to be 
themselves, enjoy coming to work 
and realise their full potential, 
regardless of their gender, marital 
status, race, age, sexual orientation, 
creed, ethnic origin, religion or belief, 
or disability.
Three women in Tesco are currently

100 Cross-Company Mentoring 
Programme. The Programme, 
launched in 2003, involves FTSE 100 
Chairmen and CEOs acting as 
mentors to senior women just below 
board level in other FTSE companies. 
The mentors guide and advise 
women in the management of their 
careers so that they are better 
positioned to be considered for board 
appointments. Our Chairman, David 
Reid, is currently working with his 
second mentee from outside Tesco.

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
*
We operate a balanced scorecard approach to managing the 
business that is known internally within the Group as our ‘Steering 
Wheel’. This unites the Group’s resources and in particular focuses 
the efforts of our staff around our customers, people, operations, 
finance and the community. Its prime focus is as a management tool 
for the Company so that there is appropriate balance in the trade-
offs that need to be made between the main levers of management 
– such as operations measures, financial measures or delivery of 
customer metrics.
It therefore enables the business to be operated and monitored 
on a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders. 
For the owners of the business, it is simply based around the 
philosophy that if we look after customers and staff well and operate 
efficiently and effectively then shareholders’ interests will always be 
best served by the inevitable outputs of those – growth in sales, profits 
and returns.

Trading margin   
UK trading margin 6.2% 6.2% 5.9%
International trading margin (excluding the United States) 5.3% 5.3% 5.6% 
Trading margin is calculated from the trading profit expressed as a percentage of Group revenue (sales excluding value 
added tax) and excluding the impact of IFRIC 13. It is a measure of profit generation from sales and is a comparable 
performance measure with other companies. This is how much we made from trade in our stores, taking account of the 
cost of the products sold, wages and salaries, expenses associated with running the stores, depots and head office, and the 
cost of depreciation of the assets used to generate the profits. Trading profit is stated after adjusting operating profit for 
the impact of IAS 19, IAS 32 and IAS 39 (principally pension costs and the marking to market of financial instruments). 
It also excludes the non-cash elements of IAS 17 ‘Leases’, relating to the impact of annual uplifts in rents and rent-free 
periods, and the IFRS 3 amortisation charge on intangible assets arising on the acquisition of Tesco Personal Finance (TPF).

ROCE is calculated as profit before interest less tax divided by the average of net assets plus net debt plus dividend 
creditor less net assets held for sale. ROCE is a relative profit measurement that not only incorporates the funds 
shareholders have invested, but also funds invested by banks and other lenders, and therefore shows the productivity 
of the assets of the Group.

Underlying diluted earnings per share is the calculation of profit after tax and minority interest divided by the diluted

if the Company decided to distribute all its profits as dividends instead of retaining some for future expansion.

Total shareholder return 9.5% 8.0% 22.8%
Total shareholder return is the notional return from a share and is measured as the percentage change in the share price, 
plus the dividend paid. This is measured over the last five years. 
Full year dividend per share 13.05p 11.96p 10.09p
The dividend is paid in two instalments.
We monitor a wide range of KPIs, both financial and non-financial. Individual business units have their own versions of the Steering Wheel which 
incorporate their own priorities and KPIs. Some of the Group KPIs below are tracked through the Steering Wheel and those above are tracked as 
a monitor of investor return.
Across the Group, KPIs are set for local markets, with oversight from the Executive Directors, to ensure they are tailored to drive the priorities 
of each business. 
The following are some KPIs for the UK and Group operations:

a calendar year basis.
†† 2009 figures adjusted for 52-week comparison. 40 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
These results are for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010. In the 
last full financial year, we reported a 53-week period for the UK, 
Republic of Ireland and the United States (US) and a 52-week period 
for the rest of the Group. Growth rates in these results are expressed 
for the UK, Republic of Ireland and US to coincide with the 
comparable 52 weeks last year.
Statutory numbers include the adoption of IFRIC 13 (Customer Loyalty 
Programmes). All other numbers are shown excluding IFRIC 13, 
consistent with internal management reporting. More information 
can be found in note 1 to the Group financial statements.
Group sales, including VAT, increased by 6.8% to £62.5bn. At 
constant exchange rates, sales increased by 6.1% (including petrol) 
and 7.7% (excluding petrol).
Underlying profit before tax rose to £3,395m, an increase of 10.1%. 
Group trading profit was £3,412m, up 12.3% on last year and Group 
trading margin, at 5.9%, rose 25 basis points. These were helped 
by the fact that Tesco Bank was fully consolidated in 2010 and 
accounted for as a joint venture for most of 2009.
Group operating profit rose by 10.7% to £3,457m. Group profit 
before tax increased 10.4% to £3,176m.
On a statutory 52-week basis (compared to 53 weeks last year), 
Group operating profit rose by 9.1% to £3,457m and Group profit 
before tax rose by 8.9% to £3,176m.
Cash flow and balance sheet Tesco liquidity has improved 
significantly during the year through strong cash generation, tight 
control of capital expenditure and working capital improvements 
arising from better inventory management. Net debt has 
consequently reduced by £1.7bn to £7.9bn.
Excluding the effects of currency fluctuations, we expect to reduce 
net debt to £7.5bn by the end of the 2010/11 financial year.
The strength of our property-backed balance sheet was 
further demonstrated with profitable market-leading sale and 
leaseback transactions.
Group capital expenditure was £3.1bn (last year £4.7bn). This reduced 
level of spend was achieved whilst still delivering 8% growth in 
Group selling space. This year we plan to invest around £3.5bn in 
capital expenditure.
Excluding Tesco Bank, cash flow from operating activities totalled 
£5.4bn (£5.1bn in 2009), including a £0.6bn improvement in 
working capital.
Finance costs and tax Net finance costs, after net favourable IFRS 
adjustments of £103m*, reduced to £314m (£356m last year on a 
consistent 52-week basis). A reduction in the underlying interest 
charge is expected next year. Total Group tax has been charged at 
an effective rate of 26.4% (last year 26.7%). We expect the tax rate 
in 2010/11 to be around 26%.
Dividend Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2% 
to 16.62p in the second half, calculated using a constant tax rate. The 
Board has approved a final dividend of 9.16p per share, taking the full-
year dividend to 13.05p. This represents an increase of 9.1% on last 
year’s full-year dividend which is in line with the growth in underlying 
diluted earnings per share at constant exchange rates. The final 
dividend will be paid on 9 July 2010 to shareholders on the Register 
of Members at the close of business on 30 April 2010.
Property We are continuing to release value created through the long-
term development of our property portfolio. In the year we completed 
deals with total proceeds of £1.8bn and we expect to divest a similar 
amount this year. The strong demand for these assets and the good 
yields achieved (initial yields between 5.0% and 5.2% for stores) 
demonstrate the strong underlying value of our property and the 
strength of the Tesco covenant. Profits from property in the year were 
£377m. Our property mix remains strong – over 70% of our property is 
freehold – supported by substantial new capital investment in freehold 
assets each year. Our latest property assets valuation of £34.6bn 
reflects recent firming yields across the market and confirms that our 
assets are worth well in excess of their book value.
Pension Our award-winning defined-benefit career-average pension 
scheme is an important part of our competitive benefits package, 
which helps Tesco recruit and retain the best people. In the UK we have 
160,000 employees in the scheme. As at February 2010, under the 
IAS 19 methodology of pension liability valuation, the scheme had a 
deficit on a post-tax basis of £1.3bn, compared to £1.4bn at the half 
year. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme’s assets and liabilities 
showed a small and manageable deficit.
Return on capital employed We have continued to invest during 
the recession, which has put pressure on returns in the short term but 
is enabling us to make good progress in all our markets. During the 
financial year 2010 our post-tax return on capital employed (ROCE) 
fell from 12.8%** to 12.1%.
Having raised ROCE from 10.2% in 2003 to 12.6% in 2006, we 
committed in April 2006 to increase ROCE a further 200 basis points 
to 14.6%. We are reaffirming this commitment with confidence 
that with the prospect of an improving global economy and recent 
significant investments in acquisitions and new space making a greater 
contribution going forward, returns will improve in the coming few 
years, starting in 2010/11.
*  £151m benefit from IAS 32 and IAS 39 (Fair value of derivatives) partially offset by 
£48m cost as a result of IAS 19 (Pensions).
**  In 2009, ROCE on a 52-week comparable basis was 12.7%. On a 53-week basis 
it was 12.8% (restated for the impact of IFRIC 13, IFRS 2 and goodwill adjustments).

Our business
Risks and uncertainties
Introduction Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real 
challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to 
develop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management 
process balances risks and rewards and relies on a sound judgement of 
their likelihood and consequence. The Board has overall responsibility for 
risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the 
Group’s objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set 
out in more detail from page 49 of the Corporate Governance section of 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The key risks faced by the 
Group and relevant mitigating factors are set out below.
Business strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not 
effectively communicated then the business may suffer. We need to 
understand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long-term 
growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Our strategy is based on  
five elements: to become a successful international retailer, to grow the 
core UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing 
services and put the community at the heart of what we do. Pursuit of this 
five-part strategy has allowed the business to diversify and, at a strategic 
level, diversification and pursuit of growth in emerging markets have the 
effect of reducing overall risk by avoiding reliance on a small number of 
business areas. However, by its very nature, diversification also introduces 
new risks to be managed in areas of the business that are less mature and 
less fully understood.
To ensure the Group continues to pursue the right strategy, the Board 
discusses strategic issues at every Board meeting and dedicates two full 
days a year to reviewing the Group’s strategy. The Executive Committee 
also discusses strategy on a regular basis. We have structured programmes 
for engaging with all our stakeholders including customers, employees, 
investors, suppliers, government, media and non-governmental 
organisations. We also invest significant resources in ensuring our strategy 
is communicated well and understood by the parties who are key to 
delivering it. The business operates a Steering Wheel (a balanced scorecard 
process whereby we set goals for different areas of the business and assess 
our overall progress on a quarterly basis) in all countries and significant 
business units to help manage performance and deliver business strategy.
Financial strategy and Group treasury risk The main financial risks of 
the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the 
risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and fluctuations 
in interest and foreign exchange rates. The risks associated with operating 
Tesco Bank are covered under Financial services risks below.
The Treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial 
risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The function has 
clear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are routinely 
reviewed and audited. The function does not operate as a profit centre and 
the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. A description 
of the role of the Finance Committee, Internal Audit and External Audit is 
set out in the Corporate Governance section on page 50.
Financial services risks Through Tesco Bank, the Group is subject to 
certain risks relating to the personal financial services industry in the UK. 
Tesco Bank is subject to significant legislative and regulatory oversight.  
In particular, Tesco Bank is subject to supervision by the Financial Services 
Authority (FSA) which has substantial powers of intervention and requires 
it to satisfy certain capital adequacy and liquidity ratios. If Tesco Bank is 
unable to or fails to satisfy these ratios in the future it could lose its licence 
and, consequently, its ability to transact business.
Tesco Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesco on 19 December 
2008. In preparation for this change its risk management and treasury 
capabilities were materially strengthened. All policies pertaining to risk 
within the Bank are now subject to Tesco Bank specific governance 
procedures which are owned by the Tesco Bank Board. 
Tesco Bank has a banking business, predominantly in the UK, with the 
three main products being credit cards, unsecured personal loans and 
savings. It has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor, 
home and pet insurance being the main products.
Tesco Bank is subject to various risks associated with the provision of 
financial services. In relation to its insurance business Tesco Bank may 
experience a concentration of risks from natural or man-made disasters.  
In addition market conditions may not allow it to purchase the amount  
of re-insurance it considers necessary on terms it considers acceptable. 
Actual claims may exceed the claims provisions that have been made on 
the basis of past experience. Tesco Bank’s credit card receivables and 
personal loan portfolio may be subject to changes in credit quality, due  
to a general deterioration in economic conditions or to failures in its credit 
assessment process, which could adversely impact its ability to recover 
amounts due. Furthermore, there is significant competition in the financial 
services industry which could adversely affect Tesco Bank’s profitability. 
Legal developments, changes in legal interpretation or precedent and 
changes in public policy may result in new risks emerging in addition to 
those anticipated.
Tesco Bank is in the process of building new banking and insurance 
systems and until these are complete there is an increased element  
of operational risk as most operations are outsourced to Royal Bank of 
Scotland. Tesco Bank retains the risk to its insurance activities posed  
by external factors, such as a large weather-related event. 
Tesco Bank is an FSA-regulated entity and so its treasury function is run 
independently from the rest of the Group. Tesco Bank’s treasury risks 
include liquidity risk and interest rate risk (in particular, in the interest rate 
margin realised between lending and borrowing costs). Tesco Bank  
is also subject to the risk of unexpected losses arising from operational 
failure, whether as a result of human error, systems failures, fraud or 
inadequate controls.
Tesco Bank monitors these risks through its governance structures, assessing 
any potential impact and action required to manage them. The work of the 
Risk Committee focuses on systemic risks such as funding, credit risk and 
risks in the insurance business, while the Tesco Bank Audit Committee 
considers internal controls and assurance. 
Operational threats and performance risk in the business There is a 
risk that our business may not deliver the stated strategy in full, particularly 
since, like all retailers, the business is susceptible to economic downturn 
that could affect consumer spending. The continuing acquisition and 
development of property sites also forms an intrinsic part of our strategy 
and this carries inherent risks. 42 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Risks and uncertainties continued
We aim to deliver what customers want better than our competitors by 
understanding and responding to their needs. All of our business units 
have stretching targets based on the Steering Wheel and the performance 
of business units is monitored continually and reported regularly to the 
Board. We manage the acquisition and development of our property  
assets carefully. We consider and assess in detail every site at each stage  
of acquisition and development and ensure that relevant action is taken  
to minimise any risks.
Competition and consolidation The retail industry is highly competitive. 
The Group competes with a wide variety of retailers of varying sizes and 
faces increased competition from UK retailers as well as international 
operators in the UK and overseas. 
Failure to compete with competitors on areas including price, product 
range, quality and service could have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial results.
We aim to have a broad appeal on price, range and store format in a way 
that allows us to compete in different markets. We track performance 
against a range of measures that customers tell us are critical to their 
shopping trip experience and we constantly monitor customer perceptions  
of ourselves and our competitors to ensure we can respond quickly if we 
need to.
People capabilities Employees are our greatest asset. It is critical to our 
success to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with the 
right capabilities at all levels of operations. We review our people policies 
regularly and are committed to investing in training and development and 
incentives for our people. Our ‘Talent Planning’ process helps individuals 
achieve their full potential. We also carry out succession planning to ensure 
that the future needs of the business are considered and provided for. 
There are clear processes for understanding and responding to employees’ 
needs through our People Matters Group, staff surveys, regular performance 
reviews, involvement of trade unions in relevant markets and regular 
communication of business developments. We take a proactive approach 
to encouraging diversity at all levels within the business.
Reputational risk As the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the 
Group are high. Failure to protect the Group’s reputation and brand could 
lead to a loss of trust and confidence. This could result in a decline in the 
customer base and affect the ability to recruit and retain good people.
Like other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation 
and the consequences of reputational damage. Emotional loyalty to the 
Tesco brand has helped us diversify into new areas like retail services and 
non-food and we recognise the commercial imperative to do the right 
thing for all our stakeholders and avoid the loss of such loyalty. The  
Tesco Values are embedded in the way we do business at every level  
and our Group Code of Business Conduct guides our behaviour in our 
dealings with customers, employees and suppliers.
We engage with stakeholders in every sphere to take into account their 
views and we try to ensure our strategy reflects them. Since the launch  
of the Community Plan in 2006 we have demonstrated our commitment 
to tackling a wide range of societal and environmental issues. We have 
high level committees, including the Executive Committee, Corporate 
Responsibility Committee and Group Compliance Committee to help 
guide and monitor our policies.
Environmental risks The main environmental risk we face is the threat 
of climate change and it is essential that we work to mitigate it through 
energy efficiency, the sustainable management of other resources and 
waste minimisation. We engage with key stakeholders and experts in 
developing environmental policy, including through the Sustainable 
Consumption Institute we have endowed at Manchester University. 
Environmental strategy and policies are reviewed regularly by the 
Corporate Responsibility Committee. Our climate change strategy is driven 
by a belief that proactive environmental performance will be rewarded by 
consumers and that providing the means by which consumers can adopt 
low-carbon lifestyles will increasingly be a route to competitive advantage.
Product safety The safety and quality of our products is of paramount 
importance to Tesco as well as being essential for maintaining customer 
trust and confidence. A breach of confidence could affect the size of our 
customer base and hence financial results.
We have detailed and established procedures for ensuring product 
integrity at all times, especially for our own-label products. There are  
strict product safety processes and regular management reports. We  
work in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of  
the standards required. We also monitor developments in areas such as 
health, safety and nutrition in order to respond appropriately to changing 
customer trends and new legislation. We have clear processes for crisis 
management, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond 
quickly on issues.
Health and safety risks The safety of our staff and customers is of the 
utmost importance to us. If we are unable to provide safe environments  
for our staff and customers this could lead to injuries or loss of life.
We operate stringent health and safety processes in line with best  
practice in our stores, distribution centres and offices which are monitored 
and audited regularly. KPIs for health and safety help prevent incidents 
and form an intrinsic part of our Steering Wheel across the business. 
Performance against these KPIs is reported quarterly. Our Group 
Compliance Committee and the Compliance Committees in our business 
units monitor the level of compliance with both health and safety laws  
and our internal policies on a regular basis.
Ethical risks in the supply chain Millions of people around the world 
work directly for suppliers to Tesco and the supply chain is made of 
complex relationships – from individual farmers and growers through  
to processors, manufacturers and distributors. At the heart of our Values  
is our belief that we should treat people as we like to be treated and we 
have a responsibility to help workers in our supply chain enjoy fair labour 
standards. We therefore require our suppliers to meet strict criteria on 
labour standards, and as a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative 
(ETI ), we expect all our suppliers to follow the ETI Base Code and guarantee 
their workers the rights set out within it. There is, however, a risk that any 
part of the supply chain might not adhere to these high standards. T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 43
Our business
To minimise this risk we only work with suppliers who can demonstrate 
that they are committed to the ETI Base Code and share our Values. We 
use Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) to carry out risk assessment 
of all our direct suppliers and all medium and high-risk suppliers must 
undergo an extensive, independent ethical audit. We continue to operate  
a comprehensive programme of audit improvements, including more 
unannounced audits and an industry-leading Auditor Recognition 
programme. We have also sought to involve more multi-stakeholder 
representatives on our audits to improve workforce engagement and 
enable activists to see and give feedback on our approach. We work with 
suppliers to identify any problems and, where they exist, support suppliers 
in taking action to improve standards for their workers.
We have invested heavily in building the labour standards capabilities of 
our suppliers and our own commercial teams in the last year, including 
rolling out extensive training to help them identify and avoid issues before 
they arise. We also work with businesses, governments, non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs) and others to tackle complex and systemic problems 
that we cannot solve on our own. As well as having a key role in the ETI we 
also work closely with the Global Social Compliance Programme and other 
groups in specific industries and regions.
Fraud and compliance As the business grows in size and geographical 
spread, the risk of the occurrence of fraudulent behaviour by our 
employees increases. Whilst the vast majority of our staff are completely 
honest, there remains the potential for fraud and other dishonest activity 
at all levels of the business, from the shop floor to senior management.
The Group takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. Relevant accounting 
and other procedures and controls at all levels are clearly set out and 
audited across the business to reduce the risk of fraud. The Group gives 
clear guidance on behaviour to employees through the Tesco Values and 
the Group Code of Business Conduct. Internal Audit undertakes detailed 
investigations into all areas of the business and highlights its findings  
to the Audit Committee. The Compliance Committee formulates and 
monitors the implementation of, and compliance with, appropriate policies 
on key areas of ethical behaviour, including fraud.
Property We have stretching targets for delivering new space in all of our 
markets and may face challenges in finding suitable sites and obtaining 
planning or other consents to enable sites to be acquired and developed. 
The complexity of many of our property developments is increasing, 
especially the growing number of malls and mixed-use schemes. We also 
have to comply with design and construction standards which vary 
significantly from country to country.
Our Property Acquisition Committee and other related committees in  
the UK, Europe, Asia and the US closely control all aspects of the property 
acquisition, planning and construction processes to ensure that applicable 
standards are met and financial risks are minimised. Our Group and 
country Compliance Committees also monitor compliance with applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements in all aspects of our property activities.
Non-food risks As the proportion of our business represented by 
non-food products increases, there is a risk that a downturn in consumer 
confidence may affect the level of demand for products which consumers 
may regard as non-essential. 
We make every effort to ensure that our non-food products are 
competitively priced and offer a broad range of products ranging from 
value to the luxury end of the market in order to cater for the needs of  
as wide a range of customers as possible.
IT systems and infrastructure The business is dependent on efficient 
information technology (IT) systems. Any significant failure in the IT 
processes of our retail operations (e.g. barcode scanning or supply chain 
logistics) would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential  
role that IT plays across our operations in allowing us to trade efficiently 
and achieve commercial advantage through implementing IT innovations  
that improve the shopping trip for customers and make life easier for 
employees. We have extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity 
and efficiency of our IT infrastructure and we share systems from across 
our international operations to ensure consistency of delivery.
Regulatory, political and economic environment We are subject to a 
wide variety of regulations in the different countries in which we operate 
because of the diverse nature of our business. Tesco may be impacted by 
regulatory changes in key areas such as planning laws, trading hours and 
tax rules as well as by scrutiny by the competition authorities who have 
been carrying out enquiries in the UK, Ireland and elsewhere. We may also 
be impacted by political developments and the economic environment in 
the countries in which we operate. We consider these uncertainties in the 
external environment when developing strategy and reviewing performance. 
We remain vigilant to future changes. As part of our day-to-day operations 
we engage with governmental and non-governmental organisations to 
ensure the views of our customers and employees are represented and try 
to anticipate and contribute to important changes in public policy wherever 
we operate.
Activism and terrorism A major incident or terrorist event incapacitating 
management, systems or stores could impact on the Group’s ability to 
trade. In addition to contingency plans, we have security systems and 
processes that reflect best practice.
Pension risks The Group’s pension arrangements are an important part 
of our employees’ overall benefits package. We see them as a strong 
contributor to our ability to attract and retain good people. Since the 
implementation of IAS 19 there is a risk that the accounting valuation 
deficit (which is recorded as a liability on the Group Balance Sheet)  
could increase if returns on corporate bonds are higher than the 
investment return on the pension scheme’s assets. The Group has 
considered its pension risks and has taken action by reducing risk in  
its investment strategy.
Financial review
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability  
of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties  
to financial transactions, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange  
rates and credit rating risks. These risks are managed as described below.  
The Group Balance Sheet position at 27 February 2010 is representative  
of the position throughout the year.
Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a 
combination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt, capital 
market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The 
objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the 
debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to 
maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit 
rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. Tesco Group 
has a long-term rating of A3 with a negative outlook by Moody’s and A-  
by Standard & Poor’s. New funding of £2.3bn was arranged during the 
year, including a net £1.8bn from property transactions and £0.5bn from 
long-term debt. At the year end, net debt was £7.9bn (last year £9.6bn). 44 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Risks and uncertainties continued
Interest rate risk management Our objective is to limit our exposure to 
increases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from 
interest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, 
caps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating 
rate debt.
Our policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt 
interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end, £5.6bn  
of debt was in fixed rate form (2009 – £6.3bn) with a further £0.1bn of  
debt capped or collared, therefore 72% (2009 – 72%) of net debt is fixed, 
capped or collared. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate 
form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, 
excluding joint ventures and associates, was 5.4% (2009 – 5.2%).
Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce 
the effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. Transactional 
currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income 
Statement are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of 
foreign currencies and currency options. At the year end, forward foreign 
currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to 
£1.083bn were outstanding (2009 – £2.11bn) as detailed in note 22. We 
hedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via 
foreign exchange transactions in matching currencies. Our objective is to 
maintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements 
in our Group Balance Sheet value. During the year, currency movements 
increased the net value of the Group’s overseas assets by £477m (last year 
increase of £480m). We translate overseas profits at average foreign 
exchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge.
Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from 
default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list  
of counterparties of good credit quality. The Group’s positions with  
these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored.
Credit risk arising from Tesco Bank’s unsecured lending is managed using  
all the normal credit assessment and collections and recoveries systems.  
In terms of liquidity risk Tesco Bank has implemented a conservative 
approach to the minimum amount of liquid assets its holds and to its  
Net Stable Funding Ratio.
Insurance We purchased Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability 
protection from the open insurance market at ‘catastrophe’ level only.  
The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the 
business by using our captive insurance companies, Tesco Insurance 
Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the 
Republic of Ireland. Tesco Insurance Limited covers Assets and Earnings, 
while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability.
Statement of compliance
This Business Review has been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
for a business review under the Companies Act 2006. The Business Review’s 
intent is to provide information to shareholders and should not be relied  
on by any other party or for any other purpose.

those contained in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, 
but are not limited to, those discussed under ‘Risks and uncertainties’ on 
pages 41 to 44 of this document. T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 45
Our business
General information
Principal activity, business review and future developments The 
principal activity of the Group is retailing and associated activities in the 
UK, China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Republic of Ireland, India, 
Japan, Malaysia, Poland, Slovakia, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey and  
the US. The Group also provides retail banking and insurance services 
through its subsidiary Tesco Bank. 
Group results Group revenue (excluding VAT) rose by £3bn to £56.9bn, 
representing an increase of 7.1%. Group profit before tax increased by 
£259m, to £3,176m. Profit for the year was £2,336m, of which £2,327m 
was attributable to equity holders of the parent company. 
Dividends The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend 
of 9.16p per ordinary share, to be paid on 9 July 2010 to members on  
the Register at the close of business on 30 April 2010. Together with the 
interim dividend of 3.89p per ordinary share paid in December 2009,  
the total dividend for the year will be 13.05p compared with 11.96p for  
the previous year, an increase of 9.1%. 
Fixed assets Capital expenditure (excluding business combinations) 
amounted to £3.1bn compared with £4.7bn the previous year. In the 
Directors’ opinion, the properties of the Group have an open market value 
well in excess of the carrying value of £24.8bn which has been included in 
these financial statements. 
Share capital and control of the Company Details of the Company’s 
share capital, including changes during the year in the issued share capital 
and details of the rights attaching to the Company’s Ordinary shares, are 
set out in note 29 on page 116. Details of shares held by the Company’s 
Employee Benefit Trusts are shown in note 27 on page 111. During the year 
no Ordinary shares were repurchased for cancellation. No shareholder 
holds securities carrying special rights with regards to control of the 
Company and there are no restrictions on voting rights. The Board has 
power to purchase the Company’s shares and is seeking renewal of that 
power at the forthcoming AGM within the limits set out in the notice of 
that meeting. 
Shares held by the Company’s Employee Share Incentive Plan Trust, 
International Employee Benefit Trust and Tesco Ireland Share Bonus 
Scheme Trust rank pari passu with the shares in issue and have no special 
rights. Voting rights and rights of acceptance of any offer relating to the 
shares held in these trusts rests with the trustees, who may take account of 
any recommendation from the Company. Voting rights are not exercisable 
by the employees on whose behalf the shares are held in trust. 
The Company is not party to any significant agreements that would take 
effect, alter or terminate following a change of control of the Company. 
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or Officer that 
would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting 
from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company’s share plans may 
cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover. 
Company’s shareholders The Company has been notified that as at 
the date of this report Blackrock, Inc. owns 5.24%, and Legal & General 
Investment Management Limited owns 3.71% of the issued share capital  
of the Company. The Company is not aware of any other shareholders 
with interests of 3% or more in the issued share capital of the Company. 
Articles of Association The Company’s Articles of Association may only 
be amended by special resolution at a General Meeting of the shareholders.

Higginson; Ken Hydon; Sir Terry Leahy; Tim Mason; Laurie McIlwee;  
Lucy Neville-Rolfe CMG; David Potts; David Reid and Jacqueline 
Tammenoms Bakker. The biographical details of the present Directors

Lucy Neville-Rolfe, David Potts and David Reid retire from the Board by 
rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. 
The interests of Directors and their immediate families in the shares of 
Tesco PLC, along with details of Directors’ share options, are contained  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 52 to 66. 
At no time during the year did any of the Directors have a material interest 
in any significant contract with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  
A qualifying third-party indemnity provision as defined in Section 234 of 
the Companies Act 2006 is in force for the benefit of each of the Directors 
and the Company Secretary (who is also a Director of certain subsidiaries 
of the Company) in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office, 
to the extent permitted by law. In respect of those liabilities for which 
Directors may not be indemnified, the Company maintained a Directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the financial year. 
Employment policies The Group depends on the skills and commitment 
of its employees in order to achieve its objectives. Ongoing training 
programmes seek to ensure that employees understand the Group’s 
customer service objectives and strive to achieve them. The Group’s 
selection, training, development and promotion policies ensure equal 
opportunities for all employees regardless of factors such as gender, 
marital status, race, age, sexual preference and orientation, colour, creed, 
ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability or trade union affiliation. All 
decisions are based on merit. Internal communications are designed  
to ensure that employees are well informed about the business of the 
Group. Employees are encouraged to become involved in the financial 
performance of the Group through a variety of schemes, principally the 
Tesco employee profit-sharing scheme (Shares in Success), the savings-
related share option scheme (Save As You Earn) and the partnership  
share plan (Buy As You Earn). 
Political and charitable donations Cash donations to charities 
amounted to £31,221,573 (2009 – £28,278,867). Total contributions to

year, the Group made contributions of £49,365 (2009 – £55,468) in the 
form of sponsorship for political events: Labour Party £15,000; Liberal 
Democrat Party £6,300; Conservative Party £8,384; Scottish National 
Party £5,500; Plaid Cymru £2,000; trade unions £12,181.
Supplier payment policy Tesco PLC is a signatory to the Prompt 
Payment Code. More information about the Code can be found at  
www.promptpaymentcode.org.uk. Payment terms and conditions are 
agreed with suppliers in advance. Tesco PLC has no trade creditors on  
its Balance Sheet. The Group pays its creditors on a pay on time basis 
which varies according to the type of product and territory in which the 
suppliers operate.
Going concern The Directors consider that the Group and the Company 
have adequate resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable  
future and have therefore continued to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the financial statements. As with all business forecasts, the 
Directors’ statement cannot guarantee that the going concern basis will 
remain appropriate given the inherent uncertainty about future events. 
Events after the Balance Sheet date 
There were no material events after the Balance Sheet date. 
Auditors A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
auditors of the Company and the Group will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting. 
Directors’ statement of disclosure of information to auditors 
Having made the requisite enquiries, the Directors in office at the date of 
this Annual Report and Financial Statements have each confirmed that,  
so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined 
by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Group’s auditors 
are unaware, and each of the Directors has taken all the steps he/she ought  
to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of 
that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. Corporate governance
Directors’ report on corporate governance
Tesco PLC is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance 
as we recognise that strong governance is crucial in helping the business  
to deliver its strategy, generating shareholder value and safeguarding our 
shareholders’ long-term interests.
Below Board level, the company fosters a strong culture of good governance, 
including maintaining high ethical standards and strong personal integrity. 
This is formalised in the Group Code of Business Conduct which sets out 
our expectations of employees clearly. All businesses within the Group are 
required to monitor their compliance with the Group governance framework 
and this information is reviewed at Board level.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance sets out guidance in the 
form of principles and provisions on how companies should be directed 
and controlled to follow good governance practice. The Financial Services 
Authority (FSA) requires companies listed in the UK to disclose, in relation 
to Section 1 of the Combined Code, how they have applied the principles 
and whether they have complied with its provisions throughout the 
financial year. Where the provisions have not been complied with 
companies must provide an explanation for this.
The Board considers that Tesco PLC complied in full with the Combined 
Code principles of Corporate Governance and Code of Best Practice for the 
whole of the year ended 27 February 2010, with the exception of provision 
A.3.2, in respect of which the company was not in compliance for part of 
the year. 
Provision A.3.2 requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, should comprise Non-executive Directors determined by the 
Board to be independent. The Board recognises the importance of a 
balanced board with an appropriate level of independence. Due to 
unexpected changes to the Board in the previous year, with the resignation 
of Carolyn McCall and Mervyn Davies as Non-executive Directors, the 
Board was not in balance at the beginning of the year.
At that stage, Ken Hanna’s impending appointment to the Board had 
already been announced, and he joined the Board with effect from  
1 April 2009, at which point the Board became balanced and once again 
fully compliant with provision A.3.2.
Further information on the Combined Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk. 
Board composition and independence 
As at 27 February 2010, the Board of Tesco PLC comprised eight Executive 
Directors, eight independent Non-executive Directors and David Reid, 
Non-executive Chairman. Rodney Chase is Deputy Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director. The size of the Board is appropriate given the 
diverse markets the business operates in and the breadth of operations 
and services offered in each market.
The structure of the Board and the integrity of the individual Directors ensure 
that no single individual or group dominates the decision making process.
Biographies for the Directors can be found on pages 36 and 37 of this report.
Changes to the Board since 1 March 2009 are as follows:
Ken Hanna Non-executive Director Appointed 1 April 2009
Election of Directors
All Directors have to submit themselves for re-election at least every three 
years if they wish to continue serving and are considered by the Board  
to be eligible. The Company’s Articles of Association require all new 
Directors to be submitted for election by shareholders in their first year 
following appointment. 
The Chairman
Clear divisions of accountability and responsibility exist and operate 
effectively for the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive. The 
Chairman has primary responsibility for leading the Board and setting 
its agenda, while the Chief Executive has executive responsibilities for the 
operations and results of the Group and making proposals to the Board  
for the strategic development of the Group.
Senior Independent Director
The Board has appointed one Non-executive Director, Rodney Chase,  
to act as Senior Independent Director. The Senior Independent Director  
is available to shareholders to assist in resolving concerns, should the 
alternative channels be inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director  
is also required to lead the discussion in relation to assessing the 
effectiveness of the Chairman’s performance.
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors bring a wide range of skills and experience,  
as well as independent judgement on strategy, risk and performance to  
the Company.
The independence of each Non-executive Director is assessed at least 
annually. The Combined Code suggests that a Non-executive Director 
should be independent in character and judgement and be free from 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear  
to affect, the Director’s judgement.
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Board responsibilities
The Board held 8 meetings in the year. It also held a two day off-site 
meeting which considered the Group’s strategy. The Board has set out a 
clear Schedule of Matters Reserved for Board Decision in order to ensure 
its overall control of the Group’s affairs. These include the approval of:
• the Company’s strategic and operating plans;
• annual and interim financial statements;
• major acquisitions and disposals;
• authority levels for expenditure;
• treasury policies;
• risk management and internal control systems;
• group governance policies; and 
• succession planning for senior executives. 
The Board delegates to management the detailed planning and 
implementation of these matters in accordance with appropriate risk 
parameters. The Board monitors compliance with policy and achievement 
against objectives by holding management accountable for its activities 
through regular updates. In addition, each substantial business within the 
Group is required to present to the Board on a regular basis, giving it the 
opportunity to understand and explore issues as deemed necessary.
During the year ended 27 February 2010, the Board’s scheduled activities 
included the following:
• approving interim and full year results;
•  receiving reports from the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee 
and Nominations Committee;
•  receiving reports from other key committees within the Group, including 
the Compliance Committee, Corporate Responsibility Committee and 
Finance Committee;
•  receiving reports on governance issues affecting the group, including 
stakeholder management;
•  receiving regular reports on risk management within the Group, 
including the Key Risk Register;
•  discussing and approving Group strategy;
•  receiving a report on the effectiveness of the Board;
•  receiving reports from key businesses within the Group; and
•  receiving regular reports on the financial position of the Group and the 
various businesses within the Group.
46 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Corporate governance
All Directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and 
may take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense  
in conducting their duties. The Company provides insurance cover and 
indemnities for its Directors and officers. 
Attendance at meetings
The Board scheduled 8 meetings in the year ended 27 February 2010,  
and ad hoc meetings were also convened to deal with matters between 
scheduled meetings as appropriate. It is expected that all Directors attend 
Board and relevant Committee meetings, unless they are prevented from 
doing so by prior commitments, and that all Directors will attend the AGM. 
Where Directors are unable to attend meetings due to conflicts in their 
schedules, they receive the papers scheduled for discussion in the relevant 
meetings, giving them the opportunity to relay any comments to the 
Chairman in advance of the meeting. Directors leave the meeting where 
matters relating to them, or which may constitute a conflict of interest  
to them, are being discussed. The table below shows the attendance  
of Directors at scheduled Board meetings and at meetings of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees during the year. 
Board processes
The Board governs through a number of Board Committees – in particular, 
the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees – to which certain 
responsibilities and duties are delegated. These Committees are properly 
authorised under the constitution of the Company to take decisions and 
act on behalf of the Board within the parameters laid down by the Board. 
The Board is kept fully informed of the work of these Committees and any 
issues requiring resolution are referred to the full Board as appropriate.  
A summary of the operations of these Committees is set out below. The 
effectiveness of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees is 
underpinned by their Non-executive Director membership, which provides 
independent insight on governance matters. A copy of each Committee’s 
Terms of Reference is available on our website www.tesco.com/boardprocess. 
The Board is serviced by the Company Secretary, who reports to the 
Chairman in respect of his core duties to the Board.

The Nominations Committee leads the process 
for Board appointments and the re-election  
and succession of Directors, as well as making 
recommendations for the membership of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
The Committee is chaired by David Reid and the Company Secretary  
also attends meetings in his capacity as Secretary of the Committee. 
Where matters discussed relate to the Chairman, the Senior Independent 
Director chairs the meeting. 
The Nominations Committee met formally once in the year to discuss  
the ongoing shape and capability of the Board. There were also a number 
of ad hoc meetings during the year. As well as reviewing the performance 
and development of the Executive Directors and the senior executive levels 
below the Board, the Committee also regularly considers:
• the Board structure, size, and composition;
•  the skills, experience and knowledge of the Board and identifies 
candidates to fill Board vacancies and enhance its capability;
•  succession planning for directors and other senior executives in the 
course of its work, taking into account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the company, and what skills and expertise are therefore needed 
on the Board in the future;
•  the time commitment required from Non-executive Directors;
•  the leadership needs of the organisation, both executive and 
non-executive, with a view to ensuring the continued ability of  
the organisation to compete effectively in the marketplace; and
•  strategic issues and commercial changes affecting the Group and the 
market in which it operates.
Individual members of the Committee were involved during the year  
in interviewing candidates for Board and senior executive positions.

Members (all independent Non-executive 
Directors):
• Charles Allen (Chairman)
• Patrick Cescau
• Rodney Chase
• Karen Cook
• Dr Harald Einsmann
• Ken Hanna (from 1 April 2009)
The Remuneration Committee’s role is to 
determine and recommend to the Board the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors.  
It also monitors the levels and structure of 
remuneration for senior management and 
seeks to ensure that the remuneration 
arrangements are designed to attract, retain 
and motivate the Executive Directors needed 
to run the Company successfully. 
At the invitation of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board normally 
attends meetings and the Chief Executive attends as appropriate. 
Representatives of the Group’s Personnel and Finance functions attend  
as appropriate to provide support and the Company Secretary also attends 
in his capacity as Secretary of the Committee.
The Committee met seven times this year. Each year it conducts a review 
of the Committee’s own effectiveness and its Terms of Reference. The 
responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee and an explanation of 
how it applies the Directors’ remuneration principles of the Combined 
Code, are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 66.

Audit Committee 
Members (all independent Non-executive 
Directors):
• Ken Hydon (Chairman)
• Patrick Cescau
• Rodney Chase
• Ken Hanna (from 1 April 2009)
Other regular attendees at the invitation 
of the Committee include:
• Chairman of the Board
• Finance Director and his representatives
• Head of Internal Audit
• Corporate and Legal Affairs Director
• Relevant Executive Directors
• External Auditors
The Company Secretary also attends in his 
capacity as Secretary of the Committee. 
The Combined Code requires the Audit Committee to include at least one 
member with recent and relevant financial experience. The Committee 
Chairman fulfils this requirement, and all other Committee members have 
an appropriate understanding of financial matters.
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are:
• to review the financial statements;
• to review the Group’s internal control and risk assurance processes;
•  to consider the appointment of the external auditors, their reports to 
the Committee and their independence, which includes an assessment 
of their appropriateness to conduct any non-audit work; and
• to review the programme of Internal Audit.
The Committee met formally four times this year. There was also an 
additional ad hoc meeting. While fulfilling the above responsibilities, 
during the year the Committee received presentations from significant 
businesses within the Group, as well as on fraud, bribery and corruption, 
business continuity, IT controls and governance and whistleblowing. Each 
year the Committee conducts a review of its own effectiveness and its 
Terms of Reference. The Committee also had regular private meetings 
with the external auditors and the Head of Internal Audit during the year. 
The need for training is kept under review and the annual agenda  
ensures time is dedicated to technical updates which are generally 
provided by external experts. This year training was provided on 
accounting and reporting developments under IFRS and IAS and 
governance developments proposed by the FRC. With respect to Tesco 
Bank, training was provided on regulatory, accounting, governance  
and risk management requirements. Training is also provided to meet 
specific individual needs of Committee members.

Management of the Group – Executive Committee
The Board delegates responsibility for formulating and implementing the 
Group’s strategic plan and for management of the Group to the Executive 
Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Executive and comprises the 
eight Executive Directors and a senior executive, Colin Holmes, who was 
appointed as a member of the Committee on 7 September 2009. The 
Committee has authority for decision-making in all areas except those  
set out in the Schedule of Matters Reserved for Board Decision and meets 
formally on a regular basis. A number of other senior executives also  
attend the Committee and their valuable operational experience helps 
broaden the debate. Their attendance facilitates the communication  
of the Committee’s decisions to the rest of the Group. The Company 
Secretary attends in his capacity as Secretary of the Committee.
The Executive Committee is responsible for implementing Group strategy 
and policy and for monitoring the performance and compliance of the 
business, drawing on the work of relevant committees, and reporting on 
these matters in full to the Board.
The Executive Committee has set up further committees – including the 
Finance, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committees (which are 
described in more detail below) – and operational groups which have 
responsibility for implementing the key elements of the Group’s strategic 
plan and managing its UK and international operations, joint ventures, 
property acquisitions, finance, funding and people matters. These 
committees and groups have as members an appropriate mixture of 
Executive Directors and senior management from relevant functions. 
Procedures to deal with Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Company has procedures in place to deal with the situation where  
a Director has a conflict of interest. As part of these procedures members 
of the Board are required to:
• consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts;
•  consider the conflict situation in conjunction with the rest of their 
duties under Companies Act 2006;
•  keep records and Board minutes as to authorisation granted by 
Directors and the scope of any approvals given; and
• regularly review conflict authorisation.
Training and development
All new Directors receive a personalised induction programme, tailored  
to their experience, background and particular areas of focus, which is 
designed to develop their knowledge and understanding of the Group’s 
culture and operations. The programme has evolved taking into account 
feedback from new directors, and will usually include an overview of the 
business model and Board processes, meetings with the Executive team 
and senior managers, site visits at home and abroad and briefings on  
key issues (including social, ethical and environmental (SEE) issues). 
Directors also receive an induction to those Board Committees he or she  
will serve on. 
The need for Director training is regularly assessed by the Board and 
regular training sessions are arranged to provide an opportunity for 
upskilling of the Directors on a variety of areas relevant to the Group’s 
business, including SEE issues. In the last year the Board received training 
focusing, inter alia, on the regulatory and governance issues associated 
with operating a financial services business, following the acquisition of 
Tesco Bank in the previous year.
The Board usually meets overseas once each year to facilitate the Directors’ 
understanding of the Group’s international operations. In February 2010,  
the Board visited China and Korea to view first hand the progress and 
direction of the business in these markets. In July 2009, the Company  
held its Annual General Meeting in Scotland and the Board took the 
opportunity to visit some strategically significant parts of the business  
in this region.
Board performance evaluation 
The performance of the Board is a fundamental component of the Group’s 
success. The Board regularly reviews its own performance. During the year 
ended 27 February 2010, the Board assessed its own performance. This 
assessment was co-ordinated and directed by the Chairman with the 
support of the Company Secretary. The Chairman and the Company 
Secretary carried out in-depth interviews with each Director. The results of 
the evaluation were considered by the Board, and confirmed the strength 
of the strategic and entrepreneurial leadership of the Company, a sound 
governance framework and practices compliant with the Combined Code.
The Chief Executive reviews the performance of each Executive Director. 
The Chairman reviews the performance of the Chief Executive and each 
Non-executive Director. During the year, the Chairman met several times 
with the Non-executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present, 
to discuss Board issues and how to build the best possible team. The Senior 
Independent Director met with the Non-executive Directors, in the absence 
of the Chairman, to assess the Chairman’s performance.
Risk management and internal controls 
Accountabilities 
Accepting that risk is an inherent part of doing business, our risk 
management systems are designed both to encourage entrepreneurial 
spirit and also provide assurance that risk is fully understood and managed. 
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal 
control within the context of achieving the Group’s objectives. Executive 
management is responsible for implementing and maintaining the 
necessary control systems. The role of Internal Audit is to monitor the 
overall internal control systems and report on their effectiveness to 
Executive management, as well as to the Audit Committee, in order  
to facilitate its review of the systems. 
Background 
The Group has a five-year rolling business plan to support the delivery of 
its strategy of long-term growth and returns for shareholders. Every business 
unit and support function derives its objectives from the five-year plan and 
these are cascaded to managers and staff by way of personal objectives. 
Key to delivering effective risk management is ensuring our people have  
a good understanding of the Group’s strategy and our policies, procedures, 
values and expected performance. We have a structured internal 
communications programme that provides employees with a clear 
definition of the Group’s purpose and goals, accountabilities and the  
scope of permitted activities for each business unit, as well as individual 
line managers and other employees. This ensures that all our people 
understand what is expected of them and that decision-making takes 
place at the appropriate level. We recognise that our people may face 
ethical dilemmas in the normal course of business so we provide clear 
guidance based on the Tesco Values. The Values set out the standards  
that we wish to uphold in how we treat people. These are supported  
by the Group Code of Business Conduct which was launched this year, 
replacing the Code of Ethics, and offers guidance on relationships  
between the Group and its employees, suppliers and contractors.
We operate a balanced scorecard approach that is known within the  
Group as our Steering Wheel. This unites the Group’s resources around  
our customers, people, operations, community and finance. The Steering 
Wheel operates at all levels throughout the Group. It enables the business 
to be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard for  
all stakeholders. 
Risk management 
The Group maintains a Key Risk Register. The Register contains the key 
risks faced by the Group including their impact and likelihood, as well as 
the controls and procedures implemented to mitigate these risks. The 
content of the Register is determined through regular discussions with 
senior management and reviewed by the Executive Committee and the full 
Board. A balanced approach allows the degree of controllability to be taken 
into account when we consider the effectiveness of mitigation, recognising 
that some necessary activities carry inherent risk which may be outside  
T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 49 Corporate governance continued
the Group’s control. Where our risk management process identifies 
opportunities to improve the business these are built into our future plans.  
Our key risks are summarised on pages 41 to 44 of the Business Review. 
The risk management process is cascaded through the Group with 
operating subsidiary boards maintaining their own risk registers and 
assessing their own control systems. The same process also applies 
functionally in those parts of the Group requiring greater oversight. For 
example, the Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference require it to oversee 
the Finance Risk Register. The Board assesses significant Social, Ethical 
and Environmental (SEE) risks to the Group’s short-term and long-term 
value, and incorporates SEE risks on the Key Risk Register where they are 
considered material or appropriate.
We recognise the value of the ABI Guidelines on Responsible Investment 
Disclosure and confirm that, as part of its regular risk assessment 
procedures, the Board takes account of the significance of SEE matters  
to the business of the Group. We recognise that a number of investors  
and other stakeholders take a keen interest in how companies manage 
SEE matters and so we report more detail on our SEE policies and 
approach to managing material risks arising from SEE matters and the 
KPIs we use both on our website (www.tesco.com/cr2010) and in our 
Corporate Responsibility Report 2010. To provide further assurance,  
the Group’s Corporate Responsibility KPIs are audited on a regular  
basis by Internal Audit.
Internal controls 
The Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and 
for reviewing the effectiveness of such a system. We have a Group-wide 
process for clearly establishing the risks and responsibilities assigned to 
each level of management and the controls which are required to be 
operated and monitored. 
The CEOs of subsidiary businesses are required to certify by way of  
annual governance returns that appropriate governance and compliance 
processes have been adopted. For certain joint ventures, the Board places 
reliance upon the internal control systems operating within our partners’ 
infrastructures and the obligations upon partners’ boards relating to the 
effectiveness of their own systems. 
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable  
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of internal controls and is 
satisfied that the controls in place remain appropriate.
Monitoring 
The Board oversees the monitoring system and has set specific 
responsibilities for itself and the various committees as set out below. Both 
Internal Audit and our external auditors play key roles in the monitoring 
process, as do several other committees including the Finance Committee, 
Compliance Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee.  
The Minutes of the Audit Committee and the various other committees 
(Finance, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committees) are 
distributed to the Board and each Committee submits a report for formal 
discussion at least once a year. These processes provide assurance that  
the Group is operating legally, ethically and in accordance with approved 
financial and operational policies. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee reports to the Board each year on its review of the 
effectiveness of the internal control systems for the financial year and the 
period to the date of approval of the financial statements. Throughout  
the year the Committee receives regular reports from the external auditors 
covering topics such as quality of earnings and technical accounting 
developments. The Committee also receives updates from Internal Audit 
and has dialogue with senior managers on their control responsibilities. It 
should be understood that such systems are designed to provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Internal Audit 
The Internal Audit department is fully independent of business operations 
and has a Group-wide mandate. It undertakes a programme to address 
internal control and risk management processes with particular reference 
to the Turnbull Guidance. It operates a risk-based methodology, ensuring 
that the Group’s key risks receive appropriate regular examination. Its 
responsibilities include maintaining the Key Risk Register, reviewing and 
reporting on the effectiveness of risk management systems and internal 
control with the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and ultimately 
to the Board. Internal Audit facilitates oversight of risk and control systems 
across the Group through risk committees in Asia and Europe and audit 
committees in a number of our international businesses and joint ventures. 
The Head of Internal Audit also attends all Audit Committee meetings. 
External audit 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who have been the Company’s external 
auditor for a number of years, contributes a further independent 
perspective on certain aspects of our internal financial control systems 
arising from its work, and reports to both the Board and the Audit 
Committee. Our policy in relation to the reappointment of the external 
auditors is to consider their engagement and independence annually.  
The Committee has satisfied itself that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  
is independent and there are adequate controls in place to safeguard its 
objectivity. One such measure is the non-audit services policy that sets  
out criteria for employing external auditors and identifies areas where it is 
inappropriate for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to work. Non-audit services 
work carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is predominantly the 
review of subsidiary undertakings’ statutory accounts, transaction work 
and corporate tax services, where their services are considered to be the 
most appropriate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also follows its own  
ethical guidelines and continually reviews its audit team to ensure its 
independence is not compromised.  
Finance Committee 
Membership of the Finance Committee includes Non-executive Directors 
with relevant financial expertise, Executive Directors and members of 
senior management. The Committee is chaired by Sir Terry Leahy, CEO. 
The Committee usually meets twice a year and its role is to review and 
agree the Finance Plan on an annual basis, review reports of the Treasury 
and Tax functions and to review and approve Treasury limits and 
delegations. 
Compliance Committee 
Membership of the Compliance Committee includes three Executive 
Directors and members of senior management. The Committee is chaired 
by Lucy Neville-Rolfe, Corporate and Legal Affairs Director. The Committee 
normally meets six times a year and its remit is to ensure that the Group 
complies with all necessary laws and regulations and other compliance 
policies in all of its operations world-wide. The Committee has established 
a schedule for the regular review of operational activities and legal 
exposure. Each business in the Group has a Compliance Committee 
designed to ensure compliance with both local and Group policies, and 
each Compliance Committee reports to the Group Compliance Committee 
at least once a year. 
Corporate Responsibility Committee 
The Corporate Responsibility Committee is chaired by the Corporate  
and Legal Affairs Director, Lucy Neville-Rolfe and membership is made  
up of senior executives from across the Group. It meets at least four times 
a year to support, develop and monitor policies on SEE issues and to 
review threats and opportunities for the Group. Progress in developing 
Community initiatives is monitored by the use of relevant KPIs for the 
businesses within the Group. The Board formally discusses the work of  
the Committee on a regular basis, including progress in implementing  
our Community Plan. 
The Corporate and Legal Affairs department and the Trading Law and 
Technical department provide assurance and advice on legal compliance, 
health and safety, and SEE matters. These functions report on their work 
on a regular basis and escalate matters as appropriate. 
50 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Corporate governance
Whistleblowing
The Group operates a whistleblowing policy and has a confidential 
‘Protector Line’ service accessible to concerned employees where they  
can report, anonymously if necessary, on issues of malpractice within  
the business. Such issues include illegal and unethical behaviour such as 
fraud, dishonesty and any practices that endanger our staff, customers  
or the environment. 
Complaints made are treated as confidential and are investigated. Where 
appropriate, matters will be escalated to the Director of Group Security  
for further action.
Management 
In our fast moving business, trading is tracked on a daily and weekly basis, 
financial performance is reviewed weekly and monthly and the Steering 
Wheel is reviewed quarterly. Steering Wheels are operated in business 
units across the Group and reports are prepared of performance against 
target KPIs covering the five segments of the Steering Wheel (Customer, 
Operations, Community, People and Finance) on a quarterly basis, 
enabling management to measure performance. All major initiatives 
require business cases normally covering a minimum period of five years. 
Post-investment appraisals, carried out by management, determine the 
reasons for any significant variance from expected performance. 
Relations with stakeholders
We are committed to having a constructive dialogue with stakeholders to 
ensure we understand what is important to them and allow ourselves the 
opportunity to present our position. Engagement helps us identify new 
risks and opportunities to ensure that our long-term strategy is sustainable. 
In some instances we find that working with stakeholders in partnership 
can help deliver shared goals. We might not be able to satisfy all stakeholder 
concerns all the time but through engagement we can do our best to 
balance competing demands. We know that customers need to be able  
to trust our business and they will only trust us if they believe that we are 
engaging on an appropriate basis with our stakeholders. 
Our programme of engaging with stakeholders including customers,  
staff, suppliers, investors, government, regulators, non-governmental 
organisations and others, is set out in more detail in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report 2010 and on our website (www.tesco.com/cr2010). 
Shareholder engagement
We are committed to maintaining a good dialogue with shareholders 
through proactively organising meetings and presentations as well as 
responding to a wide range of enquiries. We seek shareholder views on  
a range of issues from strategy to corporate governance and SEE issues. 
We recognise the importance of communicating appropriately any 
significant Company developments.
During the year, the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director  
met with most of our leading shareholders to discuss issues relating to  
the Board, strategy and governance matters, as well as new developments 
within the business. The Chairman’s meetings with major shareholders 
took place independently from the Executive team. In addition to this,  
our Investor Relations team engage with shareholders on a regular basis, 
and on a wide range of issues. The Corporate Secretariat team also 
organise regular meetings, on both a one-to-one and group basis, with 
socially responsible investors (SRIs) to discuss the work the Group is  
doing on corporate responsibility and governance-related issues. These 
meetings are attended as appropriate by Directors and other members  
of senior management.
An Investor Relations report is produced for the Board periodically. This 
report summarises feedback from shareholders particularly in terms of  
our management and strategy, and ensures the Board has a balanced 
perspective on the views of our major shareholders.
It is normal that institutional shareholders may be in more regular contact 
with the Group than other shareholders, but care is exercised to ensure 
that any price-sensitive information is released to all shareholders, 
institutional and private, at the same time in accordance with applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements. All major presentations to institutional 
shareholders are made available to private shareholders through the 
Tesco PLC website.
Every shareholder may choose to receive a full Annual Report and  
Financial Statements or the Annual Review and Summary Financial 
Statements, either in paper or electronic form. These reports, together 
with publicly-made trading statements, are available on the Group’s 
website, www.tesco.com/annualreport2010
The Tesco PLC AGM
The Annual General Meeting offers the opportunity for the Board to 
communicate directly to shareholders. Our last Annual General Meeting  
in July 2009 was held in Glasgow. The 2010 AGM will be held in London  
at 10.30am on Friday 2 July. The choice of location is based on our policy 
of widening the opportunity for our shareholders around the country to 
attend the AGM, by moving to a different location in the UK each year.
The whole Board attends the meeting and is available to answer questions 
from shareholders present. To encourage shareholder participation, we 
offer electronic proxy voting and voting through the CREST electronic 
proxy appointment service. At our last Annual General Meeting, all 
resolutions were voted by way of electronic poll. This follows best practice 
guidelines and allows the Company to count all votes, not just those  
of shareholders attending the meeting. The Chairman announces  
the provisional voting results at the meeting, and the final results are 
announced the same day through the Regulatory News Services and  
the Tesco PLC website.

T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 51 Directors’ remuneration report
This report sets out the remuneration policy for the Executive and Non-
executive Directors of Tesco PLC and describes the individual remuneration  
of the Directors for the year ended 27 February 2010. The report has been 
drawn up in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the Financial Services 
Authority Listing Rules.
Executive summary
Tesco aims to deliver, sustainable and profitable long-term growth.  
Despite challenging economic conditions across our markets, Tesco has 
again delivered a strong performance against targets this year. In doing  
so, Tesco has continued to build on the track record it has established  
over several years.

Tesco is already a large and profitable company. A 10% increase in 
Company value equates to some £3bn in additional shareholder value, 
equivalent to the value of a top 50 FTSE organisation. Over the last  
5 years, Tesco has delivered more than £10bn of additional shareholder  
value through dividends and share price growth. Continuing to grow 
profitability from such a high base is demanding but forms the core  
of Tesco’s strategy and its supporting processes including executive 
remuneration. Our remuneration strategy is intended to foster a culture  
of outstanding performance, taking into account both the short-term  
and long-term needs of the business.
In determining the level of executive reward, the Remuneration Committee 
continues to be conscious of the economic background and widespread 
concern about executive remuneration being appropriately justified by 
company performance. It has therefore sought to ensure reward outcomes 
are proportionate to Tesco’s performance outcome.
The strong result against targets in 2009/10 included improvement on 
most of the underlying performance measures relating to productivity  
and growth. Against this performance background, the main aspects  
of executive remuneration policy and practice for the year are as follows:
•  Operational Executive Director salaries were increased from 1 July 2009 
by an average of 2.58% after the normal review (against an average 
across the Group of 2.5%);
•  annual bonus payouts ranged from 75% to 95% of maximum reflecting 
strong performance during the year against financial and strategic 
milestones. The maximum potential bonus was 250% of salary for the 
Group CEO, 300% of salary for the US CEO and 200% of salary for 
other Executive Directors;
•  long-term incentive payout was 124 of a potential maximum of 150% 
of salary;
•  share options vested in full reflecting sustained strong earnings delivery;
•  no material changes were made to policy, remuneration mix or scale 
of incentives;
•  deferred awards, already earned from prior years, representing 
4.5 million shares became available to Directors; 
•  there have been no substantial changes to the commercial structure 
of the terms of existing awards, however, a number of shares have  
been released from awards already earned from prior years to satisfy  
tax liabilities crystallised in the year;
•  minor changes to remuneration arrangements relating to leaving 
conditions were approved by shareholders; and
•  there continued to be a high level of share ownership by 
Executive Directors.
Executive Director remuneration strategy
Tesco has a long-standing policy of valuing talent and experience. We seek 
to provide incentives for delivering high, sustainable and profitable growth 
which leads to a strong increase in additional value for shareholders. We 
operate in a keenly competitive and rapidly changing retail environment. 
Business success depends on the skills of each member of the key team, 
but outstanding business performance comes from teamwork. Tesco has a 
stable and successful management team, and incentivising and rewarding 
that team at senior levels to deliver ever higher levels of performance is 
vital to our ongoing success and our ability to create shareholder value.  
We believe our incentives should support the continued progress and  
the strengthening of our returns from across the Group, as well as the 
creation and development of significant new businesses.

52 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Remumeration report
The Remuneration Committee believes that the majority of total 
remuneration should be performance-related and delivered largely  
in shares closely to align the interests of shareholders and Executive 
Directors. In determining the balance between the fixed and variable 
elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages, the 
Committee takes into account both policy and market practice.
Total remuneration levels for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by 
the Committee taking into account their value to the Company in terms of 
continuing strong performance, potential and competitive market practice. 
Consideration is also given to reward levels at the next tier of management 
and across the Group in order to sustain a common sense of purpose and 
sharing of success as well as to ensure that executive arrangements remain 
appropriate in the context of wider Group remuneration. When setting the 
remuneration of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the Group’s 
performance against a mixture of corporate objectives and financial 
measures. These corporate objectives include specific measures based  
on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, an integral part  
of the corporate strategy. Inclusion of these specific measures in a number 
of parts of the remuneration structure helps to reinforce positive and 
responsible behaviour by senior management. To find out more go to 
www.tesco.com/annualreport2010
Performance related remuneration
The remuneration structures for Executive Directors and other key 
executives are tailored to emphasise the delivery of strong year-on-year 
earnings growth as well as sustained performance in the longer term.  
More than two-thirds of total remuneration (excluding pension) is linked  
to the performance of the business. Long-term performance is rewarded 
through delivery of shares and short-term performance through a 
combination of cash and compulsorily deferred shares. This combines 
emphasis on strong year-on-year performance with long-term executive 
share ownership, providing a strong link between the incentives received 
and shareholder value.
Performance measures
The Executive Directors have a range of performance targets across the 
various incentive plans which reflect the objectives of the Group and their 
own responsibilities and are aligned with long-term shareholder value 
creation. Targets are generally set to reward performance improvement 
compared to prior periods, with maximum awards only paying out for 
delivery of strong performance.
The measures are summarised in the table below and are based on:
•  delivery of improved bottom-line financial results, measured through 
earnings, both in the present year and sustainably over time;
•  enhancement of efficient profitability, measured through return on 
capital, whilst growing the business;
•  improving share price via the use of share options throughout the 
organisation;
•  achievement of durable improvements in the underlying drivers 
of performance such as cost reduction, energy efficiency, reduced 
environmental impact and sales growth captured through various 
corporate measures; and
•  laying foundations for future performance through measures such 
as accessing new sales footage, developing people and implementing 
community programmes which are also captured through the  
corporate measures.
The sustainability of our business is key and the Remuneration Committee 
is satisfied that the measures and targets do not incentivise Executive 
Directors to take an inappropriate level of risk.

T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 53 Directors’ remuneration report continued
Participation in the various elements is governed by the Remuneration 
Committee and individual Executive Directors are awarded incentives 
under the elements which are most relevant to their sphere of responsibility.
If performance is lower than the maximum targets, incentive payments will 
reduce accordingly and will be zero if threshold levels of performance are 
not attained. The Committee has reviewed the performance conditions for 
each of the incentive arrangements against the Group’s business strategy, 
its growing global leadership, its position as one of the companies at the 
top of the FTSE 100 and the intensely competitive sector in which it operates, 
and has concluded that they provide a set of comprehensive and robust 
measures of management’s effort and success in creating shareholder value.
Share ownership guidelines
The Remuneration Committee believes that Executive Directors holding 
shares aligns their interests with shareholders and reinforces their 
commitment to the business. Executive Directors are required to build  
and maintain a shareholding with a value at least equal to their basic  
salary. Shares held in plans which are not subject to forfeiture are included  
in this measurement. New appointees will typically be allowed three  
years to establish this shareholding. Full participation in the long-term 
Performance Share Plan is conditional upon maintaining the minimum 
shareholding. All Executive Directors satisfy this requirement, apart from 
Laurie McIlwee, who was appointed to the Board on 27 January 2009.

Includes ordinary shares and awards of shares and nil cost options made to Directors which 
remain subject only to a holding period. Excludes unexercised vested executive share options.
Funding of equity awards
Executive incentive arrangements are funded by a mix of newly issued 
shares and shares purchased in the market. Where shares are newly issued 
the Company complies with ABI dilution guidelines on their issue. Currently 
shares to be issued in respect of executive plans are equivalent to c.4% of 
shares in issue.
Fixed remuneration
Basic pay
Basic pay is designed to attract and retain talented individuals. It needs  
to reflect individual capability and any changes in responsibilities as the 
Group faces new opportunities and challenges. As the Group continues  
to diversify into new product areas and services, as well as expanding 
internationally, it seeks to reflect this in the benchmarking that is used.  
We examine salary levels at the major retailers, the leading FTSE 
companies and ensure consideration is given to key international 
competitors. We also take into account pay conditions throughout the 
Group as well as the prevailing economic climate in deciding executive 
annual salary increases. The average increase for senior management 
below Board level last year was 2.58%, in line with the average increase  
for other staff which was typically around 2.5%. Pay levels Group-wide  
are determined with consideration to a number of factors, including the 
prevailing economic environment, discussions with employee 
representation groups and market practice.
Basic salaries are typically increased with effect from 1 July each year  
and the Remuneration Committee will again be taking into account the 
prevailing economic climate in setting Executive Director salaries for the 
coming year.

Pensions
Pension provision is central to our ability to foster loyalty and retain 
experience which is why Tesco wants to ensure that the Tesco PLC Pension 
Scheme is a highly valued benefit. All Executive Directors are members  
of the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme which provides a pension of up to  
two-thirds of base salary on retirement, normally at age 60, dependent  
on service. The Final Salary Scheme is now closed to new entrants but has 
been replaced throughout the organisation by a different defined-benefit 
pension scheme based on career average earnings. Since April 2006, 
following implementation of the regulations contained within the Finance 
Act 2004, Executive Directors have been eligible to receive the maximum 
pension that can be provided from the registered pension scheme. The 
balance of any pension entitlement for all Executive Directors is delivered 
through an unapproved retirement benefits scheme (SURBS). Except for 
Tim Mason, the SURBS is ‘secured’ by using a fixed charge over a cash 
deposit in a designated account.
Over the last few years pension contributions by our Executive Directors 
have been increasing progressively. In 2009/10 the level of contribution 
was 8% of salary which is in line with senior management’s contribution 
levels. Contributions will rise over the next two years to 10% by 2011/12. 
Further details of the pension benefits earned by the Directors can be 
found on page 58.
All employee share schemes
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s all 
employee share schemes on the same terms as other UK employees. 
•   Shares In Success. Shares in the Company are allocated to participants 
in the scheme up to HMRC approved limits (currently £3,000 per 
annum). The amount of profit allocated to the scheme is determined  
by the Board, taking account of Company performance.
•  Buy as You Earn. An HMRC approved share purchase scheme under 
which employees invest up to a limit of £110 on a four-weekly basis  
to buy shares at market value in Tesco PLC.
•  Save as You Earn. An HMRC approved savings-related share option 
scheme under which employees save up to a limit of £250 on a four 
weekly basis via a bank/building society with an option to buy shares  
in Tesco PLC at the end of a three-year or five-year period at a discount 
of up to 20% of the market value. There are no performance conditions 
attached to SAYE options.
Other benefits
The Executive Directors are eligible for car benefits, life assurance, 
disability and health insurance and staff discount.
2009/10 Performance measurement
Short-term performance 2009/10
Earnings per share
The reported underlying diluted Group EPS for 2009/10 was 31.66p,  
an increase of 9.1% on last year.
Corporate objectives
The corporate objectives are based on our balanced scorecard, known  
as the Steering Wheel. Corporate objectives for the awards made in 
respect of the financial year 2009/10 included increasing sales from  
new space; specific profit targets for international businesses and for 
retailing services; like-for-like sales growth and the development of the 
non-food business; focus on developing trading models internationally; 
enhancing talent management and capability; embedding the new 
international Community Plans and Community Promises; and reducing 
our environmental impact. Performance against most targets was within 
the target range.
Total shareholder return
The graph below highlights the Group’s total shareholder return 
performance over the last five financial years, relative to the FTSE 100 
index of companies. This index has been selected to provide an established 
and broad-based comparator group of retail and non-retail companies of  
a similar scale to Tesco.

TSR is the notional return from a share or index based on share price 
movements and declared dividends.
The Committee considers TSR performance against the FTSE 100 and a 
comparator group of international retailers that includes Ahold, Carrefour, 
J Sainsbury, Metro, Morrisons, Safeway Inc, Target and Walmart. 
Following the Remuneration Committee’s consideration of the extent to 
which the various performance measures (EPS, corporate objectives and 
TSR) in respect of the 2009/10 award were achieved, the Executive Directors 
have been awarded 95% of the potential maximum for the cash element 
and 94% of the potential maximum for the deferred shares element of their 
annual bonus. The Committee believes that this level of bonus appropriately 
reflects the strong performance against financial and strategic milestones.
US objectives
Additional awards are made to Tim Mason and Sir Terry Leahy subject to 
performance conditions which measure the progress of the US business 
against a range of aggressive targets related to the development of  
this business. During 2009/10 advances were made on most measures 
including store development, sales growth, cost management and 
customer factors. However, the ongoing economic downturn did continue 
to act as a constraint over the year on the pace of growth against the 
demanding development objectives.
The Remuneration Committee has assessed the bonus outturn for 
2009/10 and Tim Mason has been awarded 65% of the potential 
maximum for both the cash and deferred shares elements of that part  
of his annual bonus which is measured by reference to US-specific targets. 
Sir Terry Leahy has been awarded 65% of the potential maximum  
for that part of his annual bonus which is measured by reference to 
US-specific targets and which is satisfied in deferred shares.
Long-term performance 2009/10
Earnings per share
The three-year performance period for the 2007/8 Executive Option grant 
over shares with a value of 200% of salary at the date of grant ended at 
the financial year end 2009/10. Vesting of these options was conditional  
on the achievement of earnings per share performance conditions, with 
the first 100% subject to the achievement of underlying diluted EPS 
growth of at least RPI plus 9% over three years with the balance vesting 
for achieving growth of at least RPI plus 15%. There is no re-testing of 
performance. The increase in underlying diluted EPS relative to RPI over 
the three years from 2007/8 to 2009/10 exceeded 15% and these options 
will therefore vest in full on the third anniversary of their grant.
Return on capital employed
Following the completion of the three-year performance period for the 
2007/8 PSP award, the Committee considered the level of performance 
against the target for the first 75% of the PSP award of achieving post-tax 
Group ROCE of 14.2% by the end of 2009/10. Post-tax ROCE (calculated  
on a like-for-like basis with the target originally set) at the end of 2009/10 
was 14.2%, so the full amount of the first 75% of the award will vest.  
The Committee also exercised its judgement as to the extent to which  
the remaining 25% of the PSP award should vest as a result of superior 
ROCE performance, taking into account factors including the level of 
T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 55 Directors’ remuneration report continued
ROCE achieved, the expected ROCE for additional and existing capital 
investment, whether capital spend was in line with strategic objectives  
and balanced short-term and long-term investment needs, the level  
of sales and underlying profit growth and whether this reflected other 
developments in the marketplace. Having considered these factors  
in detail the Committee concluded that all of the remaining 25% of the 
award should vest. A total of 100% of the 2007/8 PSP award measured  
on group performance will therefore vest.
For the 50% of salary award which related to International ROCE 
performance, the Committee considered the level of performance against 
the target for the first 75% of the International PSP award of achieving 
post-tax International ROCE of 8.1% by the end of 2009/10. Post-tax 
International ROCE (calculated on a like-for-like basis with the target 
originally set) at the end of 2009/10 was 6.9% so 23.1 of the first 75% of 
the award will vest. The Committee also exercised its judgement as to the 
extent to which the remaining 25% of the PSP award should vest as a 
result of superior ROCE performance, taking into account the factors 
outlined above, the Committee concluded that all of the remaining 25%  
of the International PSP award should vest. A total of 48.1% of the 2007/8 
PSP award measured on international performance will therefore vest.
Future performance measures
The Committee has determined that no change is required for the coming 
year in the form of incentive arrangements, nor in the relative balance 
between them. The maximum opportunity under incentive arrangements 
will remain the same for the 2010/11 year (as set out on pages 53 and 54). 
The same principles as described earlier were also adopted in the 
determination of performance targets. 
Short-term performance targets
We do not disclose specific future targets for reasons of commercial 
sensitivity. However it is intended that performance will continue to be 
measured against stretching EPS, TSR and Corporate Objective targets 
aligned with the delivery of our strategy. The continuing difficult market 
conditions in the US have led to the start-up phase of the US business 
lasting longer than originally envisaged and so the Group CEO and  
US CEO will continue to have the opportunity to receive an annual bonus 
relating to the achievement of financial, strategic and operational targets 
which measure the early-stage development of the US business. Success 
against these measures will contribute to building a strong platform for 
long-term sustainable growth of the US business.
Long-term performance
Earnings per share
Options were granted in 2009/10 to Executive Directors over shares  
with a value of 200% of salary, with an exercise price equal to the market 
value at the date of grant, and any gain is therefore dependent on 
increasing the share price between the date of grant and exercise. Vesting 
of these options is conditional on the achievement of earnings per share 
performance conditions, with the first 100% subject to the achievement  
of underlying diluted EPS growth of at least RPI plus 9% over three years 
and the balance vesting for achieving growth of at least RPI plus 15%. 
Performance against this target will be measured at the end of 2011/12  
to determine the level of vesting.
Return on capital employed – Group and international
The rules of the Performance Share Plan allow awards to be made over 
shares up to 150% of salary. In the year ended 27 February 2010 awards 
were made to all the Executive Directors except Tim Mason over Tesco PLC 
shares equal to a total of 150% of salary. An award was made to Tim Mason 
over Tesco PLC shares equal to a total of 100% of salary. For all the 
Executive Directors, awards over up to 100% of salary will vest (together 
with reinvested dividends) subject to the achievement of Group ROCE 
targets. The awards over the equivalent of a further 50% of salary made  
to the Executive Directors other than Tim Mason will vest (together with 
reinvested dividends) subject to the achievement of targets based on 
International ROCE in order to incentivise and reward delivery of higher 
returns from invested capital outside the UK (but excluding the US).
The first 75% of the awards will vest on a straight-line basis at the end  
of the three-year performance period, with 25% vesting for baseline 
performance and the full 75% vesting for maximum performance against 
target. The target in respect of the first 75% of the 2009/10 PSP award is 
achievement of 13.3% Group ROCE and 7.0% International ROCE at the 
end of the three-year performance period in 2011/12. The remaining 25% 
of the awards will vest for superior ROCE performance as judged by the 
Remuneration Committee taking into account the factors outlined above.
If the Remuneration Committee exercises its judgement to allow some,  
or all, of the remaining 25% of the PSP awards to vest, we will describe  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report in the relevant year those factors 
taken into account in determining the level of the award which would vest. 
There is no re-testing of performance in respect of any targets.
Return on capital employed – US
The Group is seeking to build a substantial presence in the US, which  
in time has the potential to become a significant source of value for  
our shareholders.
The Tesco PLC US Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 (the US LTIP) has been 
designed to deliver reward only if the US business realises this potential. 
The US CEO was made an award of two million shares under the US LTIP 
in 2007. Awards were also made to other senior members of the US 
management team. No other Executive Directors will participate in the 
Plan. Awards under the plan vest based on the ROCE and EBIT performance 
of the US business as set out on page 63. 
A key part of the Group’s long-term strategy is to consider new business 
ventures which have the potential for significant long-term value creation 
for our shareholders. The Group New Business Incentive Plan (Group Plan) 
supports this initiative. Initially only the Group CEO will participate in the 
Group Plan. However, awards may be made to other employees at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee in the future where this is 
appropriate to do so in order to support the Group’s new business ventures.
As the Company’s US venture is currently the most developed new 
business initiative, the award made to the Group CEO under the Group  
Plan is focused on the performance of the US venture, although the 
Remuneration Committee has the flexibility to consider and include other 
new business development opportunities within the proposed award. An 
award of 2.5 million shares was made to the Group CEO in November 2007. 
This award will vest based on the ROCE and EBIT performance of the  
US business as set out on page 63, however the plan also requires Group 
and International ROCE targets to be met and any payouts under this plan 
will be scaled back on a pro rata basis to the extent they are not met. In 
addition, the Remuneration Committee will consider the findings of the 
Governance Oversight Committee (described below) and opinions of the 
Audit Committee as to whether the level of reported results achieved reflects 
the underlying financial performance of the Company when considering if, 
and the extent to which, the award made to the Group CEO will vest.
Service agreements
The Executive Directors all have rolling service agreements with no fixed 
expiry date. These contracts are terminated on notice of 12 months by  
the Company and six months’ notice by the Executive. If an Executive 
Director’s employment is terminated (other than pursuant to the notice 
provisions in the service agreement or by reason of resignation or 
unacceptable performance or conduct) the Company will pay a sum 
calculated on the basis of basic salary and the average annual bonus paid 
for the last two years. No account will be taken of pension. Termination 
payments will be subject to mitigation. This means that amounts will  
be paid in instalments to permit mitigation. If the termination occurs  
within one year of retirement, the termination payment will be reduced 
accordingly. To reflect his length of service with Tesco and the early age  
of his appointment as CEO, Sir Terry Leahy’s service agreement provides 
for his full pension entitlement to become available on retirement on or 
after his 57th birthday. 
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that new appointments  
of Executive Directors will normally be on a notice period of 12 months.  
The Committee reserves the right to vary this period to 24 months for the 
initial period of appointment and for the notice period to then revert to 
12 months. The service agreements are available to shareholders to view  
on request from the Company Secretary.

Outside appointments
Tesco recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become 
Non-executive Directors of other companies. Such Non-executive duties 
can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Tesco. 
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to  
accept Non-executive appointments and retain the fees received, provided 
that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
Executive Directors’ biographies which include details of any outside 
appointments can be found on pages 36 and 37 of this Report. Fees 
retained for any Non-executive directorships are set out below.

Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment setting out their 
duties and the time commitment expected. The letters are available to 
shareholders to view from the Company Secretary upon request.
The Chairman meets with each Non-executive Director separately to 
review individual performance. All Non-executive Directors are subject  
to re-election by shareholders every three years at the Annual General 
Meeting and their appointment can be terminated by either party without 
notice. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined  
by the Chairman and the Executive Committee after considering external 
market research and individual contribution. Non-executive Directors 
receive a basic fee of £65,000 per annum. The Chairs of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees receive £30,000 (in addition to their basic  
Non-executive fee) and Non-executive Directors who are members of 
these Committees receive an additional £12,000 for each Committee.  
The Senior Independent Director, Rodney Chase, who is also the Deputy 
Chairman, receives a total fee of £135,000 per annum. The Remuneration 
Committee determines the Chairman’s remuneration, having regard to  
time commitment and packages awarded to Chairmen of other companies 
of a similar size and complexity. David Reid, Non-executive Chairman, 
receives an annual fee of £610,000 and has the benefit of a company car 
and chauffeur.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is governed by formal 
Terms of Reference which are reviewed annually. The Terms of Reference 
are available from the Company Secretary upon request or can be viewed 
at www.tesco.com/boardprocess
Composition of the Committee
The Committee consists entirely of independent Non-executive Directors. 
The members of the Committee during the year were Charles Allen 
(Chairman of the Committee), Patrick Cescau, Rodney Chase, Karen Cook, 
Harald Einsmann and Ken Hanna. Ken Hanna was appointed a member of 
the Remuneration Committee effective from 1 April 2009. The Directors’ 
biographies can be found on pages 36 and 37 of this Report.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the 
matters being decided, other than as a shareholder, nor any day-to-day 
involvement in running the business of Tesco. Jonathan Lloyd, the Company 
Secretary, is Secretary to the Committee. David Reid, Non-executive 
Chairman, Sir Terry Leahy, Chief Executive of the Group and Laurie McIlwee, 
Group CFO, all attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee. They 
are not present when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee is supported by the Group Personnel and Finance 
functions and has continued to use the services of Deloitte LLP whom it 
appointed as an external, independent advisor. Deloitte LLP also provided 
advisory services in respect of corporate tax planning, share schemes, 
international taxation, corporate finance and treasury to the Group during 
the year. Members’ attendance at Committee meetings is listed in the 
Corporate Governance section on page 47 of this Report.

Role of the Committee
The Committee’s purpose is to:
•  determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration policy for the 
Chairman and Executive Directors;
•  ensure the level and structure of remuneration is designed to attract, 
retain, and motivate the Executive Directors needed to run the Company;
•  agree performance frameworks and targets, and review performance 
against these;
•  monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management 
ensuring it is aligned with shareholders interests; and
•  ensure the remuneration relationship between the Executive Directors 
and senior executives of the Company below this level is appropriate.
The Committee normally meets at least four times a year and has a rolling 
schedule of items within its remit. In the financial year ended 27 February 
2010 the Committee met 7 times, and there was also an off-site meeting 
to consider remuneration strategy. 
Key activities
During the year, the key activities of the Committee included:
• approval of the 2008/09 Directors’ Remuneration Report;
•  review and approval of awards made under the Executive Incentive Plan, 
Performance Share Plan and Discretionary Share Option Plan;
•  annual review of all elements of the Executive Directors’ reward 
packages, and those of senior management;
•  review of all share plan performance measures against 2008/09 
performance targets;
•  agreement of final vesting amounts of the 2006 Performance Share 
Plan Award, and 2006 Discretionary Share Option Plan award;
• design and targets for 2009/10 Annual Bonus;
• consideration of targets for the 2009 Performance Share Plan;
•  review of its performance and agreement of steps to enhance its 
effectiveness;
• review of compliance with director shareholding guidelines ;
•  consideration of developments in best practice and updated guidelines 
on executive compensation from shareholder advisory bodies; and
• review of the Chairman’s pay and benefits.
Governance Oversight Committee
The Governance Oversight Committee (GOC) has been established  
to review and report at the end of each financial year on the allocation  
of capital and other Group resources. The GOC comprises the Senior 
Independent Director of the Company (who chairs the GOC), the  
Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Chairman of the Group also attends the GOC and the 
Company Secretary serves as its secretary. The GOC reports its findings  
to the Remuneration Committee each year. The Remuneration Committee 
takes these into account, along with the view of the Audit Committee,  
to ensure that financial performance against targets is indicative of strong 
and robust business performance. If appropriate, vesting under the  
plans may be adjusted by the Remuneration Committee (in respect of 
Executive Directors) or the Board (in respect of all other employees who  
are participants). In accordance with the Combined Code, any such 
adjustments to vesting for Executive Directors will be reported to 
shareholders in the Directors’ Remuneration Report at the relevant time. 
Compliance
In carrying out its duties, the Remuneration Committee gives full 
consideration to best practice. The Committee was constituted and 
operated throughout the period in accordance with the principles outlined 
in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority derived from the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance. The auditors’ report, set out on 
page 69, covers the disclosures referred to in this report that are specified 
for audit by the Companies Act 2006. This report also complies with

Table 2 Directors’ pension details
Executive Directors are members of the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme which provides a pension of up to two-thirds of base salary on retirement, normally 
at the age of 60, dependent upon service. The scheme also provides for dependants’ pensions and lump sums on death in service. The scheme is a 
defined benefit pension scheme, which is approved by HMRC.

1 The accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at 60 based on service to 27 February 2010.
2 Some of the Executive Directors’ benefits are payable from an unapproved pension arrangement. This is secured by a fixed and floating charge on a cash deposit.
3  The basis used for calculating transfer values was revised during the year because changes in financial conditions meant that the previous basis for calculating transfer values, used since 2008, 
no longer produced reasonable values. Transfer values at 28 February 2009 have been restated using the new basis for comparative purposes.
4  Sir Terry Leahy is entitled to retire at any age from 57 to 60 inclusive with an immediate pension of two-thirds of base salary.
5 Inflation over the year has been allowed for using the September 2009 statutory revaluation order.

1  The Performance Share Plan replaced the Long-term Executive Incentive Scheme. The first award under the new plan was made in 2004. All awards except those described in notes 2-3 
and 5-6 have been made in the form of nil cost options.
2 Tim Mason’s awards since 2006 have been made in the form of unfunded promises to deliver shares. 
3  Laurie McIlwee was appointed on 27 January 2009. His 2006, 2007 and 2008 awards were made in the form of conditional shares under the senior management Performance Share Plan. 
Lucy Neville Rolfe’s 2006 award was also made in the form of conditional shares under the senior management Performance Share Plan. On 20 July 2009, 53,531 shares were released to 
Lucy Neville-Rolfe and 47,527 shares were released to Laurie McIlwee at a share price of 369.95p. On 12 August 2009, 1,370 shares were released to Lucy Neville-Rolfe and 1,221 shares 
were released to Laurie McIlwee at a share price of 369.05p.

4  The awards are subject to performance conditions based on Return on Capital Employed targets. The Group ROCE for 2008/9 was 13.34%, therefore targets for PSP awards granted  
on 20 July 2006 were partially met and 90% of these awards vested. The balance of the awards (10%) lapsed. Executives are required to retain the vested awards for a further 12 months 
with the exception of the circumstances covered in notes 5 and 6. Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2007 AGM for the removal of the requirement for any vested shares to be 
retained for a further 12 months and this applies to awards made after July 2007. All awards are increased to reflect dividend equivalents as each dividend is paid with the exception of  
the 2004 award on which no dividends accrue.
5  Following approval by the Remuneration Committee, Executives were offered the opportunity to surrender the nil cost options awarded on 20 July 2006 in exchange for an equivalent 
number of restricted shares, and to fund the income tax and national insurance due on these awards at the point of exchange (27 November 2009). The balance of shares shown is in the 
form of restricted shares, and remains subject to the retention period which ends on 20 July 2010.
6  Following approval by the Remuneration Committee, Executives were given the opportunity to surrender the nil cost options awarded on 20 July 2006 in exchange for an award of an 
equivalent number of restricted shares on 25 February 2010, and to sell sufficient shares to cover the tax liability due. The post tax number of shares under award remains subject to the 
retention period and will not be released until 20 July 2010. The share price on 25 February 2010 was 416.175p.

1  The Group New Business Incentive Plan (2007) was approved by shareholders on 29 June 2007. The awards made under this plan will normally vest in four tranches, four, five, six and 
seven years after the date of award for nil consideration. The award is in the form of nil cost options. Awards may be adjusted to take account of any dividends paid or that are payable  
in respect of the number of shares earned. 
2  The vesting of the award made to the Group CEO under this plan will be conditional upon achievement against Group and International performance conditions. The performance 
conditions under this award will be aligned with the targets set for awards made under the Performance Share Plan (PSP) in each of the years 2007 to 2009, which will become capable  
of vesting between 2010 and 2012. If less than threshold performance is achieved for each of these PSP awards then no portion of the Group Plan award will become capable of vesting.  
If maximum Group and International performance is achieved for each of these PSP awards (i.e. the 2007 – 2009 PSP awards vest in full in 2010 – 2012, then the whole of the Group Plan 
award will become eligible for vesting, subject to achievement of the appropriate new business performance targets referred to below. If Group and International performance for any  
of these PSP awards is between threshold and maximum levels then the Group award will become eligible for vesting on a pro rata basis, subject always to the achievement of the 
appropriate new business targets referred to below.         
3  Once performance against the Group and International targets has been determined, the extent to which the award made to the Group CEO under this Plan is capable of vesting will be 
conditional on the financial performance of the specified new business venture, as determined by the Remuneration Committee.

1  The US Long Term Incentive Plan (2007) was approved by shareholders on 29 June 2007. The awards made under this plan will normally vest in four tranches, four, five, six and seven 
years after the date of award for nil consideration. Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed  
in the US business over the seven-year plan. The targets are set out under table 7.
2  The maximum number of shares which may be awarded under the US LTIP is two million shares to the US CEO and 1.5 million shares to any other participant. An award of two million 
shares was made to Tim Mason, US CEO, in November 2007. Awards may be adjusted to take account of any dividends paid or that are payable in respect of the number of shares earned. 
The extent to which awards will vest under the US LTIP is conditional on the financial performance of the Company’s US business, based on the achievement of stretching Earnings Before 
Interest and Tax (EBIT) and Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) targets set by reference to the US long-term business plan.
3  A percentage of the EBIT of the US business for the relevant years may be allocated to an EBIT pool (the ‘profit pool’). The profit pool will be capped at 10% in any one year and is 
expected to be approximately 5% of cumulative EBIT over the four measurement years (2010/11 to 2013/14). The portion of an award which may vest will be determined by reference to 
the value of the EBIT pool as well as performance against the ROCE hurdles for the relevant year, as outlined in the table above. To the extent that the ROCE hurdles for any one year are 
met (either in full or in part), but there is insufficient value in the profit pool to fund the vesting of awards, then the actual vesting in that year will be scaled back so that the profit pool is 
not exceeded. That portion of the award that has not paid out in that year due to the profit pool being restricted may vest in future years, provided that the profit pool in any later year 
permits this.
4  The targets for the US LTIP have been based on the business plan in respect of the initial phase of the US business. The Remuneration Committee has the responsibility to review these 
targets in light of the scale and scope of the US business in order to ensure that they remain appropriate and challenging. In particular, the Remuneration Committee will seek the input of 
the Audit Committee and the Governance Oversight Committee in order to ensure that financial performance against the targets is indicative of strong and robust business performance. 
Any material adjustments made in respect of the targets will be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and will be disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

1  The Executive Incentive Plan replaced the Short-term Executive Incentive Scheme. The first award under the new plan was made in 2005. The awards are subject to performance 
conditions based on TSR, earnings per share and corporate objectives.
2  Since 2007 Tim Mason’s awards have been made in the form of an unfunded promise to deliver shares. His 2005 award was made in the form of nil cost options.
3 The awards are increased to reflect dividends equivalents as each dividend is paid.
4 No options lapsed in the year under the Executive Incentive Plan.
5  Following approval by the Remuneration Committee, Executives were offered the opportunity to surrender the nil cost options awarded on 24 May 2007 and 2 May 2008 in exchange for 
awards of an equivalent number of restricted shares, and to fund the income tax and national insurance due on these awards at the point of exchange (27 November 2009). The balance 
of shares shown is in the form of restricted shares, and will not be released until the date specified in the table.
6  Following approval by the Remuneration Committee, Executives were given the opportunity to surrender the nil cost options awarded on 24 May 2007 and 2 May 2008 in exchange for 
awards of an equivalent number of restricted shares on 25 February 2010, and to sell sufficient shares to cover the tax liability due. The post tax number of shares under award remains 
subject to the retention period and will not be released until the date specified in the table. The share price on 25 February 2010 was 416.175p.
7  For all Directors except for Tim Mason, the 2009 award was made in the form of restricted shares. The Remuneration Committee gave approval for Executives to sell sufficient shares to 
cover the tax liability due at the time of award. The post tax number of shares will not be released until 19 May 2012.

state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial 
year and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year. Under that 
law the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
endorsed by the European Union (EU) and have elected to prepare the 
Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
 In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates; 
•  for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS, as endorsed by the EU; 
•  for the Company financial statements state whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed; and 
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position of  
the Company and the Group, and which enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006, and as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Business Review includes a fair review of the business and important 
events impacting it, as well as a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties of the business.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement and Annual Report  
and Financial Statements published on the Group’s corporate website. 
Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and of  
the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group 
Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group Statement  
of Changes in Equity and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law  
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  
the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set 
out on page 68, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16  
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
27 February 2010 and of its profit and cash flows for the 52 weeks  
then ended; 
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 52 weeks ended 
27 February 2010 for which the Group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in  
our opinion: 
•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
•  a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the Parent 
Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•  the Directors’ statement, set out on page 45, in relation to going 
concern; and 
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements 
of Tesco PLC for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

basis, except for certain financial instruments, share-based payments, 
customer loyalty programmes and pensions that have been measured  
at fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently  
to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of  
the ultimate Parent Company (Tesco PLC), all entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s share of its interests in joint 
ventures and associates.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those of the Group.
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity whose operating and financing policies are 
controlled, directly or indirectly, by Tesco PLC.
The accounts of the Parent Company’s subsidiary undertakings are 
prepared to dates around the Group year end.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and 
expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements.
Joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-
term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more 
other venturers under a contractual agreement.
An associate is an undertaking, not being a subsidiary or joint venture,  
over which the Group has significant influence and can participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the entity.
The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates is included 
in the Group Income Statement using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group Balance 
Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the entity, less any impairment in value. The carrying values of 
investments in joint ventures and associates include acquired goodwill.
If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or 
exceeds its investment in the joint venture or associate, the Group does 
not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or 
made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures and 
associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in 
the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
Critical estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regard to 
establishing uniform depreciation and amortisation periods for the Group, 
impairment testing (including loans), provisions for onerous leases and other 
provisions, assumptions for measuring pension provisions and fair value of 
share-based payments, determination of the fair value of obligations to 
purchase minority interests and fair value of derivative financial instruments, 
classification of leases as operating leases versus finance leases (including on 
sale and leasebacks), the likelihood that tax assets can be realised and the 
classification of certain operations as held for sale.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosure
The Group has adopted the following new and amended standards and 
interpretations as of 1 March 2009:
•  IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2008, requires customer loyalty awards to 
be accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in 
which they are granted. Part of the fair value of the consideration 
received relating to the customer loyalty awards is deferred and 
subsequently recognised over the period in which the awards are 
redeemed. The results for the 53 weeks ended 28 February 2009 have 
been restated accordingly. The impact on the Group Income Statement 
for the year ended 28 February 2009, is a £429m reduction in total 
revenue, £396m reduction in cost of sales and a £9m decrease to the 
taxation charge for the year. The net impact is a decrease of £33m to 
profit before tax and £24m to profit after tax. The net impact to the 
Group Balance Sheet as at 28 February 2009 is a £53m reduction in 
shareholders’ equity, £73m increase in trade and other payables and  
a £20m reduction in the provision for deferred tax. The net impact to 
the Group Balance Sheet as at 24 February 2008 is a £29m reduction in 
shareholders’ equity, £40m increase in trade and other payables and  
an £11m reduction in the provision for deferred tax. The prior year effect 
of the restatement on basic and diluted earnings per share is a reduction 
of 0.36p per share, and 0.35p per share, respectively.
•  Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’ – Vesting Conditions 
and Cancellations, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009 clarifies that only service and performance conditions 
are vesting conditions. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions 
which have to be taken into account to determine the fair value of the 
equity instruments granted. The award must be treated as a cancellation 
where the award does not vest as a result of a failure to meet a non-
vesting condition that is within the control of either the Group or the 
counterparty. Cancellations are treated as accelerated vestings and all 
remaining future charges are immediately recognised in the Group 
Income Statement with the credit recognised directly in equity. The 
results for the year ended 28 February 2009 have been restated 
accordingly. The impact on the Group Income Statement, Group 
Balance Sheet, basic and diluted earnings per share for the prior year 
was not material.
Note 1 Accounting policies
T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 75 Notes to the Group financial statements continued
•  IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009 replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment Reporting’ and 
requires operating segments to be reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for resource 
allocation and assessing performance of the operating segments, the 
key performance measure being trading profit, has been identified as 
the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. 
•  IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, prohibits the 
presentation of items of income and expenses (that is, ‘non-owner 
changes in equity’) in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity,  
and requiring ‘non-owner changes in equity’ to be presented in a 
performance statement. The Group has elected to present two 
statements: a Group Income Statement and a Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. The consolidated financial information has 
been prepared under the revised disclosure requirements. There was  
no impact on the results or net assets of the Group. Due to the adoption 
of IFRIC 13 and the amendments to IFRS 2, a Group Balance Sheet as  
at 24 February 2008 has been presented as required by IAS 1 (revised) 
when there is a retrospective restatement. 
•  Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments – Disclosures’, effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 requires 
enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
Sale and repurchase agreement (Tesco Bank)
•  In order to align with emerging industry practice the Treasury Bills and 
related Medium Term Notes previously recognised have been restated in 
Group Balance Sheet as at 28 February 2009. These balances arose as a 
result of a securitisation and associated sale and repurchase agreement 
entered into as part of the Special Liquidity Scheme during the year 
ended 28 February 2009. The effect of the change in the prior year is a 
reduction in loans and advances to banks and other financial assets of 
£588m, with a related reduction in current borrowings.
IFRS 3 Business combinations 
Under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, any adjustments to the provisional 
fair values allocated within 12 months of an acquisition date are calculated 
as if the fair value at the acquisition date had been recognised from  
that date. As a result, goodwill relating to the following acquisitions has 
been restated:
•  Homever (acquired 30 September 2008) – the net impact of the 
restatement is an increase in goodwill of £14m, increase in trade  
and other receivables of £22m, increase in trade and other payables  
of £2m and increase in non-current provisions of £34m.
•  Tesco Bank (acquired on 19 December 2008) – the net impact of the 
restatement is an increase in goodwill of £35m, increase in deferred  
tax assets of £28m, increase in non-current provisions of £99m and  
a decrease in retained earnings of £36m.
Revenue
Retailing
Revenue consists of sales through retail outlets.
Revenue is recorded net of returns, relevant vouchers/offers and value-
added taxes, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the buyer. Relevant vouchers/offers include: money-off 
coupons, conditional spend vouchers and offers such as buy one get one 
free (BOGOF) and 3 for 2.
Commission income is recorded based on the terms of the contracts and  
is recognised when the service is provided.
Financial Services
Revenue consists of interest, fees and commission receivable.
Interest income on financial assets that are classified as loans and 
receivables is determined using the effective interest rate method. This is 
the method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or for a 
group of assets, and of allocating the interest income over the expected 
life of the asset. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the 
estimated future cash flows to the instrument’s initial carrying amount. 
Calculation of the effective interest rate takes into account fees receivable, 
that are an integral part of the instrument’s yield, premiums or discounts 
on acquisition or issue, early redemption fees and transaction costs. 
Fees in respect of services are recognised on an accruals basis as service  
is provided. The arrangements are generally contractual and the cost of 
providing the service is incurred as the service is rendered. The price is 
usually fixed and always determinable. Significant fee types include credit 
card related services fees such as interchange, late payment and balance 
transfer fees. 
The Group receives insurance commission from the sale of general 
insurance policies, which is dependent on the profitability of the underlying 
insurance policies.
Clubcard and loyalty initiatives
The cost of Clubcard and loyalty initiatives is treated as a deduction from 
sales and part of the fair value of the consideration received is deferred and 
subsequently recognised over the period that the awards are redeemed.
The fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the 
fair value to the customer and considers factors such as redemption via 
Clubcard deals versus money-off-in-store including Double Up and 
redemption rate.
Computers for Schools and Sport for Schools and Club vouchers are issued 
by Tesco for redemption by participating schools/clubs and are part of our 
overall Community Plan. The cost of the redemption (i.e. meeting the 
obligation attached to the vouchers) is treated as a cost rather than a 
deduction from sales.  
Other income
Finance income, excluding income arising from financial services, is 
recognised in the period to which it relates using the effective interest rate 
method. Dividends are recognised when a legal entitlement to receive 
payment arises.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after profit arising on property-related items but 
before the share of results of joint ventures and associates, finance income 
and finance costs.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. 
Property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated on a straight-line 
basis to their residual value over their anticipated useful economic lives.
The following depreciation rates are applied for the Group:
 •  freehold and leasehold buildings with greater than 40 years unexpired – 
at 2.5% of cost;
 •  leasehold properties with less than 40 years unexpired are depreciated 
by equal annual instalments over the unexpired period of the lease; and
 •  plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles – at rates 
varying from 9% to 50%.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful 
lives on the same basis as owned assets or, when shorter, over the term of 
the relevant lease.
All property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in 
accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ when there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Note 1 Accounting policies continued
76 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction  
of qualifying assets are capitalised. Qualifying assets are those that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended 
use. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Group Income 
Statement in finance costs, excluding those arising from financial services, 
in the period in which they occur. For Tesco Bank finance cost on financial 
liabilities is determined using the effective interest rate method and is 
recognised in cost of sales. 
Investment property
Investment property is property held to earn rental income and/or for 
capital appreciation rather than for the purpose of Group operating 
activities. Investment property assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. The depreciation 
policies for investment property are consistent with those described for 
owner-occupied property.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
The Group as a lessor
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as 
receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a 
constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment in the lease.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The Group as a lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at 
their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding 
liability is included in the Group Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction 
of the lease obligations so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the 
Group Income Statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Group Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Sale and leaseback
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and 
immediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with 
the buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends 
upon the substance of the transaction (by applying the lease classification 
principles described above) and whether or not the sale was made at the 
asset’s fair value.
For sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from the  
sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and operating 
leasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly  
the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the Group 
Income Statement.
Following initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those 
principles described above.
Business combinations and goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase 
method.
On acquisition, the assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of an acquired entity are measured at their fair value. 
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion 
of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
The Group recognises intangible assets as part of business combinations at 
fair value on the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values 
is based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions on the 
timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the 
assets acquired and the selection of an appropriate cost of capital. The 
useful lives of intangible assets are estimated, and amortisation charged 
on a straight-line basis.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of an 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets/net 
liabilities of the acquired subsidiary, joint venture or associate at the  
date of acquisition. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value  
of the Group’s share of the net assets/net liabilities of the acquired entity 
(i.e. a discount on acquisition) then the difference is credited to the Group 
Income Statement in the period of acquisition. 
At the acquisition date of a subsidiary, goodwill acquired is recognised as 
an asset and is allocated to each of the cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the business combination’s synergies and to the lowest level 
at which management monitors the goodwill. Goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within the carrying 
value of the investment.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the 
recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill 
relates. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, 
and value in use. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement 
and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss  
on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 February 2004 (the date of 
transition to IFRS) was retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to 
reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been restated and will not 
be included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets, such as software, pharmacy licences, customer 
relationships, contracts and brands, are measured initially at cost and are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, at 
2%-100% of cost per annum.
Internally-generated intangible assets – Research and development 
expenditure
Research costs are expensed as incurred. 
Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried 
forward only if all the criteria set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ are  
met, namely:
 •  an asset is created that can be identified (such as software or new 
processes);
 •  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic 
benefits; and
 •  the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Following the initial recognition of development expenditure, the cost  
is amortised over the project’s estimated useful life, usually at 14%-25%  
of cost per annum.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets are impaired. If such indication exists, the recoverable 
Note 1 Accounting policies continued
T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 77 Notes to the Group financial statements continued
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of  
the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash  
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates  
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the  
asset belongs. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and 
value in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of 
the recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no 
impairment loss had been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating 
unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as a 
credit to the Group Income Statement immediately.
Other investments
Other investments in the Group Balance Sheet comprise loan receivable 
and available-for-sale financial assets. Refer to the financial instruments 
accounting policy for further detail.
Loan receivables are recognised at amortised cost and available-for-sale 
financial assets are recognised at fair value.
Inventories
Inventories comprise goods held for resale and properties held for, or in the 
course of, development and are valued at the lower of cost and fair value 
less costs to sell using the weighted average cost basis.
Short-term investments
Short-term investments in the Group Balance Sheet consist of deposits 
with money market funds. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Balance Sheet consist of cash at 
bank, in hand and demand deposits with banks together with short-term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if 
their carrying amount will be recovered through sale rather than 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is 
highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale 
and it should be expected to be completed within one year from the date 
of classification.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are 
measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Pensions and similar obligations
The Group accounts for pensions and other post-employment benefits 
(principally private healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
In respect of defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted 
present value (using the projected unit credit method) whilst plan assets 
are recorded at fair value. The operating and financing costs of such plans 
are recognised separately in the Group Income Statement; service costs 
are spread systematically over the expected service lives of employees and 
financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense 
as they fall due.
Share-based payments
Employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form  
of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services 
in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) or 
in exchange for entitlements to cash payments based on the value of the 
shares (cash-settled transactions).
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the grant 
date using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-
Based Payment’, the resulting cost is charged to the Group Income 
Statement over the vesting period. The value of the charge is adjusted  
to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting.
Taxation
The tax expense included in the Group Income Statement consists of 
current and deferred tax. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet  
date. Tax is recognised in the Group Income Statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income  
or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised other comprehensive 
income or equity, respectively. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,  
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts  
used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged  
or credited in the Group Income Statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in 
which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity, or other 
comprehensive income, respectively.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to 
be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there 
is a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets against 
current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on 
the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets 
and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to 
the Group Income Statement for the period.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Pounds 
Sterling according to the functional currency concept of IAS 21 ‘The Effects 
of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. Since the majority of consolidated 
companies operate as independent entities within their local economic 
environment, their respective local currency is the functional currency. 
Therefore, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date  
of the Group Balance Sheet; profits and losses are translated into Pounds 
Sterling at average exchange rates for the relevant accounting periods. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred 
to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation  
is disposed of.
Note 1 Accounting policies continued
78 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at 
fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Investments
Investments are recognised at trade date. Investments are classified as 
either held for trading or available-for-sale, and are recognised at fair value.
There are no investments classified as held for trading.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes  
in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed 
of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net result for the 
period. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method is 
recognised in the Group Income Statement. Dividends on an available-for-
sale equity instrument are recognised in the Group Income Statement 
when the entity’s right to receive payment is established.
Loans and advances
Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and 
include amounts due from customers and amounts due from other banks. 
The Group has no intention of trading these loans and advances and 
consequently they are not classified as held for trading or designated  
as fair value through profit and loss. Loans and advances are initially 
recognised at fair value plus directly related transaction costs. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, these assets are carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method less any impairment losses. Income from these 
financial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised  
in the Group Income Statement.
Impairment of loans and advances
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of  
its loans and advances to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. An impairment loss has 
been incurred if there is objective evidence that an event or events since 
initial recognition of the asset have adversely affected the amount or 
timing of future cash flows from the asset.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset  
or group of financial assets classified as loans and advances has been 
incurred, the Group measures the amount of the loss as the difference 
between the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of 
assets discounted at the effective interest rate of the instrument at initial 
recognition. Impairment losses are assessed individually for financial assets 
that are individually significant and collectively for assets that are not 
individually significant. In making collective assessments of impairment, 
financial assets are grouped into portfolios on the basis of similar risk 
characteristics. Future cash flows from these portfolios are estimated on 
the basis of the contractual cash flows and historical loss experience for 
assets with similar credit risk characteristics. Historical loss experience is 
adjusted, on the basis of current observable data, to reflect the effects of 
current conditions not affecting the period of historical experience.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Group Income Statement and the 
carrying amount of the financial asset or group of financial assets reduced 
by establishing an allowance for impairment losses. If in a subsequent 
Note 1 Accounting policies continued
period the amount of the impairment loss reduces and the reduction 
can be ascribed to an event after the impairment was recognised, the 
previously recognised loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance. Once 
an impairment loss has been recognised on a financial asset or group of 
financial assets, interest income is recognised on the carrying amount 
using the rate of interest at which estimated future cash flows were 
discounted in measuring impairment.
Loan impairment provisions are established on a portfolio basis taking 
into account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience, credit 
scores and defaults based on portfolio trends. The most significant 
factors in establishing the provisions are the expected loss rates and the 
related average life. The portfolios include credit card receivables and 
other personal advances. The future credit quality of these portfolios is 
subject to uncertainties that could cause actual credit losses to differ 
materially from reported loan impairment provisions. These uncertainties 
include the economic environment, notably interest rates and their 
effect on customer spending, the unemployment level, payment 
behaviour and bankruptcy trends.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to  
the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of 
the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at  
fair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost 
with any difference between cost and redemption value being 
recognised in the Group Income Statement over the period of the 
borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure  
to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks arising from 
operating, financing and investing activities. The Group does not hold  
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however,  
if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for 
as such.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by 
reference to market values for similar financial instruments, by 
discounted cash flows, or by the use of option valuation models. Where 
derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses  
on remeasurement are immediately recognised in the Group Income 
Statement. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition 
of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge 
relationship and the item being hedged.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to 
document from inception the relationship between the item being 
hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to 
document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between 
the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the 
hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness 
testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge 
remains highly effective.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one 
year from the balance sheet date are disclosed as non-current.
T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 79 Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Fair value hedging
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when 
they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that  
are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group 
Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Derivative financial instruments qualifying for fair value hedge accounting 
are principally interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
Cash flow hedging
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when 
they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are either 
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or 
liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
The effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative 
instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in the Group Income Statement in the same period or periods 
during which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. 
The classification of the effective portion when recognised in the Group 
Income Statement is the same as the classification of the hedged 
transaction. Any element of the remeasurement of the derivative 
instrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is 
recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance 
income or costs.
Derivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally 
forward foreign exchange transactions and interest rate swaps.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  
or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the 
forecasted transaction occurs or the original hedged item affects the 
Group Income Statement. If a forecasted hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is 
transferred to the Group Income Statement.
Net investment hedging
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges 
when they hedge the Group’s net investment in an overseas operation. 
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from remeasuring 
the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective 
element is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. Gains 
and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income 
Statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Derivative instruments qualifying for net investment hedging are 
principally forward foreign exchange transactions.
Treatment of agreements to acquire minority interests
The Group has entered into a number of agreements to purchase the 
remaining shares of subsidiaries with minority shareholdings.
Under IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’, the net present value of 
the expected future payments are shown as a financial liability. At the end 
of each period, the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any changes 
recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs 
for the year. Where the liability is in a currency other than Pounds Sterling, 
the liability has been designated as a net investment hedge. Any change in 
the value of the liability resulting from changes in exchange rates is 
recognised directly in equity.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that a transfer 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and where  
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes  
that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under the lease. Where 
material, these leases are discounted to their present value. Provisions  
for dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease by lease basis.
Other recent accounting developments
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2010 or issued 
and early adopted: 
In preparing the Group financial statements for the current year, the Group 
has adopted the following new and amended standards and 
interpretations which have no impact on the results or net assets of the 
Group (unless otherwise stated):
•  Amendment to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard has been revised to 
require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a 
qualifying asset. 
•  Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and IAS 1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’– Puttable Instruments and 
Instruments with Obligations Arising on Liquidation, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
•  Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ – 
Presentation on Classification of Rights Issues, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
•  Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRSs’ and IAS 27 
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ – Cost of an 
Investment of a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate, 
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2009.
•  IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Embedded Derivatives 
(amendments)’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 July 2008.
•  IFRIC 14 ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding 
Requirements and their Interaction’, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2008. 
•  IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’, effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. 
•  IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’, effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008. 
Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and 
under review as to their impact on the Group:
•  Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’ – Group Cash-Settled 
Transactions, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2010. In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’,  
and IFRIC 11 ‘ IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, the 
amendments expand on the guidance of IFRIC 11 to address the 
classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that 
interpretation. The new guidance is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
•  IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The 
revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with non-
controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in 
control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains 
and losses. The standard also specifies the accounting when control of 
an entity is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair 
value, and a gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement. The 
Group will apply IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions with non-
controlling interests from 28 February 2010.

80 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements
•  IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’, effective for business 
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning 
of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to 
business combinations, with some significant changes, including: all 
payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the 
acquisition date, with the contingent payments that are classified as 
debt subsequently remeasured through the Group Income Statement. 
There is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquirer’s net assets.  
All acquisition-related costs should be expensed. The Group will apply 
IFRS 3 (revised) prospectively to all business combinations from 
28 February 2010.
•  Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ – Eligible Hedged Items, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The amendment provides clarification 
on how the principles that determine whether a hedged risk or portion 
of cash flows is eligible for designation should be applied in particular 
situations.
•  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2013. This is the first part of a new standard on 
classification and measurement of financial assets that will replace IAS 39.
•  Amendment to IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
•  IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners’, effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 
•  IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’, effective for transfers of 
assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.
•  IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010.
The Group continually reviews amendments to the standards made under 
the IASB’s annual improvements project.
Use of non-GAAP profit measures – underlying profit before tax
The Directors believe that underlying profit before tax and underlying 
diluted earnings per share measures provide additional useful information 
for shareholders on underlying trends and performance. These measures 
are used for internal performance analysis. Underlying profit is not defined 
by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other 
companies’ adjusted profit measures. It is not intended to be a substitute 
for, or superior to IFRS measurements of profit.
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax are:
 •  IAS 32 and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ – fair value remeasurements – 
Under IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group applies hedge accounting to its 
various hedge relationships when allowed under the rules of IAS 39  
and when practical to do so. Sometimes the Group is unable to apply 
hedge accounting to the arrangements but continues to enter into  
these arrangements as they provide certainty or active management  
of the exchange rates and interest rates applicable to the Group.  
The Group believes these arrangements remain effective and 
economically and commercially viable hedges despite the inability  
to apply hedge accounting.
   Where hedge accounting is not applied to certain hedging 
arrangements, the reported results reflect the movement in fair value of 
related derivatives due to changes in foreign exchange and interest 
rates. In addition, at each period end, any gain or loss accruing on open 
contracts is recognised in the Group Income Statement for the period, 
regardless of the expected outcome of the hedging contract on 
termination. This may mean that the Group Income Statement charge is 
highly volatile, whilst the resulting cash flows may not be as volatile. The 
underlying profit measure removes this volatility to help better identify 
underlying business performance. During 2010 there was no impact 
(2009 – £10m) of the IAS 32 and IAS 39 charge arose in the share of 
post-tax profit of joint ventures and associates, with the remainder in 
finance income/costs. 
Note 1 Accounting policies continued
•   IAS 19 Income Statement charge for pensions – Under IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’, the cost of providing pension benefits in the 
future is discounted to a present value at the corporate bond yield 
rates applicable on the last day of the previous financial year. 
Corporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates 
volatility in the Group Income Statement and Group Balance Sheet. 
IAS 19 also increases the charge for young pension schemes, such as 
Tesco’s, by requiring the use of rates which do not take into account 
the future expected returns on the assets held in the pension scheme 
which will fund pension liabilities as they fall due. The sum of these 
two effects can make the IAS 19 charge disproportionately higher and 
more volatile than the cash contributions the Group is required to 
make in order to fund all future liabilities. Therefore, within underlying 
profit we have included the ‘normal’ cash contributions for pensions 
but excluded the volatile element of IAS 19 to represent what the 
Group believes to be a fairer measure of the cost of providing post-
employment benefits.
 •  IAS 17 ‘Leases’ – impact of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods 
– The amount charged to the Group Income Statement in respect of 
operating lease costs and incentives is expected to increase significantly 
as the Group expands its international business. The leases have been 
structured in a way to increase annual lease costs as the businesses 
expand. IAS 17 ‘Leases’ requires the total cost of a lease to be 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, 
irrespective of the actual timing of the cost. The impact of this 
treatment in 2010 was a charge of £41m (2009 – £27m) to the Group 
Income Statement after deducting the impact of the straight-line 
treatment recognised as rental income within share of post-tax profits 
of joint ventures and associates.
•  IFRS 3 Amortisation charge from intangible assets arising on 
acquisition – Under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, intangible assets 
are separately identified and valued. The intangible assets are 
required to be amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives and as such is a non-cash charge that does not reflect 
the underlying performance of the business acquired.
•  IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ – This new interpretation 
requires the fair value of customer loyalty awards to be measured  
as a separate component of a sales transaction. The underlying profit 
measure removes this fair value allocation to present underlying 
business performance, and to reflect the performance of the 
operating segments as measured by management. 
•  Exceptional items – Due to their significance and special nature, 
certain other items which do not reflect the Group’s underlying 
performance have been excluded from underlying profit. These gains 
or losses can have a significant impact on both absolute profit and 
profit trends; consequently, they are excluded from the underlying 
profit of the Group. For the year ended 27 February 2010, exceptional 
items are as follows: 
 –  IAS 36 Impairment of goodwill arising on acquisitions – the carrying 
value of goodwill relating to Japan was not fully recoverable, 
resulting in an impairment charge of £131m (2009 – £nil), and as 
such is a non-cash charge that does not reflect the underlying 
performance of the business. The recoverable amount for Japan 
was based on value in use, calculated from cash flow projections for 
five years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts, the 
results of which are reviewed by the Board.
 –  Restructuring costs – These relate to certain costs associated with 
the Group’s restructuring activities. For the year ended 27 February 
2010, the Group incurred £33m (2009 – £nil), relating to 
restructuring activities.
There were no exceptional items in 2009.
T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 81 Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Note 2 Segmental reporting
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’).  
The CODM has been determined to be the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors as it is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources  
to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments. Previously, segments were determined and presented in accordance with IAS 14 
‘Segment Reporting’.
The CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly Executive Committee meetings as the key measure of the segments’ results as it reflects the 
segments’ underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation. Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group. 
Segmental trading profit is an adjusted measure of operating profit, which measures the performance of each segment before exceptional items 
(goodwill impairment and restructuring charges), profit arising on property-related items, impact on leases of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods, 
amortisation charges from intangible assets arising on acquisition, adjustments to fair value of customer loyalty awards and replaces the IAS 19 pension 
charge with the ‘normal’ cash contributions for pensions.
On the adoption of IFRS 8, the Group revised its operating and reporting segments. The Group’s operating segments were previously defined 
geographically – UK, Rest of Europe, Asia and US. The Group’s operations (retail and retailing services) are managed by geography, with Tesco Bank  
as a separate reporting segment because of its different regulatory environment. Accordingly, the segments under IFRS 8 are UK, Rest of Europe (ROE 
comprises Republic of Ireland, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Turkey), Asia (comprising Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, China, 
Japan and India), US and Tesco Bank.
Comparative information has been restated to reflect these new segments.
Segment assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated is comprised 
mainly of derivative receivables, interest-bearing loan receivables and taxation-related assets.
Inter-segment turnover between the operating segments is not material.
The segment results for the year ended 27 February 2010, for the year ended 28 February 2009 and the reconciliation of the segment measures to the 
respective statutory items included in the consolidated financial information are as follows:

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial  
reporting purposes:

Deferred tax liabilities               (795) (676)
                   (757) (627)
The impact of adopting IFRIC 13 on the 2009 opening balance sheet was an £11m reduction in deferred tax liabilities.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, because the earnings are continually reinvested by 
the Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. The temporary difference unrecognised at the year end amounted to 
£2,766m (2009 – £1,726m). Furthermore the introduction of a dividend exemption in the UK tax legislation with effect from 1 July 2009 means that 
earnings can be remitted from certain subsidiary undertakings where no tax will be payable on repatriation.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items (because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the Group can utilise the benefits):

           £m £m

Tax losses                 286 192
                   287 204
As at 27 February 2010, the Group has unused trading tax losses of £1,019m (2009 – £744m) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in respect of £142m (2009 – £58m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining  
£877m (2009 – £686m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £297m (2009 – £32m in 
2013) that will expire in 2014 and £550m (2009 – £647m between 2014 and 2029) that will expire between 2015 and 2030. Other losses will be carried 
forward indefinitely.
In addition, the Group has UK capital losses of £342m (2009 – £310m) in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Note 9 Earnings per share and diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year (adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive options).
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all potentially dilutive ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based 
options which the Group considers to have been earned.
All operations are continuing for the years presented.

Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications 
that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at 
which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In 2010, recoverable amounts  
are based on value in use. Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for generally five years using data from the Group’s latest internal 
forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, 
growth rates and expected changes in margins. Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience 
and expectations of future changes in the market. Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the 
recoverable amounts of goodwill.
The carrying amount for Japan has been reduced to its recoverable amount through the recognition of an impairment loss of £131m against goodwill. 
This has been included in cost of sales in the Group Income Statement. The key assumptions for Japan include a long-term growth rate of 1.1%  
(2009 – 1.5%) and a pre-tax discount rate of 6.1% (2009 – 7.3%). 
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates of generally 1% to 4% (2009 – 2% to 10%).
In the case of Poland, it is reasonably possible that a change in key assumptions would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use. With headroom  
of £46m (2009 – £84m) and assuming a 10.6% pre-tax discount rate (2009 – 11.3%), a 0.3% (2009 – 0.4%) increase in the discount rate would cause 
goodwill to exceed its value in use.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 6%-14% (2009 – 7% to 24%). On a post-tax basis, the discount rates ranged from 
4% to 13% (2009 – 5% to 19%). These discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the specific 
risks relating to each geographical region.
In February 2010 and 2009 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, each store is a cash-generating unit. Cash-generating units are tested for 
impairment if there are indications of impairment at the balance sheet date.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are mainly based on value in use, which is generally calculated from cash flow projections for five to 
twenty years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins. Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax 
rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. Changes in selling prices 
and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of generally 1% to 4% (2009 – 2% to 10%).
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 6% to 14% (2009 – 7% to 24%) depending on the specific conditions in which each 
store operates. These discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital.

The impairment losses relate to stores whose recoverable amounts do not exceed the asset carrying values. In all cases, impairment losses arose due to 
stores performing below forecasted trading levels.
The reversal of previous impairment losses arose principally due to improvements in stores’ performances over the last year which increased the net 
present value of future cash flows.

Loans and advances include amounts subject to securitisation of £1,459m (2009 – £1,468m). During 2009 the Group entered into a securitisation 
transaction and issued debt securities which the Group subsequently purchased. The purpose of the transaction was to allow the Group to enter into the 
Special Liquidity Scheme whereby it would enter into a sale and repurchase agreement acquiring Treasury Bills issued by the UK Government and using 
the debt securities as security. As at 27 February 2010 the Group held £500m (2009 – £588m) in respect of this transaction. The Treasury Bills do not 
meet the recognition criteria of IAS 39 and are not recognised on the Group Balance Sheet.

T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 101 Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Note 22 Financial instruments 
Derivatives are used to hedge exposure to market risks and those that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in 
IAS 39. Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and the Group’s hedging policies are further described below. 
Finance income of £20m (2009 – finance costs of £30m) resulted from hedge ineffectiveness.
Fair value hedges 
The Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued 
by the Group. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement under the effective interest 
rate method.
A loss of £65m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a gain of £85m on hedged items (2009 – a gain of £1,197m on hedging 
instruments was offset by a loss of £1,227m on hedged items).
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in 
a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company. Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains 
and losses are deferred in equity.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars. The cash flows hedged will occur and will affect the Group 
Income Statement within one year of the balance sheet date. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing  
in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the Group Income Statement. When a  
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Group 
Income Statement.
Net investment hedges 
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency swaps to hedge the exposure of a proportion of its 
non-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group has a South Korean Won denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Samsung Tesco 
Co. Limited. This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income Statement on disposal of the overseas operation.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting
The Group’s policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not 
designated as a hedge where gains and losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item offset in the Group Income Statement.
These instruments include caps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
The Group has a liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, dunnhumby Limited. Changes in the value of the 
liability are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.

The fair values of financial instruments have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments are traded. 
The fair value of all other items have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The above table excludes 
other receivables/payables, which have fair values equal to their carrying values.

Fair value measurement
Effective from 1 March 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the Group Balance Sheet at 
fair value. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
•  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
•  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that 
is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and
•  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

Note 23 Financial risk factors
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates, the risk of default by counterparties to financial 
transactions, and the availability of funds to meet business needs. These risks are managed as described below. The Group Balance Sheet position at  
27 February 2010 is representative of the position throughout the year.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board provides written 
principles for risk management, as described in the Business Review on pages 41 to 44.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued at fixed 
rates exposes the Group to fair value risk. Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 44.
The Group has RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index. RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt. The Group also has LPI 
debt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%. LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.
For interest rate risk relating to Tesco Bank please refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors.

Credit risk 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, customer deposits, financial instruments and deposits with banks and 
financial institutions. The Group policy on credit risk is described on page 44.
The counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is £1,474m (2009 – £1,860m). The Group policy is to transact derivatives only with counterparties 
rated at least A1 by Moody’s.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be £11.0bn (2009 – £12.1bn), being the Group’s total financial assets.
For credit risk relating to Tesco Bank please refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on page 109.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed by short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. In addition, the Group has committed facility agreements for £2.6bn  
(2009 – £2.7bn), which mature between 2011 and 2014.
The Group has a European Medium Term Note programme of £15.0bn, of which £10.6bn was in issue at 27 February 2010 (2009 – £11.0bn), plus  
a Euro Commercial Paper programme of £2.0bn, none of which was in issue at 27 February 2010 (2009 – £1.6bn), and a US Commercial Paper 
programme of $4.0bn, none of which was in issue at 27 February 2010 (2009 – £nil).

The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives. The potential cash outflow of 
£15.6bn is considered acceptable as it is offset by financial assets and trade receivables of £12.9bn (2009 – £16.9bn offset by financial assets and trade 
receivables of £13.9bn).
The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the 
balance sheet date. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date. For index-linked liabilities, inflation is 
estimated at 3% for the life of the liability.

Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via:
•  Transactional exposure, from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the purchasing company. Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged. 
These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional and fair value of these 
contracts is shown in note 22.
•  Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK. The Group hedges a proportion of its investments in its international 
subsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are formally designated as net investment hedges.
•  Loans to non-UK subsidiaries. These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally 
designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 107 Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Note 23 Financial risk factors continued
The impact on Group financial statements from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below.
Sensitivity analysis
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on  
the retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. However, it does include the foreign 
exchange sensitivity resulting from all local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives 
portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 
27 February 2010.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.  
It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
 •  the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no 
sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt;
•  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange 
rates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt;
•  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates are 
recorded directly in equity;
•  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement;
•  all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on the 
Group Income Statement;
•  debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the interest payable part of the calculation; and
•  the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects 
a full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result from 
changes in UK interest rates, and in exchange rates:
         2010  2009
         Income Equity Income Equity
        gain/(loss) gain/(loss) gain/(loss) gain/(loss)
        £m £m £m £m
1% increase in GBP interest rates (2009 – 1%)        (38) – (59) –
 
15% appreciation of the Euro (2009 – 25%)         (13) (43) (22) (22)
10% appreciation of the South Korean Won (2009 – 20%)       – (82)  (1) (222)
25% appreciation of the US Dollar (2009 – 25%)        (1) (8)  (11) 218
25% appreciation of the Thai Baht (2009 – 25%)        – (1)  – (1)
10% appreciation of the Czech Koruna (2009 – 25%)        – (31)  – (204)
5% appreciation of the Polish Zloty (2009 – 15%)        – –  14 –
A decrease in interest rates and a depreciation of foreign currencies would have the opposite effect to the impact in the table above.
The impact on equity from changing exchange rates results principally from foreign currency deals used as net investment hedges. The impact on equity 
will largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets. For changes in the USD/GBP exchange rate, the impact on equity results 
principally from forward purchases of US Dollars as cash flow hedges.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital (defined as net debt plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in 
order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising 
return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments  
to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them or issue new 
shares. In April 2006, the Group outlined its plan to release cash from its property assets, via a sequence of property joint ventures and other transactions, 
and return significant value to shareholders, either through enhanced dividends or share buy-backs. The target for the value of share buy-backs was 
increased from £1.5bn to £3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007. Whilst the Group continued with the policy at the beginning of 2009, it 
subsequently used the proceeds from property divestment to pay down debt, following the two major acquisitions in 2009 (Homever and Tesco Bank). 
During 2009 the Group purchased and cancelled £100m ordinary shares. In the financial year 2010 the Group continued to use the proceeds from the 
sale of property to pay down debt, which it expects to continue in 2011.
The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding. This policy continued during the 
current year with bonds redeemed of £390m (2009 – £524m) and new bonds issued totalling £nil (2009 – £4,901m). The Group borrows centrally and 
locally, using a variety of capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet the requirements of each local business.

Tesco Bank
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in Tesco Bank’s banking activities have different repricing dates. Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long term are 
measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits. Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income 
sensitivity over 12 months to a 1% parallel movement in interest rates. Tesco Bank also use value at risk (VaR) for risk management purposes with a  
time horizon of one trading day and a confidence interval of 95%. Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the probability of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to Tesco Bank and arises principally from Tesco Bank’s 
lending activities but also from other transactions involving on and off-balance sheet instruments. Limits have been established for all counterparties 
based on their respective credit ratings. The limits and proposed counterparties are reviewed and approved by the Risk Management Committee (RMC) 
of Tesco Bank.
Internal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit ratings. Internal ratings are used to assess the credit quality of 
borrowers. Customers are assigned credit ratings, based on various credit grading models that reflect the probability of default.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed on a consolidated basis within Tesco Bank’s banking activities and adheres to the liquidity requirements set by the Financial 
Services Authority (FSA) from time to time. To meet regulatory requirements a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid and marketable assets is 
maintained. Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis. Tesco Bank has credit facilities sufficient 
to meet all foreseeable outflow requirements as they fall due and its liquidity risk is further mitigated by its well diversified retail deposit base.
Expressed as an annual probability of default, the upper and lower boundaries and the midpoint for each of the asset quality grades are as follows:

Insurance risk 
Tesco Bank is exposed to insurance risk indirectly through its profit sharing commission arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC. 
Insurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency or severity of insured events, relative to the expectations at the time of underwriting.
The frequency and severity of claims and the sources of uncertainty for the key classes that Tesco Bank is exposed to are as follows:
Motor insurance 
Claims experience is quite variable, due to a wide range of factors, but the principal ones are age, gender and driving experience, type and nature  
of vehicle, use of vehicle and area. There are many sources of uncertainty that will affect Tesco Bank’s experience under motor insurance including 
operational risk, reserving risk, premium rates not matching claims inflation rates, the weather, the social, economic and legislative environment  
and reinsurance failure risk.
Property insurance 
The major causes of claims for property insurance are theft, flood, escape of water, fire, storm, subsidence and various types of accidental damage. 
The major source of uncertainty is the volatility of weather.

Property provisions comprise future rents payable net of rents receivable on onerous and vacant property leases, provisions for terminal dilapidations and 
provisions for future rents above market value on unprofitable stores. The majority of the provision is expected to be utilised over the period to 2020.
The other provision balance relates to a provision for customer redress in respect of potential customer complaints. This is likely to be utilised over several years.

Note 27 Share-based payments
The total Group Income Statement charge for the year recognised in respect of share-based payments is £300m (2009 restated – £246m), which is made 
up of share option schemes and share bonus payments. Of this amount £241m (2009 restated – £208m) will be equity-settled and £59m (2009 – £38m) 
cash-settled.
a) Share option schemes
The Company had nine share option schemes in operation during the year, all of which are equity-settled schemes:
i)   The Savings-related Share Option Scheme (1981) permits the grant to employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building 
society/bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between £5 and £250  
per four-weekly period. Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three- or five-year period at a subscription price not less than  
80% of the average of the middle-market quotations of an ordinary share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date.
ii)   The Irish Savings-related Share Option Scheme (2000) permits the grant to Irish employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a 
building society/bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between €12  
and €320 per four-weekly period. Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three- or five-year period at a subscription price not less 
than 80% of the average of the middle-market quotations of an ordinary share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date. 
iii)    The Approved Executive Share Option Scheme (1994) was adopted on 17 October 1994. The exercise of options granted under this scheme will 
normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year 
period. No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004). There were 
no discounted options granted under this scheme.
iv)    The Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (1996) was adopted on 7 June 1996. The exercise of options granted under this scheme will 
normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year 
period. No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004). There were 
no discounted options granted under this scheme.
v)    The International Executive Share Option Scheme (1994) was adopted on 20 May 1994. This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK 
executives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts. The exercise of options granted under this 
scheme will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-
year period. No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004). There 
were no discounted options granted under this scheme. 
vi)     The Executive Incentive Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected 
executives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
vii)  The Performance Share Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004 and amended on 29 June 2007. This scheme permits the grant of options in 
respect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options granted before 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between four and ten years from 
the date of grant for nil consideration. Options granted after 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of 
grant for nil consideration. The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the 
return on capital employed over a three-year period.
viii)  The Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004. This scheme permits the grant of approved, unapproved and international 
options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at  
a price not less than the middle-market quotation or average middle-market quotations of an ordinary share for the dealing day or three dealing days 
preceding the date of grant. The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the 
annual percentage growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme.
ix)   The Group New Business Incentive Plan (2007) was adopted on 29 June 2007. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary 
shares to selected executives. Options will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of grant and will be exercisable 
for up to two years from the vesting dates for nil consideration. The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified 
performance targets related to the return on capital employed over the seven-year plan.

Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The average share price during the year ended 27 February 2010 was 380.05p 
(2009 – 372.06p).
The fair value of share options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table gives the assumptions 
applied to the options granted in the respective periods shown. No assumption has been made to incorporate the effects of expected early exercise.

Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during a period. The measure of volatility used in the Group’s option 
pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time. In estimating the 
future volatility of the Company’s share price, the Board considers the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally 
commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.
b) Share bonus schemes
Eligible UK employees are able to participate in Shares in Success, an all-employee profit-sharing scheme. Each year, shares are awarded as a percentage 
of earnings up to a statutory maximum of £3,000. Eligible Republic of Ireland employees are able to participate in a Share Bonus Scheme, an all-
employee profit sharing scheme. Each year, employees receive a percentage of their earnings as either cash or shares.
Senior management also participate in performance-related bonus schemes. The amount paid to employees is based on a percentage of salary and is 
paid partly in cash and partly in shares. Bonuses are awarded to eligible employees who have completed a required service period and depend on the 
achievement of corporate targets. The accrued cash element of the bonus at the balance sheet date is £52m (2009 – £33m).
Selected senior management participate in the senior management Performance Share Plan. Awards made under this plan will normally vest three years 
after the date of the award for nil consideration. Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the 
return on capital employed over a three year performance period.
Senior management in the US business also participate in the US Long-Term Incentive Plan (2007) which was adopted on 29 June 2007. The awards 
made under this Plan will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of award, for nil consideration. Vesting will normally 
be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed in the US business over the seven-year plan.

The Executive Directors participate in short-term and long-term bonus schemes designed to align their interests with those of shareholders. Full details 
of these schemes can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The fair value of shares awarded under these schemes is their market value on the date of award. Expected dividends are not incorporated into the fair 
value except for awards under the US Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Note 28 Post-employment benefits
Pensions
The Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined 
benefit schemes. The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit pension schemes for the Group’s employees in the UK and the Republic 
of Ireland.
Defined contribution plans
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of £12m (2009 – £11m) have been fully expensed against profits in the current year. 
Defined benefit plans
United Kingdom 
The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which 
are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees. Towers Watson Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial 
assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2008, using the projected unit method. 
At the date of the last actuarial valuation the actuarial deficit was £275m. The market value of the schemes’ assets was £3,987m and these assets 
represented 94% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
During the year, the One Stop Senior Executive Pension Scheme was merged into the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme. As the One Stop Scheme was already 
part of the Group there has been no impact on the overall disclosures. The One Stop Scheme had a net liability of £4.6m at 28 February 2009.
Overseas
The most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit pension scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland. An independent actuary, 
using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 1 April 2007. 
The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the 
requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 27 February 2010. The schemes’ assets are stated at their market values as at 
27 February 2010. Towers Watson Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation. The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare 
benefits have also been determined in accordance with IAS 19, and are incorporated in the following tables.
Principal assumptions 
The valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the 
requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 27 February 2010. The major assumptions, on a weighted average basis, 
used by the actuaries were as follows:
          2010 2009
          % % 
Rate of increase in salaries             3.6 3.7
Rate of increase in pensions in payment*            3.4 3.1
Rate of increase in deferred pensions*            3.6 3.2
Rate of increase in career average benefits           3.6  3.2
Discount rate             5.9  6.5
Price inflation             3.6  3.2
* In excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) element.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate (the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation). If this assumption increased/ 
decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease/increase by approximately £140m and the annual UK current service cost would 
decrease/increase by approximately £17m.

UK mortality assumptions 
The Company conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the 
Scheme. At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008, the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes:
Base tables:
 PMA92C00 for male members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be one year younger than actual age.
 PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age.
These assumptions were used for the calculation of the pension liability as at 27 February 2010 for the main UK scheme.
As at 27 February 2010, the mortality assumptions have been strengthened. The base tables have been updated in line with medium cohort projections 
with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum from 31 March 2008 to 27 February 2010. In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements 
has been changed to incorporate medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum.
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 
at the same date +25 years: 
          2010 2009

Retiring at Reporting date at age 65:  Male          21.6 21.5

Total market value of assets         4,696   3,420
The expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective returns expected on the separate 
asset classes. The expected rate of return on equities and cash have both been set having regard to expected returns over the medium term, as 
calculated by the Company’s independent actuary. The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly from actual yields for gilts and corporate 
bond stocks. The above rate takes into account the actual mix of UK gilts, UK corporate bonds and overseas bonds held at the balance sheet date.

Post-employment benefits other than pensions 
The Company operates a scheme offering retirement healthcare benefits. The cost of providing these benefits has been accounted for on a similar basis 
to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The liability as at 27 February 2010 of £12m (2009 – £10m) was determined in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries. In 2010,  
£0.7m (2009 – £0.7m) has been charged to the Group Income Statement and £0.5m (2009 – £0.5m) of benefits were paid.

Expected contributions 
A formal actuarial valuation is carried out triennially for the scheme trustees by a professionally qualified independent actuary. The purpose of the 
valuation is to agree a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities. The actuarial 
valuation of approved schemes as at 31 March 2008 has been concluded and the Group’s contributions are increasing to 11.1% from 10.9%. On this 
basis the Group expects to make contributions of approximately £430m to defined benefit pension schemes in the year ending 27 February 2011.

Capital commitments
At 27 February 2010 there were commitments for capital expenditure contracted for, but not provided, of £1,835m (2009 – £1,551m), principally relating 
to the store development programme.
118 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements
Note 33 Commitments and contingencies continued
Contingent liabilities
The Company has irrevocably guaranteed the liabilities, as defined in Section 5(c) of the Republic of Ireland (Amendment Act) 1986, of various subsidiary 
undertakings incorporated in the Republic of Ireland.
For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see note 11.
There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability  
to the Group. The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment 
can be reliably estimated. 
In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading issued its provisional findings in its Statement of Objections relating to the alleged collusion between 
certain large supermarkets and dairy processors. On 30 April 2010, the Office of Fair Trading announced that it had decided to drop the allegations 
against the Group in relation to milk and butter in the dairy investigation. The Office of Fair Trading agreed a discretionary penalty discount of 10%  
for the Group not contesting the two remaining allegations which related to cheese. The Group has however made no admission of wrongdoing.  
The discounted fine will become payable after the OFT issues its decision later this year and is immaterial to the Group and therefore no provision  
has been recognised in the Group’s financial statements.
Tesco Bank
At 27 February 2010, Tesco Bank has commitments of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, totalling £6.5bn (2009 – 
£5.7bn). The amount is intended to provide an indication of the potential volume of business and not of the underlying credit or other risks.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is the UK statutory fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms  
and pays compensation if a firm is unable to pay claims against it. The FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury to fund these compensation costs 
associated with institutions that failed in 2008 and will receive receipts from asset sales, surplus cash flow and other recoveries from these institutions 
in the future.
The FSCS meets its obligations by raising management expense levies. These include amounts to cover the interest on its borrowings and compensation 
levies on the industry. Each deposit-taking institution contributes in proportion to its share of total protected deposits. The levy is calculated based on 
deposit balances held as at 31 December in each year and as such, this is seen as the ‘trigger event’ under accounting rules. 
If the FSCS does not receive sufficient funds from the failed institutions to repay HM Treasury in full it will raise compensation levies. At this time it is 
not possible to estimate the amount or timing of any shortfall resulting from the cash flows received from the failed institutions and, accordingly, no 
provision for compensation levies has been made in these financial statements.

* Tesco Personal Finance PLC was acquired as part of Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited on 19 December 2008.
It is Tesco Personal Finance PLC’s (TPF) policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently throughout its 
activities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying risks of the 
business. In carrying out this policy, TPF has regard to the supervisory requirements of the Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’). The FSA uses Risk Asset 
Ratio (‘RAR’) as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank’s capital resources with its risk-weighted assets (the assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures are ‘weighted’ to reflect the inherent credit and other risks); by international agreement the RAR should be not less 
than 8% with a Tier 1 component of not less than 4%. TPF has complied with the FSA’s capital requirements throughout the year.

Note 35 Leasing commitments
Finance lease commitments – Group as lessee
The Group has finance leases for various items of plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings. There are also a small number of buildings which are held 
under finance leases. The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximate to their carrying value.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases and hire purchase contracts, together with the present value of the net minimum lease payments 
are as follows:
         Present value of 
        Minimum lease payments minimum lease payments

Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:
          2010 2009
          £m £m
Within one year              1,043 754

After five years               10,004 9,170
Total minimum lease payments              14,749 12,993
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its retail, distribution and office properties and other assets such as 
motor vehicles. The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. 
The Group has lease break options on certain sale and leaseback transactions, which are exercisable if an existing option to buy back leased assets at 
market value at a specified date is also exercised, no commitment has been included in respect of the buy-back option as the option is at the Group’s 
discretion. The Group is not obliged to pay lease rentals after that date and so minimum lease payments exclude those falling after the buy-back date.
Operating lease commitments with joint ventures 
Since 1988, the Group has entered into several joint ventures and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures. The terms of these 
sale and leasebacks vary, however, common factors include: the sale of the properties to the joint venture at market value, options within the lease for 
the Group to repurchase the properties at market value, market rent reviews and 20-30 year lease terms. The Group reviews the substance  
as well as the form of the arrangements when making the judgement as to whether these leases are operating or finance leases; all of the leases under 
these arrangements are operating leases.
Operating lease receivables – Group as lessor
The Group both rents out its properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases. At the balance sheet date, the following future 
minimum lease payments are contractually receivable from tenants: 
          2010 2009

Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared under UK GAAP using the 
historical cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and 
the Companies Act 2006.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010  
(prior financial year 53 weeks ended 28 February 2009).
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies are set  
out below.
Exemptions
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under 
Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented a Profit and 
Loss Account for the Company alone.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing 
a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statement’. 
The cash flows of the Company are included in the Tesco PLC Group 
financial statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Parties’ 
from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of  
the Tesco PLC Group. 
Changes in accounting policies
The Company has adopted the following new and amended standards  
and interpretations as of 1 March 2009:
•  Amendments to FRS 20 ‘Share-Based Payment’ – Vesting Conditions 
and Cancellations, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009 (early adoption is permitted), clarifies that only service 
and performance conditions are vesting conditions. Any other conditions 
are non-vesting conditions which have to be taken into account to 
determine the fair value of the equity instrument granted. This award 
must be treated as a cancellation where the award does not vest as a 
result of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition that is within the 
control of either the Company or the counterparty. Cancellations are 
treated as accelerated vestings and all remaining future charges are 
immediately recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account 
with the credit recognised directly in equity. The results for the year 
ended 28 February 2009 have been restated accordingly. The impact  
on the Parent Company’s Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet  
is immaterial for both years.
•  Amendments to FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments – Disclosures’, effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 required 
enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.  
Current asset investments
These relate to money market deposits which are stated at cost. All income 
from these investments is included in the Parent Company Profit and Loss 
Account as interest receivable and similar income.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost less, where 
appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds 
Sterling at the exchange rates at the end of the financial year.
Share-based payments
Employees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form 
of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services 
in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) or 
in exchange for entitlements to cash payments based on the value of the 
shares (cash-settled transactions).
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the grant 
date using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with FRS 20 ‘Share-
Based Payment’ the resulting cost is charged to the Parent Company  
Profit and Loss Account over the vesting period. The value of the charge  
is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. 
Where the Company awards options to employees of subsidiary entities, 
this is treated as a capital contribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Parent 
Company’s Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Debtors 
Debtors are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair  
value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest  
rate method, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Investments 
Investments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale 
and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. There are  
no investments classified as held for trading. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value for available-for-sale investments are recognised 
directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be 
impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in equity is included in the net result for the period. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the 
substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of the 
Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the 
value of the amount received, net of attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated  
at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account over the 
period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Creditors 
Creditors are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.

T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 123 Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure 
to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating, financing 
and investing activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not 
qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by 
reference to market values for similar financial instruments, by discounted 
cash flows or by the use of option valuation models. Where derivatives do 
not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement 
are immediately recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss 
Account. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of 
any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship 
and the item being hedged.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to 
document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged 
and the hedging instrument. The Company is also required to document 
and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged 
item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be 
highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is 
performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge has remained 
highly effective.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one year 
from the balance sheet date are disclosed as falling due after more than 
one year.
Fair value hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when 
they hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that  
are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Parent 
Company Profit and Loss Account, together with any changes in the fair 
value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Derivative financial instruments qualifying for fair value hedge accounting 
are principally interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
Cash flow hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when 
they hedge the Company’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are 
either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset  
or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
The effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative 
instrument is recognised directly in equity. 
The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account in the same 
period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Parent 
Company Profit and Loss Account. The classification of the effective 
portion when recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account  
is the same as the classification of the hedged transaction. Any element  
of the remeasurement of the derivative instrument which does not meet 
the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Parent 
Company Profit and Loss Account.
Derivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally 
forward foreign exchange transactions and cross currency options.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction 
occurs or the original hedged item affects the Parent Company Profit and 
Loss Account. If a forecasted hedged transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred  
to the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account.
Net investment hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges 
when they hedge the Company’s net investment in an overseas operation. 
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from 
remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity. Any 
ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Parent Company 
Profit and Loss Account. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are 
included in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account when the foreign 
operation is disposed of.
Derivative instruments qualifying for net investment hedging are principally 
forward foreign exchange transactions and cross currency options.
Pensions 
The Company participates in the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme which is a 
multi-employer scheme within the Tesco Group and cannot identify its 
share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme. Accordingly,  
as permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the Company has accounted 
for the scheme as a defined contribution scheme, and the charge for the 
period is based upon the cash contributions payable. 
Taxation 
Corporation tax payable is provided on the taxable profit for the year, using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have 
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and would give rise 
to an obligation to pay more or less taxation in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable. 
They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all 
available evidence, it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date.
Recent accounting developments
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted, following new 
amendments to FRS interpretations. These have not had a significant 
impact on the results or net assets of the Company:
•  amendments to UITF Abstract 42 and FRS 26 – Embedded derivatives,

Measurement’ on Eligible Hedged Items, effective for periods beginning

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Tesco PLC
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of Tesco PLC 
for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010 which comprise the Parent

framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law  
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set 
out on page 68, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they  
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or  
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness  
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
27 February 2010;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 52 weeks ended 
27 February 2010 for which the Parent Company financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company financial 
statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
•  the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.

  Restated for the impact of IFRIC 13 and IFRS 2. Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 1
It has been another significant 
year for our work on the 
environment and within local 
communities. As we grow, our 
customers increasingly look to 
Tesco to take the lead in these 
areas – and we are. 
In January, we opened the world’s 
first zero-carbon store at Ramsey 
in Cambridgeshire – the latest 
step in our journey to reduce the 
carbon footprint of our business. 
Over the past year we have made 
significant progress towards 
our long-term goals by reducing 
our emissions by 7.8% on our 
baseline 2006/7 store and 
distribution porfolio.
This year we donated over 
£60 million to charities – once 
again exceeding our target to 
give the equivalent of 1% of our 
profits to good causes. 
These good results are testament 
to the hard work of our people. 
The Tesco team is now 472,000 
strong – and we remain united by 
our goal to improve the shopping 
trip for our customers. I would 
like to thank all our people for 
their hard work which I know will 
continue in the year ahead.
David Reid
Chairman
We have continued to grow 
sales, profits and market share 
over the past year. We’ve also 
significantly strengthened our 
balance sheet.
Our acquisition in South Korea 
is performing well and delivering 
excellent results, we’ve opened 
our first three Tesco Lifespace 
shopping malls in China and we 
have made good progress building 
the infrastructure and developing 
new products for Tesco Bank.
I am also pleased to announce 
that we again increased our 
dividend – for the 26th consecutive 
year. This consistent track record 
of delivering dividend growth 
for shareholders is unrivalled in 
the FTSE 100.
The strong Group results over 
the last year have been achieved 
through a constant focus on 
what matters most to customers 
in challenging times around the 
world. A good example of this 
has been our renewed focus on 
rewarding loyalty – at home and 
abroad – which has been a great 
success with customers.
In the UK, we increased our 
Clubcard investment with Double 
Points – giving customers even 
greater reward for their loyalty. 
Internationally, we launched 
Clubcard in three more countries 
during the year – in Poland, 
Slovakia and Thailand – and for 
the first time we now have more 
Clubcard holders internationally 
than in the UK. 
Over the past decade Tesco has transformed 
itself into a diverse international business – 
and by following our consistent strategy we 
are well positioned for long-term growth.
I am pleased to report that 
the Tesco team has once 
again delivered a good set of 
results – guided by experienced 
management who have steered 
the business through recessions 
before. As markets around the 
world are emerging from this 
recession each part of our 
business is well positioned to 
pursue our strategy for growth. 2 Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010

a solid performance. In our core 
grocery operations, we’re growing 
ahead of the industry as a whole 
and we have been less affected  
by falling inflation than the market 
at large.
In Non-food we have made good 
progress. In the UK we achieved a 
particularly strong performance in 
electricals, entertainment and toys. 
Our clothing range is becoming 
an international success, led by 
our F&F range which is growing 
rapidly in our European markets 
and this year was launched in  
four countries in Asia. 
Our Retailing Services have 
grown sales and profits once 
again. We’ve also been building 
the platforms for future growth, 
particularly in Tesco Bank, which 
is making good progress in 
developing its own systems and 
people capabilities as well as 
working on a broader product 
range as it moves towards 
becoming a full-service retail bank.
In the same way that we’ve stuck  
to our strategy in other parts of  
the business, we’ve also remained 
committed to our work on 
Community and the environment. 
In October, we set ourselves three 
challenging long-term targets:  
to become a zero-carbon business  
by 2050; to reduce the carbon 
impact of the products in our 
supply chain by 30% by 2020;  
and to help our customers halve 
their own carbon footprint by 
2020. And we’re making good  
progress already.
We’re delivering for all stakeholders: 
an improved shopping trip for 
customers; training and good 
careers for our staff; growth and 
This year’s results show 
another solid performance 
from across the Group. By 
staying focused on doing the 
right thing for customers we 
have weathered the economic 
storm well. And by remaining 
committed to our long-term 
strategy we are emerging  
from recession stronger –  
with good building blocks  
in place for future growth.
Each element of our strategy –  
UK, International, Non-food, 
Retailing Services and Community  
– is stronger now than this time  
last year. 
In International, our businesses 
have made good progress in a 
challenging global economic 
environment. Our strategy is 
working – we’ve grown sales, 
profits and market shares and 
we’ve continued to invest in the 
drivers of future growth. Our 
performance in Asia was particularly 
pleasing, our business in Europe 
held up well despite the obvious 
economic challenges and I believe 
the start-up losses in our US 
business will now begin to reduce 
as Fresh & Easy establishes itself.
Our UK business had a good year. 
By remaining focused on helping 
customers spend less and 
encouraging loyalty with an 
increased investment in Clubcard, 
our UK business has delivered  
innovation with our suppliers; in 
local communities we’re supporting 
causes that matter to customers; 
and we’re delivering good returns 
to shareholders.
Looking forward
The outlook for shareholder 
returns is encouraging: we have a 
strong core UK business growing 
well; our international businesses  
offer significant upside from 
recovery in the short term and 
maturity in the longer term; our 
balance sheet is strengthening; 
and we’re creating value through 
good property development.
Our positions in high-growth 
international economies and  
non-food meant we were always 
likely to face strong headwinds 
during the recession but it will  
be these parts of our business 
which will grow fastest in the 
recovery and beyond.
I am confident that with the 
prospect of an improving global 
economy and recent investments 
in acquisitions and new selling 
space making a greater contribution 
going forward, returns will 
improve significantly – starting 
this year.

Tesco has a well-established and 
consistent strategy for growth.  
The rationale for the strategy is to 
broaden the scope of the business  
to enable it to deliver strong, 
sustainable long-term growth by 
following customers into large 
expanding markets at home – such 
as financial services, non-food  
and telecoms – and new markets 
abroad, initially in Central Europe 
and Asia and more recently in the 
United States.
The strategy has five elements, reflecting our four 
established areas of focus plus Tesco’s commitments  
on community and the environment:
•  to be a successful international retailer;
•  to grow the core UK business;
•  to be as strong in non-food as in food;
•  to develop retailing services; and
•  to put community at the heart of what we do.
The strategy to diversify the business has been the 
foundation of Tesco’s growth in recent years. It was laid 
down in 1997, with the fifth element – Community – being 
added in 2007. Many of the new businesses that have 
been created and developed over the last 13 years as  
part of this strategy are now of significant scale and highly 
profitable – in fact we are now market leader in many  
of our markets outside the UK. In 1997 our International 
business generated 1.8% of the Group’s profits and we 
had only just entered the Retailing Services markets;  
today these parts of our business represent 22% and  
16% of profits respectively.
Importantly, the strategy has given the business momentum 
to grow well through the economic downturn. By continuing 
to invest through the recession – in the customer offer, in 
infrastructure and in our people – we are now well placed  
to grow faster and improve shareholder returns as the global 
economic environment improves. Retailing Services Community Non-food Our people

and resilience of our assets  
and local management teams  
and strengthens our confidence  
in our international strategy and 
long-term growth prospects. 
In Asia, we have delivered a  
strong performance despite 
challenging economic conditions  
in the region. We have grown 
sales and profits well – driven  
by new space and the excellent 
performance of the stores 
acquired in South Korea in 2008, 
which are now profitable. 
Europe overall delivered a robust 
performance against strong 
economic headwinds in the form 
of increasing unemployment and 
price deflation. By reducing costs 
and lowering prices for customers 
and by continuing to invest in new 
space we have made market share 
gains across our markets.
A good example is Ireland where 
we have made substantial 
changes to our business, which 
was facing the dual challenge  
of a severe recession and cross-
border trading. By integrating 
more of our international brand 
buying with our UK business we 
have been able to reduce the 
prices of 12,500 products by an 
average of around 20%. 
In the United States, Fresh & Easy 
has been making good progress, 
despite prolonged weakness in the 
California, Nevada and Arizona 
economies. Losses were broadly 
in line with guidance and reflect 
the fact that Fresh & Easy has 
been built with the infrastructure 
to support hundreds of stores. 
Although we do not expect losses 
to be much lower in 2010/11 we 
believe they have now peaked.
In International we have 
delivered a resilient performance 
in the face of challenging 
economic headwinds. Our 
businesses have made good 
progress – delivering for 
customers today and at the 
same time investing in the 
drivers of future growth.  
Our strategy is working –  
and we ended this year 
stronger than we started it.
Each of our businesses has 
adapted itself to the demands of 
its local market – with strong local 
management teams finding ways 
to lower costs and deliver great 
value for customers. Increasingly 
our international businesses are 
also utilising the scale and skill  
of the Tesco Group – with more 
international sourcing, Discount 
Brands now in seven markets,  
F&F clothing now in ten countries, 
Clubcard introduced in seven 
countries with more Clubcard 
holders internationally than in the 
UK – and the Tesco Operating 
Model sharing our global best 
practice to the benefit of all  
our businesses.
With clear signs that our 
international markets are starting  
to recover we are planning to 
resume a faster pace of new  
space opening in the coming year. 
In 2009/10 we opened 5.1m sq ft  
of new space and in 2010/11 we 
will open 8.5m sq ft in addition  
to nine shopping malls in  
China. The performance of our

this severe recession has provided 
reassurance on the quality

Lifespace – our unique approach in China
The size and scale of China provides 
unique challenges for a retailer but also 
offers a huge opportunity for a business 
prepared to show flexibility and vision. 
Our strategy is to expand into less 
developed second and third tier cities 
by opening hypermarkets in leading 
shopping malls. We’ve found it hard to 
find locations with the right facilities in 
some cities – giving us an opportunity 
to develop our own malls, to ensure 
they are the right size, location and 
design to meet the needs of the new 
Chinese consumer.
During the year we opened our first 
three Tesco Lifespace shopping malls  
in Fushun (pictured), Qingdao and 
Qinhuangdao and we will open nine 
more this year. Each mall comprises 
approximately 500,000 sq ft of retail 
space over five floors and is a one- 
stop destination providing shopping 
(including a 100,000 sq ft Tesco 
hypermarket), entertainment, dining 
and leisure. 
We are partnering with investors to share 
the capital commitment on some of 
these projects, enabling us to roll out 
more sites faster. Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 13

Customers earned 
£550m in Clubcard 
vouchers
Clubcard is our unique way of saying 
thank you to our customers for 
shopping with us. Launched in 1995, 
Clubcard now has 15 million active 
members in the UK. Clubcard not only 
rewards our customers for their loyalty, 
but it also provides us with valuable 
insight into changing shopping patterns. 
By monitoring this data and spotting 
trends early we’re able to respond 
quickly and ensure that we’re always 
providing customers with what they 
want, when and where they want it.
This year Clubcard became even more 
rewarding. By increasing our investment 
with Double Points, customers earned 
£550 million in total in vouchers. 
Double Points has encouraged more 
customers to sign up, a Clubcard is  
now used with a higher proportion  
of transactions than before and 
Clubcard – 15 years of loyalty 
18% more UK households are 
redeeming vouchers than a year ago.
The knowledge and expertise of 
operating Clubcard – combined with 
insight and analysis from dunnhumby –  
is now being adopted across our 
international businesses. We now have 
Clubcard in seven of our international 
markets – in fact we now have more 
Clubcard holders overseas than in  
the UK.
Quality – particularly in fresh food  
– remains important to customers 
even in tough times and as we 
emerge from recession this will 
become even more important. 
That’s why we have been investing 
in our fresh food offer with a  
wide-ranging change programme. 
Improved technical standards, 
additional specialist staff training, 
closer relationships with our 
suppliers and significant changes  
to the way we merchandise some 
key products are helping us 
deliver a stronger range and 
better shopping experience for 
customers. These and other 
initiatives helped Tesco win the 
‘Fresh Produce Retailer of the 
Year’ Award in 2009.
transactions, continue to keep us 
ahead of the industry on customer 
measures of checkout service. We 
trained more than 200,000 staff  
to help them respond better to 
customer needs and our ‘Every 
Comment Helps’ initiative, which 
encourages customers to give 
instant feedback via text or email, 
has given us the benefit of 60,000 
customer comments to help us 
improve our offer and service. 
Tesco’s diverse and adaptable 
range allows us to offer a wide 
choice for every customer whatever 
their budget. Through the recession 
we have helped customers with 
lower-priced ranges such as 
Discount Brands and Market Value 
and we have also offered them 
affordable treats such as the Finest 
Restaurant Collection ready meals, 
which have been very popular.  
We continue to innovate our range 
with over 2,600 new or improved 
own-label food lines launched  
this year.
Our strategy of earning 
customers’ loyalty by helping 
them to spend less – with low 
prices and affordable new 
products such as the Discount 
Brands – deflated sales growth 
initially but it was the right 
thing to do for customers. 
By encouraging and rewarding 
loyalty – through an increased 
investment in Clubcard – we have 
maintained steadier sales growth 
during the year than the industry 
as a whole, which has seen 
significant slowdown with the 
steep decline in inflation.
Whilst focusing on lowering prices 
and offering great promotions  
has been a real priority during the 
recession, delivering for customers 
is also about providing an ‘Every 
little helps’ shopping trip. That’s 
why we have continued to invest 
in availability, service, range  
and quality.
We understand how important  
it is to our customers that their 
favourite items are available every 
time they shop. Over the past year 
we have introduced a number of 
new initiatives to improve stock 
management and reduce further 
the number of gaps on our shelves. 
By developing more efficient 
ordering systems, introducing better 
in-store monitoring processes and 
changing the way we store our stock 
we have reduced evening gaps in 
fresh food by 18%. 
We’ve also stayed ahead of our 
competitors on key customer 
service measures. Our one-in-front 
initiative – where if there is more 
than one customer queuing at a 
single checkout we open another – 
and increased investment in self-
service checkouts, which now 
account for a quarter of all

F&F – a global brand
Our ambition is to make F&F a  
leading global fashion brand, offering 
unbeatable value for money, not 
compromised by quality, design  
or provenance.
F&F launched in the UK in 2001 and 
has expanded rapidly since then with 
sales last year of £540 million in the  
UK – supported by the launch of our 
online clothing site in October. 
F&F launched in Central Europe in 2008 
and we’re already making excellent 
progress. F&F is rapidly becoming 
established in the region with customer 
awareness of the brand growing from 
34% to 61% in the last year. 
Across our markets in Central Europe, 
Tesco is already one of the largest 
clothing retailers. In fact during the 
year we sold more F&F items – 
68 million – than the combined 
populations of our four countries in  
the region: Poland; Hungary; Czech 
Republic; and Slovakia. 
We’re now building on the success in 
the UK and Central Europe to launch 
F&F across our Asian markets. This year 
we launched in China, Malaysia, South 
Korea and Thailand. 
As with any brand, F&F can’t afford to 
stand still, which is why we’re broadening 
the brand’s appeal with new ranges – 
F&F Couture and F&F Jewellery.
•  www.tesco.com/clothing 
combines familiar Tesco labels – 
such as Cherokee and F&F – with 
new Tesco lines offered exclusively 
online, plus a number of other 
brands. It became one of the top 
ten most visited clothing websites 
within a few weeks of its launch;
•  www.tesco.com/entertainment 
has brought together, for the 
first time, our entire physical and 
digital entertainment offer, in a 
new and easy to use one-stop 
site. Customers can buy a CD, 
DVD or game and a film or 
album download, all in one 
transaction. From the outset  
the new site has proved popular 
with customers.
We are also bringing global scale 
and skill to our non-food business. 
For example, in Europe, the use of 
joint buying for clothing – whereby 
95% of the supplier base in Central 
Europe is the same as Ireland and 
the UK – enables us to reduce 
supply chain costs, helping us to 
maximise quality whilst minimising 
prices for customers. 
Shopping habits are changing – 
customers want to buy online as 
well as from stores and catalogues 
– and many will use a combination  
of these to research before buying. 
With an integrated multichannel 
approach we’re making it easy for 
customers, whichever way they 
want to shop. In addition to the 
15,500 products available online 
through Tesco Direct, we now  
have two new specialist websites 
launched in October: 
By remaining focused on 
providing customers with 
excellent quality and value, our 
non-food business has been 
resilient through the downturn. 
In some key categories we have 
made significant market share 
gains as more customers have 
been encouraged to try our  
non-food range in the search  
for great value and as some 
competitors have felt the strain. 
With our growing range in-store, 
customers are recognising the 
convenience of buying non-food 
items with their weekly groceries, 
rather than making a special trip  
to the high street. Our sales in toys, 
for example, continue to grow 
rapidly – up 25% this year.
In entertainment products, we’re 
reducing prices and differentiating 
our range by signing deals directly 
with film studios. This year we 
signed a groundbreaking deal with 
DreamWorks for the exclusive 
rights to the short animated film 
Merry Madagascar, which sold over 
one million copies over Christmas.
In some areas, such as electricals, 
customers are looking for specialist, 
impartial advice. That’s why we 
now employ over 1,000 specially 
trained Tesco Tech Support 
advisors in our largest stores in the 
UK. This team has helped Tesco 
double turnover in electricals in the 
last four years; we now sell one in 
every six microwaves in the UK and 
one in four small-screen TVs.

tesco.com – a leading online retailer
Including both our grocery and non-food 
offer, tesco.com is one of the largest 
online retailers in the UK, with sales  
of more than £2 billion. Just as in our 
stores, our success comes from listening 
to customers and a constant drive  
to ensure that we provide an online 
‘Every little helps’ shopping experience.
With more than a million active 
customers, our online grocery business is 
the market leader and the most profitable 
business of its kind in the world. It 
continues to grow strongly – last year  
we delivered over one billion items.  
We have put ease of use at the heart of 
our online shopping trip – for example, 
our ‘favourites’ feature, which makes 
shopping online easier by using 
Clubcard to remember a customer’s 
favourite in-store and online purchases. 
We also continue to innovate with our 
‘price match’ on any substituted 
products and our ‘shorter than we’d  
like’ code life guarantee.
Tesco Direct extends the reach of  
our non-food offer with over 15,500 
products available to customers via the 
internet and catalogues. Customers 
can choose to have goods delivered  
to their home or they can pick them up 
at one of our 261 in-store Direct desks. 
This year we relaunched our online 
entertainment site, enabling customers 
to buy downloads alongside the 
physical product, and we launched our 
online clothing website with a range  
of 2,500 fashionable items, of which 
1,000 were exclusively online.

customer service offer, growing 
sales by 28% and continuing on 
its path towards profitability.
Tesco Telecoms
Profit from our telecoms business 
grew, driven primarily by Tesco 
Mobile, which achieved a 14% 
increase in customer numbers –  
to more than two million – in a 
declining pre-pay phone market. 
Tesco Mobile also successfully 
entered the ‘pay monthly’ market 
this year and in December 
broadend its appeal further by 
becoming only the third UK 
operator to offer the iPhone,  
for which sales have been 
encouraging.
We have made good progress  
in rolling out our in-store Phone 
Shops with 105 open at year end 
and a further 100 planned by  
the end of this year. Phone Shops 
are transforming our ability to  
sell products that require an 
assisted sale, particularly contract 
mobile phones.
Also in 2009 we signed a wholesale 
broadband agreement with Cable 
& Wireless, which will enable us to 
relaunch our broadband offer  
to customers in 2010 with higher 
bandwidth speeds and lower prices. 
dunnhumby
This year marks dunnhumby’s 
20th anniversary. In addition to 
supporting Tesco’s Clubcard in 
seven countries around the  
world, dunnhumby serves other 
retailers and manufacturers in  
26 international markets; in fact 
Tesco now represents only around 
15% of its sales. dunnhumby  
is growing fast – with profits  
up 28% in the year. dunnhumby 
now touches the lives of over 
350 million consumers through  
its client relationships.
Following the announcement  
in July 2008 of our intention  
to take full ownership of Tesco 
Bank, we set a target to grow 
the profitability of our Retailing 
Services businesses from a little 
under £400 million in 2007/8 to  
£1 billion. This year we made 
good progress in attracting new 
customers and growing sales 
and profits while at the same 
time laying the foundations  
for further growth. 
Tesco Bank
Overall, Tesco Bank has delivered 
a good performance in a challenging 
retail banking market growing 
profits by 13% to £250 million. 
Bad debt levels rose during the 
year but have now stabilised and 
throughout have remained below 
industry averages. We grew the 
number of customer accounts by 
more than 400,000 in the last 
year – to a total of more than 
6.2 million across all products. 
We’ve made good progress in 
developing the systems we’ll need 
to operate Tesco Bank on a stand-
alone basis, selecting partners for 
both our banking and insurance 
platforms. Subject to regulatory 
approval, we anticipate launching 
new savings products and 
mortgages by the end of financial 
year 2010/11, with current accounts 
to follow by the second half of 2011.

The Key to a Low-Carbon World’. 
At that conference, we committed 
ourselves to a new set of challenging 
long-term targets: to become  
a zero-carbon business by 2050; 
to reduce the carbon impact of 
products in our supply chain by 
30% by 2020; and to help our 
customers halve their own 
footprints by 2020.
Actively supporting local 
communities
Throughout the year, we gave  
over £60 million in donations to 
charities and contributions to 
community projects including 
cause-related marketing, gifts-in-
kind, staff time and management 
costs. Once again we have donated 
the equivalent of more than 1%  
of our profits to good causes. 
Additionally, including our Charity 
of the Year partnerships, which go 
from strength to strength, this year 
our staff raised over £7 million for 
charity across the Group. 
We have continued to roll out 
Community Champions right 
across the Group. Community 
Champions are staff members 
who dedicate paid hours to 
coordinate store activities in their 
local communities. The Champions 
support local charities, organisations, 
schools and causes that local people 
really care about. We now have 
Champions in seven countries. 
Buying and selling products 
responsibly
In 2009, over 3,300 suppliers 
covering all our markets 
responded to our Group-wide 
anonymous supplier survey – 
Supplier Viewpoint. At least 90% 
agreed that we pay on time,  
we are professional, we treat  
them with respect and we are 
committed to meeting customer 
requirements.
We have launched our Trading 
Fairly programme and recruited 
our first ethical action managers 
in South Africa and Bangladesh, 
who work with our local suppliers 
to improve conditions across  
the supply chain. We have also 
introduced ‘Trading Fairly’  
Awards for our produce and 
clothing suppliers, which reward 
suppliers making particularly 
strong efforts to improve 
conditions for their employees.
Giving customers  
healthy choices
Across the Group we have exceeded 
our target of nutritional labelling on 
own-brand products – we now label 
100% of eligible products – giving 
customers the tools they need to 
make healthy choices.
As part of our strategy to encourage 
customers to lead more active 
lives, we run a range of programmes 
around the world from aerobic 
competitions in Thailand to charity 
‘Runs for life’ in Slovakia and  
the Czech Republic. This year we 
succeeded in getting 6.2 million 
people active across the world.
Creating good jobs and careers
We are dedicated to creating 
good jobs wherever we are.  
We will create 16,000 new jobs 
this year, including 9,000 in the 
UK and 380 for the long-term 
unemployed.
We are committed to being a 
responsible neighbour within 
our local communities and 
taking a leadership role on the 
environment. This is something 
our customers expect and  
we believe is increasingly 
important for our growth.
Caring for the environment
Over the past few years we have 
played a leadership role amongst 
large businesses in tackling 
climate change, through our own 
actions and in collaboration with 
our customers, suppliers, NGOs 
and governments around the world. 
We have made great progress this 
year in reducing CO
2
 emissions 
across our business globally. 
Emissions from our baseline 2007 
store and distribution centre 
portfolio have fallen by 7.8% over 
the past year and new stores and 
distribution centres built since 
2006/7 are on average emitting 
28.8% less CO
2
 than their 
equivalents in 2006/7.
We have delivered on our promise 
to divert 100% of store waste in the 
UK from going directly to landfill.
We opened the world’s first  
zero-carbon supermarket in Ramsey, 
Cambridgeshire, in January this 
year, deploying a range of energy-
efficiency measures, natural 
refrigeration and renewable 
energy technology.
In 2007 Tesco invested £25 million 
to create a new Sustainable 
Consumption Institute (SCI)  
at the University of Manchester.  
The SCI aims to answer some  
of the fundamental questions 
about how to make a consumer 
society sustainable. 
In October, the SCI held a 
conference to launch its first  
major report ‘Consumers:  
Community We’re continuing to lead the way in  
caring for the environment, supporting  
local communities and encouraging  
healthy lifestyles Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 21

“ ...you are given 
  the opportunity to  
  go as far as you want” Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 23
‘No-one tries 
harder for 
customers’
‘We treat people 
how we like to be 
treated’
Despite the tough global market 
in 2009 we continued to invest  
in pay at the annual review. We 
focused on our core rates and  
in a tough financial year our pay 
competitiveness improved in  
most markets.
In many developing markets, 
employees place most value on 
good basic pay and being paid 
fairly for overtime and these are 
our priorities. In Malaysia, for 
example, where there is no legal 
minimum wage, the minimum a 
Tesco employee will receive is 
30% more than the Poverty Line 
Index. In Thailand this year we 
introduced a staff discount linked 
to Clubcard.
In the UK, our reward package 
leads the market on pay and 
benefits. We are one of the few 
FTSE businesses to still have an 
open defined benefit pension 
scheme, which is greatly valued  
by staff. 
We are committed to providing 
opportunities for our people  
to get on and turn their jobs  
into careers. Last year we had 
more people on development 
programmes than ever before.
The first 17 students to complete 
the Tesco Foundation Degree 
graduated in July. The Foundation 
Degree in Retail – delivered  
and awarded by Manchester 
Metropolitan University – is a two-
year development programme 
aimed at providing work-focused 
retail training to managers at Tesco. 
We have now have 60 people on 
the scheme and are working on 
ways to make it grow.
We believe that even in difficult 
times it is essential to invest in 
future talent. That’s why this year, 
while many other businesses were 
cutting their graduate schemes, 
we increased our graduate intake 
to 810, including 535 in Asia. 
We now have 480 people at 
Director level in the business.  
Of these, 50% work in our 
International business –  
a combination of local hires  
and people moving from the  
UK business. 
We also understand the importance 
of increasing mobility. As a global 
business we’re developing leaders 
with a global perspective and now 
have 34% of our Directors with at 
least one year of experience 
outside their home country. 
Over the coming year we will  
be investing nearly £30 million  
in a purpose-built training facility 
in South Korea, set to become  
our Tesco Academy hub for Asia. 
The new Academy will help  
ensure that the development of 
our people in Asia keeps pace with 
the rapidly growing business.
We strive to provide an inclusive 
environment where all difference 
is valued, people are able to be 
themselves, enjoy coming to work 
and realise their full potential, 
regardless of their gender, marital 
status, race, age, sexual orientation, 
creed, ethnic origin, religion or 
belief, or disability.
Our Values are ‘No-one tries 
harder for customers’ and  
‘We treat people how we like  
to be treated’. These values  
are interlinked and underpin 
everything we do at Tesco.  
We know that by managing  
our people well – in a culture  
of trust and respect – they  
will in turn try their hardest  
for customers. 
By offering competitive pay and 
benefits and an opportunity to 
develop a long-term varied career 
with good training, we are able  
to keep our people motivated, 
committed and excited about 
working at Tesco. In the UK,  
for example, in our internal 
‘Viewpoint’ staff survey this year, 
we improved on 24 out of the  
25 measures and attendance 
levels improved again, putting  
an additional four million hours 
into our stores and depots.
Our people are crucial to our 
success and it is essential that  
they feel rewarded for the work 
they do and supported in their 
development. We offer good pay 
across all our businesses, as well  
as benefits in each market that 
reflect employees’ priorities. 
Our people As we grow our business we’re developing 
our people to become leaders for the future 24 Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010
Summary report of the Directors
Principal activity and business review
The principal activity of the Group is retailing and associated activities in the UK, China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Republic of Ireland, India, Japan, 
Malaysia, Poland, Slovakia, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey and the US. The Group also provides retail banking and insurance services through its subsidiary  
Tesco Bank. The summary of the Group financials is on pages 26 to 28.
Dividends
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 9.16 pence per ordinary share to be paid on 9 July 2010 to members on the Register at the close  
of business on 30 April 2010. Together with the interim dividend of 3.89 pence per ordinary share paid in December 2009, the total dividend for the year will  
be 13.05 pence, compared with 11.96 pence for the previous year, an increase of 9.1%.
Directors
Details of the current members of the Board are shown on the inside back cover.
David Reid, Lucy Neville-Rolfe, David Potts, Ken Hydon and Tim Mason retire from the Board and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM). Ken Hanna joined the Board on 1 April 2009.
Corporate governance
Tesco PLC is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. 
The Board considers that Tesco PLC complied in all respects with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance for the year ended 27 February 2010 with the 
exception of provision A.3.2, in respect of which the company was not in compliance for part of the year.
Provision A.3.2 requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise Non-executive directors determined by the Board to be 
independent. The Board recognises the importance of a balanced board with an appropriate level of independence. Due to unexpected changes to the Board in 
the previous year, with the resignation of Carolyn McCall and Mervyn Davies as Non-executive Directors, the Board was not in balance at the beginning of the year. 
At this stage, Ken Hanna’s impending appointment to the Board had already been announced, and he joined the Board with effect from 1 April 2009, at which 
point the Board became balanced and once again fully compliant with provision A.3.2.
A full corporate governance statement is contained in the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010. 
Summary report of the Directors on remuneration
 
Remuneration policy
It is the role of the Remuneration Committee to determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Executive Directors. 
Tesco has a long-standing policy of valuing talent and experience and seeks to provide incentives for delivering high, sustainable and profitable growth which 
leads to a strong increase in value for shareholders. The remuneration strategy is tailored to reward the delivery of strong year-on-year earnings growth as well  
as sustained performance in the longer term.
Compliance
In carrying out its duties, the Remuneration Committee gives full consideration to best practice. The Committee was constituted and operated throughout  
the year in accordance with the principles outlined in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority derived from the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance. The Remuneration Report complies with the disclosures required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
A summary of Directors’ emoluments and interests is set out on page 25. The full Remuneration Report is provided in the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements 2010.

Group financials
These results are for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010. In the last full financial year, we reported a 53-week period for the UK, Republic of Ireland and the 
United States (US) and a 52-week period for the rest of the Group. Growth rates in these results are expressed for the UK, Republic of Ireland and US to coincide 
with the comparable 52 weeks last year.
Statutory numbers include the adoption of IFRIC 13 (Customer Loyalty Programmes). All other numbers are shown excluding IFRIC 13, consistent with internal 
management reporting. More information can be found in note 1 to the Group financial statements in the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Group sales, including VAT, increased by 6.8% to £62.5 billion. At constant exchange rates, sales increased by 6.1% (including petrol) and 7.7% (excluding petrol).
Underlying profit before tax rose to £3,395 million, an increase of 10.1%. Group trading profit was £3,412 million, up 12.3% on last year and Group trading 
margin, at 5.9%, rose 25 basis points. These were helped by the fact that Tesco Bank was fully consolidated in 2010 and accounted for as a joint venture for most 
of 2009.
Group operating profit rose by 10.7% to £3,457 million. Group profit before tax increased 10.4% to £3,176 million.
On a statutory 52-week basis (compared to 53 weeks last year), Group operating profit rose by 9.1% to £3,457 million and Group profit before tax rose by 8.9% 
to £3,176m.
Cash flow and balance sheet Tesco liquidity has improved significantly during the year through strong cash generation, tight control of capex and working 
capital improvements arising from better inventory management. Net debt has consequently reduced by £1.7 billion to £7.9 billion.
Excluding the effects of currency fluctuations, we expect to reduce net debt to £7.5 billion by the end of the 2010/11 financial year.
The strength of our property backed balance sheet was further demonstrated with profitable market leading sale and leaseback transactions.
Group capital expenditure was £3.1 billion (last year £4.7 billion). This reduced level of spend was achieved whilst still delivering 8% growth in Group selling 
space. This year we plan to invest around £3.5 billion in capital expenditure.
Excluding Tesco Bank, cash flow from operating activities totalled £5.4 billion (£5.1 billion in 2009), including a £0.6 billion improvement in working capital.
Finance costs and tax Net finance costs, after net favourable IFRS adjustments of £103 million*, reduced to £314 million (£356 million last year on a consistent 
52-week basis). A reduction in the underlying interest charge is expected next year. Total Group tax has been charged at an effective rate of 26.4% (last year 
26.7%). We expect the tax rate in 2010/11 to be around 26%.
Dividend Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2% to 16.62p in the second half, calculated using a constant tax rate. The Board has approved a 
final dividend of 9.16p per share, taking the full-year dividend to 13.05p. This represents an increase of 9.1% on last year’s full-year dividend which is in line with 
the growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at constant exchange rates. The final dividend will be paid on 9 July 2010 to shareholders on the Register of 
Members at the close of business on 30 April 2010.
Property We are continuing to release value created through the long-term development of our property portfolio. In the year we completed deals with total 
proceeds of £1.8bn and we expect to divest a similar amount this year. The strong demand for these assets and the good yields achieved (initial yields between 5.0% 
and 5.2% for stores) demonstrate the strong underlying value of our property and the strength of the Tesco covenant. Profits from property in the year were £377m. 
Our property mix remains strong – over 70% of our property is freehold – supported by substantial new capital investment in freehold assets each year. Our latest 
property assets valuation of £34.6bn reflects recent firming yields across the market and confirms that our assets are worth well in excess of their book value.
Pension Our award-winning defined-benefit career-average pension scheme is an important part of our competitive benefits package, which helps Tesco recruit 
and retain the best people. In the UK we have 160,000 employees in the scheme. As at February 2010, under the IAS 19 methodology of pension liability valuation, 
the scheme had a deficit on a post-tax basis of £1.3bn, compared to £1.4bn at the half year. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme’s assets and liabilities 
showed a small and manageable deficit.
Return on capital employed We have continued to invest during the recession, which has put pressure on returns in the short term but is enabling us to make 
good progress in all our markets. During the financial year 2010 our post-tax return on capital employed (ROCE) fell from 12.8%** to 12.1%.
Having raised ROCE from 10.2% in 2003 to 12.6% in 2006, we committed in April 2006 to increase ROCE a further 200 basis points to 14.6%. We are 
reaffirming this commitment with confidence that with the prospect of an improving global economy and recent significant investments in acquisitions and new 
space making a greater contribution going forward, returns will improve in the coming few years, starting in 2010/11.

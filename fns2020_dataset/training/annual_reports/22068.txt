Results
We are delighted to report another successful year for the 
company, which has witnessed strong growth from the 
investment portfolio combined with profitable realisations  
and substantial new investments. Net asset value per share  
total return (‘NAVTR’) was 14.9%, building on last year’s 18.9%. 
Income generation was slightly above the previous year and 
continued to cover the cost of both expenses and dividend.  
The board is recommending an increase in the final dividend 
that would result in a 4.0% improvement on the previous year,  
a rate comfortably ahead of inflation. This would represent  
the forty-seventh consecutive year that the dividend paid to 
shareholders has been increased.
Caledonia offers investors the chance to invest alongside the 
company’s largest shareholder, the Cayzer family. The company 
achieves its long term outperformance by carefully choosing 
investments with strong management and sound financial 
discipline in both the listed and unlisted sectors. Caledonia’s 
balance sheet and ownership structure allow the company to 
take a genuinely long term view (in excess of ten years). As a 
closed end fund, we are not under pressure, as many other fund 
managers are, of having to invest new monies raised or having  
to make disposals within a fixed timescale.
The portfolio has evolved significantly since the incumbent 
management team took over four years ago. We have sold many 
of the smaller investments which, whilst good businesses, were 
unlikely to make a material impact on Caledonia’s net asset 
value. We have successfully sold several long term investments 
from our unquoted holdings and have reinvested in typically 
larger unit sizes or added to other larger shareholdings.
A recent but important emphasis has been on the management  
of risk such that returns from the risk taken compare favourably 
with the wider market. Above all, we recognise that we manage 
capital that has already been created and our job is one of both 
preservation and growth within sensible levels of risk.
It is worth reiterating Caledonia’s overriding  
strategic aims:
• to grow capital value over the long term measured 
in real terms 
• to pay an increasing annual dividend, which grows  
at or in excess of inflation over the long term
• to manage risk commensurate with shareholders’ 
requirements and our investment horizon.
A review of the detailed strategy adopted in 2011 was carried 
out by the board during the year. The result of this saw the 
strategic allocation to the Unquoted pool marginally increasing 
and allocation to the Funds pool reducing. This has reflected 
both market conditions and available opportunity. Details are 
given on page 7. In addition, we have made changes to overall 
performance measurement, which reflect the way we manage 
the business to achieve our strategic aims.
We have achieved a strong performance 
in a year in which we undertook 
significant activity across our portfolio. 
We continued to take advantage of 
opportunities to reduce some of our 
larger holdings to maintain the right 
balance of risk across the portfolio,  
and reported a substantial uplift in NAV 
on the sale of two unquoted investments. 
Our investment activity included  
two significant acquisitions, the 
purchase of Choice Care Group and  
Park Holidays, both of which fit well  
with our investment criteria.

Income
Income received during the year rose slightly to £41.7m, 
compared with £41.4m last year. Significant growth in income  
is unlikely to resume until 2016, when we expect the most recent 
unquoted investments to begin to make a full contribution.
Balance sheet
At the year end, we had net debt of £7.1m, compared with net 
assets of £1,445.6m, though one day later, we received initial 
cash of £67.2m from the disposal of Oval, taking the net cash 
to £60.1m. In addition to the cash balances, the company has 
£175m of committed bank facilities available to it. Our policy 
is to keep gearing at modest levels and this is primarily confined 
to the unlisted companies that we own rather than on Caledonia’s 
balance sheet. This is closely monitored by our investment  
team from their board positions at these companies. Our bank 
facilities are primarily in place to provide flexibility for timing 
differences between investment and divestment, but also in  
the case of extreme market movements when we might wish  
to deploy significant amounts of capital.
Overview of portfolio
This year’s performance has been driven by the Quoted, 
Unquoted and Funds pools. Income & Growth had a flat year 
following on from two years of strong outperformance,  
so its overall performance since inception remains healthy.

Portfolio 1,230.5 332.4 (251.6) 148.8  1,460.1 41.7 15.4 
The portfolio weighting by pool has changed modestly during 
the year, as the Quoted pool has continued to take profits and  
the Unquoted pool has made substantial new investments.  
The Quoted pool, measured as a percentage of net assets, has 
decreased from 40% to 35%, whereas the Unquoted pool has 
increased from 29% to 39%, although this reduced to 34% after 
the sale of Oval. The movement reflects partially our view as  
to comparative valuation metrics between listed and unlisted 
markets and partly the individual opportunities that presented 
themselves to us. The Funds pool continued to build its 
investments in public and private equity funds, particularly  
in the US and Asia, which is a long term process and will not 
influence performance in a significant way for several years. 
Caledonia’s top ten investments accounted for 44% of the 
portfolio, which is consistent with the previous year.
Performance measurement
Last year, the board ceased using a one year benchmark to 
measure performance, which had hitherto been the FTSE 
All-Share, preferring to concentrate on the ten year total return 
measure. Over a shorter period of time, it is more relevant to 
measure our absolute performance on an inflation adjusted basis. 
Since our shareholders expect to increase their wealth in real 
terms on an annual basis, we, in turn, should expect, on average, 
to beat inflation. Should markets fall substantially, so the value 
of our portfolio will fall as we will not move substantially into 
cash. But over several years, we would expect our portfolio to 
grow somewhat ahead of inflation. The table below shows the 
performance of markets over varying periods of time and is 
instructive in judgement of inflation adjusted performance.

With both our longer term investment strategy and our 
exposure to unlisted investments, a true picture of how the 
portfolio is performing is only really apparent after a substantial 
amount of time has passed. The board therefore has settled on 
a rolling ten year timeframe as being a relevant period against 
which to compare performance with the FTSE All-Share Total 
Return index. In addition, the board’s aim is for the company to 
deliver annual average returns over a ten year period of between 
RPI+3% and RPI+6%. Historically, this level of performance 
would be in line with or above most share indices, including the 
FTSE All-Share Total Return. Caledonia’s own track record since 
1987, the year in which Caledonia realised its holding in British 
& Commonwealth Holdings and embarked on its strategy  
to build a diversified holding company, was RPI+9% against  
that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return, which was RPI+6%.

Caledonia’s portfolio is invested worldwide though, in general, 
we restrict our direct unlisted investing activities to the UK. 
We invest in funds, both private and public equity, to give 
shareholders wider geographical exposure, backing managers 
for whom we have a high regard. The portfolio has wide 
exposure to currencies other than sterling, which represented 
47% of the overall exposure when investee companies are 
analysed by revenue rather than by domicile. Our policy, as a 
long term investor, is to accept currency fluctuation as a part of 
investment risk. We do not therefore hedge unless a contractual 
obligation has been entered into concerning either proceeds of  
a disposal or funds for an acquisition.
Pool performance
Quoted (£498m, 35% of net assets)
We invest in companies with established business models, strong 
balance sheets and good returns on capital and invest in equities 
over the long term.
The Quoted pool produced an impressive 20.5% return for the 
year, despite reducing its capital base by a net £101m. There 
were notable performances from Polar Capital, returning 69%, 
and Quintain Estates, returning 62%, both investments that 
have been part of the portfolio for many years. The latter had a 
difficult time during the financial crisis, culminating in a rights 
issue, which we supported, and we are delighted to see it return 
to robust health. Close Brothers also contributed significantly, 
producing the second largest gain in value in the portfolio over 
the year. We continued to lighten our holding in this company, 
but we still retain a substantial, albeit reduced, shareholding.  
We also took profits on our long term shareholding in Bristow 
Group, which has produced a series of excellent results over the 
past three years.
New positions have been taken in Rolls-Royce, Diageo and 
Atlas Copco and we added to a number of existing quoted 
businesses that we hold, notably Jardine Matheson. All pay 
healthy levels of dividends. 
Unquoted (£568m, 39% of net assets)
We invest in unlisted businesses requiring capital and an investor 
with a balance sheet to support a long term perspective. We invest 
in both majority and minority positions.
The Unquoted pool produced a healthy return of 17.7% for  
the year, including generating £22.4m of income. The return 
included a significant uplift on the disposal of Amber Chemicals 
and an increase in value of Oval to its sale value, with healthy 
contributions from most of the remainder of the portfolio.
It has been a year of intense deal making for the Unquoted pool, 
with two significant new investments, Park Holidays and Choice 
Care Group, and two sales, Amber Chemicals and Oval. 
We purchased 98% of the equity of Choice Care Group for 
£49.5m in August 2013. The business is based near Reading and 
owns and operates 49 homes in the south of England, providing 
personalised residential care and supported living for adults 
with severe learning difficulties. The company has significant 
asset backing from its properties and has many other 
characteristics that fit well with our strategy. Caledonia’s  
long term approach is well matched with this business, which 
seeks to grow gradually without compromising its provision  
of care, which is its first and foremost priority. We have already 
provided the company with additional capital to fund its plans 
for expansion.
In November 2013, we acquired Park Holidays, the UK’s fourth 
largest caravan park operator, for an equity consideration of 
£88.1m. This is also a business that fits well with our investment 
criteria, being asset backed and highly cash generative. The 
business has made a good start, with bookings and caravan sales 
showing good growth on the previous year, as we head into the 
high season.
We sold our holding in Oval to the US family-owned insurance 
company, Arthur J Gallagher, one day after the year end. Whilst 
the investment is still shown as part of the portfolio at the year 
end, it is included at the disposal value of £70.0m, a 65% uplift 
to our previous holding value. The final division of Amber 
Chemicals was sold for £22.9m, which represented an uplift 
of over 60% on the holding value prior to sale.
The remainder of the portfolio, which consisted of ten principal 
investments, exhibited good growth. At TGE Marine, the 
liquefied gas engineering company, profits more than doubled 
as its strong order book was translated into sales. Our 2013 
US acquisition of Latshaw Group, consisting of five engineering 
businesses, has been successful, with strong profits growth 
across the companies, as the US economy continues to recover. 
The Sloane Club had a good year, with occupancy rising to new 
highs. Cobehold, which is our largest single investment, valued  
at £100.2m, saw its NAV total return grow by 7%. During the year, 
we participated in Cobehold’s €400m capital raising, committing 
€19.8m of which €9.9m (£8.4m) has been paid to date, enabling 
the company to make several interesting new acquisitions. 
However, we wrote down the value of Easybox, our Italian self -
storage business, and Satellite Information Services, the media 
company, recognising difficult trading conditions.
Funds (£204m, 14% of net assets)
We invest in both private and public equity funds with an emphasis 
on providing exposure to areas of the world where we are less 
willing to invest directly.
The Funds pool return of 11.8% was particularly creditable, 
especially as we are in the process of progressively building its 
exposure to private equity, which means that investment gains 
will not fully come through for several years. The most notable 
performance came from our Chinese private equity fund 
holding, Capital Today China (‘CTC’), where the valuation of  
our stake increased by 53% to £44.8m as at 31 March 2014.  
We originally committed $20m to this fund and have to date 
received $15.2m (£9.9m) in cash. CTC holds a 7% stake in JD.com, 
a Chinese internet retailer, which has recently completed an  
IPO in the US. The fund also owns three other investments  
of note: Youku Tudou, an online video sharing site in which 
Alibaba recently took an 18% stake, Shanghai Sinoway Herbage 
Cosmetics Company, the leading herbal skincare brand in China, 
and City, the largest lingerie retail chain in China.

Strategic report
Board
After serving on the board for nine years, Richard Goblet 
d’Alviella has decided to step down on 25 June 2014. He will be 
replaced by Harold Boël, CEO of Sofina, the Belgian investment 
company, which has a 5% stake in Caledonia and shares our 
philosophy of close involvement in its investee companies. 
Richard has been a great advocate and supporter of our 
long term outlook and we will miss his wise counsel. Harold  
is a material sciences engineer by training and has been CEO  
of Sofina for six years, prior to which he held a number of 
operational and managerial roles with Corus, now part of  
Tata Steel. We look forward to welcoming him to the board  
as an independent non-executive director.
Charles Allen-Jones has also signalled his wish to step down at 
some point during the current year. Charles has served on the 
board for over 12 years and has made an immeasurable impact 
on the affairs of the company, especially as senior independent 
non-executive director. His sage advice and independent 
thinking will be difficult to replace, but when the time comes  
he will retire with our deep gratitude and very best wishes.
Outlook
It makes a pleasant change to be able to write that economic 
growth is finally returning to western economies, albeit at a low 
level. Asian and other developing economies continue to grow  
at a much faster rate than those in the west, though not without 
signs of slowing down. This has affected their stock markets  
and has brought valuations back to levels where we now feel 
comfortable to deploy capital in these regions. 
Elsewhere, stock markets are now mainly being valued on 
a fundamentals basis, with earnings growth to the fore. 
We believe that the gains of the past two years will not be 
repeated to the same extent this or next year and remain wary  
of external events, which often lead to heavy falls in markets. 
In the UK, economic growth continues to pick up, but we face  
the uncertainty caused by the Scottish vote on independence  
in September this year and a UK general election in 2015. 
Our portfolio remains cautiously positioned, but invested in 
sound businesses with good prospects providing they are 
allowed to flourish by those entrusted to govern our economy. 
We remain confident in our strategy, which is delivering long 
term outperformance and annual returns in excess of inflation.
Rod Kent  Will Wyatt
Chairman Chief Executive
During the year, we invested in several new funds: $10.0m 
(£6.0m) in the Ranger fund managed by Arlington Value Capital, 
a US based value investor which targets listed US equities,  
and £10.0m in the launch of the Polar Capital Global Financials 
Trust, which aims to benefit from the re-rating of financial 
assets across the globe. In addition, we committed $50m to  
FLAG Capital, a US private equity fund of funds, of which $8.5m 
(£5.7m) was drawn in the year. Soon after the year end, 
we invested $20.0m (£11.9m) in the NTAsian Discovery Fund, 
a Bangkok-based small-cap public equity fund, and committed 
$15m to Vision Knight Capital II, an Asian private equity fund.
Income & Growth (£190m, 13% of net assets)
The portfolio holds interests in 40 international listed businesses, 
which provide a reliable and growing dividend. Cash flow returns 
to shareholders are prioritised in the invested businesses.
The Income & Growth pool’s flat performance for the year 
contrasted with last year’s excellent performance, when it 
produced a 23.7% return. The pool has completed three  
full years in existence and performance figures have been  
very pleasing, with a three year return of 28%. Higher yield 
investments went out of vogue during the year under review 
as investors chased growth in higher risk assets. The pool 
produced income of £7.0m, a 40% increase on the previous year, 
representing a gross yield of 4.3%. This will continue to build  
in the future.
The top five holdings were SES, Zurich Insurance, Swedbank, 
HSBC and General Electric. The pool not only provides Caledonia 
with a sustainable income, but also gives us exposure to some  
of the world’s best companies, something we believe is essential 
in any portfolio. We added £20m to the pool during the year  
and would anticipate doing so again during the current year, 
whilst we have surplus cash, to bring the pool in line with its 
strategic allocation.
Discount and share buy-backs 
During the year, we bought back shares for a total of £15.0m, 
which were subsequently cancelled. We view buy-backs as a low 
risk, long term tool for enhancing returns, providing a permanent 
benefit to shareholders when purchased at a discount to net 
assets. The discount to net asset value has traded in the range  
of 16% to 26% throughout the year and we were able to take 
advantage of this to buy shares at an average discount of 19.7%. 
We will once again seek the necessary shareholder approvals  
at the forthcoming annual general meeting to continue with 
these buy-backs for a further year.
Dividend
The board is recommending shareholder approval of a final 
dividend of 35.7p, giving a total for the year of 49.1p, a 4.0% 
increase on the previous year. This would represent the 
forty-seventh consecutive year of increase in our annual 
dividend. The final dividend will be paid on 7 August 2014, 
assuming its payment is approved at the annual general  
meeting to be held at Cayzer House on 17 July 2014. 6  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Business model and strategy
Business model
We aim to deliver long term growth to both shareholder capital 
and income by investing in a balanced, risk managed range of 
asset classes, across diversified sectors and regions. We focus  
on established businesses, where return on capital employed  
is a differentiator of longer term performance and where 
underlying real assets provide risk mitigation to the balance 
sheet. We use gearing cautiously and focus it within appropriate 
asset classes, principally to mitigate risk rather than to drive 
returns. This typically arises within the Unquoted pool, where 
the existence of preference share capital and structured loans 
provides both a level of additional security over assets and a 
mechanism for preferential annual income flows.
We have funding flexibility, through a £125m revolving credit 
facility, which is used to mitigate any short term illiquidity 
within the portfolio, facilitating the bridging of short term 
investment flows. We also have a £20m term loan, used to 
provide long term funding to investments and an additional 
£30m revolving credit facility for liquidity management in 
a service company.
Our business model has been developed over many years to 
deliver long term growth in capital and an increasing annual 
dividend to shareholders.
Pools of capital
We manage our portfolio through distinct ‘pools’ of capital,  
each headed by an experienced, specialist investment executive. 
Each pool invests to achieve target capital and income returns, 
combining to provide a managed total return for Caledonia.
• The Quoted pool focuses on identifying opportunities to build 
meaningful positions in long term value businesses.
• The Unquoted pool takes direct minority and majority stakes in 
private companies, where an opportunity exists to partner a 
strong management team with capital, without the traditional 
restrictions of short term private equity financing. We take a 
board seat in all significant private company investments. 
• The Funds pool contains investments in UK, European, North 
American and Asian private and public equity funds and, in 
particular, provides diversified overseas reach in areas where 
our investment model would make direct investing more 
difficult to manage. 
• The Income & Growth pool provides an exposure to global 
‘mega-cap’ companies offering capital growth potential and 
high dividend expectations. This pool provides both a reliable 
platform for our overall income requirements and a source 
of liquidity.
Caledonia is a self-managed investment 
trust company with net assets of £1.4bn. 
Our heritage can be traced back to  
the shipping empire established by  
Sir Charles Cayzer in 1878. We continue 
to enjoy the backing of the Cayzer family, 
which owns some 48.5% of the share 
capital. The Cayzer family shareholding 
provides both support for our long term 
value investment horizon and provides a 
foundation to our culture of conservative 
generational wealth management. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  7

Principles Where we are now
We allocate our capital predominantly amongst quoted equities, 
private companies and funds. We identify a strategic allocation 
range to each of these classes commensurate with our overall 
risk and return objectives. These allocation ranges are reviewed 
regularly to ensure they remain consistent with our strategy 
and market conditions.

We look to achieve a diverse investment portfolio by asset class, 
industry sector, geography and currency. Overall exposures in 
each case are actively monitored and managed by our executive 
management, under the supervision of the board. The portfolio 
is further diversified through our fund investment portfolio and 
the selection of external fund managers with clear mandates.
Despite being primarily a sterling based asset portfolio, we 
achieve a significant exposure outside the UK through the 
revenue exposure provided, in particular, from our Funds  
pool and our Income & Growth pool investments.

We look to mitigate concentration risk by limiting the value of  
an investment in any one company to less than 10% of our net 
asset value and will look for appropriate market opportunities  
to recycle value throughout the portfolio to achieve this in an 
appropriate timeframe. In recent years, our investment 
concentration has reduced.

We maintain a degree of portfolio liquidity to provide both risk

process and both individual investments and the portfolio  
as a whole are periodically measured against a number of risk 
control metrics, including concentration, liquidity, volatility and 
sector and geographical diversity. In addition, we ensure that we 
have formal representation on the board of all our core private 
company investments and, where we have a significant holding, 
some listed investments.
Investment process
Our investment process is built from a disciplined series of steps, 
leveraging Caledonia’s reputation and the experience of our 
investment team. We look to identify long term value through 
each stage, including sourcing opportunities and initial reviews, 
through due diligence, approval and deal execution. The 
performance of our investments is subject to a formal review 
Business model and strategy continued
Manage and support investees
We manage our investments as pools 
of capital, focusing ownership and 
responsibility on our executive team. 
Where we take a board seat, we can both 
actively monitor the development of our 
investment and contribute long term 
support and governance.
Make significant investments
We invest directly in both listed and 
unlisted opportunities around the world. 
Our minimum investment size is £10m 
and we are willing to invest between 
£20m and £50m for significant equity 
interests in companies.
Develop business network
Maintaining our reputation as a 
supportive and constructively involved 
long term investor enables us to develop 
our network of contacts, who will give  
us priority consideration when new deal 
opportunities arise.
Identify best opportunities
We adopt a disciplined process of 
research and due diligence to identify 
value opportunities in well-managed, 
long term businesses with established 
business models and strong cash flows. 
Such opportunities are typically not 
reliant on leverage for returns and offer 
long term growth potential.
Monitor and control risk
Individual investments and the 
investment portfolio as a whole are 
monitored for risk against our strategic 
objectives. Consideration is given to 
concentration exposure, volatility levels, 
liquidity and geographical and industry 
sector diversity.
Attract preferential deal flow
Our reputation, network of deal 
originators and family tradition enable  
us to access premium investment 
opportunities not always available to 
others. This derives from both tracking 
quality management teams in proven 
businesses and through the contacts  
we make through our extensive board 
representation network.
The Caledonia team
At its heart, our investment 
process is focused on 
recruiting and retaining high 
quality investment executives 
to maintain deal flow and 
investment continuity,  
who understand and are able  
to execute Caledonia’s 
investment philosophy.

Target returns
Our investment approach is aimed at delivering high single  
digit total annual returns, over rolling ten year periods. This 
investment horizon provides the time frame for businesses to 
grow and accumulate in value in a controlled manner, within both 
the public and private markets, whilst mitigating some of the 
volatility inherent in short term trading investment strategies.
Over rolling ten year periods, we believe such an investment 
approach both optimises risk/return characteristics and 
outperforms most markets. Over a ten year investment horizon, 
we target a sustainable annual yield from portfolio assets, 
providing a balance to total return between income and 
capital appreciation. 10  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Over the year, our investment 
performance delivered an NAV total 
return of 14.9%.
Over the last four years, we have 
rebalanced our portfolio substantially, 
increasing diversification, yield and 
portfolio liquidity and reducing 
investment concentration and the 
number of subscale investments.
Our investment process is at the heart of our current 
performance and future prospects. We have an unconstrained 
approach, which allows us to look across regions, sectors, size 
and time horizons. Fundamental to our choice of investments 
is our research and disciplined investment process.
Performance
Our NAV total return over the year was 14.9%, which built  
on a total return of 18.9% in the previous year.
Over the year, we have developed our portfolio through 
significant new investment, funded by opportunistic disposals 
and managed top-slicing. The portfolio has benefited from 
significant revaluation and realisation gains, as well as higher 
levels of income. Our investment portfolio produced a 15.4% 
return, which, after management and other expenses, delivered 
an overall NAV total return of 14.9%.
The 15.4% portfolio return comprised increases in the valuation 
of our investments and the income that they yielded.

Strategic report
During the year, we realised £251.6m, around half resulting from 
the reduction of holdings in the Quoted pool and a quarter from 
recycling within the Income & Growth pool.
Net portfolio gains over the year totalled £152.0m (after 
adjusting for a £0.6m loss on unallocated investments), 
comprising £196.4m of gains, offset by £44.4m of losses.  
£57.7m of net gains were generated by the Unquoted pool, 
principally Oval, sold on 1 April 2014, and TGE Marine.  
The Quoted pool generated £81.5m of net gains and the  
Funds pool £19.9m. The Income & Growth pool lost £6.8m.

During the year, we made two substantial unquoted 
investments. We invested £88.1m for 100% of the equity  
in Park Holidays, a UK caravan parks owner and operator.  
We also invested £49.5m for 97.7% of the equity in Choice Care 
Group, a UK owner and operator of residential learning disability 
homes, in each case to support a management buy-out.
Other new investments included £10.0m in the Polar Capital 
Global Financials Trust, a UK investment trust investing in  
global financial companies, and drawdowns from new fund 
commitments.
Follow-on investments included an increase in our holding in 
TGE Marine, the German gas engineering company, to 67.9% at  
a cost of £8.9m. We invested a further £8.4m in part paid shares 
in Cobehold, the Belgian investment company, as part of a 
€400m capital raising. During the year, we advanced a further 
£7.5m of loan finance to Brookshire Capital, a UK property 
investment company, to enable it to expand its portfolio. 
The £103.7m invested through the Income & Growth pool 
represented both an increased allocation of cash to this pool  
of £20.0m and changing holdings within the pool. This portfolio 
contained 40 companies at 31 March 2014 (down from 42 at  
the previous year end), in a range of sectors across the globe, 
with stakes ranging in value from £2.0m to £7.5m.
Realisations
Proceeds from portfolio realisations during the year totalled 
£251.6m (2013 – £309.6m), summarised as follows:

Greggs Quoted 8.1 
Kingdom Group Quoted 6.6 
Income & Growth pool Income & Growth 69.3 
Other realisations 29.5 
Total portfolio realisations 251.6 
We have continued to sell down our substantial investment 
in Close Brothers, to enable us to broaden the spread of our 
investments across the portfolio. In addition, we released capital 
from a number of other substantial long term investments held 
in the Quoted pool, in particular, Bristow Group, LondonMetric 
Property, Quintain Estates and Kingdom Group.
The £69.3m of realisations through the Income & Growth pool 
were recycled into new investments, or used to increase our 
holdings in existing companies. This demonstrates the active 
management of the Income & Growth pool and indicates an 
average portfolio turnover of around three years.

The overall return primarily arose from strong market 
performances of our top listed investments, including Close 
Brothers, Quintain Estates, Polar Capital, LondonMetric Property 
and AG Barr. Amber Chemicals delivered a gain of £7.2m as a 
result of our sale to ICM Corporation on 31 March 2014 and  
Oval was marked up to the value of its sale to Arthur J Gallagher 
on 1 April 2014. 12  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc

Private equity funds 10%  9%
Public equity funds 3%  2%
Cash and other -1%  6%
Over the year, there has been a substantial shift in allocation 
from listed equities and cash to private companies. The 
reduction in listed equities principally arose from part 
realisations of Close Brothers, Bristow Group, LondonMetric 
Property and Quintain Estates. The new investments in Park 
Holidays and Choice Care Group principally accounted for the 
increase in private companies.
After the year end, we realised our investment in Oval, which 
would have had the effect of reducing private companies and 
increasing cash each by 5%.
Currency
The following chart analyses net assets by currency exposure, 
based on the currencies in which securities are denominated 
or traded.

The changes in currency exposure over the year principally 
reflected portfolio changes. In particular, the sales of UK quoted 
company holdings and additional European investments have 
shifted the balance from sterling to the euro.
On the other hand, the valuation of Satellite Information Services 
fell as a result of the loss of its BBC outside broadcasting contract 
and reduced prospects for its core betting content services.  
The value of the Income & Growth pool investments fell in 
aggregate, particularly during the first quarter of 2014, when 
market sentiment moved quickly against income stocks, which 
is the core of this portfolio, in favour of growth opportunities.

The chart shows a significant shift during the year, from the 
Quoted pool and cash and into the Unquoted pool. However,  
this omits the sale of Oval on 1 April 2014, which reduced  
the Unquoted pool to 34% and increased cash to 4%.
The increase in the Funds pool reflected the investment  
in the Polar Capital Global Financials Trust and commitment 
drawdowns in two new US funds.

The increase in the value of TGE Marine, a shift in the geographic 
weighting of the Income & Growth pool, the Quoted pool 
investment in Atlas Copco and the additional fund raising by 
Cobehold has increased our exposure to Europe over the year. 
Similarly, the realisation of part of our holding in Bristow Group 
has reduced our exposure to the US.
At the end of the year, UK listed and resident companies 
accounted for 57% of our portfolio. However, much of our UK 
exposure is through multinational companies, which generate  
a large proportion of their revenues overseas. The following 
chart shows the geographic analysis by revenue generation, 
which shows an exposure to the UK economy of 47%.

Portfolio summary 14  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
The Quoted pool contains significant holdings in well managed 
companies, held for the long term. These investments typically 
offer substance, brand, intellectual property and strong market 
position. We target opportunities that have a good record of 
return on capital employed and a strong asset base. In common 
with the wider Caledonia philosophy, we look to back good 
management teams who run their companies along prudent 
financial lines but with ambition for good returns.
The pool started the year with investments valued at £517.2m 
and ended with a value of £497.8m, as the opportunity was 
taken to top-slice a number of strongly performing investments 
into a buoyant market. In total, £100.9m of net realisations were 
made, principally £43.4m from Close Brothers, £35.2m from 
Bristow Group and £23.2m from LondonMetric Property.
Including £10.6m of income, the Quoted pool achieved a return 
over the year of 20.5%, following last year’s return of 24.6%.
A number of strong performances contributed to the Quoted 
pool gains totalling £81.5m, notably from Close Brothers,  
Polar Capital, Bristow Group and Quintain Estates. 
We have established new initial investments in a number of 
quality businesses, including Atlas Copco (£8.3m), the Swedish 
industrial engineering group, Rolls-Royce (£5.1m), the aircraft 
engine manufacturer, and Diageo (£4.8m), the premium drinks 
business, and added £5.2m to our holding in Jardine Matheson, 
the diversified business group focused principally on Asia.

Strategic report
Polar Capital, the AIM listed investment manager, almost 
doubled its assets under management over the year to $13.2bn. 
We provided initial capital for this business in 2001, which has 
now grown to 99 employees.
Dewan Housing Finance, the Indian listed company providing 
house financing to lower and middle income purchasers 
returned 14.7% over the year, supported by strong results.
LondonMetric Property, is a UK REIT investing in commercial 
and residential property, principally in the UK. Strong earnings 
growth and valuation increases resulted in a 40.6% return  
to Caledonia whilst, at the same time, we reduced our  
holding substantially.
We invested in Spirax Sarco, a supplier of engineered solutions 
for the design, maintenance and operation of industrial and 
commercial steam systems, in 2011. Although the company’s 
performance improved over the last year, its share price 
advanced only a modest amount. However, an 11% increase  
in its annual dividend helped us achieve a 9.8% return.
We increased our investment in Jardine Matheson, the 
diversified business group focused on Asia, over the year. 
However, a flat result led to a slight decline in the share price, 
which could not be offset by its dividend, resulting in a negative 
return to us of 4.1%.
Bristow Group is a leading provider of helicopter services to  
the offshore energy industry, quoted on the NYSE. We initially 
invested in Bristow in the UK in 1991 and saw it merged with  
the US-based Offshore Logistics in 1996. Bristow had a 
successful year, with revenue and earnings increasing over  
the previous year. In February 2014, Bristow acquired 60% of 
Eastern Airways, a UK airline providing charter and scheduled 
services, principally for UK oil and gas industry transport.
Close Brothers, the UK listed specialist financial services group, 
had a strong first half result to 31 January 2014, with increases 
across the banking, brokerage and asset management divisions. 
Although we continued to top-slice our holding into a buoyant 
market, our investment returned an excellent 37.1% over 
the year.
AG Barr, the UK soft drinks manufacturer, particularly notable 
for its Scottish soft drinks, Irn-Bru and Rubicon, had another 
good year, with earnings and dividends increased by some 10%.
Avanti Communications, the AIM listed company supplying 
satellite broadband services to telecoms companies across 
Europe, Africa and the Middle East, had an excellent close to 
2013. For the six months to 31 December 2013, Avanti’s revenues 
nearly doubled and it signed a number of new contracts. 
However, its share price slipped a little over the year, resulting 
in a negative return of 1.0%.
Quintain Estates, the UK listed property company, returned 
62.0% over the year, as it completed its corporate re-positioning 
with the sale of its interest in Greenwich Peninsula and the 
advancement of development at Wembley Park. We have taken 
advantage of the improving market for Quintain stock to lighten 
our holding over the year. 16  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
The Unquoted pool has grown substantially over the year, 
increasing from £384.5m at the start of the year to £568.3m  
at the end, after £129.6m of net investment. Including £22.4m  
of income, the Unquoted pool achieved a return over the year  
of 17.7%, building on a return of 16.1% last year.
The Unquoted pool had an active year, making two significant 
new investments, five follow-on investments and two  
material disposals.
In August 2013, we acquired a controlling stake in Choice Care 
Group for £49.5m. Based in the south of England, Choice Care 
owns and operates a portfolio of 49 residential learning 
disability homes, as well as providing supported living services 
in the same areas. The estate is well invested and represents 
a solid platform for future developments. Our strategy is to 
develop new homes as well as extend Choice Care’s supported 
living business, building incremental value. Since the buy-out, 
we have invested an additional £0.7m to support the 
development of two additional homes.
In November 2013, we acquired 100% of Park Holidays for an 
equity commitment of £88.1m. Based in the south of England, 
Park Holidays owns and operates a portfolio of 23 caravan 
parks. Our strategy is to continue to grow the parks’ profits 
through selective capital expenditure as well as operational 
improvement. In addition, we will look to support Park Holidays’ 
management team in making targeted acquisitions.
Belgium-based Cobehold, our largest investment, had a solid year. 
It is an investment company with holdings in companies with 
long term growth prospects throughout Europe. Its portfolio 
of unquoted investments weathered the European downturn 
admirably, maintaining capital values and increasing the 
dividend paid to shareholders. During the year, we participated 
in Cobehold’s €400m first fundraising since its buy-out in 2004, 
committing €19.8m, of which €9.9m (£8.4m) has been paid to 
date, enabling the business to develop further across Europe.
The Unquoted pool contains both 
significant minority and majority 
holdings in private companies. Our focus 
is on established businesses, led by 
sound management teams, where our 
target investment size of £20m to £50m 
provides a meaningful presence and 
growth capital supporting double-digit 
operating margins.

Strategic report
Satellite Information Services, the UK media group, took the 
decision to exit its outside broadcasting business following  
the announcement of the loss of its BBC contract to other media 
providers. As a result, we have marked down the value of our 
holding in this company.
Buckingham Gate is a property investment company, which 
owns an office building in central London, partly used as  
our head office and partly let out to third parties. Due to the 
continuing development work in Victoria, external advisers  
have held the value of this property to last year’s level.
Over the year, we also increased our investment in Brookshire 
Capital, a property investment company in which we have an 
80% interest, as it continued to invest in light industrial units 
located in the south of England. The portfolio of 11 properties 
has benefited from valuations rising in the sector over the year 
and now generates a geared yield at property level of 14.5%.
Easybox, our Italian self-storage business, has had a 
disappointing year, with challenges to the market coupled with 
significant management change. Consequently, we have written 
down the value of our investment in this company by some 46%.
Following earlier loan repayments of £1.6m, on 31 March 2014 
we sold our holding in Amber Chemicals, the global speciality 
silicones business, to ICM Corporation of the US for £22.9m  
(net of costs), an uplift of over 60% on its carrying value. 
We invested in Amber Chemicals over 50 years ago and have 
benefited from its ability to grow and sell chemicals businesses 
over the years and latterly the development of its market leading 
silicones business.
Oval, a leading provider of insurance broking and financial 
services in the UK, maintained its recent track record of 
increasing earnings and, following a re-financing of its senior 
debt facilities in June 2013, re-commenced interest payments to 
Caledonia. On 1 April 2014, we sold our 23.2% holding to Arthur 
J Gallagher of the US for £70.0m, as part of its acquisition of the 
entire Oval group. We revalued Oval to the sale value at the year 
end, which was a 65% increase on the previous carrying value.
The Sloane Club, a premium residential club situated in central 
London, had a good year, with improved occupancy leading to 
increased revenue and earnings. As a result of this improvement 
and a review of its five year business plan, consulting valuers 
marked-up the value of the property.
TGE Marine, the Germany-based designer and supplier of cargo 
handling systems for liquid gas carrying ships and offshore 
units, improved its revenue and earnings. Over the year, we 
acquired additional ordinary shares in TGE Marine for €10.6m 
(£8.9m), increasing our stake from 49.9% to 67.9%.
We saw particularly strong revenue and earnings growth at 
Sterling Industries and Latshaw Group this year, resulting in 
an increase in our valuations of both these businesses. Sterling 
Industries is a UK-based international engineering business, 
specialising in the global supply of combustion and heat transfer 
technology and services, and Latshaw Group comprises five 
US engineering businesses in sectors including plastic injection 
moulding, custom wire and cable products and gauging tools. 
Both these companies paid significant dividends during the year.
Bowers & Wilkins, a premium audio manufacturer headquartered 
in the UK, had a good year and paid a welcome dividend. 18  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
The Funds pool had a good year, with a total return of 11.8%. 
The principal component of the valuation movement was a 53% 
increase in the value of the Capital Today China fund, principally 
due to the continued success of JD.com (formerly Jingdong),  
the Chinese online retailer. The Funds pool started the year at 
£166.8m and ended at £204.4m, after net investment of £17.7m.
The Funds pool contains investments in private and public 
equity funds in the UK, Europe, US and Asia. Investment through 
funds enables us to broaden our geographic and sector spread, 
by taking advantage of managers’ specialist knowledge and 
ensures exposure to areas of the world where we are less willing 
to invest directly.
The nature of the longer term investment process within the 
Funds pool requires the continuous origination and investment 
in new funds, to ensure both effective vintage management and 
a balance between maturing funds and those at the initial stages, 
where returns are naturally phased to later years.
During the year, we committed to three new limited partnership 
funds: $50m (£30.0m) to FLAG Private Equity V, managed by 
FLAG Capital, £10m to the ISIS Growth I fund, managed by ISIS 
Equity Partners, and $10m (£6.0m) to AVM Ranger, managed  
by Arlington Value Capital. A total of £14.0m was drawn down  
by these funds in the year.
FLAG Private Equity V is a private equity fund of funds, investing 
in buy-out managers operating in the US lower-mid market.  
FLAG Capital has a strong track record and has achieved top 
quartile performance with its previous funds.
ISIS is one of the most active and successful lower mid-market 
private equity houses in the UK and has supported over 100 
entrepreneurial businesses since its inception in 1995. The ISIS 
Growth I fund continues this tradition.
AVM Ranger is a US public equity fund, with a value oriented, 
sector and size agnostic style. Arlington Value Capital has been 
active since 2008, with excellent returns to investors.
We also invested £10.0m in the Polar Capital Global Financials 
Trust, a UK investment trust managed by Polar Capital. This is  
an actively managed trust, designed to take advantage of growth 
opportunities and potential for significant yield recovery in the 
global financials sector.
The Funds pool comprises investments 
in private and public equity collective 
investment vehicles, structured through 
companies, limited partnerships and 
open-ended funds.
Our fund investments provide broad 
exposure to areas of the world where it  
is more difficult for us to invest directly.

The Capital Today China Growth Fund is managed by Capital 
Today and provides growth capital to medium-sized Chinese

Perlus Microcap is a long only equity fund investing in small 
public companies in North America, managed by UK-based

Value since its August 2008 inception, with low volatility.  
Our investment in this fund returned 9.3% over the year.
Nova Springboard is a fund managed by Nova Capital

managed by Bangkok-based NTAsset Management, investing 
in Asian (ex Japan) companies. The fund specialises in 
‘undiscovered small cap companies’ and aims to generate 
absolute returns by investing for the long term in companies

The Income & Growth pool comprises a geographical and sector 
balanced portfolio of currently 40 investments in mainly global 
blue chip companies with strong balance sheets, above average 
returns and demonstrable histories of creating shareholder 
value. All investments are carefully researched, visited locally 
and have strong organic growth potential in tandem with a high 
dividend yield.
Over the year, the Income & Growth pool invested £103.7m, 
of which £20.0m was new funding, and realised £69.2m, as we 
rebalanced the portfolio as noted below. Net dividend income 
during the year was £7.0m, representing a gross yield of 4.3% 
on the average invested capital. Overall, the value of the pool 
grew over the year from £162.0m to £189.6m, representing  
13% of Caledonia’s net assets.
The Income & Growth pool was created in March 2011, with 
£156.0m of investment to date, and, over the three years of its

Strategic report
Over the year, we rebalanced the pool investments away from 
the UK and Asia and towards Europe and, to a more limited 
extent, North America, with the purchase of General Electric. 
Whilst the portfolio is a collection of research driven 
investments, focusing on the sustainable organic growth  
and dividend potential of each company, over the longer term, 
regional allocations are important. From that perspective,  
Asian and emerging markets are now exhibiting relatively good 
value and the Australian economy is showing signs of a recovery. 
Australia has above average dividend yields, particularly in the 
sustainable type of companies that suit the pool. Reassessing  
the potential and valuations of investments in Australia, Asia 
and Brazil is important to maintaining dividend yields and 
keeping good value in the pool.

After two strong years of capital returns, the valuations of 
higher yielding stocks did not continue their rise. This subdued 
performance resulted in a return to the pool over the year of  
just 0.1%. In the first half of the year, the Federal Reserve  
Bank introduced tapering to wind down quantitative easing, 
which had an adverse effect on higher yielding stocks globally. 
However, this effect diminished in the second half of the year,  
as economic growth picked up and the pool returns improved, 
gaining 4.7% since October.
Solid performance came from developed markets, with US,  
UK and European equities all contributing to returns. Europe  
in particular came back strongly and the pool added a number  
of European holdings, including Daimler, the German maker of 
Mercedes cars and trucks, SES, the Luxembourg-based global 
satellite company, RTL Group, the German television group, and 
Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, which have all gained 
in value. Asian and emerging market investments had a more 
difficult year, as Chinese growth slowed and Brazil experienced 
higher inflation. However, there were still some good returns 
from Asia, with Giant Manufacturing in Taiwan, the world’s 
largest manufacturer of bicycles, providing the best gains.

Total return
The company seeks to generate total return from investment 
income, net of expenses, and capital growth. For the year ended 
31 March 2014, the total return was £184.2m (2013 – £207.6m), 
of which £29.8m (2013 – £29.8m) derived from income and 
£154.4m (2013 – £177.8m) from capital.
Revenue performance
Investment income in the year of £41.7m was marginally higher 
than last year’s £41.4m. The Income & Growth pool contributed 
£2.0m more than in 2013, reflecting the increased cash 
allocation to this pool, and the Unquoted pool benefited from 
substantial dividends from the Latshaw Group, The Sloane Club 
and Sterling Industries. These increases were substantially 
offset by a reduction in income from Close Brothers and other 
Quoted pool investments, as we reduced overweight holdings.
The investment income represented a net yield on the monthly 
average portfolio of 3.2%, compared with 3.3% last year.
Capital performance
Net gains on investments totalled £151.4m (2013 – £178.1m, 
including derivatives). The principal gains were £35.3m from 
Oval, £21.2m from Close Brothers, £18.0m from Quintain Estates 
and £15.5m from the Capital Today China fund. These gains 
more than offset investment losses, the most significant of which 
was £7.9m from Satellite Information Services.
Listed investments contributed £72.1m to the valuation gains, 
and unlisted investments contributed £79.3m. Unlisted 
investments increased in value at a greater rate than listed 
investments over the year. This was evidenced principally  
by transactions in the year or soon after. In general, we would 
normally expect to see the valuation changes of unlisted 
companies lagging those of our listed portfolio, reflecting  
our prudent valuation principles.
The company has early-adopted the  
IASB Investment Entities amendments, 
consolidating the company and its 
service subsidiaries, as we believe that 
this will make the annual report more 
understandable to the reader.

Dividend
We recognise that a reliable source of growing dividends is an 
important part of shareholder total return and have extended 
to 47 years our record of growing annual dividends.
We paid an interim dividend of 13.4p per share on 9 January 
2014 and have proposed a final dividend of 35.7p per share. 
The total dividend for the year of 49.1p is an increase of 4.0% 
on last year.
Including the proposed final dividend, the dividends to be  
paid out of revenue earnings for the year ended 31 March 2014 
totalled £27.1m, which was covered by that year’s revenue 
earnings of £29.8m.
If approved, the final dividend will be payable on 7 August 2014 
to holders of shares on the register on 11 July 2014.  
The ex-dividend date will be 9 July 2014.
Investment entities accounting
In October 2013, the IASB issued the Investment Entities 
amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27, for accounting periods 
beginning 1 January 2014. The EU adopted these IFRS 
amendments in November 2013. The company has early-adopted 
these amendments for its 31 March 2014 year end.
For a number of years, Caledonia’s financial presentation had 
focused on the supplemental results of the company, which were 
considered to be the most appropriate measure of performance, 
as they enabled majority-owned investments to be measured at 
fair value. The company results were thus directly comparable 
with the results of other investment trusts, which typically do 
not hold majority stakes.
Applying the Investment Entities amendments enables 
Caledonia to present group accounts broadly consistent with 
the supplemental company results. That is, under Investment 
Entities, all investments (except service subsidiaries) are 
measured at fair value. As it would no longer be beneficial  
to include the additional company information, Investment 
Entities has enabled us to simplify the financial statements, 
making them more understandable.
The principal differences between Investment Entities 
accounting and the company results is the grossing up of certain 
investments for £30.7m of debt lent by Caledonia Treasury, 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caledonia. Caledonia Treasury’s 
finance is principally from a Royal Bank of Scotland term loan.
In addition, the Investment Entities consolidation includes 
accounting for the pension schemes funded by Caledonia  
Group Services and the head office property in Buckingham 
Gate, London.
The comparatives quoted in the strategic review reflect  
the restated Investment Entities accounting comparatives, 
which may differ from information published previously.

The company maintains a prudent valuation approach to 
investments. Internal valuations of investments are conducted 
in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture 
Capital Valuation Guidelines. Adjustments are normally made 
to earnings benchmark multiples – generally of around 30% – 
to account for points of difference between the comparators and 
the company being valued, including relative liquidity and scale. 
Most unlisted property and fund investments are based on 
external valuations.
The following chart summarises the source of valuations  
across the portfolio:

Expenses
Caledonia allocates all expenses, other than transaction costs,  
to revenue. Our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.03% 
(2013 – 1.13%), compared with the Investment Trust Global 
sector average of 0.85% (2013 – 1.02%). We calculate our 
ongoing charges ratio on an industry standard basis, comprising 
published management expenses over the monthly average NAV.
Overall, the company’s revenue column management expenses 
were slightly higher than last year at £13.6m (2013 – £13.3m). 24  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Cash flows, liquidity and facilities
During the year, we moved from opening net cash of £73.9m 
to net debt of £7.1m, principally due to net portfolio investment 
settlements of £71.4m. However, we moved into a net cash 
position again of £62.9m on 1 April 2014, with the receipt 
of £67.2m from the sale of Oval.

During the year, the company increased its committed facilities 
from £75m to £125m, to increase its flexibility to take advantage 
of opportunities as they arise.
Treasury management
The Treasury department provides a central service to group 
companies and conducts its operations in accordance with 
clearly defined guidelines and policies, which have been 
reviewed and approved by the board. Treasury transactions  
are only undertaken as a consequence of underlying commercial 
transactions or exposures and do not seek to take active  
risk positions. It is Treasury’s role to ensure that the group  
has sufficient available funds to meet its needs in the  
foreseeable future.

Strategic report
Effective risk management is a key 
component of the company’s business 
model and assists in ensuring that the 
different parts of the group operate 
within strategic risk parameters.  
The board has overall responsibility  
for setting and monitoring the  
company’s risk appetite.
Caledonia risk governance and structure
Risk management and its governance is the responsibility of  
the board, with the executive given the task of ensuring an 
effective and transparent process to ensure risks are identified, 
documented, assessed and, where appropriate, mitigated.  
The board sets the risk appetite within the business model and 
this is communicated through the executive to all those with 
managerial responsibilities. Risks emanate from all parts of the 
business and are considered by all executives as part of their 
work, from origination of investments to ongoing monitoring 
and portfolio management. 
The Audit Committee assesses and approves the risk 
management processes and structure and specifically reviews 
the controls assurance programme. This programme identifies 
key mitigating controls, tests their operation and reports on 
compliance and effective operation. This, together with reports 
arising from the external audit, provides input to the board as 
a whole on the status of the risk management process.

Risk management reporting
Caledonia manages and reports risk through two primary  
areas of focus: an overall business risk report and a portfolio 
investment risk report.
The business risk report considers the wider business 
environment of the group, including business continuity 
planning, IT and cyber security risks, regulatory risks and 
financial control risks.
Caledonia manages business risk through a number of 
integrated processes and procedures operating throughout  
the year to provide risk visibility to both the executive team  
and the wider board.
Risk management 26  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Principal risks Mitigation Key developments
Strategic
Risks in relation to the appropriateness of the business model  
to deliver long term growth in capital and income and the 
effective communication and delivery of the business model.
Strategic risks include the appropriate allocation of capital  
in relation to geographic, sector and currency exposures.
 
The company’s business model and strategy are reviewed 
periodically, against market conditions and target returns.
The performance of the company and its key risks are 
monitored regularly by management and the board.
 
• Caledonia has established and communicated a clear 
investment strategy, focusing on longer term value 
investing. A clear strategic capital allocation to a range  
of investment types, risk profiles and returns has been 
established and communicated, enabling the board  
and shareholders to evaluate targeted performance. 
Remuneration and rewards are aligned to strategic 
targeted performance.
Investment
Risks in respect of specific investment and realisation decisions.
Investment risks include the appropriate research and due 
diligence of new investments and the timely execution of both 
new investments and realisations for optimal shareholder value.
 
Pool managers have well-developed networks through 
which they attract proprietary deal flow.
Investment opportunities are subject to rigorous and 
disciplined investment appraisals and multi-stage 
approval processes. Target entry and exit events and 
prices are monitored and updated regularly, in relation  
to market conditions and strategic aims.
 
• An increased breadth of investment management skills 
and expertise over the last two years has facilitated 
increased deal flow and quality of research across  
the portfolio.
Market
Risk of losses in value of investments arising from movements  
in market prices, particularly in highly volatile markets.
Caledonia invests primarily in listed equities, private companies 
and equity funds. Its principal market risks are therefore equity 
price volatility, foreign exchange rate movements and interest 
rate volatility. An explanation of these risks, along with 
sensitivities, is included in note 23 to these accounts.
 
Market risks and sensitivities are reviewed on a weekly 
basis and actions taken to balance appropriately risk  
and return.
A regular review of market and investment volatility and 
value at risk is conducted by the board and the portfolio is 
realigned with strategic aims where appropriate. Reviews 
also consider investment concentration, currency and 
liquidity exposures.
 
• Risk weighted performance reporting and portfolio risk 
analysis has been developed for management and the 
board, giving a regular insight into the characteristics  
and performance of Caledonia’s portfolio.
Liquidity
Risk that liabilities cannot be met or new investments made due 
to a lack of liquidity. Such risk can arise from not being able to 
sell an investment due to lack of a market or from not holding 
cash or being able to raise debt.
 
Detailed cash forecasting for six months ahead is updated 
and reviewed weekly, including the expected drawdown of 
capital commitments.
Listed portfolio liquidity is reviewed regularly.  
Loan facilities are maintained to provide appropriate 
liquidity headroom.
 
• Average liquidity levels of our quoted portfolio have 
increased over the last year.
• The successful exit of two recent significant unquoted 
investments generated £93m net proceeds.
• Revolving borrowing facilities were renegotiated for a 
further five years, and committed facilities increased to 
£175m from the previous level of £125m.
Operational
Risks arising from inadequate or failed processes, people and 
systems or from external factors. 
Operational risks include recruiting, developing and retaining 
staff, appropriate systems and procedures, business disruption 
and an IT framework that provides flexible and resilient support.
 
Systems and control procedures are developed and 
reviewed regularly. They are tested, as part of the  
annual programme of controls assurance, to ensure 
effective operation.
Appropriate remuneration and other policies are in place 
to encourage the retention of key staff. Business continuity 
plans are maintained, using an offsite facility.
 
• An IT risk dashboard has been developed to document 
significant IT risks facing Caledonia.
• A cyber security review was completed during the year 
looking at how equipment, information and services are 
protected from unintended or unauthorised access, change  
or destruction.
Regulatory and legal
Risk arising from exposure to litigation or fraud and adherence 
to the tax and regulatory environment, as Caledonia operates 
across a number of jurisdictions and in an industry that has  
been subject to increasing regulatory oversight.
 
Caledonia has internal resource which considers all 
regulatory and tax matters as they arise. Use is made of 
advisers and the Association of Investment Companies, of 
which Caledonia is a member and on whose self-managed 
investment company committee it is represented. Regular 
training is undertaken.
 
• Caledonia is satisfied that it is not an Alternative 
Investment Fund (‘AIF’), as defined in the EU’s Alternative 
Investment Fund Managers Directive, and therefore  
is not required to be authorised by the Financial Conduct 
Authority to perform the regulated activity of managing 
an AIF under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, 
as amended.

Risks are identified and assessed through a risk dashboard, 
capturing the most significant business risks facing Caledonia 
and documenting the actions required to achieve an acceptable 
level of risk. 
The business risk dashboard is reported to the board half yearly.
The portfolio investment risk report specifically focuses on  
the more technical areas of investment portfolio risk in relation 
to Caledonia’s investment strategy. This includes such areas  
as investment volatility, value at risk, diversification, liquidity 
and concentration risks.

Marketplace
As an investment company, we are committed to a long term 
investment strategy and to maintaining effective relationships 
with those companies in which we invest. We often hold a board 
seat in our significant investments and use this to maintain  
a close relationship with managements of those companies. 
Additionally, we hold frequent meetings with managements  
and review internal documents, such as management accounts 
and reports.
We also make considered use of our voting rights. As a 
consequence of our involved investment style, we would expect 
to vote in line with management recommendations, but are 
prepared to abstain or vote against recommendations where  
we consider they are not in the interests of our shareholders.
We continue to meet with our shareholders and listen to any 
concerns they may have.
Workplace
Caledonia has in place a set of polices intended to protect 
employees from unlawful discrimination, offer them a working 
environment where they have a right to be treated fairly,  
with consideration and respect, and support high standards  
of conduct and performance. These policies assist in ensuring  
that the company meets applicable health and safety standards 
and treats disabled employees in accordance with its statutory 
obligations. These policies are communicated to employees  
by way of a staff handbook provided at the time of joining,  
with periodic updates thereafter.
In addition to a grievance procedure, which allows employees  
to raise concerns either formally or informally, there are formal 
whistleblowing arrangements in place, which enable members  
of staff to raise any issue of concern regarding possible 
impropriety in the conduct of the company’s business, 
confidentially and independently of line management.
A formal performance appraisal process, through which 
employees may be set objectives on an annual basis and their 
achievement against those objectives assessed at the end of  
the year, is intended to ensure that employees have a clear view 
of their performance and the ability to develop their potential 
within the company through additional training where 
necessary. Together with team meetings and company-wide 
briefings, this provides staff with the opportunity to be closely 
involved in the success of the business.
We are committed to building our 
business for the long term. To this  
end, we consider the impact of our 
business on the marketplace,  
workplace and environment.

Caledonia’s environmental impact is limited. However, any 
measures taken to reduce this impact demonstrate the 
company’s commitment to improve the environment and can 
have direct benefits through reductions in costs for energy  
and consumables. A number of measures have been and will  
be taken in this area:
• encouragement of the use of electronic communications  
to save paper, printing consumables and energy
• usage of video-conferencing and telephone conference calls 
rather than travelling to meetings
• recycling of office waste, used paper and other consumables. 30  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc

The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is collectively responsible for the success 
of the company and for supervising its affairs. It sets the 
company’s strategy, ensures that the necessary financial and 
human resources are in place to enable the company to meet  
its objectives and reviews management performance. It also  
sets the company’s values and standards and ensures that  
its obligations to its shareholders and others are understood  
and met. It aims to provide leadership of the company within  
a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables  
risk to be assessed and appropriately managed.
To assist its operation, the board has adopted a Schedule of 
Authorities which sets out those matters which it specifically 
reserves for its own decision and those which are delegated  
to board committees and to executive management. Matters 
reserved for the board’s own decision include the following:
• the appointment and removal of directors of the company,  
as prescribed by the company’s articles of association,  
and of certain senior executive positions
• the terms of reference of board committees and the 
membership thereof
• the company’s strategy
• annual budgets
• the company’s systems of risk management and  
internal control
• treasury policies, banking counterparties and counterparty 
exposure limits
• policy on directors’ remuneration and terms of appointment 
• significant capital transactions
• charitable donations and political donations.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separated 
and clearly defined in the Schedule of Authorities. The Chairman 
is primarily responsible for the leadership of the board to ensure 
that it carries out its role effectively and for succession planning. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for the implementation of  
the board’s strategy and policies and the management of the 
company’s activities, other than those matters specifically 
reserved to the board. The Schedule of Authorities is reviewed 
annually by the board.
All directors receive detailed papers in advance of board 
meetings to enable them to discharge their duties and also  
have unlimited access to senior management should further 
information be required. Presentations by pool managers and 
other senior executives are regularly given to the board, as well 
as occasionally by senior executives of investee companies.

companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders.
On appointment, new directors are offered induction and 
training considered appropriate by the board, and subsequently 
as necessary, and the annual performance evaluation of the 
board encompasses the identification of any individual training 
needs of board members so that, if necessary, these can be 
reviewed by the Chairman with the directors concerned.  
The directors receive briefings at board meetings on regulatory 
and other issues relevant to the company and its business sector 
and, in addition, may attend external courses to assist in their 
professional development.
Board composition
The biographies of the directors appear on pages 30 and 31.
The board currently comprises ten directors. Excluding the 
Chairman, three of the directors are executive and six are 
non-executive. The board considers all of the non-executive 
directors to be independent, other than The Hon C W Cayzer, 
who was an executive director until 3 December 2012. In 
assessing Mr Goblet d’Alviella’s independence, the board took 
account of the fact that he has served as a non-executive director 
for nine years and also of his position as Executive Chairman  
of Sofina SA, whose wholly-owned subsidiary, Rebelco SA,  
has a 5.1% shareholding in Caledonia. Mr Goblet d’Alviella’s 
position at Sofina has not given rise to any conflicts of interest 
and his circumstances very much accord with the importance 
that Caledonia attaches to its own executives having board 
positions at, or close contact with, investee companies. Mr Allen-
Jones has also served as a non-executive director for more than 
nine years. The board has specifically considered both his and 
Mr Goblet d’Alviella’s length of tenure in the context of The UK 
Corporate Governance Code and does not believe that their 
independent status is compromised simply by length of service. 
Rather, the experience, character and conduct of each director 
are the board’s determinants of their independence.
The company has announced that Harold Boël will be joining  
the board from 25 June 2014. Mr Boël is Chief Executive Officer 
of Sofina SA and the board has determined that he will be an 
independent director, based on the same consideration of his 
role at Sofina as for Mr Goblet d’Alviella.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain specific areas of responsibility 
to the following standing committees: the Nomination 
Committee, the Audit Committee, the Governance Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. Further details of the work  
of each of these committees and their membership during the 
year are set out on pages 35, 36, 38 and 40 respectively.
The terms of reference of each committee are reviewed annually 
and are available on the company’s website. 34  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
There are safeguards in the company’s articles which apply when 
the directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential 
conflict of interest. First, only independent directors, being those 
who have no interest in the matter being considered, are able  
to take the relevant decision and, second, in taking the decision, 
the directors must act in a way which they consider, in good 
faith, will be most likely to promote the success of the company. 
The directors are able to impose time limits or conditions when 
giving authorisations if they think this is appropriate.
The board has adopted procedures to address the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to directors’ conflicts  
of interest. Each new director on appointment is required to 
declare any potential conflict situations, which may relate to him 
or her, or his or her connected persons. These are reviewed by 
the board and, if necessary, also by the Governance Committee, 
which then considers whether these situations should be 
authorised and, if so, whether any conditions to such authority 
should be attached.
Each board meeting includes a standing agenda item on conflicts 
of interest to ensure that all directors disclose any new potential 
conflict situations. These are then reviewed, again if necessary 
also by the Governance Committee, and authorised by the board 
as appropriate. A register of directors’ conflicts of interest is 
maintained by the Company Secretary and is reviewed annually 
by the Governance Committee.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with investors in order  
to achieve a mutual understanding of objectives. The Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director regularly hold meetings  
with institutional investors, private client stockbrokers and 
fund managers. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
is also available to attend some of these meetings. Any views  
put forward by shareholders are reported back to the board, 
which periodically also receives presentations from the brokers 
on shareholder feedback and the general market perception of 
the company. In addition, the annual general meeting provides  
a forum for shareholders to meet the directors, both formally 
and informally.
The Chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available 
to answer questions at the annual general meeting.

Board performance evaluation
The board conducts an annual evaluation of its performance  
and that of its committees and, in accordance with best practice, 
involves an independent third party to assist in this process 
every three years. For the year ended 31 March 2014, Law 
Debenture Governance Services (‘Law Debenture’) acted as  
the external facilitator. Law Debenture invited each director  
and the Company Secretary to complete an online questionnaire 
regarding the operation and effectiveness of the board, 
conducted one to one interviews with each of them and observed 
a board meeting. Law Debenture then discussed its findings  
at a separate session of the board.
The evaluation of the performance of the Chairman was led  
by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and involved 
individual discussions with other members of the board,  
the results of which were then considered by the non-executive 
directors without the Chairman present. The Chairman 
considered the performance of the non-executive directors and 
that of the executive directors was reviewed by the Chairman 
and the non-executive directors, with the Chief Executive also 
present for the discussion on the other executive directors.
Law Debenture’s review of the effectiveness of Caledonia’s board 
concluded that shareholders can be confident that the board is 
well led and administered and that governance requirements 
are well covered. A number of minor process improvements 
were put forward for the board’s consideration, the principal 
being that a clearer specification of the skills and experience 
required amongst board members might assist in achieving the 
optimum mix around the board table.
Law Debenture has no other connection with the company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to  
avoid a situation where he has, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest which conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the 
company’s interests. The Companies Act 2006 however allows 
directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts where the articles of association contain a provision  
to this effect. The Companies Act 2006 also allows the articles  
to contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts 
of interest to avoid a breach of duty.

The Nomination Committee is responsible for the regular  
review of the structure, size and composition (including the 
skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) of the board and  
for giving consideration to succession planning for directors 
and, if requested by the board, for other senior executives. It is 
responsible for identifying, using external search consultants 
where necessary, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when 
they arise, for making recommendations to the board in relation 
thereto and for keeping under review the leadership needs of  
the company, both executive and non-executive.
The Nomination Committee also reviews the time required  
of the non-executive directors and ensures that they receive 
formal letters of appointment setting out clearly what is 
expected of them in terms of time commitment, committee 
service and involvement outside board meetings.
Diversity
The board’s policy on diversity is, as it has been in the past,  
to seek to appoint the best qualified person to a particular role 
regardless of gender or other diversity criteria and therefore it 
has not adopted any measurable objectives in relation thereto.
Work of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee met once during the year to review 
the size and composition of the board following the 2013 annual 
board performance evaluation and to consider the contributions 
of the non-executive directors seeking election or re-election  
at the 2013 annual general meeting, prior to giving 
recommendations for their elections or re-elections.

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the  
integrity of the financial statements of the company and any 
announcements relating thereto and for reviewing any 
significant financial reporting judgements contained therein.  
In addition, it oversees the relationship with the external auditor, 
KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’). It also reviews the company’s systems of 
internal control and risk management procedures and considers 
annually whether an internal audit function is required.
The Audit Committee, comprised exclusively of independent 
non-executives directors, met three times in the year ended 
31 March 2014, in May and November 2013 and in March 2014. 
Subsequent to the year end, it met in May 2014 to consider the 
significant issues in relation to the 2014 annual report.
The external auditor, KPMG, the Finance Director, the Company 
Secretary and various members of the finance team attend the 
meetings of the Audit Committee. Other board members and/or 
senior executives may also attend meetings at the invitation of 
the Chairman. At the end of each meeting, the Audit Committee 
has a separate discussion with the external auditor without 
executive management present.
Work of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee undertook the following activities in the 
discharge of its responsibilities.
Financial statements
The main focus of the meetings in May and November 2013 was 
the 2013 annual report and financial statements and the 2013 
half-year results respectively, including evaluation of the going 
concern statements therein.
The March 2014 meeting considered principally the audit 
planning for the 2014 annual report, including in particular  
the new requirements of the revised UK Corporate Governance 
Code, other new disclose requirements and investment 
entities accounting. 
In its May 2014 meeting, the Audit Committee reviewed the form 
and content of the 2014 annual report and financial statements. 
In conducting its review, the Audit Committee considered 
reports prepared by management and the external auditor. 
These reports provided an analytical review of the financial 
statements, comparing the current to prior year financial 
position and results, and detailed the judgements and sources 
of estimation uncertainty involved in applying the accounting 
policies to the financial statements. The Audit Committee also 
considered the going concern statement. The Audit Committee 
recommended the 2014 annual report to the board.
The significant issues the Audit Committee considered in relation 
to the 2014 financial statements were the valuation of unlisted 
and listed investments. In relation to these financial statements, 
the Audit Committee also considered material balance sheet 
provisions, the going concern statement (and related liquidity 
issues), compliance with the annual report ‘fair, balanced  
and understandable’ provisions of the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the proposed early adoption of the IASB 
Investment Entities amendments.
Unlisted valuations
The Audit Committee recognises that unlisted investments  
are a significant component of the financial statements and  
that their valuation is subject to considerable judgement and 
uncertainty. The Chairman of the Audit Committee attended 
an internal valuation review meeting (along with the external 
Audit Committee report Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  37
Directors’ report
Management submitted that Investment Entities would enable 
Caledonia to present group accounts broadly consistent with  
the existing supplemental company results. That is, under 
Investment Entities, all investments (except service subsidiaries) 
would be measured at fair value. This would significantly 
simplify the financial statements, making them more 
understandable.
The Audit Committee discussed management’s submission and 
sought the views of the company’s auditor, who agreed that early 
adoption of Investment Entities would be beneficial to the clarity 
of the company’s financial reporting. The Audit Committee 
decided that it would recommend early adoption of Investment 
Entities to the board.
Internal control
In the May and November meetings, a report on the internal 
control reviews performed during the previous six months was 
presented, together with an update on the controls assurance 
programme given at the March 2014 meeting. The Audit 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment and the structure in place to resolve identified 
weaknesses. The control reviews included treasury segregation, 
computer security and anti-bribery policy compliance. No 
significant areas of weakness were identified. The Audit 
Committee agreed the control review work plan for 2015.
Internal audit
As the company does not have an internal audit function, the 
Audit Committee considers annually whether there is a need  
for one. The company is an investment trust and manages  
its non-consolidated subsidiaries as other private company 
investments, expecting them to operate their own risk 
management processes. The company closely monitors the 
control environment of its private company investments. 
Additionally, for majority-owned investments, the company’s 
auditor is engaged to extend the annual audit to include  
the control environment. The Audit Committee recommended  
to the board that an internal audit function was not required. 
Auditor
The Audit Committee last conducted an audit tender process  
in mid-2011. The main outcomes of the process were the 
replacement of Deloitte (who had been the company’s auditor 
since 2006) with KPMG Audit Plc and a plan for the development 
of the external audit approach. The principal planned changes 
were to increase the depth of the audit by reducing the 
materiality level and to provide risk assurance reports to 
complement the internal reviews. At its request and for internal 
reasons, KPMG Audit Plc resigned as the company’s auditor  
with effect from the conclusion of the annual general meeting  
on 24 July 2013 and was replaced by its immediate parent entity, 
KPMG LLP.
auditor) and reported to the Audit Committee on the quality 
of the review, adherence to the company’s valuation policy  
and consistency of valuation methodologies over time. 
In the case of one unlisted investment (representing 4.9% of 
net assets), the valuation at 31 March 2014 was based on the 
expected proceeds from a pending sale, a change in methodology 
from previous years. The Audit Committee heard that the sale 
was completed on 1 April 2014 and, therefore, concurred that a 
year end valuation based on pending proceeds was appropriate.
Listed valuations
Listed investments are a significant component of the financial 
statements. The internal valuation review meeting referred to 
above also considered the listed securities, to ensure that the 
exchange bid prices used in the valuation were from an actively 
traded market. Although a number of investments traded in 
relatively illiquid markets, there had been at least one trade in 
the previous month. Therefore, the Audit Committee concurred 
that it was appropriate to use the exchange bid price in all cases.
Balance sheet provisions
The company holds a provision of £8.3m against a guarantee 
given for potential liabilities of a subsidiary. The subsidiary’s 
potential liabilities relate to an HMRC claim that losses deducted 
on the derecognition of FTSE index options in 2009 should not be 
allowed. The company and its advisors have presented its case to 
HMRC, who are dealing with the issue as a joint case, along with 
a number of other parties. During the year, there had been no 
significant change to the circumstances of the case. Therefore, 
the Audit Committee agreed that it was appropriate to hold a 
provision equivalent to full cover for the potential loss of the case.
Going concern
The Audit Committee considered the trading needs of the 
company and its financial capacity, including available bank 
credit and liquid funds, to be wholly sufficient to confirm the 
going concern of the business.
Fair, balanced and understandable statement
The Audit Committee reviewed the draft annual report  
and, taken as a whole, considered it to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Audit Committee recommended to the 
board that the statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the annual report and the financial statements, set out on  
page 57, should be signed accordingly.
Investment entities
In October 2013, the IASB issued the Investment Entities 
amendments to IFRS 10 and 12 and IAS 27, for accounting  
periods beginning 1 January 2014. The EU adopted these  
IFRS amendments in November 2013. Management proposed 
that Caledonia should adopt Investment Entities early, for the 
31 March 2014 year end, and the Audit Committee examined 
management’s arguments. Management noted that, for a number 
of years, Caledonia’s financial presentations had focused on the 
supplemental results of the company, which were considered 
to be the most appropriate measure of performance, as they 
enabled investments in subsidiaries to be measured at fair value. 
The company results were thus directly comparable with the 
results of other investment trusts, which typically do not hold 
majority stakes. 38  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Non-audit work
In order to safeguard the auditor’s independence and objectivity, 
the Audit Committee maintains a schedule of specific non-audit 
activities which may not be undertaken by the external auditor, 
within the broad principles that the external auditor should not 
audit its own work, should not make management decisions on 
behalf of the company, should not be put into the role of advocate 
for the company and that no mutuality of interest should be 
created between the company and the external auditor.
Pre-approval of non-audit fees is required for non-audit fees 
exceeding pre-determined thresholds.
Re-appointment of KPMG as auditor
KPMG Audit Plc was appointed auditor in 2011 and was replaced 
by KPMG LLP in 2013. The lead audit partner is required to 
rotate every five years and other key audit partners every seven 
years. No contractual obligations restrict the Audit Committee’s 
choice of external auditor. The Audit Committee concluded that 
KPMG provides an effective audit and the Audit Committee 
recommended to the board the re-appointment of KPMG LLP.
Resolutions to re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditor and to authorise 
the directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration, will be 
proposed at the annual general meeting on 17 July 2014.
Private meetings
During the year, the Chairman of the Audit Committee met 
separately and privately with the Finance Director and KPMG.

Audit effectiveness
Audit quality is reviewed continuously throughout the year  
by both the Finance Director and Audit Committee. The focus  
is centred on the following:
• the quality and seniority of the auditor’s staff
• the appropriateness of the planned audit methodology 
as applied to Caledonia’s business activity
• the level and challenge and quality of reporting to the  
Audit Committee.
The effectiveness of the audit is also monitored throughout the 
year using a number of measures, including but not limited to:
• a review and approval of the scope of the planned audit
• the planned implementation of improvements following 
appropriate post audit reviews
• the monitoring of the independence of the external auditor
• a review of any Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality 
Review Report for KPMG’s audit of the company
• discussion with the firm’s independent senior partner.

for the monitoring and review of the ability of each director to 
act in the interests of shareholders as a whole and to exercise 
independence of judgement free from relationships or 
circumstances which are likely to, or could appear to, affect  
his or her judgement. The Governance Committee also reviews 
conflict or potential conflict situations relating to directors, 
which may require the prior authorisation of the board under the 
Companies Act 2006, and makes recommendations to the board 
as to whether such conflict or potential conflict situations should 
be authorised and, if so, whether any conditions, such as duration 
or scope of the authority, should be attached. The Governance 
Committee reviews annually all authorisations previously 
granted by the board to ensure that they remain appropriate. 
If the Governance Committee believes that a director may be 
subject to a conflict of interest which may prejudice his or her 
ability to exercise independence of judgement, it may make such 
recommendations to the board as it may think fit, including that 
the director abstains from participating in any decision of the 
board or any of its committees on the matter concerned.
Work of the Governance Committee
The Governance Committee met twice during the year and  
the principal matters it considered included: 
• the review and approval of the Corporate governance report 
for the year ended 31 March 2013
• approval of final terms of the sale of certain artefacts  
and memorabilia owned by Caledonia to the Cayzer Family 
Archive, a charitable foundation established to preserve  
an historical archive of the Cayzer family and its heritage  
in shipping, for £0.3m
• the review of potential conflict situations notified by directors 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the making  
of recommendations to the board in relation thereto
• consideration of the influence of the Cayzer Concert Party on 
Caledonia’s board and whether it was in the general interest  
of the non-Cayzer Concert Party shareholders, with the 
conclusion that it was
• the company’s ongoing ability to continue to buy back its own 
shares whilst ensuring that the Cayzer Concert Party holding 
remains below the 49.9% limit required by the waiver of  
Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers approved  
by non-Concert Party shareholders and the considerations for  
the company as share buy-backs bring such holding nearer  
to this limit.

On behalf of the board, I am pleased to introduce Caledonia’s 
Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2014.
New basis of remuneration disclosure  
and shareholder voting
As heralded in last year’s report, new remuneration reporting 
regulations put forward by the Department for Business 
Innovation and Skills became law with effect from 1 October 
2013. This year’s Directors’ remuneration report is therefore 
presented in a new format designed to comply with these 
regulations – the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports)(Amendment) Regulations 2013 
(‘Regulations’) – and is also prepared in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and  
the requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules.
The report now comprises three sections as follows:
• an annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, which summarises and explains the major 
decisions taken and changes made in relation to directors’ 
remuneration during the year
• a forward looking remuneration policy, which describes the 
company’s remuneration framework and how it is aligned 
with its business strategy, summarises the key elements of 
directors’ pay and illustrates levels of total remuneration that 
may be paid to the executive directors in different scenarios
• an annual report on directors’ remuneration, which sets out 
the amounts actually paid to directors in respect of the year 
under review and the value of long term incentive awards that 
vested in that period.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the remuneration policy 
and the annual report on directors’ remuneration for the year 
ended 31 March 2014 separately by simple majority votes at the 
company’s annual general meeting on 17 July 2014, the vote on 
the remuneration policy being binding on the company, whereas 
the vote on the annual report on directors’ remuneration will  
(as was the case with previous directors’ remuneration reports) 
be advisory in nature only. The Regulations require that the 
remuneration policy be approved by shareholders at least every 
three years, although an earlier vote will be required if the 
Remuneration Committee wishes to implement any policy 
changes or if an advisory vote on an annual report on directors’ 
remuneration is not passed. A resolution to approve the annual 
report on directors’ remuneration must be put to shareholders 
every year.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the company’s auditor to 
report to the shareholders on certain parts of the directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether, in its opinion, those 
parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Regulations. The parts of the annual report on 
directors’ remuneration that have been audited are indicated  
in that report. The annual statement by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and the policy on directors’ 
remuneration are not subject to audit.

Directors’ report
Remuneration for the 2014 financial year
Turning to the year under review, as described in the Chairman’s 
and Chief Executive’s report, Caledonia has delivered strong 
performance in the year to 31 March 2014. NAV per share on  
a total return basis (‘NAVTR’) increased by 14.9%, compared 
with an increase of 2.5% in the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’), which 
the Remuneration Committee introduced as a measure of the 
company’s performance for annual bonuses this year in order to 
reward executives only when positive real returns are generated 
for shareholders. On the basis of the company’s relative 
performance against RPI over the year and after assessing the 
performance of the individual directors against the personal 
objectives set for them at the start of the year and, where 
relevant, pool performance and objectives, the Remuneration 
Committee decided that it was appropriate to award the 
maximum potential bonus of 100% of basic salary to each  
of the executive directors.
The year to 31 March 2014 also represented the end of the three 
year performance measurement period for awards granted 
in 2011 under the company’s performance share scheme and 
matching shares under the deferred bonus plan. For the 2011 
matching awards under the deferred bonus plan, the targets 
were that, for 50% of the shares comprised in an award to vest, 
Caledonia’s undiluted net asset value per share (‘NAV’) would 
have to outperform RPI by at least 9% over the measurement 
period, and for the other 50%, Caledonia’s NAV would have to 
outperform the FTSE All-Share index by at least 3% over the 
measurement period. Both targets were met and therefore all  
of the 2011 deferred bonus matching shares have vested.
For the 2011 performance share scheme awards, the 
performance targets were that, for two-thirds of the shares 
comprised in an award, Caledonia’s NAVTR had to outperform 
the FTSE All-Share Total Return index (‘FTSE index’) and,  
for the other third, the FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts 
(all-stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts index’) over the three year 
measurement period, in each case with shares vesting on a 
graduated basis between 0.5% and 3.5% outperformance. Whilst 
Caledonia’s NAVTR has outperformed both of these benchmark 
indices over the past two financial years, underperformance  
in the 2012 financial year prior to the implementation of the 
company’s revised strategy meant that neither performance 
target was met and accordingly the 2011 awards lapsed in their 
entirety. For this year’s performance share scheme awards, the 
Remuneration Committee commenced a phased move towards 
a longer performance period for a significant proportion of the 
shares comprised therein, in order better to align them with the 
company’s long term investment horizon. Half of the shares 
comprised in an award will be measured over three years by 
reference to the Gilts index and half over five years by reference 
to the FTSE index. This balance will be repeated for any awards 
made in the 2015 financial year, but thereafter one-third will  
be measured over three years and two-thirds over five years  
by reference to the aforementioned indices.
In line with good practice, the Remuneration Committee  
has also introduced provisions into Caledonia’s performance 
share scheme and deferred bonus plan, which will give the 
Remuneration Committee the right to cancel or reduce unvested 
awards in the event of a material misstatement of the company’s 
financial results, a miscalculation of a participant’s entitlement, 
misconduct on the part of the participant or an event resulting  
in material loss or reputational damage to the company or a 
member of the group. These are commonly known as ‘malus’ 
provisions and will apply to share based awards granted after 
1 April 2014.
Remuneration for the 2015 financial year
Looking ahead to the 2015 financial year, basic salaries of 
executive directors have been increased with effect from 1 April 
2014 by 2.5%, which was the same as the standard increase 
given to the company’s staff generally and mirrored the rise in 
the cost of living as measured by RPI of 2.5%. The Chairman’s 
and the non-executive directors’ fees were last reviewed in  
April 2011 and these have therefore also been increased by 10%, 
in line with inflation since that date.
As explained in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report,  
the board has recently decided to adopt RPI as the basis of 
measurement of Caledonia’s performance over the medium,  
as well as the shorter, term in place of the FTSE index. In the  
light of this, the Remuneration Committee will be considering 
whether RPI should also be adopted as the benchmark index for 
the company’s share incentive plans, in place of the FTSE index 
and Gilts index currently used. Other than this, no changes in  
the basis of directors’ remuneration are anticipated for the 2015 
financial year.
Shareholder consultation
The remuneration policy that we are now asking shareholders to 
approve embodies the fundamental principles that have guided 
our Remuneration Committee for many years, namely that we 
aim to attract and retain talented individuals needed to manage 
and grow our business successfully and to motivate them with 
packages that are closely linked to the company’s long term 
performance and strategy. We endeavour to ensure that the 
quantum of our pay is competitive, but not excessive, and that we 
reward success when earned, but not failure. Most importantly, 
we seek to align the interests of those who manage our company 
with the shareholders who own it.
We have taken the opportunity to consult with some of our 
larger shareholders and certain institutional shareholder 
representative bodies on this policy and are very grateful for 
their constructive feedback. We hope therefore that both the 
policy and the annual report will receive your support at the 
annual general meeting in July.

Remuneration structure
Executive directors
The table below sets out Caledonia’s policy in relation to each component of executive director remuneration, with further 
explanations in the notes that follow.
Salary (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to 
strategic objectives
To support the recruitment and retention of executive directors of the calibre required to manage and grow 
the company successfully.
Operation Reviewed annually.
The basic salaries of the executive directors on implementation of the policy will be as follows:
W P Wyatt  £506,480 
S A King   £359,380 
J M B Cayzer-Colvin  £303,890
Opportunity and 
recovery or 
withholding 
provisions
Salary increases are normally awarded by reference to any increase in the cost of living, but may take  
into account other factors such as external market positioning, change in the scope of the individual’s 
responsibilities or level of experience, development in the role and levels of pay elsewhere in the company.
Other than in exceptional circumstances or where there is a change in role or responsibilities, year on year 
increases in basic salaries will not exceed inflation by more than 5%.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance 
measurement 
framework

Not applicable.
Benefits (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to 
strategic objectives
To provide a range of benefits alongside basic salary to recruit and retain high calibre executive directors.
Operation Executive directors are provided with family private medical insurance cover, death-in-service insurance, 
permanent health insurance and, in the case of Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin, a cash allowance in lieu of 
a company car. They are also entitled to receive minor benefits that are available to other Caledonia staff.
The executive directors are also covered by the company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy 
and have the benefit of an indemnity under the company’s articles of association.
Legacy arrangements
The policy is essentially forward looking in nature. In view of the 
long term nature of the company’s remuneration structures – 
including obligations under service contracts, pension 
arrangements and incentive schemes – a substantial number  
of pre-existing obligations will remain outstanding at the time 
that the new policy is approved, including obligations that  
are ‘grandfathered’ by virtue of being in force at 27 June 2012.  
It is the company’s policy to honour in full any pre-existing 
obligations that have been entered into prior to the effective 
date of this policy.
Objectives
The key objectives of the Remuneration Committee in setting  
the company’s remuneration policy are as follows:
• remuneration of executive directors should be linked to the 
company’s long term performance and its business strategy
• performance related remuneration should seek to align the 
interests of executive directors with those of the shareholders
• a significant proportion of executive directors’ remuneration 
should be linked to the performance of the company and only 
receivable if demanding performance targets are achieved
• remuneration packages for executive directors should be 
competitive, but not excessive, in terms of market practice in 
order to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the 
quality needed to manage and grow the company successfully.
Implementation of the policy
The remuneration policy set out below embodies the policies  
and practices previously operated by the company, as described 
in the Remuneration Committee’s Directors’ remuneration 
report for the year ended 31 March 2013, included in the 2013 
annual report. If approved by shareholders at the annual general 
meeting to be held on 17 July 2014, this policy will take effect 
from that date and will then apply until a revised remuneration 
policy is approved by shareholders. The company does not 
expect to seek shareholder approval for a revised policy until  
the annual general meeting in 2017.
Under the new statutory regime, a company may only make  
a remuneration payment to a director or a payment for loss of 
office if it is either consistent with the most recently approved 
remuneration policy or, if not, is separately approved by 
shareholders. The Remuneration Committee considers that  
an effective remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible 
to take account of future changes in the company’s business 
environment and in remuneration practice generally. In framing 
its policy, the Remuneration Committee has therefore sought  
to combine a level of breadth and flexibility to enable it to react 
to changed circumstances without the need for a specific 
shareholder approval, whilst at the same time incorporating 
sufficient detail and transparency to enable shareholders  
to understand how it will operate in different scenarios and  
feel comfortable that payments made under it are justified. 
Components of remuneration where the Remuneration 
Committee wishes to retain a level of discretion are identified  
in the relevant sections of the policy.

Directors’ report
Where there is a valid business reason for doing so, the company may pay for the cost of spouses 
accompanying directors on business trips and reimburse directors for hotel accommodation and travel 
expenses (including payment of any tax thereon). Executive directors are also eligible to receive other  
minor benefits and expenses payments (again including payment of any tax thereon).
Opportunity  
and recovery  
or withholding 
provisions
A taxable benefits package that is competitive with the marketplace. 
The value of taxable benefits provided, other than ad hoc items incurred in connection with Caledonia’s 
business that may be deemed taxable benefits such as travel and other expenses, will not in aggregate exceed 
10% of basic salary.
No recovery or withholding provisions.

Not applicable.
Short term incentives (variable pay)
Purpose and link to 
strategic objectives
To reward performance on an annual basis against key financial, operational and individual objectives. 
Operation Discretionary annual bonus scheme and deferred bonus plan under which a proportion of bonus may  
be compulsorily or voluntarily deferred into shares.
Bonus is not pensionable.
Opportunity  
and recovery  
or withholding 
provisions
The maximum potential bonus is 100% of basic salary. Any bonus over 50% of basic salary is compulsorily 
deferred into shares and up to half of any remaining cash bonus may be voluntarily deferred, each for a period 
of three years. Shares derived from compulsory or voluntary deferral of bonus are matched on a one for one 
basis, subject to performance conditions (as described under long term incentives below).
All bonus payments are subject to the overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee, which also 
retains discretion to amend the proportions of bonus subject to compulsory or voluntary deferral or not  
to require or offer any deferral.
In order to be entitled to an annual bonus, an executive director must normally be in the group’s employment 
and not under notice of termination (either given or received) at the time the bonus is paid.
The Remuneration Committee has the right to cancel or reduce any bonus compulsorily or voluntarily deferred 
into shares which have not yet vested in the circumstances described under long term incentives below.
Performance 
measurement 
framework

By reference to a combination of company performance against external benchmarks and individual 
performance against personal objectives. Executive directors with responsibility for pools of capital will  
have a proportion of bonus determined by reference to pool performance and objectives.
Long term incentives (variable pay)
Purpose and link to 
strategic objectives
To motivate executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value, thereby aligning the interests  
of management with those of shareholders.
To encourage long term retention of key executives.
Operation Caledonia operates a performance share scheme under which participants are awarded nil-cost options over 
the company’s shares.
The performance share scheme replaced an executive share option scheme under which market value options 
were awarded to senior executives. The last awards under the executive share option scheme were made in 
2010, although Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin retain options under this scheme which have yet to be exercised.
Under the company’s deferred bonus plan, matching share awards are granted in respect of compulsory  
and voluntary deferral of pre-tax bonus. The current deferred bonus plan replaced an earlier plan introduced 
in 2005 under which matching share awards were granted in 2011. Mr Wyatt, Mr King and Mr Cayzer-Colvin 
all retain matching share awards granted under the earlier scheme, the vesting conditions for which have 
been met.
Opportunity  
and recovery  
or withholding 
provisions
The maximum value of nil-cost options that may be granted in any year under the performance share scheme 
rules is 200% of basic salary, although the company’s policy is to grant annual awards of no more than 125% 
of basic salary.
Matching shares are granted on a one for one basis for shares derived from bonus deferral.
On exercise of nil-cost options or calling of matching share awards, participants will also receive an amount 
equivalent to the dividends and any associated tax credits that would have accrued on the shares during the 
relevant performance measurement period. 44  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
The Remuneration Committee has the right, in respect of awards granted after 1 April 2014, to cancel or 
reduce long term incentive awards which have not yet vested, in the event of a material misstatement of the 
company’s financial results, miscalculation of a participant’s entitlement, individual misconduct or an event 
resulting in material loss or reputational damage to the company or any member of the group.
In the event of a change of control before the expiry of the performance measurement period of a long term 
incentive award, the vesting level of the award will be determined by the Remuneration Committee based on 
the extent to which the performance targets have been achieved and vested shares will then be scaled down 
to reflect the shortened measurement period. The Remuneration Committee may modify such vesting levels 
if it considers that the performance target would be met to a greater or lesser degree at the testing date and/
or if the application of time pro rating would be inappropriate in the circumstances.
Performance 
measurement 
framework
1
Nil-cost options awarded under the 2011 performance share scheme and matching share awards granted 
under the deferred bonus plan are subject to performance targets related to the company’s diluted net  
asset value per share on a total return basis (‘NAVTR’) measured against two benchmark indices, the FTSE 
All-Share Total Return index (‘FTSE index’) and the FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts (all stocks)  
Total Return index (‘Gilts index’), measured over three or five years.
The rules of each scheme provide discretion to the Remuneration Committee to amend the performance 
targets or impose different performance targets.
The performance targets for all outstanding options granted under the company’s executive share option 
schemes and matching share awards granted under the 2005 deferred bonus plan have been met.
Pension related benefits (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to 
strategic objectives
To provide a means of retirement saving as part of a range of benefits alongside basic salary to recruit  
and retain high calibre executive directors.
Operation Executive directors are offered defined contribution funding, based on a percentage of salary, to a personal 
pension scheme or a cash salary supplement (or a combination of both) at their choice.
Opportunity  
and recovery  
or withholding 
provisions
The percentage of basic salary for the Chief Executive is 22.5% and for other executive directors 17.5%.  
If a director chooses to take a cash supplement in lieu of some or all of his or her pension entitlement,  
the payment is reduced by such amount as is necessary to make the cash supplement cost neutral for  
the company after taking into account National Insurance contributions.
The Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to increase the percentage of salary relating to 
pension benefits from time to time in line with market conditions, up to a maximum of 30% of basic salary.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance

Not applicable.
1. Performance measures and targets
Annual bonus
For the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, a maximum of 50% of bonus is 
determined by reference to company performance and 50% by reference to individual 
performance objectives. For executive directors responsible for a specific pool of capital, 
25% of bonus is determined by reference to the company’s performance, 25% to pool 
performance, 35% to pool objectives and 15% to individual performance objectives.  
In all cases, the company performance element is determined by reference to the relative 
performance of the company’s NAVTR against RPI. Bonus payments for this element 
commence with a 10% pay-out if NAVTR matches RPI, increasing incrementally  
to the maximum entitlement payable if outperformance of 7% or more is achieved.  
Pool performance is judged by the Remuneration Committee by reference to the return 
achieved by the pool over the year against RPI and an annualised target return set for  
the pool and by objectives such as deal flow and delivery of portfolio strategy. Individual 
performance is assessed by reference to personal objectives set at the start of the year , 
including non-financial measures such as risk management, marketing of the company, 
team leadership, management skills and promotion of Caledonia’s corporate culture and 
image both internally and externally.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to amend or adopt alternative annual 
bonus targets in order to achieve better alignment with the company’s strategic objectives.
Compulsory and voluntary deferral of bonus
Shares comprised in a compulsory deferral will normally only vest if the director remains 
an employee of the Caledonia group for a three year period commencing on the first day  
of the financial year in which the award is made. 
Shares comprised in a voluntary deferral are not subject to any conditions and will 
normally vest at the earlier of three years from the first day of the financial year in which 
the award is made or the date that the director ceases to be an employee of the Caledonia 
group for any reason.
Long term incentive plans
Performance share scheme
For nil-cost options granted prior to the 2014 financial year under the performance share 
scheme, one-third of the shares comprised in an award are subject to a performance condition 
which compares the performance of NAVTR against the Gilts index over three years. For the 
other two-thirds, Caledonia’s NAVTR is measured against the FTSE index, also over three 
years. Awards vest on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on 0.5% outperformance of  
the relevant benchmark, rising on a straight line basis to maximum vesting on 3.5% 
outperformance. There is no re-testing of either performance target and, to the extent a 
performance target is not met, the relevant award will lapse. For the purpose of calculating 
the performance measures, averages of the company’s NAVTR and the two benchmark 
indices over the three months prior to the start and end of the performance period are  
used to reduce volatility. To the extent that the performance targets are met, awards may be 
exercised between the date of vesting and the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, except 
that only two-thirds of the shares that have vested may normally be exercised after three 
years, with the remaining one-third normally becoming exercisable after five years.
For nil-cost options granted in the 2014 financial year, the performance criteria are as above, 
except that one-half of the shares comprised in an award will be measured against the Gilts 
index over three years and the other half against the FTSE index over five years, with shares 
that vest in each case becoming exercisable immediately.
Under transitional arrangements previously put in place by the Remuneration Committee, 
nil-cost options to be granted in the 2015 financial year are to be on the same performance 
measures as those granted in the 2014 financial year and then, for the 2016 financial year 
onwards, one-third of the shares comprised in an award are to be measured against the Gilts 
index over three years and two-thirds against the FTSE index over five years, with shares that 
vest in each case becoming exercisable immediately.
Deferred bonus plan matching awards
The performance targets for matching shares awarded under the deferred bonus plan are the 
same as those described above for the nil-cost options granted under the performance share 
scheme prior to the 2014 financial year, except that shares that vest can be called 
immediately following the end of the measurement period and will lapse if not called within 
the twelve months thereafter.
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  45
Directors’ report
Rationale for choice of performance measures for the short and long term incentive plans
The Remuneration Committee has chosen NAVTR as the basis of performance measurement 
for the company for both its short term and long term incentive arrangements as it regards 
this as the best indicator of the success or failure of management decisions in terms of the 
value of the portfolio.
For the company performance element of the annual bonus scheme, the board has taken the 
view that benchmarking against a stock market index or indices over a short period is not 
relevant given Caledonia’s long term investment horizon and the nature of its portfolio. The 
Remuneration Committee has therefore instead chosen RPI as the comparator , as on this 
basis executives will only be rewarded to the extent that they are able to deliver positive real 
returns for shareholders. The Remuneration Committee will review the rate of increase in 
RPI at the start of each financial year and may adjust the level of outperformance required 
for the incremental and maximum bonus payments in order to ensure that they remain a 
fair measure of performance.
For awards under the performance share scheme and matching shares under the deferred 
bonus plan, the Remuneration Committee has chosen the FTSE index as the measure for a 
substantial proportion of the shares comprised in such awards as it believes that this is the 
best way to incentivise executives to deliver continued strong NAVTR performance against  
the market, which in turn should underpin Caledonia’s stated objective of delivering long  
term growth in shareholder capital and income. The Gilts index has been chosen as a second 
measure for the long term incentive plans as the Remuneration Committee regards it as 
reflective of the company’s aim to provide a long term store of wealth for its shareholders.
The targets for each component of the long term incentive plans have been set by the 
Remuneration Committee with the aim of delivering increasing reward for greater 
outperformance. The Remuneration Committee keeps these measures and the levels at  
which incremental and maximum entitlements are earned under review in order to ensure 
that they remain sufficiently challenging and aligned with the company’s strategy and key 
performance indicators.
2. New components introduced into the new remuneration policy
There are no new components included in the above policy table which were not a part  
of the remuneration framework previously operated for executive directors by the company.
3. Changes to components included in the previous remuneration policy
The only changes to the remuneration policy operated for the year to 31 March 2013 were  
the adoption of RPI as the measure of the company performance element of the annual 
bonus scheme, the phased adoption of a five year performance measurement period for a 
significant proportion of awards under the company’s performance share scheme and the 
introduction of malus provisions for long term incentive awards and bonus deferral.
4.  How the remuneration policy for executive directors relates to remuneration  
of Caledonia group employees generally
Caledonia’s executive directors’ remuneration packages tend to be higher than those  
of other group employees, but also include a higher proportion of variable pay.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The table below sets out each component of the Chairman’s and 
the non-executive directors’ remuneration and the approach 
taken by the company in relation thereto. 
Component Approach
Chairman’s and non-executive 
directors’ fees
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee and the non-executive 
directors’ fees are set by the board. These are reviewed periodically taking into account the 
responsibilities and time commitments required and non-executive director fee levels generally.
The Chairman receives an annual fee, which includes his basic non-executive director’s fee,  
but does not receive any other remuneration.
Non-executive directors receive basic fees, which are subject to an annual limit for non-executive 
directors’ ordinary remuneration contained in the articles of association, currently £350,000.  
In addition, special fees are paid for the chairmanship and membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees and also for the role of Senior Independent Non-Executive Director  
and chairman of the Governance Committee.
The fees of the Chairman and the non-executive directors on implementation of the policy  
will be as follows:
Chairman £184,500
Basic non-executive director’s fee £39,900
Audit Committee chairman £5,600
Audit Committee member £2,300
Remuneration Committee chairman £4,900
Remuneration Committee member £1,600 
Senior Independent Director/Governance Committee chairman £5,100
Additional fees payable for 
services to other group 
companies
Exceptionally, non-executive directors may receive fees from group companies for services 
provided to them. The Hon C W Cayzer receives such a fee, currently £60,000, for his chairmanship 
of the Sloane Club, a position which he held as an executive director of Caledonia prior to becoming 
non-executive.
Fees for services provided to subsidiary companies are set and reviewed by the boards of those 
companies, but will not exceed £100,000 per annum in aggregate for any non-executive director.
Other benefits The Chairman and the non-executive directors are all covered under the company’s directors’  
and officers’ liability insurance policy and have the benefit of an indemnity under the company’s 
articles of association. The Chairman is also provided with an office and some secretarial support.
The company may, where appropriate, pay for the cost of spouses accompanying non-executive 
directors on trips where there is a business reason for doing so and reimburse non-executive 
directors for hotel accommodation and travel expenses (in each case including payment of any 
tax thereon).
under Rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules, if such were absolutely 
necessary to ensure the recruitment of an exceptional candidate. 
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee would take into 
consideration all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, 
overall quantum, type of remuneration offered and comparability 
with the packages of other Caledonia senior executives and the 
total variable pay would not exceed the maxima stated in the 
policy table for executive director remuneration above.
Remuneration policy for new appointments
Executive directors
In the case of the appointment of a new executive director,  
the Remuneration Committee would typically seek to align  
the remuneration package with the above remuneration policy.  
The Remuneration Committee however retains the discretion  
to make special remuneration commitments on the appointment  
of a new executive director, including the use of awards made  46  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
The Remuneration Committee may in addition make bonus 
commitments or share awards on the appointment of  
an external candidate to compensate for remuneration 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, taking 
into account factors such as any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted, 
for example cash or shares, and the time over which they  
would have vested. The aim would be to ensure that replacement 
awards would be made on no greater than a comparable basis.
In order to attract and retain suitable executives, the 
Remuneration Committee retains discretion, in exceptional 
circumstances, to offer service contracts with up to an initial 
24 month notice period, which then reduces to 12 months at  
the end of this initial period. If it considers it appropriate,  
the Remuneration Committee may also offer a lower salary 
initially, but with a series of increases to achieve the desired 
salary positioning over a period of time, as the individual 
develops into the role.
If a new appointment is the result of an internal promotion,  
the Remuneration Committee would expect to honour any 
pre-existing contractual arrangements or benefits package 
agreed with the relevant individual. In the event that a  
new director resides overseas, the Remuneration Committee 
may agree a reasonable relocation package and tax  
equalisation arrangements.
In recruiting any new executive director, the Remuneration 
Committee would apply the overall policy objective that 
executive directors’ remuneration should be competitive,  
but not excessive. In the event that the Remuneration  
Committee agreed that it was necessary for special 
commitments or sign-on arrangements to be offered  
to secure the recruitment of a new executive director,  
an explanation of why these were required and details  
thereof would be announced at the time of appointment.
Chairman and non-executive directors
Terms for the appointment of any new Chairman or non-
executive director would also be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee or the board within the above 
remuneration policy.
Executive directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s 
and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment 
Executive directors
Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia Group 
Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, details 
of which are summarised below:
Date of contract
Notice period 
for the 
company and 
the director
Unexpired
term
W P Wyatt 2 June 2005 12 months 12 months
S A King 19 November 2009 12 months 12 months
J M B Cayzer-Colvin 19 April 2005 12 months 12 months
If notice is served by either party, the director can continue to 
receive basic salary, benefits and pension payments for the 
duration of the notice period, during which time the company 
may require the individual to continue to fulfil his current duties 
or may assign a period of gardening leave. Alternatively, the 
company may, in its discretion, terminate the contract without 
notice and make a lump sum payment in lieu of notice. This lump 
sum would include an amount equivalent to the basic salary  
and benefits (based on a fixed percentage of salary specified in 
the service contract) for the unexpired period of notice to which 
the payment relates. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s service 
contracts provide that an amount equivalent to 80% of the 
average of the annual bonuses paid for the previous three 
financial years would also be included in the payment in lieu  
of notice. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s service contracts 
also include provisions whereby a liquidated sum is payable in 
the event of termination within one year following a change of 
control. The payment would be calculated on the same basis as  
a payment in lieu of notice, except that an amount equivalent to 
100% of the average of the annual bonuses paid for the previous 
three financial years would be included.
Mr King’s service contract contains provisions whereby,  
as an alternative to the payment of a lump sum in lieu of notice, 
the company may elect to pay the equivalent amount in equal 
monthly instalments, such instalments to be reduced by 50%  
of one-twelfth of the basic salary in excess of £20,000 per annum 
that Mr King receives from any alternative employment that  
he takes up during the notice period.
Executive directors’ service contracts may be terminated 
without notice and without any further payment (other than  
in respect of amounts due at the date of termination) on the 
occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not have 
service contracts, but are appointed under letters of 
appointment, which provide for termination without notice  
or compensation.
Inspection
Executive directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s and 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available  
for inspection at the registered office of the company.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held by 
executive directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold 
non-executive directorships unrelated to the company’s 
business to broaden their commercial experience, provided that 
the time required is not material. Normally the company will 
retain any fees arising from such non-executive directorships, 
but may permit the executive director to retain fees on a case  
by case basis.
Details of any fees from external non-executive directorships 
retained by executive directors are disclosed in the annual 
report on directors’ remuneration.
Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy  
for executive directors
The charts below provide an indication of the total pay  
of the executive directors in the first year of operation  
of the remuneration policy under three assumed  
performance scenarios:
• minimum receivable – this assumes that the director receives 
fixed components of pay only and nothing in respect of annual 
bonus or long term incentives
• receivable for target performance – this assumes that, in 
addition to fixed pay, there is a pay-out of 50% of basic salary 
for annual bonus and 50% vesting of performance share 
scheme awards and deferred bonus plan matching shares
• maximum receivable – this assumes that, in addition to fixed 
pay, there is a maximum bonus of 100% of basic salary and 
100% vesting of performance share scheme awards and 
deferred bonus plan matching shares.
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  47
Directors’ report
Executive directors would also be entitled under their service 
contracts to be paid on termination for any accrued, but untaken, 
holiday entitlement. The Remuneration Committee may, where it 
considers it appropriate in the circumstances, make payments 
for loss of statutory rights or waiver thereof and a contribution 
towards legal and outplacement fees. The Remuneration 
Committee may also make a payment to ensure that any 
restrictive covenants remain enforceable.
Where the director holds unvested awards under the company’s 
long term incentive schemes, the Remuneration Committee 
would exercise its discretions as to vesting in accordance with 
the relevant scheme rules. In good leaver circumstances, for 
example where cessation of employment is by reason of death, 
retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, redundancy, or such 
other reason as the Remuneration Committee may decide,  
the Remuneration Committee will normally determine the level 
of vesting based on the attainment of the performance targets, 
either at the time of cessation or at the normal test date if 
permitted by the scheme rules, but in the case of the former  
may decrease or increase the level of vesting if the Remuneration 
Committee considers that the targets would have been met to  
a lesser or greater extent at the end of the performance period. 
The number of shares that vest will normally be reduced to 
reflect the proportion of the performance period that the 
director was in employment, although the Remuneration 
Committee has discretion not to scale down the number of 
shares if it believes it appropriate in the circumstances.
Following termination, the Remuneration Committee may  
agree to pay a director consultancy fees and continue insurance 
related benefits until the end of the policy period. The company’s 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy also provides 
for a six year period of run-off cover for former directors. 
In limited circumstances, the company may permit a director  
to remain in employment after ceasing to be a director for a 
limited period to allow time for an effective handover or for 
a successor to be appointed.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors have no 
entitlement to any compensation on termination of their 
appointments, although they would have the benefit of  
run-off cover under the directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance policy as described above.

1.  Fixed pay – comprises basic salary and pension related benefits, based on basic salary for 
the financial year ending 31 March 2015 and other taxable benefits taken from the table 
of total emoluments paid to directors for the 2014 financial year included in the annual 
report on directors’ remuneration.
2.  Annual bonus – based on basic salary for the year ending 31 March 2015.
3.   Long term awards – for target performance and maximum receivable, it is assumed that  
the director will voluntarily defer into shares the maximum amount of annual bonus
permissible under the deferred bonus plan rules and therefore receives an entitlement to 
matching shares on a one for one basis. An initial grant of 125% of basic salary for the year 
to 31 March 2015 under the performance share scheme is assumed, as this is the policy 
maximum set by the Remuneration Committee, notwithstanding that the maximum permitted 
under the scheme rules is 200%. No share price growth is assumed for shares vesting under 
either scheme, nor are any dividend equivalents that might accrue on share awards included.
Policy on payments for loss of office
Executive directors
It is the policy of the company that, other than in exceptional 
circumstances on recruitment as stated above, no executive 
director should be offered a service contract that requires  
more than one year’s notice of termination or which contains 
provision for predetermined compensation in excess of one 
year’s total emoluments. In the event of a termination, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider a director’s past 
performance and the circumstances of the departure in 
exercising any discretions relating to the arrangements  
for loss of office, including contractual obligations, prevailing 
best practice, the reason for the departure and any transition  
or handover required.
The termination provisions in executive directors’ current 
service contracts are described above in the section on executive 
directors’ service contracts. It is the Remuneration Committee’s 
intention that all future executive directors’ service contracts 
should include provisions enabling the company to reduce 
compensation payments in the event that the director takes  
up alternative employment within the notice period. However,  
if a new director is appointed internally, the Remuneration 
Committee would expect to honour any existing contractual 
arrangements agreed with the relevant individual before he  
or she becomes a director.
In applying the company’s right to make a lump sum payment  
in lieu of notice, the Remuneration Committee would normally 
expect to pro rate the lump sum for the unexpired period of 
notice to which the payment relates. In appropriate 
circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may make a 
payment in respect of the full twelve months’ notice period,  
even if the director works under notice for part of it.
The company’s annual bonus scheme provides that an employee 
must be in the group’s employment and not under notice of 
termination (either given or received) in order to be entitled to 
receive a bonus for the relevant financial year. The Remuneration 
Committee would expect to apply this principle to executive 
director terminations, but retains discretion to make bonus 
payments on termination if it believes it appropriate to do so.  48  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the group
In setting the policy for directors’ remuneration, the 
Remuneration Committee considered pay and employment 
conditions of other employees within the group. The 
Remuneration Committee does not however seek to apply any 
metrics between pay levels of different roles within the group  
as this would restrict flexibility in aligning reward and 
performance and potentially could hinder the recruitment  
and retention of high calibre individuals. Executive directors’ 
remuneration packages are however benchmarked with other 
senior investment executives, who participate in the same 
annual bonus and long term incentive plans. Given the parity of 
these remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee 
did not feel it necessary to conduct any formal consultation  
with employees, although views expressed by senior executives 
are shared with Remuneration Committee members.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee last undertook a major review of 
the remuneration arrangements for executive directors in 2011, 
which principally resulted in the adoption of the performance 
share scheme in place of an earlier executive share option 
scheme and an updated deferred bonus plan. A consultation  
with the company’s larger shareholders and various shareholder 
representative bodies was undertaken through written 
correspondence as part of this review. Other than changes  
to the performance measures for the annual bonus scheme and 
the performance share scheme and the introduction of malus 
provisions for long term incentive awards, which are described 
in this report, the remuneration structures adopted in 2011 
remain the same. Notwithstanding, the Remuneration 
Committee felt it appropriate to consult a number of the 
company’s larger shareholders and certain institutional 
shareholder representative bodies again through written 
correspondence in formulating the above remuneration policy. 
No changes to the remuneration policy were made as a result  
of the consultation.
More generally, the Remuneration Committee receives copies  
of correspondence from shareholders relating to remuneration 
matters and the company’s annual general meeting provides 
shareholders with the opportunity to ask questions about 
directors’ remuneration.

3. Long term incentives
The long term incentive awards whose performance measurement period ended during  
the year were awards granted in 2011 under the company’s performance share scheme  
and matching share awards under the deferred bonus plan. The vesting of awards under  
the performance share scheme was dependent on the performance of the company’s 
NAVTR over the three financial years ending on 31 March 2014 measured against  
two separate performance benchmarks. For two-thirds of the shares comprised in  
an award, Caledonia’s NAVTR was measured against the FTSE All-Share Total Return index  
(‘FTSE index’) and for the remaining one-third against the FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked 
Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts index’). In each case, vesting was on a graduated 
basis, with 10% vesting on achievement of 0.5% outperformance of the relevant benchmark 
index, rising on a straight line basis to 100% vesting on 3.5% outperformance of the relevant 
index. For the purpose of calculating the performance measures, averages of the figures for 
the company’s NAVTR and the two benchmark indices published over the three months 
prior to the start and end of the performance period were used to reduce volatility.
The company’s NAVTR increased by 21.1% over the performance period, compared with 
increases of 29.2% in the FTSE index and 24.8% in the Gilts index. Accordingly, neither  
of the performance targets was met and the performance share awards granted in 2011 
therefore lapsed in their entirety.
The vesting of matching share awards under the deferred bonus plan was dependent, for 50% 
of the shares comprised in the award, on the company’s undiluted net asset value per share 
(‘NAV’) outperforming RPI by at least 9% over the three financial years to 31 March 2014,  
and for the other 50%, on the company’s NAV outperforming the FTSE All-Share index  
by at least 3% over such period. The company’s NAV increased by 19.9% over the 
performance measurement period, compared with increases of 9.6% for RPI and 15.9%  
for the FTSE All-Share index. Accordingly, the deferred bonus matching awards granted  
in 2011 vested in full.
The amounts shown in the table above under long term incentives therefore comprised the 
value of the vested bonus matching share awards granted in 2011 based on the company’s 
share price at 31 March 2014 of 1923p, together with the value of dividends and associated 
tax credits that would have accrued on the matching shares during the performance 
measurement period as follows:

1. Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits comprised family private medical insurance cover and a small Christmas 
supplement paid to all Caledonia staff. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s taxable benefits  
also included a cash allowance of £15,024 in lieu of a company car.
In addition to taxable benefits, other non-taxable benefits were provided to executive 
directors including death-in-service insurance (4x basic salary), permanent health 
insurance, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and certain other benefits of minor 
value provided to all of Caledonia’s head office staff.
2. Short term incentives
In accordance with the rules of the company’s deferred bonus plan, the following amounts 
included in the total of short term incentives were compulsorily deferred, satisfied by  
share awards made shortly after the announcement of the company’s final results for the 
relevant year:

J M B Cayzer-Colvin 148 148 296 144 144 288
For Mr Wyatt and Mr King, a maximum of 50% of bonus was determined by reference  
to company performance and 50% by reference to individual performance objectives.  
For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, who has specific responsibility for the Funds pool of capital, 25% of 
his bonus was determined by reference to the company’s performance, 25% to his pool’s 
performance, 35% to his pool’s objectives and 15% to individual performance objectives. 
For the 2014 financial year, the company performance element was determined by 
reference to the relative performance of the company’s NAV per share on a total return 
basis (‘NAVTR’) against the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’), with bonus payments for this 
element commencing with a 10% pay-out if the company’s NAVTR matched that of RPI, 
increasing incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if outperformance of 7%  
or more was achieved. Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s pool performance was assessed by reference  
to the return achieved by the Funds pool over the year against RPI and an annualised  
target return set for that pool of 12.5% and by pool objectives such as deal flow and 
delivery of portfolio strategy. Individual performance for each executive director was 
assessed by reference to personal objectives set at the start of the year , including 
non-financial measures such as risk management, marketing of the company, team 
leadership, management skills and promotion of Caledonia’s corporate culture and  
image both internally and externally.
The company’s NAVTR increased by 14.9% over the year compared with an increase of 
2.5% in RPI, resulting in a maximum bonus entitlement for the company performance 
element. The Funds pool’s return over the year was 11.8%, which outperformed RPI  
by 9.3% and was 0.7% below the annualised target return, notwithstanding that the pool  
is still in a period of transition from legacy holdings to a strategic portfolio. On this basis, 
the Remuneration Committee judged that the maximum of 25% of salary was appropriate 
for this element and also that the progress made in transitioning merited a maximum 
bonus for the Funds pool objectives. Based on an assessment of their individual 
performance objectives over the year , the Remuneration Committee also awarded  
Mr Wyatt, Mr Cayzer-Colvin and Mr King maximum bonuses for that component.

Defined benefit
The Hon C W Cayzer has deferred pension entitlements under 
the Caledonia Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme. 
He ceased to be an active member of the scheme on 3 December 
2012 and therefore did not accrue any further pensionable 
service during the year, nor were any contributions made on his 
behalf into the scheme. The Hon C W Cayzer’s normal retirement 
age is 60, however early retirement can be taken from age 55 
with the company’s consent. In such circumstances, the accrued 
pension would be reduced to take account of its early payment.
Details of The Hon C W Cayzer’s accrued pension benefits were 
as follows:

Change in transfer value over the year f 269,746 
1.  The accrued pensions shown in rows (a) and (b) represented the deferred pension that 
would be paid at normal retirement age, ignoring any revaluation. The increase in accrued 
pension during the year shown in row (c) represented the increase in deferred pension in 
accordance with the revaluation of pension provisions of the Caledonia Pension Scheme 
applicable to all deferred members.
2.  The transfer values shown in rows (d) and (e) were the present values of the accrued 
pension revalued to normal retirement age and associated benefits at the relevant date. 
Transfer values were calculated using the transfer value basis as determined by the 
trustees of the Caledonia Pension Scheme at the relevant date.
3.  The change in transfer value over the year shown in row (f)(calculated as row (d) less  
row (e)), also reflected the impact on transfer values of factors beyond the control of the 
company and the directors, such as movements in financial markets. These can cause 
transfer values at different points in time to fluctuate significantly. Disclosed changes in 
transfer values may therefore be subject to a large degree of volatility and may even be 
negative. In particular, the Caledonia Pension Scheme’s transfer value assumptions have 
been updated to allow for changes in market conditions.

Payments to past directors (audited)
At the time of his retirement in July 2010, the Remuneration 
Committee determined that options granted in 2009 to Mr T C W 
Ingram, formerly Chief Executive of Caledonia, over 53,250 
shares should continue until their normal performance test date, 
being 31 March 2012 and, to the extent that the performance 
conditions were met, would become exercisable within the 
12 months following notification to Mr Ingram of the test 
results. One-half of the shares under option failed to meet their 
performance target and therefore lapsed. The other half met 
their target and were exercised by Mr Ingram during the year, 
realising a pre-tax gain of £119,413.
Payments for loss of office (audited)
There were no payments for loss of office made during the year 
to any director or former director.
Statement of directors’ shareholdings and scheme  
interests (audited)
Executive directors’ minimum shareholding guidelines
In order to align the interests of executive directors with those 
of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted 
guidelines for minimum shareholdings, which executive 
directors will be expected to attain through the retention of all 
post-tax share awards vesting under the company’s long term 
incentive plans until the minimum shareholding is met. For these 
purposes, shareholdings include those of connected persons and 
also the value, net of any exercise costs, income tax and National 
Insurance contributions, of unexercised options granted under 
the company’s executive share option schemes and awards 
granted under its performance share plan for which the 
performance targets have been met. Also included are bonuses 
deferred, compulsorily or voluntarily, under the company’s 
deferred bonus plans and any uncalled bonus matching shares 
for which the performance targets have been met.
For the Chief Executive, the minimum guideline shareholding 
has been set at 200% of basic salary and for other executive 
directors 150% of basic salary. Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin 
both significantly exceed their minimum guideline 
shareholdings, although Mr King has yet to achieve his as he  
has not received sufficient vested share awards since he joined 
the company in December 2009. The values of the relevant 
shareholdings of each executive director as at 31 March 2014, 
calculated by reference to Caledonia’s closing share price on  
that date of 1923p, were as follows:

1. Performance conditions
 Executive share option scheme
  Options outstanding under the executive share option scheme have all met their 
performance targets.
 Performance share scheme
  Nil-cost options awarded under the performance share scheme are subject to targets 
related to the company’s NAVTR performance against two benchmark indices, the FTSE 
index and the Gilts index. Awards vest on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on 0.5% 
outperformance of the relevant benchmark, rising to maximum vesting on 3.5% 
outperformance. There is no re-testing of either performance target and, to the extent  
that a performance target is not met, the relevant award will lapse. For the purpose of 
calculating the performance measures, averages of the company’s NAVTR and the two 
benchmark indices over the three months prior to the start and end of the performance 
period is used to reduce volatility. To the extent that the performance targets are met, 
vested awards may be exercised between the date of vesting and the tenth anniversary  
of the date of grant.
  For nil-cost options granted on 28 May 2012, two-thirds of the shares comprised in an 
award are tested against the FTSE index and one-third against the Gilts index. In each case 
the performance period is a period of three years commencing with the financial year in 
which the awards are granted. For the nil-cost options awarded on 12 June 2013, one-half 
of the shares comprised in an award are measured against the Gilts index over three years 
and the other half against the FTSE index over five years.
 Deferred bonus plan matching awards
  The performance targets for matching share awards granted on 26 May 2011 have all been 
met. The performance targets for matching awards granted on 12 June 2013 are the same 
as those for nil-cost options granted under the performance share scheme on 28 May 2012.
2. Other exercise conditions
 Executive share option scheme
  Once the performance conditions have been met, options granted under the executive share 
option scheme may normally be exercised between three and ten years from the date of 
grant, although only one-third of the shares comprised in an option may be exercised three 
years after grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable six years after grant.
 Performance share scheme
  For nil-cost options granted under the performance share scheme on 28 May 2012, to the 
extent that a performance target is met, two-thirds of the shares that vest may normally  
be exercised three years after grant, with the remaining one-third normally becoming 
exercisable five years after grant. For nil-cost options granted on 12 June 2013, shares that 
vest following performance testing become immediately exercisable.
3. Vested but unexercised
  Shares vested but unexercised represent those awards that are immediately exercisable 
without any conditions. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  53
Directors’ report
Percentage change in remuneration of Chief Executive
The following table shows the percentage change in the basic 
salary, value of taxable benefits and short term incentives paid 
to the Chief Executive in the year to 31 March 2014 against the 
previous financial year, compared with the average percentage 
changes in those components of pay of Caledonia’s other staff  
on a per capita basis. Caledonia’s staff received a standard 
increase in basic salary of 3.0% and the standard bonus was  
the maximum entitlement, the same as the Chief Executive. 
However, the average per capita percentage changes shown 
below were higher due to the effect of non-standard increases  
or bonus awards for a number of staff reflecting promotion, 
increased responsibilities or other such adjustments.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy  
in the 2015 financial year
The company expects to operate the remuneration policy set  
out above without any significant changes in the financial year 
ending 31 March 2015, other than potentially in relation to the 
performance measures for the performance share scheme and 
deferred bonus plan as described below.
Basic salaries of executive directors
In respect of the 2015 financial year, the Remuneration 
Committee has already awarded the executive directors 
inflation-based increases in basic salary of 2.5% as follows.

S A King 359,380 350,610 
J M B Cayzer-Colvin 303,890 296,475 
During the year and in accordance with the terms previously 
agreed by the Remuneration Committee in relation to the 
termination of his executive service agreement, The Hon C W 
Cayzer exercised executive share options over 39,129 shares  
at a pre-tax gain over exercise cost of £102,547. He also called  
a compulsory deferred bonus award over 1,557 shares, 
crystallising a pre-tax gain of £28,805, in addition to which  
he received an amount equivalent to the dividends that would 
have been paid on these shares, together with the associated  
tax credits, of £1,192.
Performance graph of total shareholder return and table  
of Chief Executive’s total remuneration
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) against that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index  
for the five financial years ending on 31 March 2014. TSR has 
been calculated assuming that all dividends are reinvested  
on their ex-dividend dates. The FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index has been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the 
company measures its delivery of value over the longer term.  
For comparison, the table below the graph shows the total 
remuneration received by the Chief Executive in each of the five 
years to 31 March 2014, prepared on the same basis as in the 
single total figure in the table on page 49, and the percentage  
of the maximum potential short and long term incentives 
received in those years.

Mr Wyatt was appointed as his successor. The remuneration shown for 2011 represents the 
amounts paid to each in the period that they served as Chief Executive in that financial year. 
The long term incentives held by Mr Ingram which vested in 2011 were HMRC approved 
executive share options granted in 2008, which the Remuneration Committee determined 
should vest based on the measurement of the performance targets up to the date of his 
retirement. The percentage of short term incentives shown as vesting for Mr Wyatt in 2011 
relates to his annual bonus for that year , the total amount of which has been included in the 
corresponding single figure for total remuneration.
  Subsequent to his retirement, Mr Ingram exercised further share options as set out in the 
section on payments to past directors above. 54  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Consideration by the directors of matters relating  
to directors’ remuneration
The current members of the Remuneration Committee are 
Charles Gregson (Chairman), Charles Allen-Jones and Robert 
Woods, all of whom served throughout the year. David 
Thompson also served as a member of the committee until  
his retirement from the board on 24 July 2013.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice 
from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, the company’s  
main legal advisers, in relation to the new remuneration 
reporting regulations, the introduction of malus provisions  
for the long term incentive plans and the formalisation of the 
guidelines for minimum shareholdings of executive directors. 
The Remuneration Committee also consulted with the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive in relation to the remuneration of the 
executive directors and internal support was provided to the 
Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary.

Annual bonus scheme
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance 
target for the company performance element of the annual bonus 
scheme and decided that, for the financial year ending 31 March 
2015, the current target, whereby payments commence with  
a 10% pay-out if the performance of the company’s NAVTR 
matches that of RPI, increasing incrementally to the maximum 
entitlement payable if outperformance of 7% or more is 
achieved, remains appropriate given the level of RPI prevailing 
at the start of the financial year.
Long term incentive schemes
In view of the board’s recent decision to adopt RPI as the basis  
of measurement of Caledonia’s performance over the medium,  
as well as the shorter, term in place of the FTSE index, the 
Remuneration Committee will be considering whether the 
benchmark indices currently used for the company’s share 
incentive plans, as described above, should similarly be  
changed. Other than this, no changes in the basis of directors’ 
remuneration are anticipated for the 2015 financial year.
Approach
The Remuneration Committee will keep the implementation  
of the remuneration policy under review in order to take account 
of any changes in the company’s business environment and 
remuneration practice generally, but with the overall aim of 
ensuring that Caledonia’s remuneration arrangements continue 
to attract and retain talent and reward executives appropriately 
in the light of the company’s performance.

Employee share trust
The Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust acquires 
and holds ordinary shares in the company for subsequent 
transfer to employees exercising options under the company’s 
executive share option schemes and the performance share 
scheme or calling for awards vesting under the company’s 
deferred bonus plans. The voting rights of shares held by the 
trust are exercisable by the independent trustee. The trustee  
has also waived all dividends payable in respect of the ordinary 
shares held by the trust, except to the extent of 0.0001%  
of such dividends. At 31 March 2014, the trust held 320,713 
ordinary shares.
Restrictions on voting rights
The directors may direct that a shareholder shall not be entitled 
to attend and vote either personally or by proxy or exercise  
any other right conferred by membership in relation to general 
meetings of the company in respect of some or all of the shares 
held by him, if he or any person with an interest in such shares 
has been duly served with a notice under section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and is in default for the prescribed period 
in supplying to the company the information required or, 
in purported compliance with such a notice, has made a 
statement which is false or inadequate in a material particular.
Agreements which may restrict the transfer of shares or 
exercise of voting rights
The company is not aware of any arrangements which may 
restrict the transfer of any of its shares or the exercise of any 
voting rights.
Authority to allot and purchase shares
At the annual general meeting of the company held on  
24 July 2013, shareholders granted to the directors authority  
to allot ordinary shares up to a nominal amount of £931,850, 
representing approximately one-third of the ordinary share 
capital then in issue, with authority to allot additional ordinary 
shares up to a nominal value of £931,850, representing 
approximately a further one-third of the ordinary share capital 
then in issue, by way of pre-emptive rights issues only, 
in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of  
British Insurers. The directors were further authorised to issue 
ordinary shares up to a nominal amount of £139,775 other than 
pro rata to existing ordinary shareholders. These authorities 
last until 24 October 2014 or, if earlier, the conclusion of the next 
annual general meeting.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 13.4p per share (2013 – 12.9p) was  
paid on 9 January 2014 and the board has proposed that a final 
dividend of 35.7p per share (2013 – 34.3p) be paid on 7 August 
2014. This will result in total dividends for the year of 49.1p  
per share (2013 – 47.2p).
Share capital structure
The company has two classes of share capital – ordinary shares 
of 5p each and deferred ordinary shares of 5p each.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to  
one vote per share at meetings of the company. All voting rights 
are however suspended in respect of any of the company’s 
shares that are held in treasury or by group companies.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and  
are not redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative 
preference dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any 
associated tax credit) of the nominal value of such deferred 
ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or £4,000 in aggregate, 
for all such shares currently in issue. The company is required  
to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits. 
On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary 
shares carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up  
on such shares only after holders of the ordinary shares have 
received the sum of £100,000 in respect of each ordinary share. 
All of the deferred ordinary shares are held by Sterling 
Industries PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
At 31 March 2014, 55,411,017 ordinary shares and 8,000,000 
deferred ordinary shares were in issue. The ordinary shares 
therefore represented approximately 87%, and the deferred 
ordinary shares approximately 13%, of the total issued share 
capital by nominal value. Of the ordinary shares in issue at 
31 March 2014, 3,000 shares were held by a group company. 
As stated above, all voting rights are suspended on these shares.
During the year, the company purchased and cancelled 811,011 
ordinary shares at a total cost of £15.0m. The company’s issued 
share capital after these transactions, as at 27 May 2014, being 
the latest practicable date prior to signature of these accounts, 
was 55,411,017 ordinary shares and 8,000,000 deferred 
ordinary shares.
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of the 
company’s shares, although the articles of association contain 
provisions whereby the directors may refuse to register a 
transfer of a certificated share which is not fully paid, provided 
that such refusal does not prevent dealings in the share from 
taking place on an open and proper basis. The directors may  
also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless 
it is (a) lodged, duly stamped, at the registered office or at such 
other place as the directors may appoint, accompanied by the 
certificate for the shares to which it relates and such other 
evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show  
the right of the transferor to make the transfer; (b) in respect  
of only one class of shares; and (c) in favour of not more than  
four transferees.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of shares if  
a shareholder has not supplied information to the company  
in default of a request duly served under section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and such shares represent at least 0.25%  
of the class of shares concerned.
Other governance matters 56  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Appointment and removal of directors and the articles 
of association
The appointment and removal of directors is governed by the 
company’s articles of association and prevailing company law.
The articles of association provide that at every annual general 
meeting one-third of the directors, or if not a multiple of three, 
the number nearest to one-third, shall retire by rotation and 
therefore be required to seek re-election by shareholders. 
New directors may be appointed by the board, but are subject 
to election by shareholders at the next annual general meeting 
of the company following their appointment. However, to comply 
with the provisions of The UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the company requires that all directors should be subject to 
annual election by shareholders. Shareholders may also appoint 
new directors by ordinary resolution. The articles of association 
limit the number of directors to not less than two and not more 
than twelve, unless the shareholders resolve otherwise.
Customers and suppliers
The group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to settle the 
terms of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction. 
The group will abide by those terms on condition that it is 
satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or services 
in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The group 
does not follow any code or statement on payment practice.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report on pages 2 
to 5 and the Investment review on pages 10 to 21. The financial 
position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial review on 
pages 22 to 24. In addition, note 23 to the financial statements 
includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing capital, financial risk management objectives, details 
of financial instruments and hedging activities, and exposures  
to currency risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
The group has cash resources and committed bank facilities 
available to meet existing and new investment commitments.  
As a consequence, the directors believe that the group is well 
placed to manage business risks successfully.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Auditor
Resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting to 
re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditor of the company and to authorise 
the directors to agree the auditor’s remuneration. A description 
of how the Audit Committee ensures the objectivity and 
independence of the auditor is set out on page 38 within  
the Audit Committee report.
At the annual general meeting held on 24 July 2013, shareholders 
also granted authority for the company to make market 
purchases of up to 5,591,100 of its own ordinary shares, being 
approximately 10% of the ordinary share capital then in issue,  
at a price not more than the higher of (a) 5% greater than the 
average of the middle market quotations for such ordinary shares 
during the five business days preceding any such purchase;  
and (b) the higher of (i) the price of the last independent trade  
in such ordinary shares; and (ii) the highest current independent 
bid relating thereto on the trading venue where the purchase is 
carried out, nor at a price less than 5p, being the nominal value 
of an ordinary share. This authority lasts until 24 October 2014 
or, if earlier, the conclusion of the next annual general meeting. 
At the same time, shareholders who were not members of the 
Cayzer family concert party (‘Cayzer Concert Party’) gave their 
approval for a waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers  
of the obligation that could arise on the Cayzer Concert Party 
under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers to  
make a general offer for Caledonia on the implementation by  
the company of the above authority to purchase its own shares.  
The approval was subject to the maximum percentage of voting 
rights in which the Cayzer Concert Party is interested not 
exceeding 49.9% as a result of purchases by the company.  
This waiver expires on 24 October 2014 or, if earlier,  
the conclusion of the next annual general meeting.
Change of control rights
There are no special control rights in relation to the  
company’s shares.
Options granted under the company’s executive share option 
schemes and its performance share scheme and awards made 
under its deferred bonus plans may become exercisable or vest 
as a result of a change of control, although the number of shares 
comprised in those options or awards may be reduced. The 
service contracts of certain directors and associate directors 
also contain provisions whereby a liquidated sum is payable  
by the company in the event of termination within one year 
following a change of control. 
Further details of these change of control rights are set out  
in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Investment trust status
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has confirmed that 
Caledonia has investment trust status for all financial periods 
from 1 April 2012.

held at Cayzer House, 30 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6NN 
on Thursday, 17 July 2014 at 11.30 am. The notice of the annual 
general meeting and details of all of the resolutions to be  
put to shareholders are set out in a separate circular sent  
to shareholders at the same time as this annual report.

Directors’ report
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
have prepared the group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company  
and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRS as adopted by the European Union has 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the group and parent company financial 
statements respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company and the group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding  
the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to  
assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval 
of this report confirms that:
1.  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant information 
of which the company’s auditor is unaware; and
2.  the director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Responsibility statements under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 30 and 31 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
1.  the group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the group; and
2.  the Strategic report contained on pages 1 to 29 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Caledonia 
Investments plc for the year ended 31 March 2014 set out on 
pages 60 to 81. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 
2014 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU);
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements the risks of material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our audit were as follows:
Valuation of unlisted investments (£748.7m)
Refer to page 36 (Audit Committee Report), page 66  
(accounting policy) and pages 69 to 70 (financial disclosures)
The risk
49.3% of the company’s total assets (by value) is held in 
investments where no quoted market price is available. The 
unquoted investments are measured at fair value, which is 
established in accordance with International Private Equity  
and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines by using measurements 
of value such as price of recent orderly transactions, earnings 
multiples and net assets. There is a significant risk over the 
valuation of these investments and this is one of the key 
judgmental areas that our audit focused on.
Our response
Our procedures included, among others:
• enquiry with management to document and assess the design 
and implementation of the investment valuation processes 
and controls in place. We attended the biannual Challenge 
Committee meetings and quarterly Audit Committee meetings 
where we assessed the effectiveness of the Committees’ 
challenge and approval of unlisted investment valuations.
• assessment of investment realisations in the period, 
comparing actual sales proceeds to prior year end valuations 
to understand the reasons for significant variances and 
consideration of whether they are indicative of bias or error 
in the company’s approach to valuations.
• challenging the investment manager on key judgements 
affecting investee company valuations in the context of 
observed industry best practice and the provisions of the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
Guidelines. In particular, we focused on the appropriateness 
of the valuation basis selected as well as the underlying 
assumptions, such as discount factors, and the choice of 
benchmark for earnings multiples. We compared key 
underlying financial data inputs to external sources and 
investee company audited accounts and management 
information as applicable. We challenged the assumptions 
around sustainability of earnings based on the plans of the 
investee companies and whether these are achievable, and  
we obtained an understanding of existing and prospective 
investee company cash flows to understand whether 
borrowings can be serviced or refinancing may be required. 
Where a recent transaction is used to value any holding, we 
obtained an understanding of the circumstances surrounding 
the transactions and whether it was considered to be on an 
arms-length basis and suitable as an input into a valuation. 
Our work included consideration of events which occurred 
subsequent to the year end up until the date of this audit report.
• We compared the investment property valuations of the 
directors to valuations performed by the external valuer and 
evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the 
valuer. With the assistance of our own valuation specialist,  
we considered the appropriateness of the external and 
internal valuations and inherent assumptions by comparing 
the group’s assumptions to externally derived data.
• For the valuation of fund interests we reviewed the latest 
reported net asset values from the fund managers. Our 
procedures also included obtaining the audited financial 
statements of the funds and considering the historical 
accuracy of the net asset values.
Our procedures also included consideration of the 
appropriateness, in accordance with relevant accounting 
standards, of the disclosures in Note 23 in respect of unlisted 
investments and the effect of changing one or more inputs to 
reasonably possible alternative valuation assumptions.
Carrying value of quoted equity investments (£703.2m)
Refer to page 36 (Audit Committee Report), page 66  
(accounting policy) and pages 69 to 70 (financial disclosures)
The risk
The group’s portfolio of listed investments makes up 46.3% of 
the total assets of the group and is considered to be a key driver 
of operations and performance results. We do not consider  
these investments to be at high risk of significant misstatement, 
or to be subject to a significant level of judgment because they 
comprise liquid, quoted investments. However, due to their 
materiality in the context of the financial statements as a whole, 
they are considered to be one of the areas which had the greatest 
effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources  
in planning and completing our audit.
Our response
Our procedures over the existence and valuation of the group’s 
quoted equity investment portfolio included, but were not 
limited to:
• documenting and assessing the processes in place to record 
investment transactions and to value the portfolio;
• agreeing the valuation of investments to externally quoted 
prices; and
• agreeing investment holdings to independently received  
third party confirmations.
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Caledonia Investments plc Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  59
Financial statements
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or
• a Corporate governance statement has not been prepared  
by the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 56, in relation  
to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate governance statement on pages 32  
to 34 relating to the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities 
statement set out on page 57, the directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description  
of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided  
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the 
company’s members as a body and is subject to important 
explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, 
published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/
auditscopeukco2013a, which are incorporated into this  
report as if set out in full and should be read to provide  
an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work  
we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope  
of our audit
The materiality of the financial statements as a whole was set at 
£22.7m comprising 1.5% of total assets. This has been calculated 
with reference to a benchmark of total assets. Total assets, 
which is primarily composed of the company’s investment 
portfolio, is considered the key driver of the company’s capital 
and revenue performance and, as such, we believe that it is one 
of the principal considerations for members of the company in 
assessing its financial performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all corrected 
and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our  
audit with a value in excess of £1.1m in addition to other audit 
misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Our audit of the company was undertaken to the materiality 
level specified above and was performed at the Caledonia 
Investments plc office in London.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006;
• the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the  
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements;
• information given in the Corporate governance statement set 
out on pages 32 to 34 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting 
processes and about share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements.
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which 
we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains 
a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the 
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that 
is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
• the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 60  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc

Statement of cash flows
for the year ended 31 March 2014
The accounting policies and notes to the financial statements on pages 64 to 81 are an integral part of these financial statements. 64  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
General information
Caledonia Investments plc is an investment trust company 
domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated in England  
in 1928, under the Companies Acts 1908 to 1917. The address  
of its registered office is Cayzer House, 30 Buckingham Gate, 
London SW1E 6NN. The ordinary shares of the company are 
premium listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the 
directors on 28 May 2014.
These financial statements are presented in pound sterling,  
as this is the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which Caledonia operates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Fair values of financial instruments
Many of the group’s financial instruments are measured at  
fair value in the statement of financial position and it is usually 
possible to determine their fair values within a reasonable  
range of estimates.
For the majority of the group’s financial instruments, quoted 
market prices are readily available. However, certain financial 
instruments, such as unlisted securities, are fair valued using 
valuation techniques, including reference to the current fair 
values of instruments that are substantially the same (subject  
to appropriate adjustments).
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time,  
based on market conditions and information about the financial 
instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve 
uncertainties and matters of significant judgement (e.g. interest 
rates, volatility, estimated cash flows) and therefore cannot be 
determined with precision.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’)  
as adopted for use in the EU and therefore the group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.  
IFRSs comprise accounting standards issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board and its predecessor 
body as well as interpretations issued by the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee and its 
predecessor body.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments and properties. Where presentational guidance  
set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial 
Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital 
Trusts (‘SORP’) issued by the Association of Investment 
Companies in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements 
of IFRSs as adopted by the EU, the directors have sought to 
prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the 
recommendations of the SORP. 
The statement of comprehensive income of the company has 
been omitted from these financial statements in accordance 
with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Under The UK Corporate Governance Code and applicable 
regulations, the directors are required to satisfy themselves that 
it is reasonable to presume that the company is a going concern. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the company 
and the group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future, as discussed  
on page 56. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of preparing the financial statements.
Adopted IFRSs
In the current year, the group has adopted the following 
standards and amendments:
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
• IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities 
• IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements
• IAS 19 Employee Benefits (revised 2011)
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
• IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
• IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
IFRS 10 provides that an investment entity shall not consolidate 
its subsidiaries or apply IFRS 3 when it obtains control of 
another entity. Instead IFRS 10 requires that an investment 
entity shall measure an investment in a subsidiary at fair value 
through profit or loss. Subsidiaries that provide investment 
related services or activities either to the entity or a third party 
remain consolidated.
In addition, IFRS 10 redefines the term ‘control’ for the purpose 
of identifying if an investor controls an investee. If one entity 
controls another entity, the parent company shall include the 
subsidiary in full in its consolidated financial statements. Under 
the new definition, control is established if the potential parent 
entity has power over the potential subsidiary (investee) as a 
result of voting rights or other rights and actual circumstances, 
is exposed or has rights to positive or negative variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee, and above all has the 
ability to use its power over the investee to affect significantly 
the amount of its returns.
IFRS 12 sets out the disclosure requirements for interests  
in other entities. This standard requires a much wider range  
of disclosures than previously required by the rules set out  
in IAS 27, IAS 28 and IAS 31.
IFRS 13 sets out in a single IFRS a unified framework for 
measuring fair value in financial statements prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
and enhances quantitative disclosures.
IAS 19R relates to accounting for defined benefit pension 
obligations and requires a net interest amount to be calculated 
by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability 
or assets, in place of the interest cost on scheme liabilities and 
the expected return on scheme assets. There was no overall 
change in the net assets of the group.
IFRS 10 and 12 and IAS 19R were applied retrospectively and  
the prior period impact of adopting these new standards and 
amendments is shown in note 28. 
IFRS 13 is applied prospectively and the remaining standards 
have no significant impact on the net assets, financial position  
or reported results of the group.

Financial statements
IFRSs not yet applied
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the 
following standard, which has not been applied in these  
financial statements, was in issue but not yet effective.
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The directors anticipate that the adoption of this standard  
in future periods will have no material impact on the  
financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of the company and service entities controlled by  
the company made up to the reporting date. Control is achieved 
where the company has the power over the potential investee  
as a result of voting rights or other rights, has rights to positive 
or negative variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee  
to affect significantly the amount of its returns.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting 
date are translated to the functional currency at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated to the functional currency using 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
stated at fair value are translated to the functional currency  
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values  
were determined.
In the financial statements, foreign exchange gains or losses are 
recognised in capital or revenue reserve depending on whether 
the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
Income
Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue 
when the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been 
established, normally the ex-dividend date. Where no ex-dividend 
date is available, dividends receivable on or before the period end 
are treated as revenue for the period. Provision is made for any 
dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities, loans and non-equity 
shares are recognised on an effective interest rate basis, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s  
net carrying amount.
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
The company’s share of net income from limited partnerships  
is recognised as revenue when received.
Where uncertainty arises over the collectability of an amount 
already included in income, the uncollectible amount or the 
amount in respect of which the recovery has ceased to be 
probable, is recognised as an expense. When the uncertainty 
over collectability is removed, normally on receipt, the income  
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis. In the 
financial statements, management expenses and performance 
fees are included in revenue reserves. Expenses of acquisition  
of an investment designated as held at fair value through profit 
or loss or expenses of an aborted acquisition or disposal of an 
investment are presented as transaction costs or deducted  
from the proceeds of sale as appropriate and included in  
capital reserves. 
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income  
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an 
expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting date. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in 
which they occur. They are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that 
the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on  
a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits 
become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the statement  
of financial position represents the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service  
cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset 
resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, 
plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in 
future contributions to the plan.
Profit sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and 
profit sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration 
the profit attributable to the company’s shareholders after 
certain adjustments. The group recognises a provision where 
contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has 
created a constructive obligation. 66  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc  
Significant accounting policies continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted to the extent that it is probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of 
the assets to be recovered.
Dividend distribution
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are 
appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the 
entity. For interim dividends, this will normally mean the date 
on which they are paid and, for final dividends, the date on which 
they are approved in general meeting.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date 
where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially 
measured at cost, excluding transaction costs.
Investments held as part of the group’s business of investing  
in financial assets are designated as measured at fair value 
through profit or loss in both the consolidated financial 
statements and the company financial statements.
Investments designated as held at fair value through profit  
or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair  
value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the value of 
investments designated as held at fair value through profit or 
loss, including foreign exchange movements, are included in net 
profit or loss for the period as a capital return.
Listed investments are valued at bid price or the last traded 
price when a bid price is not available. Unlisted investments  
are valued using recognised valuation methodologies, based on 
the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
Guidelines, which reflect the amount for which an asset could be 
exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arm’s 
length basis. The portfolio valuation methodology is detailed  
on page 82.
Distributions from investment limited partnerships are treated 
as disposal proceeds or income in accordance with the nature of 
the distribution. Any surplus capital distributions after repaying 
partner’s capital are treated as realised gains.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is 
entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Hedge accounting is not applied. Changes in the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income as they arise.
Capital reserve
The company maintains a capital reserve. The following items 
are transferred into the capital reserve from profit or loss:
• gains and losses on investments held at fair value through 
profit or loss
• gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge the fair value  
of investments
• expenses and finance costs incurred directly in relation  
to capital transactions
• taxation on items recognised in the capital reserve.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant and the fair value is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the group’s estimate of the number of shares that will 
eventually vest.
Where employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to the  
equity instruments of its parent as consideration for the services 
provided to the subsidiary, the subsidiary recognises an equity- 
settled share-based payment transaction expense with a 
corresponding increase recognised in equity representing 
a contribution from the parent.
An employee share trust is used for distributing option and 
performance share and deferred bonus awards to employees 
under Caledonia’s share remuneration schemes. The trustee 
purchases shares with money lent interest free by Caledonia  
and transfers shares to participating employees on receipt  
of the requisite consideration or calling of awards.
The transactions the employee share trust undertakes are 
considered to be performed by the trust as an agent for 
Caledonia. The transactions of the employee share trust are 
included in the separate financial statements of the parent 
company and, following the requirements of IFRS 10, in the 
consolidated financial statements as if they arose in that 
company. Own shares held by the employee share trust as at the 
reporting date are accounted for as if they were treasury shares.
National Insurance on share option scheme gains and performance 
share and deferred bonus awards
National Insurance payable on the exercise of certain employee 
share options and performance share awards at the date of 
exercise and deferred bonus awards at the date of call have  
been charged as an expense spread over the respective vesting 
periods. The charge is based on the difference between the 
market value of the underlying shares at the reporting date  
and the exercise price for share options or £nil for performance 
share awards and deferred bonus awards and calculated  
at the latest enacted National Insurance rate.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable  
and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items  
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable  
or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that were applicable at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable  
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted 
for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Investment trust companies that 
have approval as such under section 1159 of the Corporation  
Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  67
Financial statements
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at  
the fair value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement  
or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accrual basis in the statement of comprehensive income using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled 
in the period in which they arise. The effective interest method 
allocates the interest expense over the life of the instrument  
so as to reflect a constant return on the carrying amount of  
the liability.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position 
when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow  
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date 
and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
In the financial statements, provisions recognised for investments 
are included in the statement of comprehensive income as a 
capital return.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded as  
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust 
purchases the company’s equity share capital, the consideration 
paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net 
of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the 
company’s owners until the shares are transferred. Where such 
shares are subsequently transferred, any consideration received, 
net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs 
and the related income tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the company’s owners.
Operating segments
Operating segments are based on the financial information 
reported to the chief operating decision maker.
Property, plant and equipment
Property is held at fair value. Gains arising from changes  
in the fair value of property are included in other  
comprehensive income for the period in which they arise.  
To the extent gains represent reversal of cumulative losses 
previously recognised they are included in profit or loss.
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets,  
other than land or properties under construction, over their 
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the 
following bases:
Plant  10-15 years 
Equipment 3-8 years
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset  
is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds  
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised  
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts  
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised  
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount, if any. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Receivables
Receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits. Cash 
equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that  
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that  
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 68  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc

ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or £4,000 in aggregate, 
for all such shares currently in issue. The company is required  
to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits.

on investments.
20. Related parties
Identity of related parties
The group and company had a related party relationship with  
its subsidiaries (note 26) and associates (note 27) and with its 
key management personnel, being its directors.
Transactions with key management personnel
Certain directors of the company and their immediate relatives 
had significant influence in The Cayzer Trust Company Ltd, 
which held 35.4% of the voting shares of the company as at 
31 March 2014 (2013 – 34.9%).
In addition to their salaries, the group provided non-cash and 
post-employment benefits to directors and executive officers. 
Details of directors’ pension benefits are set out on page 50 
in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Notes to the financial statements continued
On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary 
shares carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up  
on such shares only after holders of the ordinary shares have 
received the sum of £100,000 in respect of each such ordinary 
share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are held by Sterling 
Industries PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
18. Net asset value per share
The group’s undiluted net asset value per share is based on the 
net assets of the group at the year end and on the number of 
shares in issue at the year end less shares held by the Caledonia 
Investments plc Employee Share Trust. The group’s diluted net 
asset value per share assumes the exercise of all outstanding 
in-the-money share options and the calling of performance share 
and deferred bonus awards.

19. Operating segments
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the 
Executive Committee, which reviews the company’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. 
Management has determined the operating segments based  
on these reports.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on a measure 
of group total revenue, principally comprising gains and losses 
on investments and derivatives hedging those investments and 
investment income. Reportable profit or loss is after ‘Treasury 
income’ and ‘Other items’, which comprise management and 
other expenses and provisions. Reportable assets equate to the 
groups’s net asset value. Cash and cash equivalents and other 
items are not identifiable operating segments.
‘Other investments’ comprise subsidiaries not managed as part 
of the investment portfolio. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  73

the Cayzer family and its heritage in shipping. The sale price  
was based on valuations by three independent valuers and the 
items sold represented only part of a larger collection of 
artefacts (not all relating to shipping) originally acquired from 
British & Commonwealth Holdings plc, which had been valued at 
some £0.5m. The Cayzer Family Archive has granted a licence to 
the group to continue to display the items sold at its premises at  
no cost other than maintenance and insurance obligations.
21. Capital commitments
At the reporting date, the group and company had entered  
into unconditional commitments to limited partnerships, 
commitments to other investment funds and loan facilities 
to portfolio companies, as follows:

Scheme, the Sterling Industries Pension Scheme and the Amber 
Industrial Holdings PLC Pension & Life Assurance Scheme 
respectively in respect of the liabilities of the participating 
employers of those schemes.
At 31 March 2014, there was a litigation claim outstanding  
for which any settlement liability is considered remote.
23. Financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise securities and other 
investments, cash balances, borrowings and receivables  
and payables that arise from operations. The investment 
portfolio includes listed and unlisted equity investments,  
debt instruments and investments in funds that are intended  
to be held for the long term.
Risk analysis
The main types of financial risk to which the group is exposed 
are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding 
at the reporting date and the risk management policies 
employed are discussed below.
Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and 
includes price risk, currency risk and fair value interest rate risk.
The strategy for managing market risk is driven by the 
investment objective, which is to outperform the FTSE All-Share 
Total Return index over rolling ten year periods. Investments are 
made in a range of instruments, including listed and unlisted 
equities, debt and non-equity investment funds, in a range of 
sectors and regions.
Details of the investment portfolio at the reporting date are 
shown on pages 10 to 21.

The exposure to foreign currency has decreased during the year 
due to the reduction in foreign denominated other receivables.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate movements may affect the fair value of investments 
in fixed interest securities and the level of income receivable 
from fixed income securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
The company and group held fixed rate, interest-bearing 
financial assets, with maturity of up to five years, cash at bank 
and term deposits, with the term to maturity of up to three 
months, and floating rate, interest-bearing financial assets.  
The group also had floating rate, interest-bearing borrowings.
The exposure to interest rate risk on financial assets and 
liabilities was as follows:

Interest-bearing loans and

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the 
exposure to interest rates at the reporting date from a 50 basis 
point change taking place at the beginning of the financial year 
and held constant throughout the year. This level of change is 
considered to be reasonable, based on observation of market 
conditions and historic trends. 
Price risk
Price risk may affect the value of listed and unlisted investments 
as a result of changes in market prices (other than arising from 
interest rate risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors 
specific to an individual investment, its issuer or factors 
affecting all instruments traded in the market.
As the majority of financial instruments are carried at fair  
value, with fair value changes recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income, all changes in market conditions  
will directly affect reported portfolio returns.
Price risk is managed by constructing a diversified portfolio  
of instruments traded on various markets and hedging  
where appropriate.
The exposures of listed and unlisted equity investments,  
equity linked bonds and funds were as follows:

The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% variation  
in equity prices. The sensitivity analysis includes all equity and 
fund investments held at fair value through profit or loss and 
adjusts their valuation at the year end for a 10% change in value.

Decrease in prices (138.0) (113.2) (139.5) (114.7)
The sensitivity to equity and fund investments has increased 
during the year due to investment portfolio gains and net 
investment in the year.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is 
unrepresentative of the inherent price risk as the year end 
exposure does not reflect the exposure throughout the year  
as a whole.
Currency risk
Investments in financial instruments and other transactions 
may be denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency. Consequently, there is exposure to the risk that the 
exchange rate of the functional currency may change relative  
to other currencies in a manner that has an adverse effect on  
the value of that portion of assets and liabilities denominated  
in currencies other than the functional currency.
The company’s non-functional currency denominated 
investments and gains/losses thereon are reviewed regularly by 
the directors and the currency risk is managed by the directors 
within the overall asset allocation strategies and risk. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  75
Financial statements
payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the 
immediate or short term nature of these financial instruments.
The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating  
the fair value of investments are disclosed on page 82.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises as a result of the possibility that the group 
and company may not be able to meet its obligations as they 
fall due.
The corporate treasury function provides services to the 
company and group, coordinating access to domestic financial

access local financial markets when this is more favourable,

Capital management policies and procedures
The group’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure that the group and company will be able to continue 
as a going concern
• to maximise the income and capital return to the company’s 
shareholders, principally through the use of equity capital, 
although the group will maintain appropriate borrowing 
facilities, to be used for short term working capital or bridging 
finance, currently £175m (restated 2013 – £125m).
The group’s total capital at 31 March 2014 was £1,445.6m  
(restated 2013 – £1,302.4m) and comprised equity share capital 
and reserves. The group was 2.8% geared at the year end (restated 
2013 – 1.5%).
The board monitors and reviews the broad structure  
of the group’s and company’s capital on an ongoing basis.  
This review includes:
• the planned level of gearing, which takes into account planned 
investment activity
• the possible buy-back of equity shares for cancellation, which 
takes account of the discount of the share price to net asset 
value per share
• the annual dividend policy.
The group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
capital are unchanged from the preceding year.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial 
instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment. 
A credit policy is in place and exposure to credit risk is 
regularly monitored.
At 31 March 2014, the financial assets exposed to credit risk 
were as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents 32.9 93.8 35.5 96.5 
112.0 199.6 82.3 167.7 
Prior to making investments in debt instruments, management 
has in place a process of review that includes an evaluation  
of a potential investee company’s ability to service and repay  
its debt. Management reviews the financial position of investee 
companies, including their continuing ability to service and 
repay debt, on a regular basis.
The exposure to credit risk on operating and other receivables  
is mitigated by performing credit evaluations on investee 
companies as part of the due diligence process.
Credit risk arising on money market funds and cash and cash 
equivalents is mitigated by spreading investments and deposits 
across a number of approved counterparties in accordance with 
board policy. These are either investment grade banks with a 
credit rating of ‘AA3’ or ‘AA-‘ or higher, as determined by the 
rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch, or banks specifically approved 
by the board. These credit ratings are reviewed regularly.
All transactions in listed securities are settled on contract  
terms using approved brokers. The risk of default is considered 
minimal, as delivery of securities sold is only made once the 
broker has received payment. Payment is made on a purchase 
once the securities have been received by the broker. The trade 
will fail if either party fails to meet their obligations. Listed 
security trades are settled through HSBC Global Custody.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk  
to counterparties at 31 March 2014 (2013 – £nil).
Fair value
Most of the financial instruments are carried at fair value  
in the statement of financial position. Usually, the fair value  
of the financial instruments can be reliably determined within  
a reasonable range of estimates. For certain other financial 
instruments, specifically operating and other receivables and  76  Annual report 2014 Caledonia Investments plc

An entity is not required to create quantitative information  
to comply with this disclosure requirement if quantitative

24. Share-based payments
The company has an executive share option scheme, which 
entitles senior employees to purchase shares in the company at 
the market price of the shares at the date of grant and on similar 
terms, subject to service and company performance criteria. 
Under the terms of the scheme, options may be exercised 
between three and ten years after the date of grant, although 
only one-third of the options may be exercised after three years 
from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable 
six years after grant. A number of grants have been made under 
this scheme.
At the 2011 annual general meeting, shareholders approved  
a new performance share scheme to replace the existing share 
option scheme as the means of delivering long term incentive 
awards to senior executives. The performance share scheme 
entitles senior executives to receive options over the company’s 
shares which are exercisable at nil-cost, subject to service and 
performance conditions. The nil-cost option awards granted in 
2011 and 2012 may be exercised between three and ten years 
after the date of grant, although only two-thirds of the awards 
may be exercised after three years, with the remaining one-third 
becoming exercisable five years after grant. The Remuneration 
Committee approved an amendment to the performance  
share scheme whereby some of the shares comprised in the 2013 
awards may be exercised after three years, and the remainder 
five years, after grant.
The company also has two deferred bonus plans, a 2005 plan  
and a 2011 plan, under which senior employees compulsorily 
defer part of their annual bonus, being any bonus in excess of 
50% of their basic salary for the bonus year, into shares and may 
voluntarily defer up to 50% of their remaining cash bonus into 
shares. The company will match the number of shares comprised 
in both compulsory and voluntary deferral, subject to service 
and company performance criteria.
The parent company is subject to the following externally 
imposed capital requirements:
• as a public limited company, the company is required to have  
a minimum issued share capital of £50,000
• to maintain its approval as an investment trust company,  
the company is required to comply with the provisions of 
section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 as amended  
by the Investment Trust (Approved Company) (Tax) 
Regulations 2011.
The parent company has complied with these requirements, 
which are unchanged since the previous year end.
Fair value hierarchy
The group’s valuation methodology is disclosed on page 82. The 
table below analyses financial instruments held at fair value 
according to the subjectivity of the valuation method, using the 
following hierarchy:
Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets.
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within  
Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3  Inputs for the asset that are not based on observable 
market data.

Level 3 709.3 494.7 693.3 476.6 
1,451.9 1,229.9 1,435.9 1,204.8 
In the prior year, investments with a value of £4.0m were 
transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 as a result of there no longer 
being any observable market data.
The directors have used several valuation methodologies  
as prescribed in the valuation guidelines to arrive at their  
best estimate of fair value, including discounted cash flow 
calculations, revenue and earnings multiples and recent  
market transactions where available.
The multiples applied in valuing our unquoted investments are 
derived from comparable companies sourced from market data. 
A key metric in our internal valuation of unquoted investments 
included within Level 3 is the EBITDA multiple. An increase of 
10% in the earnings multiple applied to our internally valued 
unquoted investments at 31 March 2014, would increase the 
valuation by £10.9m to £131.2m.
Private equity fund investments, included under Level 3,  
are valued in accordance with the valuation guidelines and  
are based on information provided by the general partner.  
The general partner’s policy in valuing unlisted investments  
is to carry them at fair value. Similarly, externally managed 
unquoted investment valuations are based on information 
provided by the manager. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2014  77

The options outstanding at 31 March 2014 have an exercise

contractual life of ten years.
The fair value of services received in return for performance 
share scheme and deferred awards granted was measured 
indirectly, by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
Under the schemes, share options were granted with service and 
non-market performance conditions. Such conditions were not 
taken into account in the fair value measurement of the services 
received at the dates of grant. There were no market conditions 
associated with the share option grants.
The fair value of services received in return for deferred share 
awards was measured directly, by reference to the fair value  
of services received during the period. This was based on the 
amount of annual bonus that was compulsorily and voluntarily 
deferred in accordance with the rules of the company’s deferred 
bonus plan.

In the UK, the funding is set on the basis of a triennial funding 
valuation by the actuaries for which the assumptions may differ 
from those above. As a result of these valuations, the group  
and the scheme trustees agree a Schedule of Contributions, 
which sets out the required contributions from the employer  
and employees for current service. Where the scheme is in 
deficit, the Schedule of Contributions also includes required 
contributions from the employer to eliminate the deficit.

As described in the accounting policies, the group has adopted 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosures  
of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 
2011) in the current year, which have retrospective application. 
Caledonia Investments plc qualifies as an investment entity, being 
an investment trust with a business purpose of providing its 
investors with a total return comprising both capital appreciation 
and investment income. In seeking to meet a long term total 
return objective, it also measures and evaluates the performance 
of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
As the retrospective application of IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 19R 
had an impact on virtually all the items in the group statement of 
financial position and in the group statement of profit or loss, the 
prior year figures disclosed have been adjusted throughout the 
annual report. On adoption of IFRS 10, the fair value at 1 April 
2012 of the subsidiaries ceasing to be consolidated was £103.7m. 
Included within the subsidiaries’ fair value at 31 March 2012 of 
£117.2m was the sum of £13.5m related to service companies, 
which remain consolidated under IFRS 10.

Sensitivities
The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive 
to the assumptions set out on page 78. The following table 
summarises the estimated increase in defined benefit obligation 
of a change in an assumption at 31 March 2014, while holding  
all other assumptions constant. This sensitivity analysis may  
not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit 
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would 
occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions  
may be correlated.

Investments are measured at the directors’ estimate of fair  
value at the reporting date, in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair 
Value Measurement. Fair value is the amount for which an asset 
could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in 
an arm’s length transaction.
Publicly traded securities
Investments listed in an active market are valued at their bid 
price on the reporting date. When a bid price is unavailable,  
the price of the most recent transaction will normally be used.
Unlisted companies
Unlisted company investments are valued by applying an 
appropriate valuation technique, which makes maximum use of 
market-based information, is consistent with models generally 
used by market participants and is applied consistently from 
period to period, except where a change would result in a better 
estimation of fair value.
The value of an unlisted company investment is generally 
crystallised through the sale or flotation of the entire business, 
rather than the sale of an individual instrument. Therefore,  
the estimation of fair value is based on the assumed realisation 
of the underlying business at the reporting date, based on the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
Guidelines (December 2012). Recognition is given to the 
uncertainties inherent in estimating the fair value of unlisted 
companies and appropriate caution is applied in exercising 
judgments and making the necessary estimates.
Enterprise value is normally determined using one of the 
following valuation methodologies:
Price of recent investment
Where the investment being valued was recently acquired  
or a recent transaction has taken place, its cost or transaction 
price will generally provide a good indication of fair value.  
This methodology is likely to be appropriate only for a limited 
period after the date of the relevant transaction.
Multiples
This methodology involves the application of an earnings 
multiple to the maintainable earnings of the business and is 
likely to be appropriate for an investment in an established 
business with an identifiable stream of continuing earnings.
The earnings multiple used is determined by reference to 
market-based multiples appropriate for the business and 
correlating to the period and calculation of earnings of the 
company being valued. The aim is to identify comparator 
companies that are similar in terms of risk and growth 
prospects to the company being valued. Earnings multiples  
are adjusted for points of difference between the comparator 
and the company being valued where appropriate, including  
the ability of Caledonia to effect change in the company  
and risks associated with holding an unlisted share.
Maintainable earnings balance reliability and relevance. 
Generally, the latest historical accounts are used unless reliable 
forecast results for the current year are available. Earnings are 
adjusted where appropriate for exceptional or non-recurring 
items and an average of more than one year’s earnings may  
be used to estimate maintainable earnings for cyclical or  
volatile businesses.
Net assets
The net assets methodology is likely to be appropriate for a 
business whose value derives mainly from the underlying value 
of its assets rather than its earnings, such as a property holding 
company or an investment business. It may also be appropriate 
for a business that is not making an adequate return on assets 
and for which a greater value can be realised by liquidating the 
business and selling its assets. A third party valuation may be 
used to give the fair value of a certain asset or group of assets.
Fund interests
Fund interests refer to participations in arrangements to create 
a designated pool of capital to invest in a wider range of assets 
than is feasible for an individual investor and to share the costs 
and benefits.
Open-ended funds, including investment companies with 
variable capital, typically report regular net asset values,  
which usually provide a reliable basis to estimate fair value.  
If the price reported by the fund is not available at the reporting 
date, the latest available price is used and may be adjusted to 
take account of changes or events to the reporting date.
Closed-ended funds include unlisted investment companies  
and limited partnerships. For these investments, the fair value 
estimate is based on a summation of the estimated fair value  
of the underlying investments. Fund manager valuation reports 
may be used where there is evidence that the valuation is 
derived using fair value principles and may be adjusted to take 
account of changes or events to the reporting date. Adjustment 
may also be necessary for features of the fund agreement not 
captured in the valuation report, such as performance fees or 
carried interest.
Other investments
Other investments include preference shares, loan notes or 
facilities, options, warrants and treasury instruments that are 
not publicly traded and do not form part of an investment in an 
unlisted company. For such investments, appropriate valuation 
techniques are adopted and used consistently.
